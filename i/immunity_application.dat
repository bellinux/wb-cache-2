40|$|Hereditary {{diseases}} {{are a major}} challenge for human medicine. The aim of somatic gene therapy is to repair a defective or improperly regulated gene by insertion of an intact gene sequence. Besides the application of gene therapy methods for treatment of monogenic diseases, somatic gene therapy will also be introduced {{for the treatment of}} cancer and chronic viral infections. Different methods have been developed for the transmission of the transgene in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro. The methods offer different advantages and disadvantages in terms of packaging capacity, <b>immunity,</b> <b>application</b> method and security. One promising possibility of gene therapy is the use of virus-like particles (VLPs). A possible starting point for the development of VLPs for gene therapy, the major capsid is VP 1 of Hamsterpolyomavirus (HaPyV), which assembles to VLP after heterologous expression in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One target of this work was the establishment of methods for encapsidation of DNA into foreign plasmid HaPyV-derived VLPs and to demonstrate the successful packaging of DNA. For this purpose, an already established system for synthesis and purification of yeast-expressed VP 1 -VLP-HaPyV used which contain the viral capsid protein VP 1. The method developed here for the packaging of DNA foreign plasmid is the dissociation of the VLP, adding the plasmid DNA and reassociation of the VLP. For the detection of VLP reassembly and the associated packaging of plasmid DNA, various methods were examined. The association of VLPs with nucleic acid can be detected with the help of gel electrophoresis easily. An additional DNase treatment and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed the protection of the packaged plasmid compared to the DNase action, {{so that it can be}} assumed that the encapsidation of the plasmid in reassembled VLP was successful. The detection of a reassembly of VLPs could be produced by electron microscopy. In contrast, a haemagglutionation test is not suitable for the differentiation of dissociated and reassembled VLPs. A second focus of the work was in the immunological characterization of the VLP of different polyomaviruses, in order to assess possible negative effects of a pre-existing polyomavirus-specific immunity. Of crucial importance for the use of VLP-derived HaPyV for human gene therapy is the possible cross-reactivity of HaPyV-VP 1 and the human polyomaviruses and especially because of the high seroprevalence of the population with human pathogenic polyomaviruses (BK polyomavirus 90 % and JC polyomavirus 70 %). Because of the large sequence similarity of the VP 1 proteins of different polyomaviruses a strong cross-reactivity must be assumed. In all tested, spontaneously-infected Syrian hamsters HaPyV demonstrated the formation of VP 1 -specific antibodies. In addition, almost all infected hamsters also showed evidence of antibodies directed against the capsid proteins of two other HaPyV, VP 2 and VP 3. The studies used for this E. coli-expressed dehydrofolate (DHFR) -capsid protein fusions are suitable for the detection of VP 1, VP 2 and VP 3 -specific antibodies. The detection of VP 2 /VP 3 -specific antibodies in almost all infected animals may be the basis for the development of DIVA (Differentiating Infected and Vaccinated Animals Of) - based diagnostics and vaccines represent process, in which VP 1 -derived VLPs used as a vaccine. The exclusive detection of anti-VP 1 antibodies, it would be either the result of a VP 1 -VLP vaccination, while there would be additional proof of the VP 2 and VP 3 -specific antibodies to a polyomavirus infection. To examine the cross-reactivity of yeast-expressed VP 1 proteins of the human pathogenic polyomaviruses and HaPyV BKPyV and JCPyV, Western Blot analysis and ELISA studies using monospecific rabbit and hamster-infected sera spontaneously HaPyV were performed. The results showed, as expected, for all investigated polyomaviruses sometimes weak cross-reactivity. The observed cross-reactivity between VLPs of different polyomaviruses could be problematic while multiple application of HaPyV-derived VLPs in gene therapy, a problem that could possibly be solved, however, by genetic modification immunodominant epitopes in the VP 1 -HaPyV or through the use of VLPs of different polyomaviruses...|$|E

However, it is unclear if SOX 2 -specific antibodies also develop in established multiple myeloma (MM). Screening 1094 peripheral blood (PB) sera from 196 MM patients and 100 PB sera from healthy donors, we detected SOX 2 -specific autoantibodies in 7. 7 % and 2. 0 % of patients and donors, respectively. We identified SOX 2211 – 230 as an immunodominant antibody-epitope within the full protein sequence. SOX 2 antigen was expressed in most healthy tissues and its expression did not correlate with the number of BM-resident plasma cells. Accordingly, anti-SOX 2 immunity was not related to SOX 2 expression levels or tumor burden in the patients' BM.

Detailed papers on fish vaccination were published from 1970 onwards. Another important development was the unraveling of neuro-endocrine-immune interactions in the 1970 s until today. Around 1980, it became more and more clear how important immunomodulation (stimulation or suppression by environmental factors, food components, drugs) was for fish health.

40|$|Pattern {{recognition}} receptors (PRRs) play {{a crucial}} role in the innate immune system and contribute to host defense against microbial infection. PRR-mediated antimicrobial signals provide robust type-I IFN/cytokine production and trigger inflammation, thereby affecting tumor progression and autoimmune diseases. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that among the PRRs, only the signaling pathway of endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR 3) induces no systemic inflammation and mediates cross-priming of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells by dendritic cells. Treatment with a newly developed TLR 3 -specific ligand, ARNAX, along with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), induces tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, modulates the tumor microenvironment to establish Th 1 -type antitumor immunity, and leads to tumor regression without inflammation in mouse tumor models. Combination therapy using ARNAX/TAA and PD- 1 /PD-L 1 blockade potently enhances antitumor response and overcomes anti-PD- 1 /PD-L 1 resistance.

T umor A n tigens Identification The immune system can respond to cancer cells in two ways: by reacting against tumor-specific antigens (molecules that are unique to cancer cells) or against tu-mor-associated antigens (molecules that are expressed differently by cancer cells and normal cells). 1 Immunity to carcinogen-induced tumors in mice is directed against the products of unique mutations of normal cellular genes. These mutant proteins are tumor-specific antigens. 2 Tumors caused by viruses display viral anti-gens that serve as tumor antigens. Examples are the products of the E 6 and E 7 genes of the human papillomavirus, the causative agent of cervical carcinoma, 3 and EBNA- 1, the Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen expressed by Burkitt’s lym-phoma and nasopharyngeal-carcinoma cells. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectromagnetic {{reverberation}} chambers (RC) are nowadays {{commonly used}} for electromagnetic <b>immunity</b> testing <b>applications.</b> Thanks {{to the presence}} of a mechanical stirrer (generally a rotating metallic object), electronic devices under test are submitted to an isotropic, statistically uniform and depolarised electromagnetic field. The latter features of the field can be obtain as long as the frequency is above the so-called lowest useable frequency (LUF). We can note that the statistical requirements of a well-stirred RC above the LUF closely correspond to the natural behaviour of a chaotic cavity, of course without the help of any stirring process. We propose to use the universal properties of chaotic cavities to reduce the LUF. We present a numerical investigation of three-dimensional electromagnetic chaotic (Sinai- like) cavities. We computed around 600 eigenmodes for two different geometries: a parallelepipedic cavity with one half-sphere on one wall and a parallelepipedic cavity with one half-sphere and two spherical caps on three adjacent walls. In these cavities we show that the statistical requirements of a well operating reverberation chamber are better satisfied in the more complex geometry due to its spatial and spectral statistical behaviours very close to those predicted by random matrix theory. More specifically, we show that in the range of frequency corresponding to the first few hundred modes, the suppression of non-generic modes can be achieved by reducing drastically the amount of parallel walls. Finally, we model and compare the influence of losses on the statistical complex response of the field inside a parallelepipedic and a chaotic cavity...|$|R

In vitro studies have also demonstrated that LAMP/Gag was highly expressed and was present in MHCII containing compartments in transfected cells. In this study, the mechanisms involved in these processes and the relative contributions of the increased expression and altered traffic for the enhanced immune response were addressed. Cells transfected with plasmid DNA constructs containing p 55 gag attached to truncated sequences of LAMP- 1 showed that the increased expression of gag mRNA required p 55 gag in frame with at least 741 bp of the LAMP- 1 luminal domain. LAMP luminal domain also showed to be essential for Gag traffic through lysosomes and, in this case, the whole sequence was required. Further analysis of the trafficking pathway of the intact LAMP/Gag chimera demonstrated that it was secreted, at least in part, associated with exosome-like vesicles. Immunization of mice with LAMP/gag chimeric plasmids demonstrated that high expression level alone can induce a substantial transient antibody response, but targeting of the antigen to the endolysosomal/secretory pathways was required for establishment of cellular and memory response. The intact LAMP/gag construct induced polyfunctional CD 4 + T cell response, which presence at the time of immunization was required for CD 8 + T cell priming.

40|$|Tγδ and B 1 {{lymphocytes}} {{are essential}} {{components of the}} mucosal immune system, activating different bacterial and viral ligands without costimulatory signals and preprocessing of other immune effectors. This ability enables the immune system to provide rapid protection against pathogens and contributes to the decoding mechanism of the sensitizing activity of mucosal antigens, because the interaction of these cells produces antibodies for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgA, but not for IgE. We studied 3 routes of introducing antigens for opportunistic microorganisms to activate Tγδ and B 1 lymphocytes: subcutaneous, intranasal, and oral. The subcutaneous and intranasal routes produced a significant increase of these cells in lymph nodes associated with the nasal cavity (NALT) and in those associated with bronchial tissue (BALT). The oral route significantly increased levels of these cells in the spleen, in NALT, BALT, and in nodes associated with the gut (GALT). We found that mucosal application of the immunomodulator Immunovac-VP- 4 (contains antigens of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms), {{in conjunction with the}} activation of Tγδ and B 1, induces adaptive immune mechanisms not only in the lymphoid formations associated with the respiratory system and with GALT, but also in the spleen (increased expression of cluster of differentiation 3 [CD 3], CD 4, CD 8, CD 19, and CD 25).

40|$|As {{phosphorylation}} {{represents the}} pivotal mechanism for regulation of biological processes, kinases belong {{to one of}} the most biologically significant enzyme classes. The development of analytical techniques for characterization of kinase activity, in particular at a global scale, is a central priority for proteomic and cell biology researchers. In order to facilitate global analysis of cellular phosphorylation, a new paradigm of microarray technology which focuses on analysis of total cellular kinase activity, kinome, has emerged in the past few years. As the specificity of many kinases is dictated primarily by recognition of residues immediately surrounding the site of phosphorylation a logical methodology is to employ peptides representing these immediate sequences as experimental substrates. Microarray chips carrying hundreds of such substrate targets have been developed for human kinome analysis, however, lack of similar tools for species outside research mainstream has limited kinome analysis in these species. Based on sequence alignment of orthologous phosphoproteins from mammalian species, conservation of amino acid identity is reported to be 80 %. Accordingly, the potential exists to utilize phosphorylation sequence databases to extrapolate phosphorylation sites in other species based on their genomic sequence information. Peptides representing these proposed phosphorylation sites can then be utilized as substrates to quantify the activity of the corresponding kinase. Based on these principles, a bovine microarray of 300 unique peptide targets was constructed. The bovine phosphorylation targets were selected to represent a spectrum of cellular events but with focus on processes related to innate <b>immunity.</b> Initial <b>application</b> and validation of the bovine peptide arrays was carried out for kinome analysis of bovine blood monocytes stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CpG-ODNs; ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 9, respectively. The arrays confirmed activation of the known TLR signaling pathway as well as identifying receptor-specific phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation events not previously attributed to TLR activation were also identified and validated by independent bioassays. This investigation offers insight into the complexity of TLR signaling and more importantly verifies the potential to use bioinformatics approaches to create tools for species-specific kinome analysis based on genomic information...|$|R
40|$|Attempts {{to develop}} a {{successful}} HIV vaccine or induce an effective anti-tumor response using the methods available have so far been unsuccessful. The evaluation of innovative strategies aimed at improving the efficacy of vaccination is therefore {{an important aspect of}} basic research. Recent studies using replication vector systems in the SIV-primate model have, in this respect, been promising. The aim of this thesis was therefore {{to develop a}} novel replication-competent vaccine vector system based on simian foamy viruses able to induce an effective and enduring immune response against defined antigens. Replicating PFV-ΔBet vectors were constructed using the foamy viral vector pHSRV 2 / 13 (PFV/HFV) as a basis. An initial animal experiment demonstrated the induction of a long-lasting PFV-specific antibody response in hamsters and mice by gene gun ballistic application of the PFV-ΔBet deletion mutants. In order to be effective, a vaccine viral vector of this kind requires the stable expression of defined antigens under the control of viral replication. A variety of hybrid viruses with differing replication and antigen expression characteristics were generated by specific genetic modification of the PFV-ΔBet basis vectors. Virus replication and the stable expression of GFP and an HIV-CTL epitope string could be demonstrated for up to 68 days in vitro. Hamsters and mice were therefore inoculated with the PFV-HIV epitope hybrid viruses and a persistent PFV-specific antibody response was observed over a period of nearly 400 days. Furthermore, in vivo replication of the vaccine vectors was demonstrated by re-isolation of the inoculated virus from the tissues of an infected hamster. The functionality of the vaccine vector system was clearly demonstrated by the presence of HIV epitope-specific T-cells in the spleens of mice immunized almost 400 days previously with the hybrid viruses. The strength of the response appeared to depend on the particular characteristics of the vaccine vectors.

The use of xenogeneic tissue {{would help to}} address this shortage; however, strong cellular <b>immunity</b> limits the <b>application</b> of this approach. T-cell responses to xenogeneic tissues involve recognition of intact species-mismatched major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the direct pathway, and xenogeneic proteins presented as peptides by responder-type MHC molecules, the indirect pathway. In this study, we exploited the species difference to selectively and sequentially inhibit direct and indirect xenoresponses after transplantation of porcine islets into mice. Selective inhibition of the direct response was achieved using porcine CTLA 4 -Ig, which binds preferentially to pig versus mouse B 7 molecules. Selective inhibition of the indirect response was achieved using murine CTLA 4 -Ig, which binds preferentially to mouse B 7 molecules. Administration of porcine CTLA 4 -Ig alone caused modest prolongation of islet survival. Injection of murine CTLA 4 -Ig alone had a minimal effect.

Unwrapping phase information correctly becomes a challenging process in the presence of noise. This is particularly the case for speckle interferograms, which are noisy by nature.

To locally maintain continuous activation of innate subpopulations while inhibiting immunosuppressive cells, we evaluated aerosol delivery CpG-ODN combined with Poly(I:C), a TLR 3 agonist able to convert tumor-supporting macrophages to tumoricidal effectors, {{in the treatment of}} B 16 melanoma lung metastases in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Aerosolization of CpG-ODN with Poly(I:C) into the bronchoalveolar space reduced the presence of M 2 -associated arginase- and IL- 10 -secreting macrophages in tumor-bearing lungs and increased the antitumor activity of aerosolized CpG-ODN alone against B 16 lung metastases without apparent signs of toxicity or injury of the bronchial-bronchiolar structures and alveolar walls. Moreover, CpG-ODN/Poly(I:C) aerosol combined with dacarbazine, a therapeutic agent used in patients with inoperable metastatic melanoma able to exert immunostimulatory effects, led to a significant increase in antitumor activity as compared to treatments with aerosolized CpG-ODN/Poly(I:C) or dacarbazine alone. This effect was related to an enhanced recruitment and cytotoxic activity of tumor-infiltrating NK cells in the lung. Our results point to aerosol delivery as a convenient approach for repeated applications of immunostimulants in patients with lung metastases to maintain a continuous local activation of innate immune cells while suppressing polarization of tumor-infiltrating macrophages to an M 2 phenotype...|$|R
40|$|During {{bacterial}} infections of the {{musculoskeletal system}} immunological cells and factors are changed {{in number and}} activity. This prospective research had the goal to examine the reaction of immunoglobulins, representative immunological cells and their serological factors and Procalcitonin in the blood during bacterial infection and whether this could result in prognostic value. In the second part we aimed to examine {{the influence of the}} application of intravenous polyvalent Immunoglobulin G on the clinical outcome. Our main assumption was, that the humoral immunity does indeed play an important role within the resistance to bacterial infections of the musculoskeletal system. Dysfunctions of the immune response manifest themselves i. a. in a decrease of the serological concentration of immunoglobulins. Following this assumption the amount of serological levels of immunoglobulins was used as a distinct marker to classify between immunocompetent and immunodeficient patients. 70 patients exhibiting symptoms of either infected endoprostesis, infected joint or spine infections were examined. At specific time points blood levels of Immunoglobulins, of B- and T-cells and their activated forms, of interleukines 6 and 10 and tumornecrosisfactor-a as well that of the Procalcitonin and the C-reacting protein were determined. Every other patient, previously classified as immunodeficient, was intravenously substituted using polyvalent Immunoglobulin G. The results of the hematological tests were correlated with the general and local clinical results. When examinig their immunological status, patients with decreased serum levels of Immonoglobulin G showed significant differences when compared to patients with normal levels, indicating a possible multilocalized immunodeficiency. This was apparent not only in the humoral immunity but was also true for B and T-cell immunity. Our data suggests a direct involvement of increased IL- 10 blood levels resulting in suppression of the humoral immunity and the lymphocytes as well as decreased monocyte activity post operatively. According to our results, both the immunoglobulin serum levels and the levels of activated B- and T lymphocytes in the blood play an important role for the prognosis of patients with infections of the musculoskeletal system. The Procalcitonin showed greater sensitivity for the diagnosis of infections of the musculoskeletal system and seems to be better suited to represent the course of the disease when compared to CRP. For patient diagnosed with both infections at the musculoskeletal system and a temporary defect in the humoral <b>immunity,</b> the <b>application</b> of intravenous Immunoglobulin G has been found to positively influence the course of the disease and its clinical outcome.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The TLR 9 agonist CpG is {{increasingly}} applied in preclinical and clinical studies as a therapeutic modality to enhance tumor <b>immunity.</b> The clinical <b>application</b> of CpG appears, however, less successful {{than would be}} predicted from animal studies. One reason might be the different administration routes applied in most mouse studies and clinical trials. We studied whether the efficacy of CpG as an adjuvant in cancer immunotherapy {{is dependent on the}} route of CpG administration, in particular when the tumor is destructed in situ. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In situ tumor destruction techniques are minimally invasive therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of (nonresectable) solid tumors. In contrast to surgical resection, tumor destruction leads to the induction of weak but tumor-specific immunity that can be enhanced by coapplication of CpG. As in situ tumor destruction by cryosurgery creates an instant local release of antigens, we applied this model to study the efficacy of CpG to enhance antitumor immunity when administrated via different routes: peritumoral, intravenous, and subcutaneous but distant from the tumor. We show that peritumoral administration is superior in the activation of dendritic cells, induction of tumor-specific CTL, and long-lasting tumor protection. Although the intravenous and subcutaneous (at distant site) exposures are commonly used in clinical trials, they only provided partial protection or even failed to enhance antitumor responses as induced by cryosurgery alone. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CpG administration greatly enhances the efficacy of in situ tumor destruction techniques, provided that CpG is administered in close proximity of the released antigens. Hence, this study helps to provide directions to fully benefit from CpG as immune stimulant in a clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from {{epithelial}} tumors is a fatal diagnosis without efficient treatment. Trifunctional antibodies (trAb) are novel therapeutic approaches {{leading to}} a concerted anti-tumor activity resulting in tumor cell destruction. In addition, preclinical data in mouse tumor models demonstrated the induction of long lasting tumor immunity after treatment with trAb. We describe the induction of anti-tumor specific T-lymphocytes after intraperitoneal administration of trAb in patients with PC. 9 patients with progressive PC from gastric (n = 6) and ovarian cancer (n = 2), and cancer of unknown primary (n = 1) received 3 escalating doses of trAb after surgery and/or ineffective chemotherapy. The trAb EpCAM × CD 3 (10, 20, 40 μg) or HER 2 /neu × CD 3 (10, 40, 80 μg) were applicated by intraperitoneal infusion. Four weeks after the last trAb application, all patients were restimulated by subdermal injection of trAb + autologous PBMC + irradiated autologous tumor cells. Immunological reactivity was tested by analyzing PBMC for specific tumor reactive CD 4 +/CD 8 + T lymphocytes using an IFN-γ secretion assay. In 5 of 9 patients, tumor reactive CD 4 +/CD 8 + T-lymphocytes increased significantly, indicating specific anti-tumor immunity. A clinical response (stable disease, partial regression) has been observed in 5 of 9 patients, with a mean time to progression of 3. 6 months. Follow-up showed a mean survival of 11. 8 months (median 8. 0 months) after trAb therapy. TrAb are able to induce anti-tumor <b>immunity</b> after intraperitoneal <b>application</b> and restimulation. The induction of long-lasting anti-tumor immunity may provide an additional benefit of the intraperitoneal therapy with trAb and should be further elevated in larger clinical trials. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Nucleic acid aptamers {{have long}} {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} bind viral envelope proteins and to inhibit the progression of pathogenic virus infections. Here we report on initial efforts to develop and screen DNA aptamers against recombinant envelope proteins or synthetic peptides and whole inactivated viruses from several virulent arboviruses including Chikungunya, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), dengue, tickborne encephalitis and West Nile viruses. We also analyzed sequence data and secondary structures for commonalities that might reveal consensus binding sites among the various aptamers. Some of the highest affinity and most specific aptamers in the down-selected libraries were demonstrated to have diagnostic utility in lateral flow chromatographic assays and in a fluorescent aptamer-magnetic bead sandwich assay. Some of the reported aptamers may {{also be able to}} bind viral envelope proteins in vivo and therefore may have antiviral potential in passive <b>immunity</b> or prophylactic <b>applications.</b> Results Several arbovirus DNA aptamer sequences emerged multiple times in the various down selected aptamer libraries thereby suggesting some consensus sequences for binding arbovirus envelope proteins. Screening of aptamers by enzyme-linked aptamer sorbent assay (ELASA) was useful for ranking relative aptamer affinities against their cognate viral targets. Additional study of the aptamer sequences and secondary structures of top-ranked anti-arboviral aptamers suggest potential virus binding motifs exist within some of the key aptamers and are highlighted in the supplemental figures for this article. One sequence segment (ACGGGTCCGGACA) emerged 60 times in the anti-CCHF aptamer library, but nowhere else in the anti-arbovirus library and only a few other times in a larger library of aptamers known to bind bacteria and rickettsia or other targets. Diagnostic utility of some of the aptamers for arbovirus detection in lateral flow chromatographic assays and a fluorescent sandwich assay on the surface of magnetic microbeads is also demonstrated. Conclusions This article catalogues numerous DNA aptamer sequences which can bind various important pathogenic arboviruses and have, in some cases, already demonstrated diagnostic potential. These aptamer sequences are proprietary, patent-pending, and partially characterized. Therefore, they are offered to the scientific community for potential research use in diagnostic assays, biosensor applications or for possible passive immunity and prophylaxis against pathogenic viruses. </p...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{pressure}} {{to protect against}} phage-induced lysis and rampant horizontal gene transfer has created a wide repertoire of defensive pathways in bacteria. CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated) systems are adaptive immune pathways that use RNA-guided nucleases to direct cleavage of invading nucleic acids. The programmable nature of these enzymes has enabled a revolution for DNA-targeting applications including gene editing, transcriptional control, and genomic imaging. In addition to DNA-targeting enzymes, specific subtypes of CRISPR-Cas systems recognize and degrade single stranded RNA (ssRNA) substrates. Repurposing these ssRNA-targeting enzymes into biotechnological tools is currently limited {{by a lack of}} mechanistic information. In this work, we address this issue by redirecting a well-studied DNA-targeting CRISPR nuclease, Cas 9, to ssRNA targets and investigating the enzymatic mechanisms of a novel ssRNA-targeting CRISPR nuclease, Cas 13 a (formerly C 2 c 2). Typically, Cas 9 ignores ssRNA while searching for dsDNA targets due to ssRNA’s inherent single-stranded structure and lack of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). We redirected Cas 9 to bind and recognize ssRNA targets through addition of a third component, a target-complementary DNA oligonucleotide or PAMmer, that provides a DNA:RNA hybrid PAM. Using primary microRNAs as a model system, we provide proof-of-concept evidence that Cas 9 :PAMmer complexes can mediate the isolation and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of protein complexes bound to specific RNAs. The complexity of redirecting Cas 9 to ssRNA substrates motivated us to investigate CRISPR proteins that natively target RNA. We focused on Cas 13 a, a predicted ribonuclease from Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems. We discovered that Cas 13 a possesses two distinct catalytic activities, one for site-specific cleavage of its CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and the second for nonspecific ssRNA degradation activated by target binding. These insights allowed us to establish a revised model for ssRNA-targeting by Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems. Through biochemical characterization of the entire Cas 13 a protein family, we revealed hidden diversity in substrate preferences and defined orthogonal enzyme subfamilies. These diverse Cas 13 a homologs can be harnessed in parallel for detection of distinct RNA species within complex mixtures for both bacterial <b>immunity</b> and diagnostic <b>applications.</b> Together, this work presents two novel biotechnological applications of CRISPR-Cas nucleases for RNA isolation and RNA detection. ¬...|$|R

The field of {{international}} human rights {{has been one of}} the most prominent and dynamic areas of public international law in recent decades. At the same time the law of state immunity, albeit less prominent, has also been subjected to a process of dynamic change. The principle of absolute immunity of states from the adjudicatory jurisdiction of foreign states has been replaced by a restrictive concept under which foreign states can be sued under certain circumstances. The violation of fundamental human rights by foreign states is, however, still widely regarded as immunity- protected conduct, be it because such violations must be considered as governmental acts (acta jure imperii) or because the violations were committed outside the territory of the foreign state. Consequently, it is often impossible for the victim of such violations to bring damage proceedings against the foreign state based on municipal (tort) law in a municipal court. The present study attempts to demonstrate that international law does not per se demand that foreign states be granted immunity in such cases. The current state of international immunity law as evidenced by state practice and the work of several international learned bodies is surveyed extensively. It is shown that the granting of immunity may contradict the procedural guarantees of the European Convention of Human Rights. The impact of human rights law on the traditional concept of diplomatic protection is described. The study concludes that a further restriction of the immunity privilege is necessary, and criteria are offered to distinguish between violations of human rights which should remain immunity-protected and violations where the interest of the perpetrating state to remain immune from foreign jurisdiction must yield to the interest of the injured individual to obtain adequate redress...|$|R
40|$|Tumor-specific T {{lymphocytes}} {{are being}} {{regarded as a}} highly effective mechanism for tumor rejection. Activation of tumor-specific cytotoxic CD 8 + T cells (Tc or CTLs) requires presentation of tumor antigens by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) via MHC class I molecules. Due to this crucial role in T-cell activation, APCs are being exploited for active cancer immunotherapy. Independent of CTLs, also CD 4 + helper T cells (Th) can mediate a number of anti-tumor effector pathways. Activation of CD 4 + T cells requires the presentation of antigen via MHC class II. So far {{only a limited number}} of MHC class II-presented, tumorspecific Th-epitopes have been identified. Therefore most current vaccination strategies are focusing on the use of defined Tc epitopes able to elicit tumor-antigen specific CTL responses. Such strategies include vaccines based on tumor-specific peptides, proteins or protein fragments, or DNA constructs encoding such tumor antigens. Since these reagents on their own are usually poorly immunogenic, they need to be administered together with an adjuvant to stimulate sufficiently strong immune responses. Dendritic cells (DCs), due to their ability to initiate primary immune responses, are the most efficient APCs and can be regarded as "nature’s adjuvant". Vaccine development therefore focuses more and more on exploiting the unique capabilities of DCs. Present experimental studies include loading of DCs with synthetic, tumor-specific peptides or tumor lysates, to achieve uptake of tumor antigens and presentation in the context of MHC molecules. However, while such vaccination approaches in some cases yielded promising results, they are associated with laborious and cost-intensive ex vivo processing of primary cells and, in the case of peptide antigens, are restricted to well-defined T-cell epitopes known to match the patient’s MHC haplotype. Therefore constructs that directly target vaccines to DCs in vivo and/or deliver a number of different T-cell epitopes, are highly desirable and might overcome some of the limitations of present approaches. The optimization of vaccine delivery can be expected to improve efficacy, reduce doses and the risk of side effects, and improve control of immunological outcome. In this thesis, construction and functional characterization of two novel types of cancer vaccines are described. These vaccines were designed to be applicable for in vivo vaccination and induction of anti-tumor immunity specific for the tumor-associated antigen ErbB 2 (HER 2 /neu). ErbB 2 is overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies including breast and ovarian carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas of the lung. Other types of carcinomas that show variable ErbB 2 overexpression are those of the colon, kidney, bladder and salivary gland, prostate and pancreas. The first type of cancer vaccines intended to improve uptake and presentation of tumor antigen by APCs is based on the intracellular delivery of an antigenic determinant as part of a fusion protein specifically targeted to cell surface molecules exclusively expressed on APCs. As a potential cell targeting domain, a fragment derived from the extracellular part of the B 7 counter receptor CTLA- 4 (CTLA- 4125) was chosen and expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli. By FACS analysis, soluble human CTLA- 4125 purified from bacterial lysates could be shown to bind specifically to murine and human B 7 molecules selectively expressed on APCs, suggesting that CTLA- 4125 could serve as an effective targeting domain for the delivery of tumor antigens to APCs. As chimeric protein vaccines for targeted delivery to APCs, two fusion proteins termed C-ErbB 2 (N) and C-E-ErbB 2 (N) were constructed, that comprise CTLA- 4125 at the N-terminus for binding to B 7, and a fragment from the extracellular part of the human tumor-associated ErbB 2 antigen (ErbB 2 (N), amino acid residues 1 - 222) at the C-terminus. In the C-E-ErbB 2 (N) protein, between cell targeting domain and antigenic determinant the translocation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA II) was included to enable endosome escape upon receptor-mediated uptake of fusion protein by APC, possibly resulting in preferential delivery to the MHC class I pathway. Chimeric CTLA- 4 -ErbB 2 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified from bacterial lysates by metal chelate affinity chromatography. Specific binding to B 7 molecules on the surface of cells and uptake of the recombinant antigen-carrier proteins by B 7 expressing human Raji cells could be demonstrated by FACS analysis and laser scanning microscopy. Immune responses induced by CTLA- 4 -ErbB 2 fusion proteins were analyzed in Balb/c mice. Ex vivo restimulation with an ErbB 2 derived peptide of splenocytes from animals vaccinated with the chimeric proteins led to enhanced IFN-g production by T cells. Subcutaneous challenge of Balb/c mice with syngeneic ErbB 2 + renal carcinoma cells (Renca-lacZ/ErbB 2) resulted in rejection of tumors by the majority of mice vaccinated with CTLA- 4 -ErbB 2 fusion proteins indicating the induction of protective immunity. While both fusion proteins were effective, C-ErbB 2 (N) protein which lacks the bacterial translocation domain appeared to be more potent than C-E-ErbB 2 (N) in several independent experiments. Mice vaccinated with CTLA- 4 -ErbB 2 fusion proteins were not protected against challenge with ErbB 2 negative Renca-lacZ cells demonstrating specificity of the immune responses induced by the vaccines. T-cell depletion experiments showed that the protective effects were strictly dependent on the presence of CD 8 + CTLs. Intravenous rechallenge of vaccinated, tumor-free animals two months after the first, subcutaneous tumor challenge did not result in the formation of lung metastasis suggesting that long-lasting immune responses had been induced. In therapeutic vaccination experiments more closely resembling a possible clinical situation, CTLA- 4 -ErbB 2 fusion proteins were injected into the periphery of established, subcutaneously growing Renca-lacZ/ErbB 2 tumors. In two independent experiments therapeutic vaccination with C-ErbB 2 (N) resulted in the cure of 7 out of 8 mice, whereas CE-ErbB 2 (N) also in a therapeutic setting appeared to be slightly less effective curing 6 out of 8 animals. Cured animals were also protected against intravenous re-challenge with RencalacZ/ErbB 2 cells confirming the induction of long-lasting anti-tumor immunity. As an alternative to production of recombinant protein vaccines in bacteria, also direct injection of DNA constructs for in vivo expression and secretion of CTLA- 4 -ErbB 2 fusion proteins was tested. Based on plasmid pSecTag 2 mammalian expression vectors were constructed, which encode under the control of a CMV promoter the C-ErbB 2 (N) and C-EErbB 2 (N) proteins tagged for secretion with an Igk leader sequence. Upon transfection of COS- 7 cells in tissue culture, secretion of CTLA- 4 -ErbB 2 fusion proteins into the culture supernatant and B 7 binding activity of such proteins could be confirmed by immunoblot and FACS analysis. In protective vaccination experiments, intramuscular injection of CTLA- 4 -ErbB 2 DNA constructs in Balb/c mice resulted in complete protection from subcutaneous challenge with Renca-lacZ/ErbB 2 tumor cells, whereas all animals vaccinated with pSecTag 2 control DNA developed rapidly growing tumors. In conclusion, the data obtained in this first part of the thesis project demonstrate that chimeric protein vaccines combining in a single polypeptide chain a cell recognition domain for specific targeting to APCs with an antigenic protein fragment derived from human ErbB 2 are effective in inducing ErbB 2 -specific, T-cell mediated anti-tumor immunity in vivo. Thereby both, injection of recombinant proteins produced in bacteria, and vaccination with mammalian expression plasmids for in vivo production of chimeric protein vaccines was effective resulting in the rejection of syngeneic, ErbB 2 expressing tumors. The chimeric protein vaccines described above contain a large protein fragment derived from a human tumor antigen for delivery to and uptake by APCs. This approach is not necessarily dependent on a given MHC type and might be particularly useful to induce immune responses against antigens for which peptides suitable for presentation by most prevalent MHC alleles have not been defined. For tumor antigens where individual peptides have already been characterized as potential rejection antigens, in a limited number of cases synthetic derivatives of such peptides have successfully been used to induce T-cell responses of single specificity. However, also in this case inclusion of appropriate antigen carriers could facilitate improved uptake and presentation by APCs and enhance immunogenicity. Therefore in an alternative approach to induce ErbB 2 -specific anti-tumor <b>immunity,</b> in vivo <b>application</b> of synthetic vaccine complexes was investigated which are based on a liposomal carrier as a vector for peptide antigens linked to the liposomal surface via a special adjuvant lipopeptide anchor (Pam 3 CysSerSer). This part of the thesis project was carried out in close collaboration with Audrey Roth, Dr. Benoit Frisch and Dr. Francis Schuber, Laboratoire de Chimie Bioorganique, Faculté de Pharmacie, Université Louis Pasteur (ULP), Strasbourg, who prepared and provided all liposomal vaccine constructs tested in this study. Two liposomal formulations were synthesized. One single-epitope construct, referred to as Tc-ErbB 2 -liposomes, carried a Tc-epitope (TYLPTNASL) derived from the human ErbB 2 amino acid sequence. This peptide has previously been shown to bind to murine H- 2 Kd MHC class I with high affinity and to elicit peptide-specific CTL responses in Balb/c mice. The second liposomal formulation, termed Tc-ErbB 2 /Th-liposomes, contained in addition to the ErbB 2 peptide a universal Th-epitope derived from influenza|$|R
