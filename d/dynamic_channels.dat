Based on this separation, the proposed SMP algorithm simultaneously detects the common <b>channel</b> taps of <b>dynamic</b> sparse <b>channels</b> in all time slots at first, and then tracks the <b>dynamic</b> <b>channel</b> taps in each single time slot individually.

40|$|With recent {{developments}} in terrestrial wireless networks and advances in acoustic communications, multichannel technologies have been proposed {{to be used in}} underwater networks to increase data transmission rate over bandwidth-limited underwater channels. Due to high bit error rates in underwater networks, an efficient error control technique is critical in the logical link control (LLC) sublayer to establish reliable data communications over intrinsically unreliable underwater channels. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol stack architecture featuring cross-layer design of LLC sublayer and more efficient packetto- channel scheduling for multichannel underwater sensor networks. In the proposed stack architecture, a selective-repeat automatic repeat request (SR-ARQ) based error control protocol is combined with a <b>dynamic</b> <b>channel</b> scheduling policy at the LLC sublayer. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>channel</b> scheduling policy uses the channel state information provided via cross-layer design.
