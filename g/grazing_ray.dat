40|$|The {{usefulness}} of star occultation measurements for space navigation and {{the determination of}} a horizon density profile {{which could be used}} to update atmospheric models for horizon-based measurement systems were studied. The time of occultation of a known star by a celestial body, as seen by an orbiting observer, determines a cylinder of position, the axis of which is the line through the star and the body center, and the radius of which is equal to the occulting-body radius. The dimming percentage, with respect to the altitude of this <b>grazing</b> <b>ray</b> from the star to the observer, is a percentage altitude for occultation. That is, the star can be assumed to be occulted when it reaches a predetermined percentage of its unattenuated value. The procedure used was to measure this attenuation with respect to time to determine the {{usefulness of}} the measurements for autonomous space navigation. In this experiment, the crewmembers had to accomplish star acquisition, identification, calibration, and tracking. Instrumentation was required only for measurement of the relative intensity of the star as it set into the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The usual {{high-frequency}} (w) ray {{method of}} modelling reflections from smooth boundaries {{does not account}} for interference arising near critical angles of incidence. When the reflector is effectively convex towards the incident-wave side, the ray. method fails (i) in a transition zone of width O(w-ln) separating regions of partial and total ray reflection, (ii) for the transmission in a zone along the reflector having thickness O (co-ln) and where a whispering-gallery is formed by multiply-reflected turning waves, and (iii) for turning rays refracted back into the first medium at distances from the critical point less than O (m ~- l ’ ~), where m is the number of turns. The interference is a local effect and approximate analytic waveforms can be found for laterally varying media. The 2 -D acoustic case is described here. The fields near the point of critical incidence and about the critically reflected ray are found in a way similar to the <b>grazing</b> <b>ray</b> solution described in an earlier paper. However, through the critical ray problem the first two terms of the asymptotic expansion must be considered. The whispering-gallery is obtained by exploiting work on modes b...|$|E

Drawing on natural similarities with the undamped Rayleigh-Bloch waves supported by infinite linear arrays, we deduce asymptotically the exponentially small radiative damping in the limit where the ring radius is large {{relative to the}} periodicity. In our asymptotic approach, locally linear Rayleigh-Bloch waves that attenuate exponentially away from the ring are matched to a ring-scale WKB-type wave field. The latter provides a descriptive physical picture of how the mode energy is transferred via tunnelling to a circular evanescent-to-propagating transition region a finite distance away from the ring, from where radiative <b>grazing</b> <b>rays</b> emanate to the far field.

40|$|The {{quality of}} long range {{infrared}} (IR) imaging {{depends on the}} effects of atmospheric refraction and other path-integrated effects (e. g., transmission losses, scintillation and blurring), which are strongly related to the prevailing meteorological conditions. EOSTAR is a PC based computer program to quantify these strong nonlinear effects in the marine atmospheric surface layer and to present a spectrally resolved target image influenced by atmospheric effects using ray tracing techniques for the individual camera pixels. Presently, the propagation is predicted with bulk atmospheric models and the sea surface is idealized by steady regular periodic Stokes' waves. Dynamical wind-waves interactions are not taken into account in this approach, although they may strongly modify the refractive index in the near-surface layer. Nonetheless, the inclusion of the sea surface in the ray tracer module already has a great impact on the near-surface <b>grazing</b> <b>rays</b> and thus influences the images especially in situations of super refraction and mirage. This work aims at improving the description of the sea surface in EOSTAR taking into account the non-uniformity of spatially resolved wind-generated waves and swell. A new surface module is developed to model surface wind-waves and swell in EOSTAR on the basis of meteorological observations and spectral wave modeling.

Coincident observations of the display were made from 23. 55 UT until 00. 50 UT. By projecting {{the image of the}} noctilucent cloud structure as seen by one camera into the field of view of the other camera, the height of the clouds was found to be 82 ± 1 km. Using this result, the effect of atmospheric screening on the visible border of the noctilucent clouds was determined. Taking account of the refraction on the solar <b>grazing</b> <b>rays</b> illuminating the clouds at the visible border and the finite angular diameter of the sun 2 ̆ 7 s disc, the altitude of the screening layer was determined to be 7 ± 1 km. Thus, on this occasion, the screening effect of the atmosphere was confined to the troposphere and was probably caused by atmospheric haze and/or tropospheric cloud. This result contrasts markedly with the high values of screening height, 30 km, deduced from measurements made earlier this century, also using the visible boundary of the clouds.

40|$|Creeping rays {{can give}} an {{important}} contribution to the solution of medium to high frequency scattering problems. They are generated at the shadow lines of the illuminated scatterer by <b>grazing</b> incident <b>rays</b> and propagate along geodesics on the scatterer surface, continuously shedding diffracted rays in their tangential direction. In this paper we show how the ray propagation problem can be formulated as a partial differential equation (PDE) in a three-dimensional phase space. To solve the PDE we use a fast marching method. The PDE solution contains information about all possible creeping rays. This information includes the phase and amplitude of the field, which are extracted by a fast postprocessing. Computationally the cost of solving the PDE is less than tracing all rays individually by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. We consider an application to monostatic radar cross section problems where creeping rays from all illumination angles must be computed. The numerical results of the fast phase space method and a comparison with the results of ray tracing are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} hybrid and {{efficient}} method {{for the analysis of}} open-ended waveguide arrays on top of finite support structures. In space borne vehicles, arrays of open-ended waveguides often find their application in multi-beam feeds for reflector antennas or as tracking radars in the noses of aircraft or missiles. Especially in these cases, the antenna is of limited dimensions due to packaging and aerodynamic constraints. Because of the finiteness of the antenna and its mounting platform, the edge effects {{play an important role in}} the generation of side lobes and back scattered energy. In complex environments, stringent demands must be given to the side lobe levels, and the back scattering effects must be properly taken into account to be able to control the negative effects on the antenna performance. Via the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) approach the truncation of the ground plane can be modeled [2], [3]. In this approach the elements of the array give rise to singly diffracted rays which sum up with doubly diffracted rays excited at the edge of the structure. In particular, these latter are excited by the singly diffracted <b>grazing</b> <b>rays</b> impinging on the edges of the mounting platform. These phenomena can have a significant impact on both the radiation characteristics of the antenna and the input impedance of the radiating waveguides. Therefore, the availability of an accurate and efficient tool for the analysis of arrays, where the finite number of the array elements, the finiteness of the supporting structure, as well as the covering radome are included, is an essential requirement for a complete antenna design CAD tool. The presented model is based on a Multi-mode Equivalent Network (MEN) [1] representation of the radiating waveguides and a high frequency approach for the external region. The accessible ports given by the MENs connecting the antenna and feeding waveguides offer the possibility of optimising the structure looking both at the antenna’s radiation characteristics and the matching network inside the waveguides, rendering very efficient in the design of arrays. Moreover, the MEN method offers the possibility to include more complex structures as building blocks in the array design, structures which are probably best simulated via FEM or FDTD methods. These building blocks are precalculated in a commercial software tool like HFSS and subsequently cascaded in the system at impedance matrix level. This extends the flexibility of the developed CAD tool and creates a more realistic analysis of waveguide arrays...|$|R

By using a small rapidly rotating sphere as gravitating source on the Earth the deflection of a <b>grazing</b> light <b>ray</b> amounts to 10 ^{- 13 } rad and the time delay is proportional to 10 ^{- 23 } s.
