25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is a <b>flexible</b> <b>cover</b> to {{the medium}} (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve lifter shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E
25|$|Bookbinding is {{the process}} of {{physically}} assembling a book from an ordered stack of paper sheets that are folded together into sections or sometimes left as a stack of individual sheets. The stack is then bound together along one edge by either sewing with thread through the folds or by a layer of flexible adhesive. Alternative methods to binding a stack together that are cheaper but less permanent include loose-leaf rings, individual screw posts or binding posts, twin loop spine coils, plastic spiral coils, and plastic spine combs. For protection, the bound stack is either wrapped in a <b>flexible</b> <b>cover</b> or attached to stiff boards. Finally, an attractive cover is adhered to the boards and a label with identifying information is attached to the covers along with additional decoration. Book artists or specialists in book decoration can greatly expand the previous explanation to include book like objects of visual art with high value and artistic merit of exceptional quality in addition to the book's content of text and illustrations.|$|E

Such assembled microdevices can be used without leakage at flow rates above 2. 4 mL/min, corresponding to 1. 2 MPa if the PDMS deformation is neglected. The bonding tensile pressure exceeds 1. 5 MPa, proving the packaging strength. Furthermore, SU 8 -PDMS composite devices display stable bonding after several weeks of storage.

40|$|A field {{site was}} {{established}} in 1993 near Newcastle, Australia, {{as part of a}} long-term study into expansive soil behavior. The primary objectives in establishing the site were to collect high quality data with which to check current design methods for lightly loaded building foundations and to develop improved understanding of the physical processes that drive unsaturated expansive soil behavior. The site was instrumented to allow measurement of soil water content, soil moisture suction, and ground movement to depths of 3 m. The site was provided with two ground covers to simulate moisture boundary conditions due to the presence of typical structures. This paper presents some of the more important findings from the 7 years of data acquired so far. These include a qualitative assessment of the overall site behavior, and quantitative observations of the range of total suction and water content changes with depth, the depth to which moisture changes occur, and the contributions to surface movement from ground movement at various depths.
