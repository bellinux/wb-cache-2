5000|$|Carbohydrates {{provide a}} quick energy source, {{increased}} palatability {{as well as}} fiber in canine diets; if disaccharides and xylitol are avoided. In an ingredient label, starch (a complex carbohydrate) may appear as rice, wheat, barley, corn and/or other varying grains. These ingredients not only supply the dog with rapid and accessible energy while performing, but {{can also be used}} after exercise to replenish glycogen stores in organs such as the liver and muscle. Direct carbohydrate levels are not displayed on <b>feed</b> <b>labels</b> due to the inaccuracy of current testing methods and varying methods in which certain sources may effect an animal's glycemic response. However, for canines it has been demonstrated that rice has the greatest blood glucose response followed by wheat, barley, corn and sorghum. Diets containing rice or wheat should be blended with some low level carbohydrate sources like (sorghum or barley) to prevent an animal's blood glucose from spiking.|$|R

40|$|The role of plasma {{proteins}} {{in the general}} protein metabolism {{of the body is}} one of fundamental importance and is particularly suited to investigation by the newer radioisotope techniques. By <b>feeding</b> <b>labeled</b> amino acids to donor dogs it is possible to obtain labeled plasma proteins which in turn can be injected into recipient animals. Earlier reports (5, 8), using d/-lysine labeled with N 15 and C 14 were concerned only with the apparent rates of disappearance of plasma proteins, the experiments being limited by low activity which did not permit analysis of tissues nor of excretion products derived from the injetted plasma. The preparation of e-C~ 4 - 1 abeled d/-lysine with a specific activity some 20 times greater than that of the material originally available has made possible a detailed study in dogs of the distribution of C 14 activity in the blood protein fractions and tissues as well as the excretion of C 14 in both expired air and urine for periods up to 7 days following intravenous injection of single doses of labeled plasma protein.

40|$|Newly emerged {{honeybee}} {{workers were}} fed during 1 or 2 weeks with sucrose containing either heavy water, sodium acetate with deuterium, sodium acetate- 1 - 14 C, or uniformly labelled glucose- 14 C. The various lipid fractions were isolated {{in order to}} investigate {{the origin of the}} secreted wax components. In feeding acetate with deuterium or 14 C the isolated hydrocarbons and free wax acids were strongly labelled, but not the esters or their component acids and alcohols. <b>Feeding</b> uniformly <b>labelled</b> glucose or heavy water caused no extreme differences in the labelling of different lipid fractions. Radioactivity of the oenocytes was 30 per cent higher than that of the fat cells (micro-autoradiographic assays) after feeding acetate- 1 - 14 C, but no distinct difference was found after <b>feeding</b> uniformly <b>labelled</b> glucose- 14 C. In order to interpret these facts we supposed that the oenocytes take up directly the acetate fed to the animals, whereas the fat cells do not.

5000|$|Many cable {{television}} channels do not timeshift (or offer timeshift feeds to all viewers across the country), {{though there are}} several exceptions. The most notable network to carry a separate full-time-shifted feed is Nickelodeon, which is targeted to children and as such, schedules its programming around a typical school day and sleep schedule. Two separate Nickelodeon feeds exist, with the second being delayed three hours from the first (most digital cable and satellite providers carry both, with that coast's primary <b>feed</b> <b>labeled</b> [...] "Nick" [...] and the secondary coastal feed as [...] "Nick 2"; controversially in 2012 sister network Nick Jr. launched a block of mother-focused shows with adult content known as Nickmom, which only carries an east feed, meaning adult content airing at 10 p.m. Eastern was seen as early as 4 p.m. in Hawaii during the summer, forcing the network to later hurriedly launch a Pacific feed to resolve those issues in February 2013). As an alternative, many cable channels, including cable news outlets such as Fox News Channel, CNN and HLN timeshift most of their prime time programs on their main channel in late night time slots, {{so that they will}} air during prime time in both the Eastern and Pacific time zones, though it is subject to pre-emption because of later breaking news.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 The {{biosynthesis}} of manumycin type metabolites {{has been}} thoroughly studied, mainly with the asukamycin producer, Streptomyces nodosus. A complete biosynthetic pathway has been elucidated from two approaches: (i) synthesizing and <b>feeding</b> <b>labeled</b> compounds to S. nodosus and the manumycin A producer, S. parvulus; (ii) tracing and isolating pathway related metabolites by <b>feeding</b> an isotopically <b>labeled</b> precursor. 3 -Amino- 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid (3, 4 -AHBA) {{was identified as}} the key precursor of the mC 7 N unit of manumycins by synthesizing and feeding 3, 4 -[7 - 13 C]-AHBA. The discovery of a shunt metabolite, 7 -(3 -(N-acetylamino- 4 -hydroxyphenyl) -(2 E, 4 E, 6 E) -hepta- 2, 4, 6 -trienoic acid (85) and other type I manumycin (epoxyquinol mC 7 N unit) co-metabolites produced by S. nodosus helped to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway which proceeds from 3, 4 -AHBA by the "lower" polyketide chain extension followed by attachment of the "upper" chain and subsequently of the C 5 N unit. The quantitative studies on the composition of fatty acids and type I manumycins from S. nodosus revealed that the production of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (39) is a rate limiting step of asukamycin biosynthesis. This limitation results in formation of shunt metabolite 85 and type I manumycin co-metabolites which differ from asukamycin at the starter unit of the "upper" chain by using branched chain starter units instead of 39. The multi-step synthesis and feeding of N 1 -(2 -hydroxy- 5 -oxo-cyclopent- 1 -enyl) - 7 -[3 -(7 -cyclohexyl-hepta-(2 E, 4 E, 6 E) -trienoyl) -amino- 4 -hydroxyphenyl]-[1, 2 - 13 C 2]hepta-(2 E, 4 E, 6 E) -trienamide (71) and its incorporation into asukamycin further demonstrated that oxidation/epoxidation is the last reaction on the biosynthetic pathway to the type I manumycins. The discovery {{of a series of}} new type II manumycins (hydroxyquinol mC 7 N unit) and the study of the fermentation course indicated that the type II manumycins produced at a later stage are formed from the type I manumycins by reduction of the epoxide...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the use of antibiotic in feed and medication programs and their effects on broilers Serum Cholesterol and Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT). The broilers were sampled randomly from four small-scale broiler producers (BP 1, BP 2, BP 3, BP 4) in Semarang region-Central Java, Indonesia. Observed data comprising medication programs {{and the types of}} feed ingredients in the commercial complete feed were obtained from medication program brochures and <b>feed</b> <b>labels</b> respectively. Four unsexed broilers from each poultry producer were randomly sampled at selling point in poultry slaughterhouse. Broilers market body weight and abdominal fat percentage were measured on the spot. Blood was taken to obtain the serum samples for determination of serum cholesterol and SGOT. An independent experimental study (E 1) was also carried out approximately {{the same time as the}} field study using the same feed as in BP- 4 and raised under similar condition as in the broiler producers. However, no medication program was employed. The results showed that all feeds from four different feed companies (FC 1, FC 2, FC 3, FC 4) used by the four BPs respectively contained antibiotics. Antibiotics were also administered in medication program via drinking water. The market age was found to be 34 - 35 days old and market weight was in average 1760. 38 ± 54. 14 g with no significant difference among producers.
