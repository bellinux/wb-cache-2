5|$|An origin {{story for}} Thrud was {{printed in the}} Thrud the Barbarian Graffik Novel. The story tells {{of a group of}} mercenaries who, lost and searching for a pub, stumble across an {{abandoned}} baby in a deserted village. The mercenaries decide to raise the baby as one of their own, teaching him how to fight and <b>drink</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pleased {{with the}} success of {{operations}} in Élisabethville, Prem Chand decided to immediately carry forward with the UN's plans. In the afternoon of 30 December the head of the Swedish battalion at Kamina Air Base, Överstelöjtnant Bengt Fredman, received orders to advance upon the gendarmerie encampments in Kamina early the following morning. The gendarmes had expected an attack on 30 December, but when one failed to occur they began to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> and fire flares at random, possibly to boost morale. Rogue bands of gendarmes subsequently conducted random raids around the city and looted the local bank.|$|E
5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E

5|$|Twelve years later, {{the snow}} shark {{has become a}} town legend. The town's mayor, Shawn Overman, is {{informed}} when two residents are killed by the shark, and he and Sheriff Donald Chapman hold a town meeting. During the meeting, one of the residents, Mike Evans, claims that the killings were caused by the shark, despite him having said to have killed the creature seven years earlier. Against Chapman's warnings, he sets out to kill the beast once more. That night, Chapman and his son Ethan argue about Ethan finding a job and they mention Ethan's mother's death. Ethan leaves to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> outside with his friend Doug, and is killed by the shark while urinating. The next day, {{with the rest of}} the police force already at the scene, a distraught Chapman sees Ethan's corpse and questions Doug about the incident. When Doug claims that Ethan's death was caused by a shark, Chapman believes him and prepares to set out to kill it.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1830s, the Swan River Colony {{was in its}} infancy {{and did not have}} a {{substantial}} local beer industry. Preachers from the Temperance League lobbied against the drunkenness prevalent in the Colony, however the lack of locally produced beer meant that they focused their attention on spirits drinkers. Governor James Stirling believed that the construction of a local brewery may reduce the Colony's drunkenness problems by allowing the men to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> instead of spirits.|$|E
25|$|Many {{military}} {{historians have}} pointed out that Westmoreland became chief of staff at the worst time in history with regard to the Army. Guiding the Army as it transitioned to an all-volunteer force, he issued many directives to try to make Army life better and more palatable for United States youth—e.g., allowing soldiers to wear sideburns and to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> in the mess hall. However, many hard-liners scorned these as too liberal. Westmoreland ran unsuccessfully for governor of South Carolina in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Wine merchants {{failed to}} survive {{the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire and {{viticulture}} declined dramatically. The Germanic tribes preferred to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> and did not see the value of the wine trade. The decline of viticulture was intensified when Vikings cut the sea lanes in the Atlantic. In the south the Saracens were making Ghazw or raids. These campaigns in southern Europe caused Languedoc, Provence, Southern Italy, and the Douro Valley to become depopulated – the people being taken into slavery or fleeing the threat.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} {{of bread and}} beer were closely linked, since barley was the same key ingredient used for both, {{and most of the}} tools used in beer production, such as mortars, querns and winnowing baskets were also the same as for bread making. Archaeological evidence specific to beer making is thus uncommon, and earlier indications were that the ancient Israelites did not often <b>drink</b> <b>beer.</b> More recently, Iron Age sites in Israel have produced remains such as beer jugs, bottles, strainers and stoppers, all of which provide evidence that the Israelites drank beer. Nonetheless, the widespread cultivation of grapes, used primarily for winemaking, indicates that wine drinking was probably far more common than beer drinking.|$|E
25|$|During the ten-year {{project to}} build the Elan Valley dams, the navvies (workers) lived in a village of wooden huts near the site. This settlement, which was {{strictly}} controlled to keep order and health, would eventually become Elan Village (see Elan Valley). Guards controlled access in and out; this was done to reduce illness and to stop liquor smuggling. All new workers were deloused and examined for infectious diseases before being admitted. To keep order, {{a man and his}} wife shared a terrace house with eight single men. A school was provided for under-11-year-olds, who were expected to work on attaining that age. The camp also had a hospital for injuries, an isolation hospital for infectious cases, and a bath house. Men were allowed to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> at a pub, though women were not. Other facilities included a library, public hall, shop and canteen.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} held in September 1955 and lasted for five days; {{attendees}} remembered that the weather was very hot. The courtroom was filled to capacity with 280 spectators; black attendees sat in segregated sections. Press from major national newspapers attended, including black publications; black reporters were required {{to sit in the}} segregated black section and away from the white press, farther from the jury. Sheriff Strider welcomed black spectators coming back from lunch with a cheerful, [...] "Hello, Niggers!" [...] Some visitors from the North found the court to be run with surprising informality. Jury members were allowed to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> on duty, and many white male spectators wore handguns.|$|E

500|$|Reinfeldt {{joined the}} Moderate Youth League—the youth {{wing of the}} Swedish Moderate Party—in 1983 {{at the age of}} 18. As a member of the Moderate Youth League in Täby, he {{challenged}} the leaders of the local league, who preferred to use the premises as a place to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> and wine rather than engage in discussions about politics. Reinfeldt, who is said to dislike hard liquor and to consume wine and beer in moderate amounts, started [...] "Conservative Youth" [...] (...) and formed a bond with the mother party, eventually taking over the youth league in 1987. In 1988 he became a secretary (...) in the Stockholm Municipality Council.|$|E
500|$|Durst unsuccessfully {{tried to}} attract {{attention}} from A representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager. Later, when Korn performed in town as the opening act for Sick of It All, Durst invited Korn to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, {{he was able to}} persuade Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs [...] "Pollution", [...] "Counterfeit" [...] and [...] "Stuck". Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which exposed the band to a new audience. The band attempted to expand their sound by auditioning an additional guitarist, but Borland soon determined that another guitarist was not the answer, and DJ Lethal, formerly of the hip hop group House of Pain, joined the band as a turntablist after a successful practice performance. Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style. Due to creative differences, Borland left the band at this point.|$|E
500|$|While {{wine was}} the most common table {{beverage}} in much of Europe, {{this was not the case}} in the northern regions where grapes were not cultivated. Those who could afford it drank imported wine, but even for nobility in these areas it was common to <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> or ale, particularly towards the end of the Middle Ages. In England, the Low Countries, northern Germany, Poland and Scandinavia, beer was consumed on a daily basis by people of all social classes and age groups. By the mid-15th century, barley, a cereal known to be somewhat poorly suited for breadmaking but excellent for brewing, accounted for 27% of all cereal acreage in England. However, the heavy influence from Arab and Mediterranean culture on medical science (particularly due to the Reconquista and the influx of Arabic texts) meant that beer was often heavily disfavoured. For most medieval Europeans, it was a humble brew compared with common southern drinks and cooking ingredients, such as wine, lemons and olive oil. Even comparatively exotic products like camel's milk and gazelle meat generally received more positive attention in medical texts. Beer was just an acceptable alternative and was assigned various negative qualities. In 1256, the Sienese physician Aldobrandino described beer in the following way: ...|$|E

2500|$|In each episode, Penn and Teller debunk {{a chosen}} {{misconception}} such as cryptozoology, debate a controversial topic like gun control, or [...] "expose the truths" [...] {{of an organization}} like PETA. Sometimes their objective is not to completely dismiss the topic at hand but to decry {{certain aspects of the}} topic that they believe to be pernicious, misleading, unnecessary, or overemphasized. For example, in the case of college they argue that while college {{is a great place to}} learn, <b>drink</b> <b>beer</b> or train for a career, the concept of diversity is bullshit when used as an excuse to restrict free speech or selectively recruit to fill quotas. Or that [...] "the casual asshole, or just plain dickhead, might do well in an anger management program" [...] but teaching people they can relieve anger through attacking or screaming at inanimate objects is bullshit, since this [...] "venting" [...] (as it's called in the industry) by an angry person in a social situation will lead to violence.|$|E
