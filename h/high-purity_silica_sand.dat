40|$|A {{leaching}} {{technology on}} samples of Algerian quartz sand deposit {{has been investigated}} {{in order to obtain}} <b>high-purity</b> <b>silica</b> (SiO 2) as raw material intended for photovoltaic application. The enrichment process was carried out by using double acid percolation leaching method (HF and HCl) for reducing the iron rate in the final product and also to decrease the final duration of the used process. In the aim to remove residual iron content from the ore surface, the leaching process was followed by an alkaline washing using NaOH and gravimetric separation. A characterization study has been carried out to establish the location, the quantity of the iron and others impurities on the ore: 850 ppm was the maximum iron contamination, whereas after the application of this technology, final iron content 96 ppm (as Fe) has been obtained. A schematic flowsheet of the process has been proposed considering the obtained experimental results and the results obtained in the literature. The experimental results have shown the technical feasibility of this process for <b>high-purity</b> <b>silica</b> <b>sands</b> production intended for photovoltaic area. 1...|$|R

One of the areas with abundant of <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> distribution is the northern coastline of Rupat Island, Bengkalis district, Riau province, Indonesia. The distribution of <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> in this island identified only on the northern coastline in this island. Some selected sample of <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> was measured to get the percentage of <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> mineral’s content using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). Two adjacent scenes of ALOS PALSAR full-polarimetry were used. The physical properties of <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> sample such as dielectric constant were measured using dielectric probe kit in the frequency range from 0. 3 to 3. 0 GHz and used for calculating the backscattering coefficient and the difference characteristics of <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> with another object.

On the <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> slope gullies, gathered data point {{at very high}} rates of erosion and sedimentation, since runoff and hydric erosion occurs on them almost instantaneausly after precipitation. When no reclamation is made, <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> mines evolve like 'natural' gullies, and they show higher tares of hydric erosion than them. The erosion of non-reclaimed <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> mines produces severe on and off sile environmental impacts.

40|$|Applications of {{three-dimensional}} printing (3 DP) to {{metal casting}} include, among other things, the direct manufacturing of foundry moulds and cores in refractory {{materials such as}} <b>silica</b> <b>sand.</b> The main properties of <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> that are essentially related to the traditional moulding and core-making processes are: size distribution, clay content, pH, acid demand, and refractoriness. The <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> used for 3 DP must also be appropriately selected for the layer-based manufacturing process involved in 3 DP. Properties such as grain size distribution, grain surface morphology, angularity, flowability, and recoating abilities have a particular importance when determining sand suitability. Because of these extra requirements, only a limited range of available foundry <b>silica</b> <b>sands</b> {{can be used for}} 3 DP processes. The latter situation explains the scarcity and high cost of suitable <b>silica</b> <b>sands,</b> thus contributing to the relatively high operational costs of the 3 DP processes for the production of sand moulds and cores. This research paper investigates the suitability of a locally-available <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> for use in a Voxeljet VX 1000 3 DP machine. The local <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> was assessed and compared with an imported <b>silica</b> <b>sand</b> recommended by the manufacturer of 3 DP equipment in terms of foundry characteristics and recoating behaviour.
