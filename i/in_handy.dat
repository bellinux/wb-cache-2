5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes <b>in</b> <b>handy,</b> in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E
5|$|While Edward was away, Salisbury was {{captured}} by the French at Lille in April 1340, and imprisoned in Paris. Reportedly, King Philip VI of France wanted to execute Salisbury and Robert Ufford, Earl of Suffolk, who {{was captured}} with him. Philip was, however, dissuaded by John of Bohemia, who argued that the earls could come <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> in an exchange, should any French noblemen be captured. Though released on parole in September, {{it was not until}} May 1342 that he reached a final settlement with the French. Salisbury was freed in a prisoner exchange, but only on the condition that he never fight in France again.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E

On 12 September 1873 he was appointed to Wolseley’s staff for special services. He commanded a flank at the Battle of Amoaful (31 January 1874) where he was wounded. and at the Battle of Esaman. He helped recruit a regiment from among the coastal African tribes, although he wrote of the Fantis that “it {{would be difficult to}} imagine a more cowardly, useless lot of men”. He did, however, discourage British officers from using physical abuse on them.|$|E

25|$|The {{sequence}} of steps {{in which the}} reorganization of chemical bonds may be {{taking place in the}} course of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many reaction intermediates with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the kinetics and the relative product mix of a reaction. Many physical chemists specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the Woodward–Hoffmann rules often come <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.|$|E
25|$|Policarpa's {{operations}} ran {{smoothly and}} undetected until the Almeyda brothers were apprehended while carrying information {{back to the}} insurgents outside Bogotá. Their information directly linked La Pola to the Revolution. The Almeyda brothers and La Pola were implicated in helping soldiers desert the Royal Army and join the Revolution; transporting weapons, ammunitions and supplies to the insurgents; in helping the Almeydas escape from prison when they were captured in September of the same year, and finding them refuge in Machetá. They had hoped their connection with La Pola could come <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> {{in the event of}} a revolt in the city. The loyalists now suspected her of treason, but lacked solid evidence to accuse a seamstress of espionage and treason.|$|E

He then made a {{comeback}} for the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour after Murali Vijay was ruled out due to injury. But he did not show any progress as he got out early in both innings for less than 10 runs. In the second match of the series, Shikhar Dhawan lost his place due to injury and was ruled out of the rest of the tour. Rahul replaced Dhawan and made his second Test century, 108 runs from 190 balls, which included 14 fours and 1 six. India went on to win the match to level the series and Rahul was named as the man of the match. His wicket-keeping skills came <b>in</b> <b>handy,</b> when Wriddhiman Saha got injured. Rahul took a catch to dismiss Angelo Mathews in the second innings.|$|E

25|$|These rural {{appliances}} {{are extremely}} important for keeping South Australia protected from fires. Almost every town in South Australia would {{have at least}} two of these rural fire trucks. The reason that there are many different types of rural trucks, is because the terrain changes a lot in South Australia. A 14 appliance, only carries 1000 litres nominally but is extremely useful for getting into small tracks which larger appliances can not. Large 34s often have trouble in getting into smaller areas. 24s are the most common, because they are not too heavy and big, but carry a reasonable amount of water, which can last a good time before having to fill up. In most parts of South Australia outside major centres there is no water mains, so this is where Bulk Water Carriers come <b>in</b> <b>handy.</b> These BWCs, often at a rural fire, will be stationary at the edge of it, for smaller trucks to fill up from. when empty it is their job to go and find water in places including, rivers, dams, swimming pools and water tanks.|$|E
25|$|In early 1868, the British force seeking Tewodros’ surrender, {{after he}} refused to release imprisoned British subjects, arrived {{on the coast of}} Massawa. The British and Dajazmach Kassa came to an {{agreement}} in which Kassa would let the British pass through Tigray (the British were going to Magdala which Tewodros had made his capital) in exchange for money and weapons. Surely enough, when the British completed their mission and were leaving the country, they rewarded Kassa for his cooperation with artillery, muskets, rifles, and munitions, all in all worth approximately £500,000. This formidable gift came <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> when in July 1871 the current emperor, Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II, attacked Kassa at his capital in Adwa, for Kassa had refused to be named a ras or pay tribute. Although Kassa's army was outnumbered 12,000 to the emperor's 60,000, Kassa's army was equipped with more modern weapons and better trained. At battle's end, forty percent of the emperor's men had been captured. The emperor was imprisoned and would die a year later. Six months later on 21 January 1872, Kassa became the new emperor under the name Yohannes IV.|$|E
25|$|Shastri {{continued}} as vice captain to Kapil Dev in the 1985–86 season. This {{season and the}} England tour of 1986 were ordinary ones for him. Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan toured India in 1986–87. Shastri {{played a crucial role}} in the Tied Test at Madras against Australia, scoring 62 and 48*. When Indian middle order collapsed and India fell behind the run rate, his two sixes in quick succession off off–spinner Greg Matthews came <b>in</b> <b>handy.</b> In the final Test at Bombay he scored 121*. As was becoming increasingly common, it was played in first and fourth gear. He hung around for around 30 minutes for the last run for his fifty and twice as long in the nineties. Yet he hit six sixes, three of which came after he completed his hundred. The huge six off left arm fast bowler Bruce Reid – a cross batted heave that went over longon – was particularly memorable. Six sixes in an innings was an Indian record at the time. But he was outshone by Dilip Vengsarkar who scored 164* in the same innings. They added a record 298* for the sixth wicket.|$|E

500|$|Perry {{thoroughly}} enjoyed {{what he was}} doing, {{saying in}} a 1989 interview, [...] "I {{got a kick out}} of live television. The spontaneity was the fun of it." [...] Spontaneity and the ability to be himself came <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> for swimmer/actress Esther Williams' guest appearance of March 16, 1957. A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed.

His mildly corrupt tenure there gave him good contacts with the police. These would soon come <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> for smoothing over certain problems of a young and unlicensed theater troupe when Rosenberg and Spivakofsky returned from Romania, penniless because {{the end of the war}} had meant the collapse of Yiddish theater in the provinces, and ready to start a troupe in Odessa.|$|E
500|$|As {{in other}} Eastern Bloc countries, {{there was a}} Soviet-style {{political}} purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of [...] "nationalist" [...] or other [...] "deviationist" [...] tendencies. In September, Władysław Gomułka who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together {{with a group of}} communist leaders who like Gomułka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from Leninism, and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary. Gomułka, accused of [...] "right-wing nationalist deviations", had indeed emphasized the Polish socialist traditions and severely criticized Rosa Luxemburg's SDKPiL party for belittling Polish national aspirations. More insidiously, the Soviets claimed Gomułka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy. Following Bolesław Bierut's order, he was arrested by the Ministry of Public Security (MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by Romkowski and Fejgin, as demanded by the Soviets. Gomułka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut, Jakub Berman and other Stalin's associates. Under interrogation he defiantly conducted his defense, threatened to reveal [...] "the whole truth" [...] if put on a trial, and remained unbroken. Gomułka was thus placed in prison without a typical show trial until released in December 1954. Bierut, heading the victorious PPR faction whose members spent the war in the Soviet Union, replaced Gomułka as the PPR (and then the PZPR) leader. Gomułka remained protected by his Polish comrades {{to the best of their}} ability and the record of his sometime defiance came <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> when in 1956 there was an opportunity for the Polish party to reassert itself.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics.com {{repeated}} many of {{the same}} sentiments in his review of the film. He hated the characters within the first five minutes of the film and found himself wishing that the film had shown more of the bear just walking in the woods rather than the characters talking with one another between the attacks. Matt Gamble of UGO Entertainment was excited by the film's cover, but was also quickly disappointed by [...] "insipid dialog" [...] amongst the characters and their continuously calling each other [...] "dude." [...] The characters actually asking what a bear was doing in the Canadian wilderness, where bears are plentiful, amused him, though he notes that it was probably not the intended reaction for the scene. His final rating of the film was an [...] "F." [...] DVD Verdict's David Johnson also questioned why the bear and actors are never seen on screen together. He derided the scenes in which the bear would make a swiping motion, and the scene would cut to show a character flying through the air: [...] "I don't know how the bear mastered the art of jujitsu in the wild, but it comes <b>in</b> <b>handy</b> when four teenagers snuff your cub and they need a healthy dose of comeuppance." [...] He also wondered at the lack of fake blood or props being used during attacks rather than [...] "ridiculous blood splatter computer graphics tossed on the screen." [...] Multiple critics noted that the film introduced two potentially interesting subplots that ended up being pointless as the film never explored either, and they all agreed that the film had excellent picture quality.|$|E
