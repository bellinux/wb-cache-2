40|$|Packaging innovation, {{finalized}} {{to configure}} food {{in terms of}} product/service, is crucial in satisfying consumers’ needs: pleasure, practicalness, health. Furthermore, also in such sector, time reduction between the R&D activity and the industrial {{exploitation of the results}} becomes more and more strategically important. In such scenery, “Steam Pack”, an innovative <b>disposable</b> <b>pack,</b> has been developed for pressure cooking of food in microwave ovens. The development in short times of “Steam Pack”, winner of the Oscar dell’Imballaggio 2005 (“Technology” section) and of a World Star Packaging Award 2005, was possible thanks to integrated CAD/CAE and statistical techniques. The study has been carried out according to a DOE of FEM analyses aimed to optimize the geometry of the membrane spring, the geometry of the steam vent and the thickness of the bowl walls. The use of integrated CAD/CAE and statistical techniques made possible the simultaneous handling of several parameters, enabling optimization in short times. This allowed to realize prototypes and start the testing stage after just two weeks {{from the beginning of the}} design activity...|$|E
40|$|We {{have adapted}} an assay for the direct {{detection}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using a prototype automated instrument platform in which probes are amplified with Q-beta replicase. The assay {{was based on}} amplification of specific detector probe following four cycles of background reduction (reversible target capture) in a closed <b>disposable</b> <b>pack.</b> The assay signal was the time required for fluorescence to exceed background levels (response time [RT]). RT was inversely related {{to the number of}} M. tuberculosis rRNA target molecules in the sample. Equivalent signals and noises were observed in assays containing either sputum or buffer. All mock samples containing > or = 10 CFU of M. tuberculosis responded in the assay (average RT, 13. 91 min), while most (83 %) samples containing as many as 10 (7) CFU of Mycobacterium avium gave no response during a 25 -min amplification reaction. The samples containing M. avium which did respond had an average RT of 17. 04 min. Seventy-five percent (167 of 223) of samples containing no target gave no responses; the remaining 25 % had an average RT of 15. 53 min. Eighty-three frozen sputum samples were tested to develop a candidate cutoff RT for the assay prior to more extensive clinical testing. After resolution of discrepant results and with a 14 -min RT cutoff, 30 of 38 M. tuberculosis-positive samples were positive by the assay; 1 of 45 negative samples responded within 14 min. Assay sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negatives predictive values in this pilot study were 79, 98, 97, and 85 %, respectively...|$|E

Kaletski became enthralled with the high quality of <b>disposable</b> <b>packing</b> materials in the USA. For the artist, those boxes provided unique, if unusual, components for the creative process. Beginning with commercial cardboard packaging he collaged the material adding line and color.

40|$|The {{development}} of the packaging industry has promoted indiscriminately the use of <b>disposable</b> <b>packing</b> as Tetra Pak, which after a very short useful life turns into garbage, helping to spoil the environment. One of the known processes {{that can be used}} for achievement of the compatibility between waste materials and the environment is the gamma radiation, which had proved to be a good tool for modi cation of physicochemical properties of materials. The aim of this work is to study the e ects of waste cellulose fromTetra Pak packing and gammaradiation on themechanical properties of cement concrete. Concrete specimens were elaborated with waste cellulose at concentrations of 3, 5, and 7 wt% and irradiated at 200, 250, and 300 kGy of gamma dose. The results show highest improvement on the mechanical properties for concrete with 3 wt% of waste cellulose and irradiated at 300 kGy; such improvements were related with the surface morphology of fracture zones of cement concrete observed by SEM microscopy...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an automated assay of giycohemoglobin {{performed with the}} Abbott VisionTM analyzer. The assay is based on batch affinity-extraction with 3 -aminophenylbo-ronic acid-derivatized agarose beads. Reagents are pack-aged in a <b>disposable</b> test <b>pack.</b> Whole-blood specimens are hemoiyzed with saponin within a glass capillary tube inserted into the test pack. The sample is automatically diluted with, mixed with, and separated from the solid-phase reagent. Bichromatic absorbance readings are {{used to calculate the}} percentage of hemoglobin bound. Based on the linear correlation between affinity-measured giycohemogiobin and HPLC-measured hemoglobin A 1, the percentage of hemoglobin bound is converted to a “standardized %HbA 1 ” result by use of regression pa-rameters stored during a calibration run.

50|$|Fuji's {{instant film}} {{products}} {{are based upon}} the improvements made to Polaroid's SX-70 instant film system that the Eastman Kodak Company sold in the 1970s and 1980s - namely the ability to expose the film through {{the rear of the}} photograph and the reversal of the dye layers' order so that development in the blue layer is visible first. As a result of these changes, the image {{does not need to be}} taken via a reflex mirror in order to reverse the image (as all Polaroid integral film cameras do). Colour balance and tonal range are also improved over Polaroid integral instant films. Fuji's decision to integrate the pressure plate springs and batteries into the camera bodies rather than the <b>disposable</b> film <b>pack</b> itself helps make the Instax system more economical per exposure than Polaroid's equivalents.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Ubiquitous {{computing}} {{is beginning}} to generate interest in the computer world, and new applications for this technology are being found daily. One facet of ubiquitous computing {{is the concept of}} distributed sensor networks: groups of sensors that communicate with each other for tasks such as monitoring inventory (RFID tags and infrastructure in a convenience store), security (security cameras in a warehouse), or watching environmental conditions (a series of temperature sensors in a greenhouse). One major obstacle blocking the adoption of distributed sensor networks is the issue of maintenance. Installing infrastructure to supply power to the sensors would be a robust solution, always keeping them powered, but it is an expensive option. On {{the other side of the}} spectrum, one could simply use <b>disposable</b> battery <b>packs</b> to power the sensors. However, these battery packs would have be tested and replaced regularly, a labor intensive process if done by hand. Combining robotics...|$|R

5000|$|Chemical reaction-based {{garments}} have cloth pouches or pockets where single-use {{packages of}} chemical hand warmers can be inserted. The hand warmers {{are about the}} size of a package of cards, and they contain chemicals which produce heat. One traditional hand warmer is a small metal box containing charcoal which, when lit, burns very slowly and produces a mild heat. <b>Disposable</b> heat <b>packs</b> typically contain cellulose, iron, water, activated carbon, vermiculite, and salt. When these packs are exposed to air, an exothermic chemical reaction occurs, which provides several hours of heat. Another chemical heating pad uses a gel that can be activated by twisting the package, thus triggering a chemical reaction. The pack can be put in a pot of boiling water to convert the chemical reaction back and allow it to be reused. While these products are commonly called [...] "hand warmers", they can be placed in boots or, with special garments such as vests, in cloth pockets on the inside of the garment. The temperature tends to be lowest among above heating methods.|$|R

40|$|We {{present data}} from a {{clinical}} trial study in which an automated version (Galileo) of a previously described Q-Beta replicase-amplified probe assay (J. S. Shah et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 33 : 1435 - 1441, 1995) {{was used for the}} direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in sputum. The assay was designed to target specific regions of 23 S rRNA found in M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, and Mycobacterium microti and had a sensitivity ranging from approximately < 10 to 300 CFU. The assay was tested for cross-hybridization by using large numbers (e. g., 10 (5) to 10 (10) CFU/assay) of 133 other organisms commonly found in respiratory tract samples, including non-M. tuberculosis Mycobacterium spp., other bacteria, fungi, and viruses. All of these competitors tested negative by the assay. Automated assay results for 780 respiratory tract samples (sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens) collected and tested at three trial sites in the United States) were compared with the results of culture and acid-fast microscopy. Aliquots of conventionally digested and decontaminated sputum pellets were heated at 100 degrees C and mechanically disrupted prior to hybridization and background reduction, amplification, and detection in a closed <b>disposable</b> test <b>pack.</b> Pertinent elements of individual patient histories relating to tuberculosis exposure, previous active disease, antituberculosis therapy status, etc., were considered in the resolution of discrepant results for 48 (assay false-positive) samples. Seventy-one of 90 (78. 9 %) culture-positive samples were positive when tested in the Galileo assay, while 7 % of culture-negative samples were assay positive, corresponding to a sensitivity of 79 % and a specificity of 93 %. Following resolution of discrepant results by chart review, the sensitivity and specificity for the Q-Beta replicase amplification assay with the Galileo analyzer were 84 and 97 %, respectively. A total of 69. 2 % of smear-negative (culture positive) samples were detected by the assay. Ten test packs at a time were automatically processed by the Galileo analyzer without operator intervention following loading of samples. The first result was reported in approximately 3 h, and the last result was available in 6. 5 h. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a clinical study with a fully automated amplification probe hybridization assay for the detection of pathogens directly from a clinical specimen...|$|R
40|$|Prior to the {{commencement}} of this study in 1990, a number of reports {{had appeared in the}} literature describing the importance of insulin action during lactation in mammals (see Chapter 1). These studies investigated the changes in circulating insulin and glucagon concentrations during lactation, the relative numbers of insulin receptors in insulin-sensitive tissues, and glucose utilisation by these tissues. However, at that time, no information was available on the structure of the mammary insulin receptor. The rationale for undertaking this study was to characterise the structure of the rat mammary insulin receptor as a means of furthering our understanding of the role insulin plays during lactation. An initial requirement of this study was the development of a method for the convenient and inexpensive preparation of A 14 -tyrosyl[125 I]iodoinsulin. A 14 -tyrosyl[125 I]iodoinsulin displays binding characteristics which are virtually indistinguishable from the native hormone, which is a necessary requirement for tracers which are to be used in binding studies. In Chapter 2, I describe a method for the purification of A 14 -tyrosyl[125 I]iodoinsulin from a mixture of iodinated insulin molecules which are produced following oxidation by chloramine-T in the presence of Na 125 iodine. In this method I employed <b>disposable</b> cartridges <b>packed</b> with a C 18 support matrix to which the iodinated insulin molecules are readily adsorbed when in an aqueous solution. A 14 -tyrosyl[125 I]iodoinsulin absorbed most strongly to the C 18 matrix and unwanted products were removed through a sequence of washes prior to the elution of the A 14 -tyrosyl[125 I]iodoinsulin derivative using a buffer containing 50 % (v/v) acetonitrile. This prodct was unambiguously shown to be A 14 -tyrosyl[125 I]iodoinsulin by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The quality of this radiolabel compared favourably with commercially ++available A 14 -tyrosyl[125 I]iodoinsulin preparations both in terms of specific activity and stability upon storage at - 20 C. Furthermore, a modified method based on this protocol has been used in our and other laboratories for the isolation of other iodinated peptides with highly satisfactory results. I have established that the size of the a-subunit of the rat mammary insulin receptor is significantly diminished compared with the liver insulin receptor (125 kDa versus 130 kDa). This difference in size was present throughout all stages of lactation and was not due to proteolysis of a larger form. Furthermore, I demonstrated that both the mammary and liver insulin receptor a-subunits migrated equally on PAGE following treatment with neuraminidase, indicating that the apparent size difference may be accounted for by a variation in the extent of receptor sialation. Treatment of the mammary insulin receptor a-subunit with glycopeptidase F demonstrated that the size of the aglycoreceptor (100 kDa) was similar to that described for insulin receptors from other insulin-sensitive tissues. I characterised the distribution of mRNA encoding the two, naturally-occurring insulin receptor isoforms in mammary tissue throughout all stages of pregnancy and lactation. These insulin receptor isoforms differ due to the absence (IR-A) or presence (IR-B) of a 12 amino acid peptide, encoded by exon 11 of the insulin receptor gene, and located near the C-terminus of the insulin receptor a-subunit. Mammary tissue predominantly expressed IR-A mRNA in contrast to liver tissue, which almost exclusively expressed IRB mRNA. Furthermore, the ratio of IR-A to IR-B mRNA in mammary tissue changed significantly during the first week post-partum whilst the distribution of IR-A and IR-B mRNA in the liver remained constant throughout pregnancy and lactation. This difference in insulin receptor isoform ++expression between mammary and liver tissue also contributed to the estimated size difference between the insulin receptor a-subunits from these two tissues. In addition, I characterised the expression of IR-A and IR-B mRNA in several different tissues obtained from rats on day 14 of gestation through to 7 days post partum. I established that the splicing mechanism is functional at least as early as day 14 of gestation, suggesting a possible role for the preferential expression of a particular insulin receptor isoform during organogenesis. I observed that IR-A mRNA was the predominant isoform in all foetal tissue studied, and the proportion of this isoform declined as the animal matured. These changes were significant in cardiac muscle, kidney and most dramatic in the liver where the expression of IR-A mRNA changed from 53 % in the 21 day old foetus (the day before parturition) to 13 % in the 1 day old neonate. These results suggest that the splicing mechanism which generates the receptor isoforms is subject to acute hormonal and/or metabolic control. The current literature suggests that the carbohydrate moieties of the insulin receptor affects its affinity for insulin. Furthermore, the IR-A and IR-B isoforms have been shown to display a 2 -fold difference in their insulin binding affinity when expressed in heterologous cell lines such at CHO cells or Rat- 1 fibroblasts. Since both glycosylational and isoform distribution differences were evident between mammary and liver tissues, the insulin binding affinities of these receptors were compared. Estimates of the binding affinity parameters were performed at both 4 C and 37 C. At both temperatures the equilibrium binding constants for mammary and liver tissues were not significantly different suggesting that structural variations of the mammary insulin receptor had no effect on the insulin binding affinity under the ++conditions described in this study. Comparison of the 4 C and 37 C binding data showed that the mammary insulin receptor exhibited complex, temperature-dependent binding characteristics, similar to those previously described for the liver insulin receptor, and entirely consistent with the presence of a temperature-dependent regulatory protein that affects insulin binding...|$|R
