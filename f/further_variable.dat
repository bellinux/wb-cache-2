The control laws are designed using Lyapunov-like analysis. While the transformed system is discontinuous in open-loop, the resulting closed-loop system becomes continuous. The resulting smooth, time-invariant control laws ensure asymptotic convergence to specified position and orientation. Realtime results obtained on a mobile robot built in our labs is also shown. 1.

30|$|The {{results of}} the {{standard}} neoclassical migration model remain stable if commuting flows, regional human capital endowment, the region's international competitiveness as well as differences in the settlement structure are added as <b>further</b> explanatory <b>variables.</b> The inclusion of the regional net in-commuting rate shows a negative correlation with migration underlying the substitutive nature of the two variables. Also, an increasing level of international competitiveness attracts further in-migration flows. We also find heterogeneity for different types of regional settlement structure proxied by population density and we observe persistent structural differences for the two East–West macro regions (by including individual federal state level fixed effects or a combined East German dummy). Most importantly, the impact of core labor market variables is still of the expected sign when <b>further</b> <b>variables</b> are added. In line with earlier empirical studies, the results thus show that macro regional differences matter, yet there are no qualitative effects on the estimated coefficients that hint to a systematic rejection of the neoclassical migration model.|$|R
