40|$|Before {{addressing}} {{the question of}} lessons of development, we must make clear at the outset {{the sense in which}} the term is used. Economic development, as distinct from mere economic growth, combines: (1) self-sustaining growth; (2) structural change in patterns of production; (3) technological upgrading; (4) social, political and institutional modernization; and (5) <b>widespread</b> <b>improvement</b> in the human condition. Kuznets used “development ” {{in the sense of the}} first three elements; development historians, new institutional development theorists and the neoclassical development economists of the eighties added increasing the sphere in which markets guide economic decisions (institutional modernization) to the Kuznetsian definition of development. Modernization theorists have added social and political development to the list of transformations that development entails while the deficient entrepreneurship school has added socio cultural evolution to the necessary aspects of development. Finally, the deficiencies of the concentrated growth process of the first two decades of economic growth have led those concerned with the welfare of the poor (Mc Namara 1973, Adelman and Morris 1973; Adelman 1973, Streeten and Stewart 1976, Sen 1988 and the UNDP, 1990 onwards) to add <b>widespread</b> <b>improvements</b> in national welfare explicitly to the list of characteristics of economic developmen...|$|R

Further research should test this framework of pedagogical knowledge in different instruction contexts, including different STEM disciplines. Additional research is needed to understand what teacher knowledge is critical to effective active-learning instruction and how the development of this knowledge is best facilitated.

We identify the architectural cause of these conflicts and resolve them in Tng, an experimental next-generation transport services architecture, by factoring congestion control from end-to-end semantic functions. Through a technique we call queue sharing, Tng enables in-path devices to interpose on, split, and optimize congestion controlled flows without affecting or seeing the end-to-end content riding these flows. Simulations show that Tng’s decoupling cleanly addresses several common performance problems, such as communication over lossy wireless links and reduction of buffering-induced latency on residential links. A working prototype and several incremental deployment paths suggest Tng’s practicality...|$|R

30|$|Realizing <b>widespread</b> <b>improvement</b> in the {{preparation}} and diversity of STEM undergraduates requires reforming not just our instruction but also our preparation of undergraduate instructors. Active-learning instructors in this study drew on rich pedagogical knowledge. Instructors {{are not likely to}} gain such knowledge through training in their STEM discipline. Instead, college instructors likely need opportunities for legitimate generative work that helps them develop pedagogical knowledge for active-learning instruction. Future research is needed to better understand how to provide such learning opportunities for college STEM instructors. What is clear is that our current approach to preparing undergraduate instructors is unlikely to be successful in helping them effectively plan and implement active-learning instruction in large courses. This work contributes to the foundational knowledge we need to begin reimagining our philosophies and approaches to training and supporting undergraduate STEM instructors.|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{scientific}} computing, the use of parallelism has led to <b>widespread</b> <b>improvements</b> {{in the performance of}} complex computations. Unfortunately, outside of the domain of computational science, the promise of parallelism has been largely unfulfilled. Workstation and PC networks have become common in most offices, and cluster computing is receiving much attention, but the lack of programming support tools directed towards non-scientific programmers has inhibited the use of parallelism to increase the performance of general purpose applications such as spreadsheets, word processors, compilers, and databases. We have developed a new model of parallel programming for general purpose applications, called composite tree parallelism, which was designed by making a small number of simple alterations to the basic data parallel programming model. Composite tree parallelism allows programmers to write coarse grained tree-based parallel data structures, in a form that retains the power an [...] ...|$|R
