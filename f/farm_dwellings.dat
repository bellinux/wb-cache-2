50|$|In United States {{agricultural}} policy, gross {{farm income}} refers to the monetary and non-monetary income received by farm operators. Its main components include cash receipts {{from the sale of}} farm products, government payments, other farm income (such as income from custom work), value of food and fuel produced and consumed on the same farm, rental value of <b>farm</b> <b>dwellings,</b> and change in value of year-end inventories of crops and livestock.|$|E
40|$|Economic {{research}} in farm housing can be greatly {{facilitated by the}} development of a low-cost method of making reliable annual estimates of farm construction volume and by the accumulation of time series over a period long enough to reveal fluctuations in the type and volume of construction. Methods of estimating residential construction volume in urban areas have been used long enough to yield much useful statistical data, although refinements continue to be made. However, there have been few estimates of <b>farm</b> <b>dwelling</b> construction volume. 2 The greater emphasis on urban housing has probably resulted from the greater volume of urban construction compared with farm construction. Also, statistics may be more easily secured from urban centers where building permits are used and where many large-volume builders can provide data. Geographic decentralization of <b>farm</b> <b>dwelling</b> construction, the general absence of building permits, and the probably small volume of construction per builder have made the collection of farm data expensive...|$|R

50|$|The Penrose Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located at Arlington County, Virginia. It contains 486 contributing buildings, 2 contributing sites, and 2 contributing object in a residential neighborhood in South Arlington. The area was created with the integration of 12 distinct subdivisions platted between 1882 and 1943. The dwelling styles include the late-19th and early-20th-century vernacular, Queen Anne, Italianate, and Colonial Revival <b>farm</b> <b>dwellings.</b> A notable number of these dwellings are prefabricated kit or mail-order houses.|$|E
5000|$|Sinnamon Farm is {{significant}} historically because it illustrates the early phase of rural settlement {{and land use}} which took place along reaches of the Brisbane River and other Queensland waterways from the 1860s to the 1890s, especially the clearing of rainforest for [...] "scrub farms", the ensuing pattern of farming, {{and the growth of}} community life centred on the family, school and church. In particular, the farm survives as illustration of the evolution, association and location within a single family of a small grouping of <b>farm</b> <b>dwellings,</b> outbuildings and associated community buildings.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

5000|$|Machiya (町屋/町家) are {{traditional}} wooden townhouses found throughout Japan and typified {{in the historical}} capital of Kyoto. Machiya (townhouses) and nōka (<b>farm</b> <b>dwellings)</b> constitute the two categories of Japanese vernacular architecture known as minka (folk dwellings). Machiya originated {{as early as the}} Heian period and continued to develop through to the Edo period and even into the Meiji period. Machiya housed urban merchants and craftsmen, a class collectively referred to as chōnin (townspeople). The word machiya is written using two kanji: machi (町) meaning [...] "town", and ya (家 or 屋) meaning [...] "house" [...] (家) or [...] "shop" [...] (屋) depending on the kanji used to express it.|$|E
50|$|Nõva {{studied at}} the Tallinn College of Engineering {{becoming}} the Estonia's first female architecture graduate in 1925. Her first post was with the Settlement Office run by the Estonian Ministry of Agriculture which established new areas for settlement on land owned by the State. The hundreds of farmhouses she designed between 1933 and 1938 were inspired by traditional <b>farm</b> <b>dwellings</b> housing people {{on one side and}} livestock on the other. Her simple, pragmatic designs were also reflected in her farmhouse furniture. The schools in Pillapalu, Koiduküla and Peressaare were also designed by Erika Nõva. After the Second World War, Nõva carried out planning work for municipalities and farming areas, frequently returning to farmhouse design.|$|E
50|$|There {{were nine}} houses {{situated}} between the viaduct and the mill ponds, built {{to house the}} workers constructing the viaduct. They were later demolished for expansion of the reservoirs. On {{the opposite side of}} the river to where Strines Weir once was there were two houses known as Strines Cottages which were <b>farm</b> <b>dwellings.</b> A recent archaeological dig found the foundations of these structures. There was a flour mill situated above Denton Brook not far from Mill Lane. In later years it was used as a school and was known as 'the ark' because of the flowing water visible through the gaps in the floorboards. It appears that there has never been a church in the vale.|$|E
50|$|Howard's Neck Plantation is a {{historic}} plantation house and farm complex located near Pemberton, Goochland County, Virginia. It was built about 1825, and is a two-story, three bay brick structure in the Federal style. The house is similar in style to the works of Robert Mills. It has a shallow deck-on-hip roof and a small, one-story academically proportioned tetrastyle Roman Doric order portico.

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of {{returns to scale}} require that inputs and output are measured without error and that environmental and managerial differences among firms of varying sizes are taken into account. Measurement problems affecting {{estimates of}} returns to scale in agriculture include: (1) combining the <b>farm</b> <b>dwelling</b> with capital inputs, (2) correlation of environmental and management characteristics with size and (3) the effect of off-farm employment on small farm output and production costs. Estimates of long run average total cost curves for farms in the corn belt reveal that after the above factors are taken into account, estimated scale economies in agriculture disappear, while {{there is evidence of}} diseconomies as farm size increases. ...|$|R
5000|$|The village pub is The Jolly Farmer, {{located in}} what was in 1672 part {{of a pair of}} <b>farm</b> <b>dwellings,</b> and {{originally}} registered as a public house in November 1738 by Lazarus Haywood under the name [...] "Jolly Farmers". It was leased to its first tenant Keeper, Samuel Packer (a boot and shoe maker from Ramsgate) in March 1739. During the Second World War the Jolly Farmer was a favourite of pilots stationed at RAF Manston. It was rumoured that many of the pilots signed their names on the ceiling of 'the snug', but this has been painted over and so the rumour is unverifiable.The licensee from 1957 to 1980 was the footballer Bert Turner.|$|E
5000|$|An act of 26 August 1936 that {{amended the}} social {{insurance}} scheme for commerce and industry raised the maximum daily maternity benefit from 18 to 22 francs, while {{an order of}} 13 February 1937 prescribed a special sound signal for road-rail coaches. Improvements were made in unemployment allowances, while an Act of August 1936 increased the rate of pensions and allowances payable to miners and their dependants. In August 1936, regulations extending {{the provisions of the}} Family Allowances Act to agriculture were signed into law. A Decree introduced that same month introduced the inspection of <b>farm</b> <b>dwellings,</b> and at the start of January 1937 an Advisory Committee on Rents was appointed by decree. To promote profit-sharing, an Act of January 1937 (that regulated the working of the State mines, the Alsatian potash mines, and the potash industry), provided that 10% of the net yield of the undertaking “must be set aside, to be used, at least to the extent of one half, to enable the staff to share in the profits of the industry.” ...|$|E
5000|$|One anomaly, which marks {{out these}} villages from others {{in other parts}} of Europe, is that the Rundling villages {{virtually}} never have a church in them. There are churches, even quite ancient ones, but they and their burial grounds are almost always well outside the Rundling itself. This could have come about because the Rundlinge were usually built only just above the water-table, whereas the churches needed higher ground to give enough depth for their burials. It could also be as a result of each village being too small to maintain a church, so the church had to serve several villages. However most researchers believe that it shows that Christianisation came late to the villages, after their basic structure had been created. There are reports by the church authorities of [...] practices well into modern times.It also suggests that, even where it had been possible to add a church to the village circle (even in the middle - why not?), they did not do so. There must have been a sense that it was not appropriate to do so, or there would be examples among the 200+ villages in Wendland, and there are not, even in the villages set on higher ground.Not only are there no churches, there are no schools or communal buildings, no shops and virtually no trade outlets. The villages are made up entirely of <b>farm</b> <b>dwellings.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Conyngham {{family had}} come from Ayrshire in Scotland in about 1611, {{possibly}} from Glengarnock and {{the first of the}} family in Ulster was said to {{have been one of the}} family of the Earls of Glencairn. Alexander Conyngham, Dean of Raphoe, ancestor of the later Marquesses Conyngham, was probably a near relative - his son Sir Albert Conyngham's portrait is at Springhill and not Slane Castle. They were granted lands under James I's Plantation of Ulster in County Armagh. They purchased the Springhill estate in around 1630. It is believed that some form of <b>farm</b> <b>dwelling</b> was constructed on the estate at this time (probably on the site of the present carpark) but this was almost certainly destroyed during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.|$|R
