5|$|Eon again {{turned to}} Richard Maibaum for the script, {{although}} Paul Dehn was later introduced for rewrites. After missing From Russia with Love, Ken Adam returned as production designer. Adam's imagination provided {{the idea of}} gold stacked upon gold behind <b>iron</b> <b>bars</b> for the scenes in the United States Bullion Depository. Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, a [...] <b>iron</b> <b>bar,</b> {{described}} in court as a railway fishplate, was dropped on him. Bulger suffered ten skull fractures {{as a result}} of the <b>iron</b> <b>bar</b> striking his head.

5|$|The deadliest fire in Davenport history came on January 7, 1950, when 41 {{people were}} killed in a fire at the St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a mental ward {{operated}} by Mercy Hospital. Most of the people who lost their lives were female patients trapped behind windows locked shut by rusty, <b>iron</b> <b>bars.</b> The cause was attributed to a patient who was lighting curtains on fire with a cigarette lighter.|$|E
5|$|On the Persian side, Kardarigan {{was also}} eager {{to fight and}} {{confident}} of victory. He arranged to be escorted by many camels carrying water for his troops in case the Byzantines refused to engage but continued to block access to the Arzamon, and had allegedly prepared <b>iron</b> <b>bars</b> and chains for the prisoners he would take. His movements, however, were detected when the Byzantines' Arab foederati captured {{a few of his}} men, allowing Philippicus to prepare his forces. This early warning was of particular importance since Kardarigan intended to attack on Sunday, a day of rest for the Christian Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|The prosperous {{industry}} {{which had}} sprung {{up around the}} new iron industry required vast numbers of largely unskilled workers to mine ironstone {{and work in the}} blast furnace plants. Coatbridge therefore became a popular destination for vast numbers of Irish (especially from County Donegal in Ulster) arriving in Scotland. The <b>iron</b> <b>bars</b> and plates produced in Coatbridge iron works were the raw materials needed throughout the British Empire for railways, construction, bridge building and shipbuilding. One example of uses Coatbridge' iron was put to included armour plating for British ships fighting in the Crimean War.|$|E
5|$|Then, in a {{calculated}} attack, approximately 500 Arsenal fans attacked {{from the main}} road behind the Galatasaray fans. This caused a severe riot in the city square, with several restaurant facilities used by fans to fight each other, with <b>iron</b> <b>bars</b> and knives also being used. This lasted 20 minutes before the Danish police attempted {{to break up the}} melee with dogs and tear gas. The violence, which included fans from other English clubs and Turks living in Denmark, lasted for 45 minutes. There were further clashes at the airport the day after the game.|$|E
5|$|Mineral ores can be mined {{just like}} normal stone and the raw ore can be smelted to produce their {{corresponding}} metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, flux stones {{are used to}} make pig <b>iron</b> <b>bars</b> and smelt it with regular iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal adamantine, found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. Raw adamantine can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese, {{after their}} arrival in Sri Lanka in 1505, began a {{campaign}} of forced conversion and destruction of many Buddhist and Hindu temples around the island. They destroyed the Munneswaram temple completely in 1578 CE {{with the exception of}} the basement, and used the core of the building as a Roman Catholic chapel. Jesuits recorded that they used <b>iron</b> <b>bars</b> to destroy the presiding deity. According to a 1640 Portuguese records, they were able to convert 500 people from the village of Munneswaram as Roman Catholics. However, the locals and temple administrators were able to hide many of the idols of the temple complex before the destruction.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{reformer}} John Howard travelled {{around the}} country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of the Prisons in England and Wales (1777). In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to the floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and <b>iron</b> <b>bars</b> over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with a small window. The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Although the casemates {{have been}} altered over the years, {{many of their}} {{original}} features survive. None of the guns remain in situ but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place. The casemates {{were divided into two}} sections. During periods of high alert the gun crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates' rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with <b>iron</b> <b>bars</b> from which two mantlets made of thick lengths of rope were hung. These protected the gun crew from splinters and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun. These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts {{on either side of the}} emplacements.|$|E

25|$|On July 24, 1976, a lion mauled a 20-year-old park {{employee}} to death. His {{body was found}} 15 to 20 feet from his vehicle, which was protected by <b>iron</b> <b>bars,</b> in {{a section of the}} park's 1000-acre wildlife preserve where about 50 lions lived. The ranger had a history of violating park rules. Investigators believed the ranger left the vehicle to relieve himself.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1970 Christo and Jeanne-Claude {{began their}} {{preparations}} for the Valley Curtain project. A 400-meter-long cloth was to be stretched across Rifle Gap, a valley in the Rocky Mountains near Rifle, Colorado.

At the time of departure he engraved an <b>iron</b> <b>bar</b> in that place as a sign. It is thought that because of engraving <b>iron</b> <b>bar</b> by Shah Shuja the area is called 'Lohagara'.|$|R
25|$|Located {{within the}} King's Bastion and {{adjacent}} to the governor general's residence, Building 10 is the former military prison and presently the museum annex. Constructed in 1842, it is a two-story rectangular stone structure with a hipped roof pierced by three brick chimneys. The west elevation facing the citadel is restrained but decorated by pilasters. Loopholes pierce the walls on both stories. There are several irregularly placed windows with <b>iron</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|E
25|$|Total {{production}} of processed iron in Manchuria reached 1,000,000 tonnes in 1931–32, of which almost half {{was made by}} Shōwa Steel in Anshan.

By 1942, Anshan's Shōwa Steel Works total production capacity reached 3,600,000 tonnes, {{making it one of}} the major iron and steel centers in the world.|$|E
25|$|Spartiates, on {{the other}} hand, were {{forbidden}} (in theory) from engaging in menial labor or trade, although {{there is evidence of}} Spartan sculptors, and Spartans were certainly poets, magistrates, ambassadors, and governors as well as soldiers. Allegedly, Spartans were prohibited from possessing gold and silver coins, and according to legend Spartan currency consisted of <b>iron</b> <b>bars</b> to discourage hoarding. It was not until the 260s or 250s BC that Sparta began to mint its own coins.|$|E

50|$|Stays {{made from}} puddled <b>iron</b> <b>bar</b> {{were used as}} a cheaper {{alternative}} to copper for joining {{the inner and outer}} firebox plates of steam locomotives.

Wrought iron rivets made from <b>iron</b> <b>bar</b> typically contained stringer filaments running the length of the rivet, but filaments at right angles to the tension, particularly beneath the head, caused weakness.|$|R
