5|$|He {{spoke to}} Harold Howitt when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> leaving the BTC and was {{informed}} that Miles Thomas needed an experienced accountant to institute strict financial controls at BOAC. Smallpeice would turn down the role initially, fearing BOAC (also state owned) {{would be similar to}} the BTC in terms of culture and manageability. Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he and Miles Thomas desired he have within the company.|$|E
5|$|Martin and {{the landlady}} at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, {{described}} Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days {{threatening to cut}} her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With {{the money from the}} shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.|$|E

She visits her best friend Kelly Taylor and her half-sister in-law, Silver, as she wants to move back home, and open a store, but David doesn't want to move back, which later causes a separation between the two.

25|$|During {{the same}} years, Daniel Bernoulli {{published}} his book Hydrodynamics (1738), {{in which he}} derived an equation for the pressure of a gas considering the collisions of its atoms with {{the walls of a}} container. He proves that this pressure is two thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas in a unit volume. Bernoulli's ideas, however, made little impact on the dominant caloric culture. Bernoulli made a connection with Gottfried Leibniz's vis viva principle, an early formulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the two theories became intimately entwined throughout their history. Though Benjamin Thompson suggested that heat was a form of motion {{as a result of his}} experiments in 1798, no attempt was made to reconcile theoretical and experimental approaches, and it is unlikely that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the vis viva principle.|$|E
25|$|In May 2002, Unomásuno fired 70 employees, {{including}} {{four of its}} founders: Christa Cowrie, Jorge Reyes Estrada, Fernando Belmont Acero, and Patricia Cardona. Most of them accepted the 33% severance plan the newspaper offered; Editorial Uno {{did not have the}} financial support to pay them what was required by law. The founders and eleven more employees, however, sued Unomásuno and asked for the company to fully pay for their severance plan. The employees wrote a petition stating that they were fired because PRI politician Francisco Labastida Ochoa was not winning the 2000 presidential race. They said that the owners poured {{a lot of money in}} his campaign, including money that was to be used to pay its employees. Alonso Muñoz told the press that Unomásuno was going through financial difficulties and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> selling the newspaper. The newspaper had MXN$85 million in debt and MXN$20 million in assets (totaling a negative net worth of MXN$65 million). Alonso Muñoz said he was considering partnering with Alonso Coratella's Mundo Ejecutivo media group and starting a new era for Unomásuno.|$|E
500|$|By mid March 1859 Darwin's {{abstract}} {{had reached}} the stage where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> early publication; Lyell suggested the publisher John Murray, and met with him to find {{if he would be}} willing to publish. On 28 March Darwin wrote to Lyell asking about progress, and offering to give Murray assurances [...] "that my Book is not more un-orthodox, than the subject makes inevitable." [...] He enclosed a draft title sheet proposing An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection, with the year shown as [...] "1859".|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} season, Cal Ripken, Sr., replaced Weaver {{as manager}} of the Orioles. Baltimore signed Rick Burleson to play second base and Ray Knight to play third base. The moves seemed to leave Wiggins battling for an outfield spot, but after he hit [...]413 during spring training, Ripken made comments that suggested <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> using Wiggins as a utility player. Just before the season started, Wiggins was not happy with Ripken's idea of using him in a utility role, feeling that his spring performance should have secured him a starting position. He believed {{that he could be}} an asset in the leadoff batting slot.|$|E
500|$|While {{composing}} the song's lyrics, Martin {{could not}} find the right words. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and saw Stephanie, a friend who happened to be present in the studio at that time. Martin later titled the song [...] "Yellow" [...] as a reference to Stephanie's yellow glow. The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line [...] "Look at the stars". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Watson left the P-I after he {{believed}} he was treated unfairly by a new editor, although he still contributed to the paper as a freelancer. Watson's criticisms of then Mariners owner George Argyros {{eventually led to the}} P-I reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, [...] "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> cutting me back to one column a week. I said maybe we should make it zero columns a week." [...] On October 30, 1983, after a hiatus of more than three decades, Watson's column appeared once again in The Seattle Times.|$|E

500|$|The rookie Chamberlain then shocked Warriors' fans {{by saying}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> retiring. He {{was tired of}} being double- and triple-teamed, and of teams coming down on him with hard fouls. Chamberlain feared he might lose his cool one day. Celtics forward Heinsohn said: [...] "Half the fouls against him were hard fouls ... he took the most brutal {{pounding}} of any player ever". In addition, Chamberlain {{was seen as a}} freak of nature, jeered at by the fans and scorned by the media. As Chamberlain often said, quoting coach Alex Hannum's explanation of his situation, [...] "Nobody loves Goliath." [...] Eddie Gottlieb coaxed Chamberlain back into the NBA, sweetening his return with a salary raise to $65,000 (equal to about $ today).|$|E
500|$|Also that November, Schindler was {{introduced}} to Itzhak Stern, an accountant for Schindler's fellow Abwehr agent Josef [...] "Sepp" [...] Aue, who had taken over Stern's formerly Jewish-owned place of employment as a Treuhander (trustee). Property belonging to Polish Jews, including their possessions, places of business, and homes were seized by the Germans beginning immediately after the invasion, and Jewish citizens were stripped of their civil rights. Schindler showed Stern the balance sheet of a company <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> acquiring, an enamelware factory called Rekord Ltd owned by a consortium of Jewish businessmen that had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year. Stern advised him that rather than running the company as a trusteeship {{under the auspices of}} the Haupttreuhandstelle Ost (Main Trustee Office for the East), he should buy or lease the business, as that would give him more freedom from the dictates of the Nazis, including the freedom to hire more Jews.|$|E
500|$|NCL first {{announced}} a new Castlevania for the DS on October 5, 2005.

On May 9, 2006, the official trailer was shown at Konami's official press conference. [...] The trailer showcased the smooth player switching and combinations of Jonathan and Charlotte's abilities. [...] In an interview with producer Koji Igarashi in June 2006, it was revealed the game would try to utilize the touch screen better than Dawn of Sorrow. [...] He also mentioned <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> incorporating cooperative game play in an unlockable stage via WiFi. [...] More information concerning online game play were released a month later at Comic-Con 2006, but details on {{how it would be}} implemented were still unconfirmed.

500|$|Writer Steven Moffat came up {{with the}} concept for [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the worst {{possible}} situations to be in with the Weeping Angels and thought of the inability to see. His first idea was blindness, though this developed into the situation that Amy ends up in. Moffat designed the two-part story to be a more action-oriented sequel to [...] "Blink", an episode he wrote for the third series that introduced the Weeping Angels. He was inspired by the relationship between the film Alien and its sequel, Aliens, which he referred to as [...] "the best conceived movie sequel ever", describing it as being more [...] "highly coloured" [...] as opposed to Alien more low-key tone. He also intended for the Angels to have a plan that could become [...] "almost like a war", in contrast to the way they were struggling to survive in [...] "Blink". The title [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] was suggested by Moffat's son.|$|E
500|$|Another {{difficult}} problem facing translators {{is how to}} deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which results in phrasing that is difficult to translate precisely. One such instance is found in the first sentence of [...] "The Metamorphosis". English translators often render the word [...] as [...] "insect"; in Middle German, however, [...] literally means [...] "an animal unclean for sacrifice"; in today's German it means vermin. [...] It is sometimes used colloquially to mean [...] "bug"—a very general term, unlike the scientific [...] "insect". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation. Another example is Kafka's use of the German noun [...] in the final sentence of [...] "Das Urteil". Literally, [...] means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: [...] "At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge". The double meaning of Verkehr is given added weight by Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> [...] "a violent ejaculation".|$|E
500|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has identified}} the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan as major {{influences on the}} cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly concerning the geographic location of the southern Besaid and Kilika islands. He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past Final Fantasy games {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Kitase felt that if the setting went back to a medieval European fantasy, it would not seem to help the development team advance. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> different world environments, Nojima suggested a fantasy world that incorporated Asian elements. Sub-character chief designer Fumi Nakashima's focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles, so that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub-groups. For example, she has said that the masks and goggles of the Al Bhed give the group a [...] "strange and eccentric" [...] appearance, while the attire of the Ronso lend to them being able to easily engage in battle. Tidus' relationship with his father Jecht was based [...] "stories throughout the ages, such as the ancient Greek legends." [...] This would eventually reveal the key of Sin's weakness and eventual defeat.|$|E
