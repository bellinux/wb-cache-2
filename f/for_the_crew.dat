5|$|In November 2016, {{trustees}} of below-the-line Hollywood unions {{filed a lawsuit}} against Lee and two of his production companies claiming Lee had failed to pay $45,000 in pension and other health contributions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kasuga {{arrived in}} Portland, Maine on 3 July 1920 for the centennial {{celebrations}} of the State of Maine {{and then made}} port visits in New York City and Annapolis, Maryland. In August 1920 Kasuga visited the city of Cristobal in the Republic of Panama, after transiting the Panama Canal, from 22–25 August 1920, with an official reception <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> before heading to San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|The ship's {{steering}} was by a contrabalanced rudder (black, at {{left in the}} picture), {{with its}} associated steering gear located in a compartment (green in the picture) above the rudder and below the aft structure. Steam-powered generators provided electric power for radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration compressors, pumps, lighting, and degaussing. An evaporator produced fresh water for the boilers and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} with three bench seats, {{one for the}} driver and his assistant, and two others <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b> The rear cargo area contained storage compartments, {{one on each side}} and two in the rear. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted above the rear storage compartments. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish sites as they were known, two of them on Chat Moss. RAF Balloon Command {{was responsible for the}} administration and manning of the sites, which were fully operational by 23January 1941. Each consisted of an air raid shelter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crews</b> took {{inspiration}} from Britney Spears' music videos {{to create their}} routines. Andre Fuentes, Spears' choreographer, assigned additional challenges <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> to complete.|$|R

50|$|The {{mountain}} was {{so named}} {{due to its}} being a designated rendezvous point <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of <b>the</b> Minnesota Geological Survey.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{collectible}} {{items that are}} flown on shuttle missions, such as mission patches, flags, and other personal items <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> were an official Harlem Globetrotters basketball and a basketball that Edwin Hubble used in 1909 when he played for the University of Chicago. After being returned to Earth, the Harlem Globetrotters basketball would {{be placed in the}} Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and Hubble's ball would be returned to the University of Chicago. Michael Massimino flew a 1964 reprint of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius from the library of his alma mater, MIT.|$|E
5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe. The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1760s, Westgate {{consisted}} {{of only a}} farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited {{its name from the}} Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide.|$|E
50|$|In {{the upper}} church there are {{numerous}} memorial plaques <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of <b>the</b> sunken Soviet submarines, including K-278 Komsomolets. <b>The</b> <b>crew</b> of <b>the</b> submarine K-141 Kursk has also been commemorated there.|$|R

5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screws, Bismarck was almost impossible to steer.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Subspecies {{became the}} first American film to be filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Director Ted Nicolaou was {{initially}} apprehensive about shooting on location in Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came to love the location thanks to the free rein he had over the ancient ruins and woodland area. Other Transylvanian areas {{would be used for}} all Subspecies films, with specific location shootings at Hunedoara, Brașov, and Sinaia. Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along with cultural differences and the general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult experience <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> while shooting the first Subspecies film.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{campaigns for}} her staff's {{right to get}} flu shots from Dr. Leo Spaceman (Parnell), but Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) will not allow it due to a limited supply. Meanwhile, Jack tries to think of {{creative}} ways {{to spend time with}} his girlfriend, Elisa (Hayek), as she works seven days a week. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) try to do something nice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 18 May 1821 Revolutionnaire {{captured}} two piratical gun-boats, with bounty money <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> {{being paid}} in 1834. Pellew remained in command until 1822.|$|R
50|$|Bastions also cover {{a larger}} area than most towers. This allows more cannons to be mounted and {{provided}} enough space <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> to operate them.|$|R
50|$|Beyoncé {{stopped by}} to hand out <b>the</b> {{challenges}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews,</b> who had to use her music videos and tour performances as inspiration for their routines.|$|R
5|$|In their spare time, {{crews were}} able {{to catch up with}} work, observe the Earth below, respond to letters, {{drawings}} and other items brought from Earth (and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard Mir), or make use of the station's ham radio. Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> to read and watch.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April 1944 a Liberator {{aircraft}} {{from the}} 392nd USAAF bombing group Based in East Anglia near Wendling, Norfolk, crashed off the beach, {{adjacent to the}} Westgate Pavilion, with five of the crew killed and four injured in the crash. A special memorial service was held <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> by the Mayor of Margate and veterans organisations on 27 April 2009 at the war memorial overlooking the crash site.|$|E
5|$|Petersen {{has claimed}} in an {{interview}} that one of the film's scenes forced the crew to adopt a guerrilla filmmaking approach. The scene in which Petersen's character Will Graham falls asleep while studying crime scene photographs during a flight required the use of an airplane during shooting. Michael Mann had been unable to gain permission to use a plane for the scene and booked tickets <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> on a flight from Chicago to Florida. Once on board, the crew used their equipment, checked in as hand luggage, to shoot the scene quickly, while keeping the plane's passengers and crew mollified with Manhunter crew jackets.|$|E
50|$|The MVS's {{national}} {{training vessel}} East Sussex 1 sailed to Weymouth {{to act as}} a floating hotel and control centre <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of <b>the</b> other craft.|$|R

5|$|Roshan {{attended}} Sydenham College, {{where he}} took part in dance and music festivals while studying, graduating in commerce. Roshan assisted his father on four films—Khudgarz (1987), King Uncle (1993), Karan Arjun (1995) and Koyla (1997)—while also sweeping the floor and making tea <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew.</b> After pack-up, Roshan would enact Shah Rukh Khan's scenes from Koyla and film himself to make a judgement about his performance as an actor. While he assisted his father, he studied acting under Kishore Namit Kapoor.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 {{was first}} {{assigned}} to Discovery with a launch date no earlier than May 2008. This originally moved the mission ahead of STS-119, ISS Assembly flight 15. Delays to several shuttle missions {{resulted in a}} change in mission ordering, and the orbiter was changed to Atlantis on 8 January 2007. The crew of Atlantis went to the Kennedy Space Center <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crew</b> Equipment Interface Test in early July 2008. This allowed the STS-125 crew to get familiar with the orbiter and the hardware they would be using during the flight.|$|E
5|$|Several planned filming {{locations}} {{were abandoned}} due to budget constraints. For thematic reasons, the film's penultimate fight scene between JTRO and L Dubba E was originally set at Dawn's Liquor Marta key {{location in the}} film. The store's owners refused permission for filming and the location was changed to a long-abandoned gas station. Bryan Goddard, who portrays Sugga Nigga, acquired permission <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> to film on the property.|$|E
50|$|The port {{was well}} known to American whaleships of the 19th century. They often put in for fresh water, food, and various forms of {{entertainment}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews.</b>|$|R
50|$|At first Camp Bradford was a {{training}} base for Navy Seabees, but in 1943 it was changed into {{a training}} center <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> of LSTs (Landing Ship Tank).|$|R
50|$|Trials <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> {{were held}} in December 2011. Cambridge's trial boats raced along the Adelaide Straight in Ely and were named Big Fish, Little Fish and Cardboard Box.|$|R
