40|$|A {{randomized}} controlled trial of N-acetylcysteine to prevent contrast nephropathy in <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography.</b> BackgroundContrast nephropathy (CN) {{is a common}} cause of renal dysfunction after <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography.</b> Recently, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) {{has been found to}} reduce the risk of CN after CT imaging with contrast enhancement. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of NAC for the prevention of CN in the setting of <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography.</b> MethodsEligible patients were those undergoing <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> with serum creatinine> 1. 7 mg/dL. Patients were randomized to one of two groups: Group 1, IV hydration and NAC, 1200 mg one hour before angiography, and a second dose 3 hours after; Group 2, IV hydration and placebo. CN was defined as an increase of 0. 5 mg/dL in serum creatinine. ResultsSeventy-nine patients completed the study. There were no significant differences between the groups in baseline characteristics, duration of angiography, mean volume of dye infused or mean IV hydration. Contrast nephropathy developed in 24. 0 % of subjects, 26. 3 % NAC, and 22. 0 % placebo (P = NS). Among subjects with diabetes mellitus, there was no significant difference in the rate of CN between the groups (42. 1 % NAC, 27. 8 % placebo; P = 0. 09).

40|$|Introduction. Transient global amnesia (TGA) {{following}} angiography is rare, and {{the pathogenesis}} {{has not been}} illustrated clearly till now. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore the pathogenesis of TGA following angiography by analyzing our data and reviewing the literature. Methods. We retrospectively studied 20836 cases with angiography in our hospital between 2007 and 2015 and found 9 cases with TGA following angiography. The data of these 9 cases were analyzed. Results. We found all 9 cases with TGA following neural angiography (5 in 4360) or <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> (4 in 8817) and no case with TGA following peripheral angiography (0 in 7659). Statistical difference was found when comparing the neural and <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> group with peripheral group (p= 0. 022). Two cases with TGA were confirmed with small acute infarctions in hippocampus after angiography. This might be related to the microemboli which were rushed into vertebral artery following blood flow during neural <b>angiography</b> or <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography.</b> There was no statistical difference when comparing the different approaches for angiography (p= 0. 82) and different contrast agents (p= 0. 619).

40|$|Background: Role of Radiology Department has {{significantly}} {{changed over the}} years, from diagnostics; the journey has now added many interventional procedures, which are carried out in guidance of CT, Ultrasound and Fluoroscopy. Despite such significant advancement, {{it has been observed}} that general perception of word angiography is associated with <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography.</b> This study assessed the level of knowledge of student nurses regarding the angiographic procedure carried out in Radiology department. The nursing students during their learning period are rotated in Radiology department as well as come across patients in ward who require angiography. This audit will reveal the level of knowledge they have regarding this procedure ad access the level of awareness they have for the pre and post procedure preparations. Methods: radiology department staff in collaboration with school of Nursing, Aga khan university Hospital, conducted this survey. A simple survey form was circulated amongst Student Nurses. The forms were collected over a period of Two weeks. Data was summarized and results were evaluated. Results: A total of 100 forms were received. Survey revealed that 99 % knew about angiography however only 67 % were aware of non-cardiac angiography. 91 % responded positively about the awareness of location where as non <b>cardiac</b> and <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> were performed but on specific inquiry regarding the location only 7 were definite about all types of <b>angiographies</b> including <b>cardiac,</b> non cardiac (Radiology) and fluorescein angiography (eye). 45 knew about <b>cardiac</b> and radiological <b>angiographies</b> and 44 only knew about <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiographies.</b> With respect to indications, 47 had reasonable information and 38 had inadequate information. 55 % knew about the preparation for angiography whereas 45 % were not well aware of it. 91 % were aware of post angiography procedure whereas 9 % were not aware of them Conclusions: The results were indicative that generally, student nurses are not much aware of non-cardiac angiographies and procedure performed however, because of extensive dealing with cardiac angiographic patients the pre and post procedure care of patients is generally satisfactory.

Two hundred patients undergoing elective diagnostic <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> were randomized to iodixanol (n = 101) or iohexol (n = 99). There {{were no differences}} noted between the 2 agents in the mean changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate during or immediately after any angiography. However, significantly more patients had a decrease in diastolic Mood pressure of > 20 mm Hg during left coronary angiography with iodixanol. The only significant differences in any electrophysiologic parameter were slightly more PR prolongation during left coronary angiography with iodixanol and more ST-segment depression with iohexol during coronary angiography. Neither was clinically significant. Injection-associated discomfort occurred with both agents, but more patients experienced moderate to severe discomfort with iohexol (52 %) than with iodixanol (17 %) (p < 0. 001). Only 1 potentially serious adverse event, ventricular fibrillation with iohexol, was considered related to contrast, {{and there were no}} differences noted between the agents. Overall, angiographic quality was equal with all angiograms being assessed as good or excellent in both groups (p = 0. 885). In this low-risk population undergoing <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography,</b> iodixanol is safe and effective without clinically important differences from iohexol.

40|$|The hemodynamic and {{electrophysiologic}} alterations {{induced by}} ionic contrast agents during <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> are well described. Recently nonionic contrast agents have become available for <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography.</b> To evaluate {{the safety of}} these new agents, a doubleblind randomized study was performed comparing a new nonionic agent (iopamidol) with a commonly used ionic contrast agent (Renografin- 76). Eighty-one patients undergoing left ventriculography and coronary angiography were included; 41 received iopamidol and 40 received sodium meglumine diatrizoate (Renografin- 76). After left ventriculography, there was {{a decrease in the}} arterial pressure with both contrast agents. However, the severity and the duration of hypotension were both significantly greater with Renografin- 76 compared with the new nonionic agent (p < 0. 001). After selective injections of the coronary arteries, electrocardiographic analysis demonstrated that the increase in the QT interval (p < 0. 0002) and the changes in both the ST segment and T wave amplitude (p < 0. 001) were significantly greater in the Renografin- 76 group compared with the iopamidol group. During coronary angiography, S of the 40 patients receiving Renografin- 76 required temporary pacing for sinus pauses of 2. 5 seconds or more, and 2 of the 40 also developed ventricular fibrillation. None of the 41 patients receiving iopamidol had these complications. This report demonstrates that the electrocardiographic changes, the severity and duration of hypotension and the incidence of serious arrhythmias are significantly greater with Renografin- 76 than with iopamidol.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the renal effects of <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> performed with three low-osmolar contrast media (CM) : iopromide (IPR), ioversol (IVR) and ioxaglate (IOX). IPR and IVR are non-ionic CM, IOX is an ionic CM. Different parameters of renal function were determined before and 6, 24, 48, 72 hrs after angiography in 45 patients: 15 patients were examined with IPR, 15 with IVR and 15 with IOX. Glomerular effects - Plasma creatinine increased slightly at the 24 th hour after IVR and IOX and at 48 hours after IOP. A significant increase in plasma beta 2 -microglobulin was observed, at the same time, only after IOX. A significant decrease in creatinine clearance was found at 6 hours after IOX. No significant variations in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and in effective renal plasma flow were found at 48 hours after cardiac angiography; while filtration fraction was significantly reduced after IOP and IOX. Tubular effects - A marked decrease in sodium clearance and a relevant increase of urinary activities of different tubular enzymes were found after <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> with all CM, but were more evident after the ionic CM IOX, than after the two non-ionic. agents. These tubular effects reached the maximum between 6 and 24 hours and returned to baseline within 72 hrs after <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography.</b> In conclusion, slight glomerular effects were observed mainly after IOX. A reversible tubular malfunction was found with the three low-osmolar CM and was more evident after ionic CM IOX, thus suggesting that other mechanisms, besides osmolarity, play a role in tubular toxicity due to CM. In no patient did the glomerular and tubular effects of CM have a clinical relevance...|$|R

Baseline clinical and angiographic variables {{were similar in}} the iopamidol (n = 155) and diatrizoate (n = 152) groups. Change in renal function after angiography was less pronounced with iopamidol compared with diatrizoate as measured by mean (Â± SD) increase in 24 h serum creatinine (0. 11 Â± 0. 2 versus 0. 22 Â± 0. 26 mg/dl, p 0. 5 mg/dl (8 % versus 19 %, p < 0. 0 l).

40|$|ObjectiveOur {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} effect of the timing of <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography,</b> contrast media dose, and preoperative renal function on the prevalence of acute renal failure after cardiac surgery. MethodsData on 395 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting were prospectively collected. Creatinine clearance was estimated by the Cockcroftâ€“Gault equation. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the time between <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> and surgery (group A, â‰¤ 1 day; group B, > 1 day and â‰¤ 5 days; group C, > 5 days). Patients who underwent a salvage operation or were receiving dialysis before surgery were excluded. Acute renal failure was defined as 25 % decrease from baseline of estimated creatinine clearance and estimated creatinine clearance of 60 mL/min or less on postoperative day 3. Owing to differences in preoperative characteristics between groups, propensity score analysis was used to adjust those differences. ResultsAcute renal failure developed in 13. 6 % of patients. Hospital mortality was 3. 3 % and was higher in patients in whom acute renal failure developed (22 %) versus those in whom it did not (0. 3 %; P 1. 4 mL/kg) predicted acute renal failure if surgery was performed up to 5 days after angiography.

Major events were defined as life threatening or requiring a procedure to treat, or both. Costs of the catheterization procedure, pharmacy, hospital laboratory and treatment of adverse events were determined {{on the basis of}} actual resource use. A total of 20 patients (8. 5 %) had major and 143 (61 %) had minor adverse events with diatrizoate use; 10 patients (4. 8 %) had major and 53 (25 %) had minor adverse events with iopamidol (p = 0. 12 for major events; p < 0. 0001 for total events). Most adverse events were treated fairly easily and inexpensively. The median overall cost was $ 186 higher for patients after iopamidol use compared with diatrizoate (p < 0. 0001), but all costs except the cost of the contrast agent were not significantly different between the two groups. Thus, patients who received iopamidol for <b>cardiac</b> <b>angiography</b> had a significantly lower rate of adverse events than those who received diatrizoate, but this difference was achieved at a considerably high overall cost...|$|R
