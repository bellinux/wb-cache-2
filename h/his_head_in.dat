5|$|After that, Finlay faced Rey Mysterio. Both men {{performed}} many offensive maneuvers {{through the}} match, but Mysterio gained the advantage when he kicked Finlay as he {{hung from the}} ropes, followed by a Leg drop, sending Finlay to ringside area and striking <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> result of an injury, Finlay was stretchered out of the ring, and Mysterio followed. Finlay, however, got up and attacked Mysterio, ending the match in a no contest.|$|E
5|$|Father Sébastien Rale {{was widely}} {{suspected}} of inciting the Norridgewock tribe against the New Englanders, and Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley {{put a price}} on <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> the winter of 1705, 275 British soldiers under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton were dispatched to seize Rale and sack the village. The priest was warned in time, however, and escaped into the woods with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E

5|$|In the 1685 Monmouth Rebellion, {{the rebel}} James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth was proclaimed King on the Cornhill in Bridgwater {{and in other}} local towns. He {{eventually}} led his troops on a night-time attack on the King's position near Westonzoyland. Surprise was lost when a musket was accidentally discharged, and the Battle of Sedgemoor resulted in defeat for the Duke. He later lost <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the Tower of London, and nine locals were executed for treason.|$|E
5|$|Of {{greatest}} {{interest is}} the fourth composition of historical figures, {{a young man and}} a woman, which was painted on the lowest west wall of the narthex and includes inscriptions in Old Church Slavonic. The figures are painted facing the viewer. The man's red clothing is covered in pearls and double-headed eagles, and he wears an archaic-looking despot's crown on <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> his right hand, the man holds a sceptre with a cross. He extends his hand to a woman, clad in a despotissa's attire and wearing a fitting crown.|$|E
5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and sits on a white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{action of the}} race {{occurred}} as the riders approached the first ascent of the Mur de Huy. Dan Martin, one of the favourites for the race, touched wheels with Tiago Machado (Katusha) and both riders crashed. Martin returned to his bike and chased back to the peloton {{with the help of}} several teammates, but later withdrew. He had hit <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the crash and wished to recover ahead of the Liège–Bastogne–Liège the following weekend. Several other riders were caught up or delayed, including Chris Froome. At the top of the first ascent of the Mur, the breakaway's lead had been cut to under six minutes.|$|E
5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> his hands.|$|E
5|$|Dynamite Headdy is an action-platform game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} Headdy, a puppet with a detachable head. The story follows Headdy in his adventures to save his world from the evil puppet King Dark Demon, who is transforming all the puppets of the world into his evil minions. To succeed, Headdy must overcome the King's army, which features the likes of Trouble Bruin and the key masters which serve as stage bosses. Headdy can jump and throw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> any direction to attack enemies. His head {{can also be used}} to grab hooks and pull himself up to other platforms. Headdy's health is represented by a spotlight in the corner of the screen which changes colors. If the player does not pick up restorative items to heal themselves after suffering damage from enemies, they will lose a life.|$|E

5|$|In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–1994), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish descent. She had {{run away}} from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed {{together}} ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, {{and in the second}} half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.|$|E
5|$|In the second, the Soviets {{started with}} a quick goal by Shadrin after 21 seconds. The last ten minutes saw two goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh of the series {{followed}} by Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods. White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of few moments for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. The other was a goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> disbelief.|$|E
5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E

60|$|And she clasped <b>his</b> <b>head</b> tenderly <b>in</b> {{her arms}} and pressed it closely to her {{throbbing}} breast.|$|R

5|$|McKnight {{was born}} in Cranbury Township in the colonial Province of New Jersey in 1750. His only sibling was his younger brother, Richard. His father, also named Charles McKnight, emigrated to the colonies from Ireland {{sometime}} around 1740 and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1742. He became a minister of some note, {{and was one of}} the founders and trustees of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Reverend McKnight opposed British governance in Colonial America and was a loud voice for opposition and overthrow of the British government in New Jersey. According to Martha J. Lamb, Reverend McKnight received a severe saber cut to <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the slashing melee that mortally wounded General Hugh Mercer at the Battle of Princeton. His church at Middletown Point was burned in 1777 and Reverend McKnight was arrested. While in custody aboard the British prison ship HMS Jersey in New York City, Rev. McKnight's health rapidly failed, and he was released shortly before his death on January 1, 1778.|$|E
5|$|O'Hara {{played the}} love {{interest}} of Henry Fonda in the 1943 war picture Immortal Sergeant. O'Hara noted that Fonda was studying for his service entry exams {{at the time}} and had <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> books between takes, and that 20th Century Fox publicized one of the last love scenes between them in the film as Fonda's last screen kiss before entering the war. She next portrayed a European school teacher opposite George Sanders and Charles Laughton, in their last film together, in Jean Renoir's This Land Is Mine for RKO. At the end of a court case in the film, during a hearty speech by Laughton, O'Hara is shown teary-eyed on screen for a prolonged period. Malone thought her performance was effective, both crying and smiling, though considered Renoir to have overdone the film and confusing the audience as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{story to}} feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also {{appears in the}} late 12th-century Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century Perlesvaus, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing {{to come to the}} same place in a year to put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.|$|E
