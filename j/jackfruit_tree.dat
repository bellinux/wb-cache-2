40|$|The {{localization}} of starch, lipid and protein, nuclei in the phloem and xylem {{cells of}} stem of <b>Jackfruit</b> <b>trees</b> (Artocarpus heterophyllus) has been studied. The optical digital images of anatomical features and localization of nuclei and reserve materials {{were obtained by}} light microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Starch granules in the ray parenchyma cells were more abundant in the outer xylem close to the cambium than in the inner xylem and phloem. Radial localization of starch granules provided more clear data than transverse and tangential observations. Lipid and protein appeared as droplets and were uniformly distributed in the outer xylem. The parenchyma cells of phloem have large amount of lipid bodies but those were almost absent in cambium and xylem ray parenchyma cells. The results on the localization of storage starch, lipid droplets and proteins in phloem, cambium and xylem cells indicating that reserve materials might be important for wood formation in <b>jackfruit</b> <b>trees.</b> This data would be helpful for further study in tree breeding program and clarification of the mechanism of utilization of such reserve materials and their distribution pattern within the cells...|$|R

2500|$|Once back home, Chandra {{forgot about}} {{his promise to}} Krishna. One day Krishna {{appeared}} in the garb of a boy before a woman at Kaina, {{and asked her to}} give Him food. He told her about the commitment made to Him by King Chandra. The boy then disappeared. When this incident was conveyed to the King, he realized his lapse and immediately came to Kaina to find the <b>jackfruit</b> <b>tree</b> to make the images of Krishna.

50|$|In Brazil, the {{jackfruit}} {{can become}} an invasive species as in Brazil's Tijuca Forest National Park in Rio de Janeiro. The Tijuca is mostly an artificial secondary forest, whose planting began during the mid-19th century; <b>jackfruit</b> <b>trees</b> {{have been a part}} of the park's flora since its founding. Recently, the species has expanded excessively, and its fruits, which naturally fall to the ground and open, are eagerly eaten by small mammals, such as the common marmoset and coati. The seeds are dispersed by these animals; this allows the jackfruit to compete for space with native tree species. Additionally, as the marmoset and coati also prey opportunistically on birds' eggs and nestlings, the supply of jackfruit as a ready source of food has allowed them to expand their populations, to the detriment of the local bird populations. Between 2002 and 2007, 55,662 jackfruit saplings were destroyed in the Tijuca Forest area in a deliberate culling effort by the park's management.|$|R

The selected characteristics were age, level of education, jackfruit land size, number of <b>jackfruit</b> <b>trees,</b> annual income from jackfruit, experience in jackfruit cultivation, knowledge on jackfruit cultivation and problem faced by the farmers. Data were gathered from 120 jackfruit farmers of six villages such as Kachina and Honpara of Bhaluka Upazilla, Donua and Nagar Haowla of Sreepur Upazilla and Naoghata and Sristighar of Shibpur Upazilla under Mymensing, Gazipur and Narsingdi districts respectively by using a structured interview schedule.
