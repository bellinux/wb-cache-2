She presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She had splenomegaly and extrahepatic hepatic portal hypertension. Angiography confirmed a giant splenic artery aneurysm measuring 8 × 10 [*]centimeters, located in middle and distal two-thirds of the splenic artery.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of a {{geriatric}} male with giant ascending aortic aneurysm (AAA) who underwent successful coronary angiography using telescoping technique for evaluation his coronary arteries before surgery for AAA. Since the ascending aorta and root were extremely dilated, we knew {{it would not have been}} possible to engage the coronaries using regular catheters and standard technique. Hence, telescopic technique was used. Amplatz left 3 (AL 3) 7 F (French) guide catheter (90 cm) was initially used, and nonselective injection of contrast was done to see the coronary ostium. After that, a 5 F multipurpose catheter (110 cm) was telescoped through 7 F AL 3 guide catheter to engage the ostium of the left main coronary artery. Using this technique, images of coronaries were obtained, and it showed minimal luminal irregularities in major epicardial coronary arteries.
