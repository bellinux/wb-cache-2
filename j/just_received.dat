5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, having <b>just</b> <b>received</b> replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{entered the}} University of Munich in April 1926, where Sommerfeld took him on {{as a student}} on Meissner's recommendation. Sommerfeld taught an {{advanced}} course on differential equations in physics, which Bethe enjoyed. Because {{he was such a}} renowned scholar, Sommerfeld frequently received advance copies of scientific papers, which he put up for discussion at weekly evening seminars. When Bethe arrived, Sommerfeld had <b>just</b> <b>received</b> Erwin Schrödinger's papers on wave mechanics.|$|E
30|$|The {{model of}} {{collective}} awareness is designed {{in a way}} that it facilitates agents to keep their role intact. It means that a social agent remains attentive and responsible to share the information in its proximity.

Bond suspects that the Resident Director of the KGB in London will attend the auction and underbid for the item, in order to drive the price up to the value needed to pay Maria for her services. Bond attends the auction, spots the man, and leaves to make arrangements for his expulsion from London as persona non grata.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, Sands {{had become}} {{impatient}} with the Navy's bureaucracy. After discussing the situation with Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{at the office of}} Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to Los Alamos Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had <b>just</b> <b>received</b> a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to Los Alamos. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to the library to read Robert Serber's Los Alamos Primer, which introduced him to the basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were known at the time, and their implications for nuclear weapon design.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had <b>just</b> <b>received</b> a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E

25|$|Three {{days after}} the battle, General Lambert held a council of war where, despite <b>just</b> <b>receiving</b> {{the news that the}} battery on {{the west bank of the}} river had been captured, it was {{concluded}} that despite his request for reinforcements as well as a siege train, capturing New Orleans and continuing the Louisiana campaign would be too costly and thus agreed with his officers to withdraw.

5000|$|Pariah only: If a {{card that}} is easy to accommodate, such as a black 9 or 10 or a red 2 or 3, is drawn, it should only be used to replace {{a card that}} has a higher point value than it.

25|$|Meanwhile, the Siamese {{leadership}} {{had grown}} desperate. The king and princes {{tried to escape}} the city but were driven back. The king finally offered to become a Burmese tributary but the Burmese, who had <b>just</b> <b>received</b> the king's order to persevere, would not accept anything less than an unconditional surrender. Shortly after, Maha Nawrahta died of illness, and by royal decree was buried with extraordinary honours. Ne Myo Thihapate now {{assumed the role of}} sole commander-in-chief.|$|E
25|$|By November, Bandula {{commanded}} {{a force of}} 30,000 massed outside Yangon. Bandula believed that he could take on a well-armed British force of 10,000 head-on. Although the Burmese were numerically superior, only 15,000 of the 30,000 had muskets. The Burmese cannons fired only balls whereas the British cannons fired exploding shells. Unbeknown to him, the British had <b>just</b> <b>received</b> the first shipment of the newest weapon in war that the Burmese had never seen—Congreve rockets. More ominous for the Burmese, the speedy march through the hilly regions of Rakhine Yoma and Assamese ranges had left their troops exhausted.|$|E
50|$|Stock {{appreciation}} rights (SARs) is {{a method}} for companies to give their management or employees a bonus if the company performs well financially. Such a method is called a 'plan'.

The chapel at Atentse has been burnt down, and the lamas hold the road to Tachien-lu. Pere Bourdonnec (another member of the French Tibet Mission) begs that Pere Maire will take action.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Smith {{took the}} {{initiative}} and on 17 April 1912 he addressed the Senate and proposed a resolution that would grant the Committee on Commerce powers to establish a hearing to investigate the sinking. Smith's resolution passed, and fellow Senator Knute Nelson, chair of the Commerce Committee, appointed Smith as chair of a subcommittee {{to carry out the}} hearings. The following day Smith met with President Taft, who had <b>just</b> <b>received</b> the news that his friend and military advisor Archibald Butt was not on the list of survivors. Taft and Smith arranged additional measures related to the inquiry, including a naval escort for Carpathia to ensure no-one left the ship before it docked.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{reported}} to the group's 61st Fighter Squadron on July 19, 1942, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The unit had <b>just</b> <b>received</b> the first production P-47B Thunderbolts, and, in effect, was flight testing the new fighter as it trained. While the 56th FG was responsible {{for many of the}} modifications that made later variants a successful fighter-bomber, the training resulted in more than forty crashes and 18 fatalities, many of which Johnson blamed on the inadequacy of the small airport at Bridgeport. However, he also asserted that many more lives would have been lost, had not the P-47 proved to have an exceptionally rugged airframe. The P-47 became the first USAAF aircraft to provide an understanding of compressibility and its effects.|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, {{they are}} a {{proprietary}} remedy (as opposed to a simple personal claim) which means that, if the defendant is insolvent, then the claimant can take title to the goods, rather than <b>just</b> <b>receiving</b> an award of damages which may be of little value against a defendant in bankruptcy. However, in some countries tracing may also lead to the award of a personal remedy where for some reason a proprietary remedy is not appropriate (i.e. it would upset pari passu distribution upon insolvency, where {{it would not be}} appropriate to do so).|$|R
