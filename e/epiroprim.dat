40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} <b>epiroprim</b> (Ro 11 - 8958), a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, alone and in combination with dapsone, against Toxoplasma gondii. In vitro, the anti-T. gondii effects of <b>epiroprim</b> and dapsone were observed at nanogram-per-milliliter levels when a 72 -h uracil assay and an infection rate of one parasite per 120 macrophages were used. In combination, these drugs exerted a synergistic effect that, however, was only parasitostatic. In a model of acute infection, mice were infected intraperitoneally with 10 (4) parasites of the RH strain of T. gondii and were treated for 14 days by gavage (therapy divided into two daily dosages), starting 24 h after infection. Used alone, dapsone and <b>epiroprim,</b> each at a dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight per day, protected 10 and 0 % of the mice, respectively. When these drugs were administered simultaneously, a 100 % survival rate was observed. Pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine (4 and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively) protected 100 % of the mice. A 3 -week therapy of chronically infected mice with either <b>epiroprim</b> (50 mg/kg/day), dapsone (50 mg/kg/day), or pyrimethamine (15 mg/kg/day) reduced the numbers of T. gondii cysts and the inflammation in their brains. A combination of <b>epiroprim</b> and dapsone, both at 50 mg/kg/day, further {{reduced the number of}} brain cysts in comparison with the number after the corresponding monotherapies. <b>Epiroprim</b> may have a role in the prophylaxis or therapy of human toxoplasmosis, especially when combined with other drugs active against T. gondii, such as dapsone...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study {{regarding}} isoniazid-epiroprim's association applied to antituberculosis chemotherapy, carried through murine model, initiated into Institut Pasteur of CÃ´te d'Ivoire and worked out at Institut Pasteur of Paris was to evaluate the epiroprim's effect alone and associated with isoniazid on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sixteen mouses (lineage C 57 Bl/ 6) were inoculated by venous way with 10 (5) viable bacillus (strain H 37 Rv) suspended in 500 microliters sterile physiological aqueous solution and were shared out into 4 sets. Fifteen days later the sets have been submitted or not to a daily treatment by gavage during three weeks (<b>epiroprim,</b> isoniazid, isoniazid plus <b>epiroprim).</b> The mouses were euthanasied, spleen and lung were removed from each animal. The titres of determined bacillus into those organs prove that isoniazid and <b>epiroprim</b> associated seem more efficacious than the isoniazid monotherapy for mouses pulmonary tuberculosis. Bacillus obtained are sensitive to isoniazid...|$|E
40|$|In a rat {{model of}} dual infection, we studied such dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors as PS- 15 (25 mg/kg of body weight), <b>epiroprim</b> (100 mg/kg), and {{pyrimethamine}} (3 mg/kg) {{alone or in}} combination with various doses of dapsone (50, 25, or 5 mg/kg) {{for the prevention of}} pneumocystosis and toxoplasmosis. Rats latently infected with Pneumocystis carinii were immunosuppressed by corticosteroids for 7 weeks, and the drugs were administered from the initiation of the corticosteroid treatment. At week 5, the rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with the RH strain of Toxoplasma gondii. Infections were monitored by the counting of P. carinii cysts in lung homogenates and the titration of T. gondii in organs by quantitative culture and an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Fourteen of the 15 untreated rats died after T. gondii challenge, with P. carinii infection in the lungs and T. gondii infection in the lungs, liver, spleen, and brain. Of the three tested DHFR inhibitors, only PS- 15 exhibited anti-P. carinii activity; none prevented toxoplasmosis in 100 % of the rats. After the DHFR inhibitors were combined with dapsone (50 or 25 mg/kg), both pneumocystosis and toxoplasmosis were completely prevented. On the basis of these results, PS- 15 and <b>epiroprim</b> combined with dapsone are candidates for use for the prevention of both pneumocystosis and toxoplasmosis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Epiroprim</b> (EPM; Ro 11 - 8958) {{is a new}} {{selective}} inhibitor of microbial dihydrofolate reductase. EPM displayed excellent activity against staphylococci, enterococci, pneumococci, and streptococci {{which was}} considerably better than that of trimethoprim (TMP). EPM was also active against TMP-resistant strains, although the MICs were still relatively high. Its combination with dapsone (DDS) was synergistic and showed as in vitro activity superior {{to that of the}} TMP combination with sulfamethoxazole (SMZ). The EPM-DDS (ratio, 1 : 19) combination inhibited more than 90 % of all important gram-positive pathogens at a concentration of 2 + 38 micrograms/ml. Only a few highly TMP-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were not inhibited. EPM was also more active than TMP against Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, and Bacteroides spp., but it was less active than TMP against all other gram-negative bacteria tested. Atypical mycobacteria were poorly susceptible to EPM, but the combination with DDS was synergistic and active at concentrations most probably achievable in biological fluids (MICs from 0. 25 +/- 4. 75 to 4 + 76 micrograms/ml). EPM and the EPM-DDS combination were also highly active against experimental staphylococcal infections in a mouse septicemia model. The combination EPM-DDS has previously been shown to exhibit activity in Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma models and, as shown in the present study, also shows good activity against a broad range of bacteria including many strains resistant to TMP and TMP-SMZ...|$|E
40|$|Congenitally immunodeficient and {{immunosuppressed}} normal mice with naturally acquired Pneumocystis carinii infection {{were compared}} {{as models for}} testing anti-P. carinii drugs. Among the immunodeficient mice, mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (scid), which lack B and T cells, had higher levels of P. carinii pneumonia than did microMT mice, which lack K cells. Normal mice administered dexamethasone in the drinking water had more extensive pneumocystosis than mice administered parenteral methylprednisolone or hybridoma cells making a monoclonal antibody to CD 4 cells. The standard anti-P. carinii drugs trimethoprim (TMP) -sulfamethoxazole (SMX), pentamidine, and atovaquone, which work well in rats and humans, worked well in the mice. Clindamycin and primaquine were effective in the scid and microMT mice {{but not in the}} immunosuppressed normal mice. High doses of <b>epiroprim,</b> an analog of TMP, appeared to enhance the activities of low doses of SMX and dapsone, while high doses of TMP did not; however, further studies are needed before definitive conclusions about the actions of these drugs can be drawn. Taken together, the data obtained in this study support the growing body of literature suggesting that the mouse is a valid alternative to the rat as a model for testing anti-P. carinii drugs. Additional differences involving the activities of individual drugs in these models will probably emerge as more experience is gained...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a hybrid method for predicting plasma concentration-time curves in humans by integrating species differ-ences in in vitro intrinsic clearance (CLint) into the Dedrick approach {{based on the}} allometry concept. With prediction of clearance (CL) by allometric scaling, taking in vitro CLint into consideration improved the accuracy and reduced the average fold error from 2. 72 to 1. 99. With the hybrid approach of applying the same concept to the Dedrick approach, the predictability of plasma concentration profiles was compared {{with the results of}} the conventional Dedrick approach and the physiologically based pharmacokinetic model using 15 compounds with widely ranging physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profiles. The hybrid ap-proach showed the highest predictability among the examined methods. For CL and the apparent volume of distribution at the steady state (Vss), the relationship between the exponent of allometric equation and fold error was also evaluated with the hybrid approach. The relationship appeared to be a horseshoe curve. Six compounds with exponents ranging from 0. 7 to 1. 1 for both CL and Vss [antipyrine, caffeine, <b>epiroprim,</b> propafenone, theophylline, and verapamil] displayed higher predictability. Three compounds with an exponent ranging from 0. 7 to 1. 1 for CL showed better predictability for CL, and the other four compounds appeared to display similar relationship between the exponent and predictability for Vss. These findings indicated that the exponent becomes a preliminary index to speculate on predictability. Combination of the hybrid approach and exponent allows us to prospectively draw human plasma concentration-time curves, with the implication of possible prediction accuracy prior to clinical studies...|$|E
