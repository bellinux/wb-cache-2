5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> thinking that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. In the end, I just put the thing away." [...] The series then went on to win BAFTAs for its entire run.|$|E
500|$|Flight {{attendant}} CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband at 09:47:57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked. Marion Britton called her friend, Fred Fiumano, at 09:49:12. Fiumano recalled, [...] "she said, 'We're gonna. They're gonna kill us, you know, We're gonna die.' And I told her, 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take you for a ride, you go to their country, and you come back. You stay there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E

2500|$|May {{spoke about}} this {{incident}} years later, saying, [...] "the first thing I knew I was being fired {{on from the}} rear ... all I could do was try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if I realized it was Richthofen, I would have probably {{passed out on the}} spot. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do".|$|E
2500|$|He said he {{was left}} {{exhausted}} and depressed by his dealings with Kasenetz and Katz. [...] "In the mornings I {{would go into the}} office and start writing and after I had finished one song in a day, which was very high output for me, they'd {{come up to me and}} say: 'Give us another song!' And I'd say 'OK' – because I'm like that. They'd keep up the pressure so that <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> writing. I was there in their offices working like that for six or eight weeks and when I flew home to Manchester I went straight round to see my doctor. I was feeling sick and could not eat. The doctor told me: 'You are totally over-worked.' I don't think I've ever felt so depressed as I did when I came back from New York." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{memorandum}} sent to Berlin demanding {{the removal of}} German ambassador Paul Wolff Metternich because he interceded {{on behalf of the}} Armenians, Talaat reaffirmed such a commitment: [...] "the work must be done now, after the war it will be too late." [...] By the end of the war, the subsequent German ambassador Johann von Bernstorff described his discussion with Talaat: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> pestering him about the Armenian question, he once said with a smile: 'What on earth do you want? The question is settled, there are no more Armenians'". A similar statement by Talaat was made to Swedish military attaché Einar af Wirsén: [...] "The way the Armenian problem was solved was hair-raising. I can still see in front of me Talaat's cynical expression, when he emphasized that the Armenian question was solved." [...] Talaat is reported to have said the following to American ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Sr. (as recorded in Ambassador Morgenthau's Story), who confronted Talaat on several occasions: [...] "I have accomplished more toward solving the Armenian problem in three months than Abdulhamid II accomplished in thirty years!" [...] Morgenthau then relates an exchange he had with Talaat: ...|$|E

2500|$|Adams {{initially}} {{may have}} met James Dean in December 1950 while jitterbugging for a soft drink commercial filmed at Griffith Park. Adams {{spent three years}} in the Coast Guard between the time this commercial was shot in late 1950 and the start of filming for Rebel Without a Cause in March 1955. Actor Jack Grinnage, who played Moose, recalled, [...] "Off the set, Nick, Dennis (Hopper), and the others would go out together--almost like the gang we portrayed--but Jimmy and Corey Allen... were not a part of that." [...] They became friends during filming. During breaks, Dean and Adams entertained cast and crew with impersonations of Marlon Brando and Elia Kazan (who had directed Dean in East of Eden). A 1955 Warner Brothers press release quoted Dean as saying, [...] "I shall be busy for the rest of 1955, and Nick will be doing film work for the next six months. Come 1956, however, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself with Adams doing a two-a-night nightclub routine--or acting in a comedy by William Shakespeare." [...] When production was wrapped, Dean said in another press release, [...] "I now regard Natalie (Wood), Nick, and Sal (Mineo) as co-workers; I regard them as friends... about the only friends I have in this town. And I hope we all work together again soon." [...] Following Dean's 1955 death in an automobile accident, Adams overdubbed some of Dean's lines for the film Giant (these are in Jett Rink's speech at the hotel) and dated co-star Natalie Wood. Adams tried to capitalize on Dean's fame through various publicity stunts, including a claim he was being stalked by a crazed female Dean fan, allowing himself to be photographed at Dean's grave in a contemplative pose, holding flowers, and surrounded by mourning, teenaged female fans along with writing articles and doing interviews about Dean for fan magazines. He also claimed to have developed Dean's affection for fast cars, later telling a reporter, [...] "I became a highway delinquent. I was arrested nine times in one year. They put me on probation, but <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> racing... nowhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{it was a}} giddy time," [...] said Beetle, afterwards, in {{dismantled}} Number Five. [...] "He gibbered a bit, and <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> him <b>on</b> the gibber, {{and then}} he dictated about a half of Dolabella & Co." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} won't be mad 'cause I {{came in here}} last night. I counted on gettin' away before you waked up; but the bed was so soft that it ain't any wonder <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> right <b>on</b> sleepin'." ...|$|R
60|$|I still waited, with an obstinacy {{which was}} fast {{becoming}} the obstinacy of despair. How long an interval elapsed, while <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> watch <b>on</b> {{the ground before}} me, I am not able to say. I only know that a change came.|$|R

60|$|I {{have said}} that I began to laugh, and now <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on.</b> I just sat down and roared, so that the people looked at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{let them}} drop me, sir. Don't let them drop me, sir!" [...] While <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> {{shouting}} {{to him in}} most soothing accents: [...] "All right, Gambril. They won't! They won't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{that all}} trace of you was lost, but <b>I</b> still <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> advertising, for missing {{people have a}} {{wonderful}} way of turning up to claim fortunes, {{and you see the}} result. Here is the letter, Sir Leonard." ...|$|R

60|$|This {{point was}} never settled. I was {{detained}} in town from {{week to week}} till it seemed hardly worth while to go back. But as <b>I</b> had <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> my rooms in the farmhouse I concluded to go down again for a few days.|$|R
60|$|Reluctantly {{agreeing to}} this, {{he turned his}} face toward the East whilst <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> toward Seattle, to visit my classmate Burton Babcock, who {{was living in a}} village on Puget Sound.|$|E
60|$|He {{crossed the}} road and walked towards the western {{boundary}} of the Regent's Park. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> my own side of the way, a little behind him, and walked in that direction also.|$|E
60|$|I {{think that}} even then I had an instinctive doubt whether formlessness was really better than formality. Something, it seems to me, may be {{contained}} and kept alive in formality, but in formlessness everything spills and wastes away. This is what I find the fatal defect of our American Ossian, Walt Whitman, whose way is where artistic madness lies. He had great moments, beautiful and noble thoughts, generous aspirations, and a heart wide and warm enough for the whole race, {{but he had no}} bounds, no shape; he was as liberal as the casing air, but he was often as vague and intangible. I cannot say how long my passion for Ossian lasted, but not long, I fancy, for I cannot find any trace of it in the time following our removal from Ashtabula to the county seat at Jefferson. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> with Pope, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> with Cervantes, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>on</b> with Irving, but I suppose there was really not substance enough in Ossian to feed my passion, and it died of inanition.|$|E

6000|$|... "There was the Emma Louisa. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> her <b>on</b> {{the long}} voyage over {{eighteen}} months with water accidents and similar accidents.
