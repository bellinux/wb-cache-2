40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The retro-ene {{reaction}} of 2 -vinylcyclohexanols occurs readily in the vapor phase at 400 - 450 ° producing unsaturated carbonyl compounds in good yields. The starting- materials were prepared in general by the carbenoid addition {{reaction of}} ethyl diazoacetate, appropriately substituted cyclohexene, and copper catalyst to produce bicyclic esters which {{were reduced to}} the alcohols and rearranged with aqueous acid. Stereochemical examination of several examples suggest the reaction is concerted and the products are kinetically determined. The reaction constitutes a useful stereoselective procedure for the synthesis of tri-substituted olefins. The synthesis of botryococcene, a geochemically important, abundant hydrocarbon of Botryococcus braunii, focused on an appropriate half-molecule which could be asymmetrically coupled. A retro-ene route was examined, but an alternative, more conventional route provided better results. This reaction scheme was founded on the convergent coupling of an organometallic reagent from the THP derivative of 6 -bromo- 3 -methyl - 2 -hexen-l-ol and 4, 5 - dimethyl- 5 - hexenal. The aldehyde was prepared from <b>ethyl</b> methyl <b>acetoacetate</b> in seven steps with an overall yield of 24...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} method for {{the synthesis of}} quinolines and polycyclic quinolines using Li+ modified nanoporous Na+-montmorillonite is described. This new nanocatalyst proceeds via Friedlander annulation under solvent-free conditions. It describes our observations about a trend of catalytic activity of Lithium cation in nanoporous Na+-montmorillonite. In this study, several types of 1, 3 -diketones such as 1, 3 -cyclohexanedione, 1, 3 -cyclopentandione, 5, 5 -dimethylcyclohexandione (dimedone), acetylacetone and <b>ethyl</b> or methyl <b>acetoacetate</b> and 2 -aminoarylketones were rapidly converted to the corresponding substitutedquinoline derivatives in good to excellent yields. The simple experimental procedure, solvent-free reaction conditions, good yields, and utilization of an inexpensive and reusable catalyst are {{the advantages of the}} proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the synthesis of quinoline derivatives using Li+ modified in nanoporous Na+-MMT as a novel nanocatalyst under solvent-free conditions.

Growth of P. tricornutum was significantly inhibited by the minimum concentration (3. 5 mmol. L- 1) of EMA at lower initial algal densities (IADs) (3. 6 x 10 (4) and 3. 3 x 10 (5) cells. mL(- 1)). However, at the highest IAD, significant growth inhibition was found at above 7 mmol. L- 1 of EMA exposure. In S. costatum, EMA concentrations of 10. 5 mmol. L- 1 or more significantly inhibited growth at lower IAD (3 x 10 (4) and 1. 8 x 10 (5) cells. mL(- 1)); at the highest IAD, only EMA concentrations above 14 mmol. L- 1 obviously inhibited the growth of S. costatum. Changes in specific growth rates and pigment were consistent with algal growth, but only at higher EMA concentrations or lower IAD values was the ratio of chlorophyll a (Chla) to carotenoid {{significantly lower than the}} control. Medium effective concentration (EC 50) values were in the order 4. 07, 8. 03 and 12. 27 mmol. L- 1 for P. tricornutum and 7. 48, 11. 92 and 17. 22 mmol. L- 1 for S. costatum. All these results show that the effect of EMA on the growth of algae was species specific and mainly depended on IAD, which might be an important factor to influence algal growth...|$|R

50|$|Geuther is {{best known}} for his {{discovery}} of <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetoacetate.</b> Although he discovered the compound in 1863, it took him two years to publish results in a peer reviewed journal. The experimental work of his and others yielded puzzling results and induced debates on the nature of <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetoacetate.</b> The structure proposed by Edward Frankland and Duppa showed a keto group (C=O), while Geuther was certain about presence of an acidic OH group in the molecule. It was long after the death of Geuther when Ludwig Knorr, Geuthers successor at the University of Jena, solved the riddle proving both sides right: the true nature of <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetoacetate</b> was a tautomeric equilibrium between the both suggested structures. The Keto-enol tautomerism strongly depends on the solvent used for the experiments. Geuther was planning to build a new chemical laboratory at University of Jena, but died well before the construction had started.

50|$|The {{original}} Knorr synthesis employed two equivalents of <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetoacetate,</b> one {{of which}} was converted to ethyl 2-oximinoacetoacetate by dissolving it in glacial acetic acid, and slowly adding one equivalent of saturated aqueous sodium nitrite, under external cooling.

50|$|The organic {{compound}} <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetoacetate</b> (EAA) is the ethyl ester of acetoacetic acid.

Alone, it is used as a flavoring for food.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{practice}} {{is to add}} the oxime solution resulting from the nitrosation and the zinc dust gradually to a well-stirred solution of <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetoacetate</b> in glacial acetic acid. The reaction is exothermic, and the mixture can reach the boiling point, if external cooling is not applied. The resulting product, diethyl 3,5-dimethylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylate, has been called Knorr's Pyrrole ever since.

50|$|The Hantzsch {{pyridine}} synthesis or Hantzsch dihydropyridine synthesis is a multi-component {{organic reaction}} between an aldehyde such as formaldehyde, 2 equivalents of a β-keto ester such as <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetoacetate</b> and a nitrogen donor such as ammonium acetate or ammonia.

50|$|In 1885 Fischer became {{professor}} at the University of Würzburg and Knorr followed him and was made associate professor.

50|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of the Robinsons’ methods for {{the synthesis of}} fatty acids are the low yields due to the recoveries of {{a significant portion of}} the dialdehyde.

While she did not solve this problem, she did improve the yield and decrease the dialdehyde recovered by “the acylation of a substituted <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetoacetate</b> by the group related to the weakest possible acid”.|$|E
