50|$|The {{presence}} of gas around a specimen creates new possibilities unique to ESEM: (a) Liquid-phase electron microscopy is possible since any pressure greater than 609 Pa allows water {{to be maintained}} in its liquid phase for temperatures above 0 °C, {{in contrast to the}} SEM where specimens are desiccated by the vacuum condition.

(c) The gas itself is used as a detection medium producing novel imaging possibilities, as opposed to vacuum SEM detectors. (d) Plain plastic scintillating BSE detectors can operate uncoated without charging.

40|$|The paper gives {{overview}} {{of the results of}} using narrow-aperture electron beam generated by a forevacuum plasma electron source as a tool for treatment of <b>electrically</b> <b>non-conductive</b> materials, such as technical glass. Effectiveness of electron beam treatment of non-conductive materials is caused by almost complete neutralization of target charge on the treated surface.

The study demonstrates the possibility to control depth and form of milling by changing modes of electron beam treatment. Combined use of electron beam and automated system for beam deflection and sweep makes possible to perform dimensional processing, particularly cutting and milling with complex trajectory. Milling rates were experimentally found depending on treatment time and mode. The suggested method of silica glass treatment represents an alternative for traditional treatment methods...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} effect of carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) inclusions on the electrical and thermal conductivity of a thermoset epoxy resin. The characterization of electrical and thermal conductivity of CNT/epoxy composites is presented. Pristine, oxidized, and fluorine-functionalized unpurified CNT mixtures ("XD grade") were dispersed in an epoxy matrix, and {{the effect of}} stirring rate and pre-curing of the epoxy on the dispersion of the CNTs was evaluated. In order to characterize the dispersion of the CNTs at different length scales, Optical Microscopy (OM), Raman Spectroscopy, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed. Samples of varying CNT weight fractions were fabricated in order to find the effect of CNT weight fraction on thermal and electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity was measured using a dielectric spectrometer, and thermal conductivity was determined by a transient plane source thermal analyzer. It was found that electrical conductivity increases by orders of magnitude for the pristine and oxidized XD CNT composites relative to the neat epoxy matrix, while fluorinated XD CNT composites remain <b>electrically</b> <b>non-conductive.</b> A small, but significant, increase in thermal conductivity was observed for pristine, oxidized, and fluorinated XD CNT composites, showing a linear increase in thermal conductivity with increasing CNT weight fraction. Pristine XD CNTs were ball-milled for different times {{in order to reduce the}} degree of agglomeration and entanglement of CNTs, and composites were fabricated using the same technique as with non-milled XD CNTs. Using ball-milled CNTs shows improved dispersion but results in an <b>electrically</b> <b>non-conductive</b> composite at the CNT weight fractions tested. The thermal conductivity of the ball-milled CNT samples shows an initial increase higher than that of non-milled pristine, oxidized, and fluorinated XD CNTs, but remains constant with increasing CNT weight fraction.

Nanoscale effects in electrical and thermal conduction, such as electron hopping and interface thermal resistance, respectively, were incorporated into the model in order to accurately predict the acquired results.

A magnetic field response recorder has a measurement head with transceiving antennas arrayed therein to correspond to {{the pattern of the}} housing's antennas. When a measurement is to be taken, the measurement head is mechanically coupled to the housing so that each housing antenna is substantially aligned with a specific one of the transceiving antennas...|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} system are {{provided}} for the shaping and polishing of {{the surface of a}} material selected from the group consisting of electrically semi-conductive materials and conductive materials. An <b>electrically</b> <b>non-conductive</b> polishing lap incorporates a conductive electrode such that, when the polishing lap is placed on the material's surface, the electrode is placed in spaced-apart juxtaposition with respect to the material's surface. A liquid electrolyte is disposed between the material's surface and the electrode. The electrolyte has an electrochemical stability constant such that cathodic material deposition on the electrode is not supported when a current flows through the electrode, the electrolyte and the material. As the polishing lap and the material surface experience relative movement, current flows through the electrode based on (i) adherence to Faraday's Law, and (ii) a pre-processing profile of the surface and a desired post-processing profile of the surface...|$|E
