5|$|Luke 9:10 it has {{the textual}} variant εις πολιν καλουμενην Βηθσαιδα (to a city called Bethsaida), as do codices B, L, and 33; but later hand-written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> εις τοπον ερημον πολεως καλουμενην Βηδσαιδα (into a deserted place {{belonging}} to the city called Bethsaida).|$|E
5|$|The D.C. {{circuit court}} judges hearing the demurrer were Chief Judge William Kilty and {{assistant}} judges William Cranch and James Markham Marshall (Chief Justice John Marshall's brother). Cranch and Marshall were Adams appointees; Kilty was a Jefferson appointee. Cranch, also the reporter of {{decisions for the}} Supreme Court, included the D.C. circuit court opinions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of his report of the Supreme Court's decision in More.|$|E
5|$|The codex uses a {{peculiar}} system of chapter divisions, which it shares with Codex Vaticanus and Minuscule 579. A more common system divides chapters {{according to their}} titles.

5|$|The only decorations in the {{manuscript}} are decorative tail-pieces {{at the end of}} each book (see illustration) and it also shows a tendency to increase the size of the first letter of each sentence. The capitals at the beginning of the sections stand out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> as in codices Ephraemi and Basilensis. Codex Alexandrinus is the oldest manuscript to use capital letters to indicate new sections.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} last {{corrector}} (C3) {{wrote in the}} 800's, possibly in Constantinople. He conformed readings of the codex to ecclesiastical use, inserting many accents, breathings, and vocal notes. He also added liturgical directions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin,</b> and worked extensively on the codex. The codex was recycled in the twelfth century.|$|E
5|$|The various {{sections}} {{into which}} the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse were divided by Euthalian Apparatus and others, are not indicated in this manuscript.

5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of the text of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} extant manuscript, the Winchester Chronicle, {{was written}} by a single scribe up to the year 891. The scribe wrote the year number, DCCCXCII, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of the next line; subsequent material {{was written by}} other scribes. This appears to place {{the composition of the}} chronicle at no later than 892; further evidence is provided by Bishop Asser's use of a version of the Chronicle in his work Life of King Alfred, known to have been composed in 893. It is known that the Winchester manuscript is at least two removes from the original Chronicle; as a result, there is no proof that the Chronicle was compiled at Winchester. It is also difficult to fix the date of composition, but it is generally thought that the chronicles were composed during the reign of Alfred the Great (871–99), as Alfred deliberately tried to revive learning and culture during his reign, and encouraged the use of English as a written language. The Chronicle, as well as the distribution of copies to other centres of learning, may be a consequence of the changes Alfred introduced.|$|E

25|$|Fermat's last theorem {{was first}} conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, famously <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of {{a copy of}} Arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin.</b> No {{successful}} proof was published until 1995 {{despite the efforts of}} countless mathematicians during the 358 intervening years.

25|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} the substituents also influence {{the strength of the}} attraction.

25|$|The Euthalian Apparatus is a {{collection}} of additional editorial material, such as divisions of text, lists, and summaries, to the New Testament's Book of Acts, Catholic epistles, and Pauline epistles.

This material is traditionally associated with the name of Euthalius.|$|E
25|$|The {{five books}} of the Torah have been broken down into their weekly Torah {{readings}} for convenience. The weekly Torah readings always begin at a parashah break, with the single exception of Vayechi (Genesis 47:28).

25|$|The Small Masorah {{consists}} of brief notes {{with reference to}} marginal readings, to statistics showing {{the number of times}} a particular form is found in Scripture, to full and defective spelling, and to abnormally written letters.

The Final Masorah comprises all the longer rubrics for which space could not be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of the text, and is arranged alphabetically {{in the form of a}} concordance. The quantity of notes the marginal Masorah contains is conditioned by the amount of vacant space on each page. In the manuscripts it varies also with the rate at which the copyist was paid and the fanciful shape he gave to his gloss.|$|E
