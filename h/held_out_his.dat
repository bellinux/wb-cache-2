25|$|At {{the end of}} the concert, Furtwängler {{continued}} to keep his baton in his right hand. Hitler understood the situation and jumped up and demonstratively <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> right hand to him. The same situation occurred during another concert later on, when a photographer had been mobilized by the Nazis for the occasion: the photo of the famous handshake between Furtwängler and Hitler was distributed everywhere by Goebbels. Goebbels had obtained what he desired: to keep Furtwängler in Germany and to give the impression to those who were not well informed (especially outside the country) that Furtwängler was now a supporter of the regime.|$|E
500|$|Eddie stashes his {{belongings}} {{at the local}} bus terminal, where he meets Sarah Packard, an alcoholic who is supported by her father, attends college part-time, and walks with a limp. He meets her again at a bar. They {{go back to her}} place but she refuses to let him in, saying he is [...] "too hungry". Eddie moves into a rooming house and starts hustling for small stakes. He finds Sarah again and this time she takes him in, but with reservations. Charlie finds Eddie at Sarah's and tries to persuade him to go back out on the road. Eddie refuses and Charlie realizes he plans to challenge Fats again. Eddie realizes that Charlie <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> percentage and becomes enraged, believing that with that money he could have rebounded to beat Fats. Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tells him to [...] "go lie down and die" [...] by himself.|$|E

2500|$|Charles {{did manage}} to spin out time. But it was of capital {{importance}} that Rupert had to do his work upon York and the allied army in the shortest possible time. According to the despatch, {{there were only two}} ways of saving the royal cause, [...] "having relieved York by beating the Scots", or marching with all speed to Worcester. Rupert's duty, interpreted through the medium of his temperament, was clear enough. Newcastle still <b>held</b> <b>out,</b> <b>his</b> men having been encouraged by a small success on 17 June, and Rupert reached Knaresborough on the 30th.|$|E

2500|$|As Montrose {{entered the}} St. Lawrence River, Dew came aboard {{disguised}} as a pilot. Canada was then still a dominion within the British Empire. If Crippen, an American citizen, had sailed to the United States instead, {{even if he had}} been recognised, it would have taken extradition proceedings to bring him to trial. Kendall invited Crippen to meet the pilots as they came aboard. Dew removed his pilot's cap and said, [...] "Good morning, Dr. Crippen. Do you know me? I'm Chief Inspector Dew from Scotland Yard."

2500|$|La Toya Jackson ended her estrangement {{with the}} entire Jackson family and {{returned}} home to Hayvenhurst. Jackson forgave her parents for her stifled upbringing reasoning, [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} as we get older, we grow and learn a lot more. And I think that my father and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how." [...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> arms and just hugged me. I was crying saying: 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.' He just held me tight and said: 'I am your brother, I always knew it wasn't you saying those words." ...|$|E

After crossing the river at Eleusis, about four miles from Alexandria, he was met by the Roman commissioners, to whom he gave a friendly greeting and <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> hand to Popilius. Popilius, however, placed in his hand the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate and told him first of all to read it. After reading it through, he said he would call his friends into council and consider what he ought to do. Popilius, stern and imperious as ever, drew a circle round the king with the stick he was carrying and said, [...] "Before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate." [...] For a few moments he hesitated, astounded at such a peremptory order, and at last replied, [...] "I will do what the senate thinks right." [...] Not till then did Popilius extend his hand to the king as to a friend and ally. Antiochus evacuated Egypt at the appointed date, and the commissioners exerted their authority to establish a lasting concord between the brothers, as they had as yet hardly made peace with each other.
