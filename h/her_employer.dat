5|$|Peggy Robertson, Hitchcock's long-time assistant, read Anthony Boucher's {{positive}} {{review of}} the novel and decided to show the book to <b>her</b> <b>employer,</b> even though studio readers at Paramount Pictures had already rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500 and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to preserve the novel's surprises. Hitchcock, {{who had come to}} face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount, Flamingo Feather and No Bail for the Judge. He disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.|$|E

5|$|Webster {{herself was}} characterised as malicious, {{reckless}} and wilfully evil. Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous. Servants {{were expected to}} be deferential; her act of extreme violence towards <b>her</b> <b>employer</b> was deeply disquieting. At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as domestic servants for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers lived and worked in close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern. Servants were very poorly paid and larceny was an ever-present temptation. Had Webster succeeded in completing the deal with John Church to sell Thomas' furniture, she stood to gain the equivalent of two to three years' worth of wages.|$|E

50|$|Saint Zita {{was born}} in Tuscany {{in the village of}} Monsagrati, not far from Lucca where, at the age of 12, she became a servant in the Fatinelli household. For a long time, she was {{unjustly}} despised, overburdened, reviled, and often beaten by <b>her</b> <b>employers</b> and fellow servants for her hard work and obvious goodness. The incessant ill-usage, however, was powerless to deprive her of her inward peace, her love of those who wronged her, and her respect for <b>her</b> <b>employers.</b> By this meek and humble self-restraint, Zita at last succeeded in overcoming the malice of her fellow-servants and <b>her</b> <b>employers,</b> so much so that she was placed in charge of all the affairs of the house. Her faith had enabled her to persevere against their abuse, and her constant piety gradually moved the family to a religious awakening.|$|R
