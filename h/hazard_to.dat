5|$|Although {{it meets}} the {{definition}} of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites. This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|El Sol {{settled on}} the bottom at a 45° angle with only the tops of her masts {{protruding}} above the surface; the Morgan Line house flag—a blue house flag with a red M inside a white star—still fluttered in the breeze. Even though the sunken vessel was not considered a <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> navigation, in another fog two days later a Staten Island Ferryboat nearly hit El Sols wreck.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being a <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> navigation, the Torran Rocks south of Erraid are one of the locations featured in the novel Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson. It was here that Alan Breck Stewart and David Balfour were ship-wrecked.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{interactions}} {{between humans and}} cattle egrets are beneficial.

5|$|Some of germanium's artificially-produced {{compounds}} {{are quite}} reactive and present an immediate <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> human health on exposure.

5|$|There {{is another}} Long Craig south of Dalgety Bay and Haystack lies {{between it and}} Inchcolm. The Common Rocks are in Silversands Bay at Aberdour and West Vows, East Vows and another Long Craig lie off Kirkcaldy. Much farther along the coast there is another West Vows and East Vows at Earlsferry. The Carr Brigs are a <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> {{shipping}} {{at the entrance to}} the Firth just off Fife Ness.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months later}} a second {{opportunity}} presented itself. Another old ship, the Haines, sank {{in shallow water}} while being towed off Plum Tree Island and became a <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> navigation. The 2nd Bombardment Group redeemed itself by completely destroying the derelict from the air, even though their only visible target was a ten-foot-square float marker. This accomplishment, however, went entirely unpublicized.|$|E

5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|Arniston sailed from Great Britain to the Far East {{eight times}} before her last voyage.BL 1812, primary sources. On {{one of her}} homeward {{journeys}} from China, she struck an uncharted rock at , near the island of Pulo Goondy (modern day Pulau Legundi), located just south of Sumatra. She did not suffer any ill effects {{as a result of}} this incident however, which is mentioned in journals of the time only for its noteworthiness as a navigation <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> other shipping.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{by three}} tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} wreck were unsuccessful, but the next spring tide carried the {{midsection}} up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite Padstow, where it was a <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> shipping. A miner named Pope {{was called in to}} remove it: he used gelignite without success, though the explosion was reported to have broken many windows in the town. In 2010 a wreck, identified as almost certainly the Antoinette, surfaced on Town Bar. The Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws.|$|E

5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Geospace is {{populated}} by electrically charged particles {{at very low}} densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. During geomagnetic storms two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere, can become strongly disturbed. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, disrupting telecommunications and GPS technologies, and {{can also be a}} <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles.|$|E

The narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, {{it is one of}} London's least busy Thames bridges. The location on a bend in the river makes the bridge a <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.|$|E

5|$|More violent eruptions are {{possible}} only in unique circumstances, {{such as an}} eruption into a lake. Any future eruption {{is most likely to}} affect only a limited area downslope from the volcano. Poisonous substances, such as volcanic gas, includes a variety of substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissoclated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential <b>hazard</b> <b>to</b> people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano.|$|E
