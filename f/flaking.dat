5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different <b>flaking</b> patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better cognitive and conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flake</b> {{breakage}} {{and texture}} are important quality, criteria in oat <b>flakes.</b> These properties {{are determined by}} the mechanical properties of the <b>flakes,</b> which may be influenced by process variables such as kilning and <b>flake</b> thickness. A pin deformation method was used to measure the rupture force of individual oat <b>flakes</b> at different water activities. The monolayer value of ground oat <b>flakes</b> ranged from 5. 83 to 684 g/ 100 g dry matter Thick <b>flakes</b> were strongest, requiring 3. 4 N to rupture the <b>flake</b> compared to 2. 2 N for the thin <b>flakes.</b> Water softened the <b>flakes,</b> causing a decrease in rupture force from 3. 6 N to 2. 4 N as water activity; increased from 0. 115 to 0. 848. Kilning had a significant effect on <b>flake</b> thickness but not on the mechanical properties. This study suggests that oat <b>flakes</b> should be stored at water activity 0. 4 or less as there is a sharp loss of <b>flake</b> strength above this point...|$|R

40|$|The self-retracting {{motion of}} a {{graphene}} <b>flake</b> on {{a stack of}} graphene <b>flakes</b> is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown {{that in the case}} when the extended <b>flake</b> is initially rotated to an incommensurate state, there is no barrier to the self-retracting motion of the <b>flake</b> and the <b>flake</b> retracts as fast as possible. If the extended <b>flake</b> is initially commensurate with the other <b>flakes,</b> the self-retracting motion is hindered by potential energy barriers. However, in this case, the rotation of the <b>flake</b> to incommensurate states is often observed. Such a rotation is found to be induced by the torque acting on the <b>flake</b> on hills of the potential relief of the interaction energy between the <b>flakes.</b> Contrary to carbon nanotubes, telescopic oscillations of the graphene <b>flake</b> are suppressed because of the high dynamic friction related to the excitation of flexural vibrations of the <b>flake.</b> This makes graphene promising for the use in fast-responding electromechanical memory cells.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the cutting efficiency of <b>flake</b> tools increases with increased tool size. Here, we undertook {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>flake</b> size and efficiency parameters using a larger and more variable <b>flake</b> dataset than used in previous analyses. Our analyses were specifically designed to assess whether there is an absolute relationship between ever-increasing <b>flake</b> size and increased efficiency and/or loading potential. An alternative hypothesis is merely that only the smallest <b>flakes</b> are inefficient, and it is this factor which has been driving previous statements linking increasing <b>flake</b> size with increased efficiency. Our first set of analyses, using all experimental <b>flakes,</b> determined that a statistically significant relationship existed between increased <b>flake</b> sizes and increased cutting efficiency, as measured by two different efficiency measures (‘Time taken’ and ‘Number of cutting strokes required’). This analysis also demonstrated a statistically significant positive relationship between <b>flake</b> size and loading forces. However, our second analysis, which excluded the smallest <b>flakes</b> in our sample, revealed a different pattern. In this second set of analyses, increasing <b>flake</b> size did not indicate a statistically significant relationship with our two measures of cutting efficiency. A statistically significant relationship between increased <b>flake</b> size and increased loading was, however, still evinced. In sum, these results suggest that there is not an unconditional or absolute relationship between increased <b>flake</b> size and increased cutting efficiency in all circumstances. Rather, there is a threshold below which <b>flakes</b> of a certain size will become markedly inefficient. Our results have particular implications relating to <b>flake</b> utility, optimality, and factors potentially influencing <b>flake</b> selection by hominins...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The need {{to develop}} {{recycling}} solutions for carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites has been well established. However, recycled composites remain inferior to composites fabricated with virgin fibers for several reasons. Realistically, recycled composites {{can be expected to}} achieve comparable performance to sheet molding compounds fabricated with virgin fibers if fiber volume fractions can be improved without significantly reducing fiber length. One possible way to achieve this is to fabricate laminates with <b>flakes</b> of cured CFRP. The goal of this research was to investigate the effect of <b>flake</b> geometry on the properties of recycled <b>flake</b> reinforced composites, and to evaluate whether fabricating recycled laminates with CFRP <b>flakes</b> may become a viable alternative to current CFRP recycling techniques. This was accomplished by fabricating and mechanically testing several composite laminates with either shredded <b>flake</b> or single ply <b>flake</b> reinforcement. The shredded material was provided as-shredded by The Boeing Company, and no further processing of the <b>flakes</b> was done prior to resin infusion. The single ply <b>flakes</b> were cured in individual sheets and cut into <b>flakes</b> of different geometries. This <b>flake</b> system was chosen to simulate cured prepreg scrap or delaminated CFRP recyclate, and to provide a well-controlled material system for studying the effects of <b>flake</b> geometry on the properties of <b>flake</b> reinforced composites. The aspect ratio of the singe ply <b>flakes</b> was varied between 1 : 1 and 1 : 4 while either <b>flake</b> area or <b>flake</b> length was held constant.

50|$|On {{most natural}} cobbles or nodules of source material, a {{weathered}} outer rind called a cortex covers the unweathered inner material. <b>Flakes</b> are often differentiated {{by the amount}} of cortex present on their dorsal surfaces, because the amount of cortex indicates when in the sequence of reduction the <b>flake</b> came from. Primary <b>flakes</b> are those whose dorsal surfaces are entirely covered with cortex; secondary <b>flakes</b> have at least a trace of cortex on the dorsal surface; and tertiary (interior) <b>flakes</b> lack cortex, having derived entirely from the interior of the core. Primary <b>flakes</b> and secondary <b>flakes</b> are usually associated with the initial stages of lithic reduction, while tertiary <b>flakes</b> {{are more likely to be}} associated with retouching and bifacial reduction activities.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the friction behaviors of graphene <b>flakes</b> sliding on a gold substrate using molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of <b>flake</b> size, <b>flake</b> shape, relative rotation angle between <b>flake</b> and substrate, and crystal orientation of substrate on the friction process are thoroughly studied. It is found {{that under the}} same load, the average friction forces per atom are smaller for a bigger graphene <b>flake,</b> which exhibits an obvious size effect. It is also shown that <b>flake</b> shape is critical in determining the friction in the sliding process. The average friction forces per atom for the square <b>flake</b> are much bigger than those for the triangular and round <b>flakes.</b> Moreover, the average friction forces per atom for the triangular <b>flake</b> are the smallest. We also find that the orientation of graphene <b>flake</b> relative to gold substrate plays {{a vital role in}} the friction process. The friction forces for the graphene <b>flake</b> sliding along the armchair direction are much bigger than those for the <b>flakes</b> with rotation. In addition, it is also found that single crystalline gold substrate exhibits a significant anisotropic effect of friction, which is attributed to the anisotropic effect of potential energy corrugation. These understandings not only shed light on the underlying mechanisms of graphene <b>flake</b> sliding on the gold substrates but also may guide the design and fabrication of nanoscale graphene-based devices.|$|R
