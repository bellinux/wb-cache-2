5|$|Cyathus striatus can {{reproduce}} both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis), {{typical of}} taxa in the basidiomycetes that contain both <b>haploid</b> and diploid stages.

After the spores have been dispersed into a suitable growing environment, they germinate and develop into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each cell compartment. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. After {{a period of time}} and under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruiting bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruiting bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new spores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of <b>haploid</b> sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce <b>haploid</b> basidiospores.

5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, <b>haploid</b> spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular <b>haploid</b> gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle.

Young basidia contain a pair of <b>haploid</b> sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single <b>haploid</b> nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E

Anthers of 20 F 1 wheat combinations were grown in vitro on a modified Potato- 2 medium. All of the examined genotypes have shown the ability to produce pollen calluses as well as to regenerate green plants. On average for the whole experiment material, 47. 2 calluses were produced per 100 cultured anthers. The green plant regeneration ranged from 0. 8 to 13. 4 green plants per spike, with an overall mean of 5. 8.

To construct strains where the only allele of RAD 54 is contained on a plasmid integrated at ura 3, a rad 54 ∆::kanMX 6 /RAD 54 heterozygous diploid was first created using the PCR based method of Longtine et al. (1998) to replace one copy of RAD 54 with rad 54 ∆::kanMX 6. This diploid was then transformed with pRS 306 digested with StuI or pHN 103 (RAD 54), pHN 104 (RAD 54 -T 132 A) and pHN 105 (RAD 54 -T 132 D) digested with NcoI. The diploids were sporulated and the dissected tetrads were analyzed for spore colonies that were a His- Arg+ G 418 R Ura+ or α His+ Arg- G 418 R Ura+. The <b>haploids</b> were then mated to produce NH 938, NH 939, NH 940 and NH 941.

5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in basidiomycetes {{is similar}} to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible <b>haploid</b> hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing mycelium. A specialized anatomical structure, called a clamp connection, is formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, the clamp connection in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment. A basidiocarp is formed in which club-like structures known as basidia generate <b>haploid</b> basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis. The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see Morphology section).|$|E

40|$|In budding yeast, spindle {{polarity}} {{relies on}} a precise temporal program of cytoplasmic microtu-bule–cortex interactions throughout spindle assembly. Loss of Clb 5 -dependent kinase activity under conditions of attenuated Cdc 28 function disrupts this program, resulting in diploid-specific lethality. Here we show that polarity loss is tolerated by <b>haploids</b> due to a more prominent contribution of microtubule–neck interactions to spindle orientation inherent to <b>haploids.</b> These differences are mediated by the relative partition of Bud 6 between the bud tip and bud neck, distinguishing <b>haploids</b> from diploids. Bud 6 localizes initially to the bud tip and accumulates at the neck concomitant with spindle assembly. bud 6 D mutant phenotypes are consistent with Bud 6 ’s role as a cortical cue for cytoplasmic microtubule capture. Moreover, mutations that affect Bud 6 localization and partitioning disrupt the sequential program of microtubule–cortex interactions accordingly. These data support a model whereby Bud 6 sequentially cues microtubule capture events at the bud tip followed by capture events at the bud neck, necessary for correct spindle morphogenesis and polarity...|$|R

The MATα allele of MAT encodes the α1 and α2 genes, which in <b>haploids</b> direct the transcription of the α-specific transcriptional program (such as expressing STE3, repressing STE2) which causes the cell to be an α cell.|$|R
40|$|Potato virus Y (PVY), {{especially}} its necrotic strains, {{is a dangerous}} pathogen of tobacco. It causes necrosis of nerves and leaf laminas leading to a significant yield reduction. Brown vein necrosis of tobacco caused by PVY is an important problem because new isolates able to break resistance are still occurring. One of resistance sources is a wild species Nicotiana africana that shows resistance to all tested PVY isolates. Breeding BPA lines derived from crossing N. tabacum cv. BP- 210 × N. africana are tolerant of many PVY isolates. Another source of resistance are transgenic tobacco lines – MN 944 LMV (cultivar Mac Nair containing gene of lettuce mosaic virus coat protein) and AC Gayed ROKY 2 (cultivar AC Gayed containing gene of PVY replicase). To increase the level of resistance by combining these sources of resist-ance, hybrids coming from crosses between transgenic line MN 944 LMV and line BPA as well as MN 944 LMV and AC Gayed ROKY 2 were obtained. The most resistant hybrids were used for producing <b>haploids</b> via androgene-sis. Immature anthers were put on Nitch & Nitch medium.

In oilseed rape <b>haploids,</b> homeologous chromosome pairing at metaphase I was found to be genetically based and controlled by a major gene, PrBn, segregating in a background of polygenic variation. In this study, we have mapped PrBn within a 10 -cM interval on the C genome linkage group DY 15 and shown that PrBn displays incomplete penetrance or variable expressivity. We have identified three to six minor QTL/BTL that have slight additive effects on the amount of pairing at metaphase I but do not interact with PrBn. We have also detected a number of other loci that interact epistatically, notably with PrBn.
