5|$|After {{retiring}} from playing, Bonini became San Marino's manager, succeeding Giorgio Leoni. He held the position until 1998, {{when he was}} replaced by Giampaolo Mazza. As of 2012, Mazza is the longest-serving manager of any European national team. Though he <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> position after their 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification campaign, giving way to former u-21s boss Pierangelo Manzaroli.|$|E
5|$|Although Robson {{had signed}} professionally, his father insisted he {{continue}} to work as an electrician.

5|$|Behan {{later said}} he {{attempted}} to persuade Frank McLaury to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> weapons, but Frank insisted that he would only <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> guns after City Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers were first disarmed.|$|R

5|$|Although he <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> {{original}} intentions for the Lifehouse project, Townshend {{continued to}} develop the concepts, revisiting them in later albums, including a 6-CD set, The Lifehouse Chronicles in 1999. In 2007 he opened a website called The Lifehouse Method to accept personal input from applicants that would be turned into musical portraits.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, Pearson {{was elected}} a councilman of the City of London Corporation for Bishopsgate ward {{and served in}} that role from 1817 to 1820 and from 1830 to 1836 as well. He served as {{chairman}} of the City board of health from 1831 to 1833. In 1839, he <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> extensive private practice and was appointed City Solicitor, holding that office until his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1850 he <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> {{career in}} science and entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. He studied in academy under the {{historical}} painter Pyotr Basin until 1857. He graduated from the academy in 1857 with a gold medal for his painting The Witch of Endor Calling Up the Spirit of the Prophet Samuel. According to Ge himself, during that period he was strongly influenced by Karl Briullov.|$|E

5|$|In 1958 Horne {{suffered}} a stroke and <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> business dealings to focus on his entertainment work. He was the anchor figure in Beyond Our Ken, which also featured Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick, Betty Marsden and Bill Pertwee. When the programme {{came to an end}} in 1964, the same cast recorded four series of the comedy Round the Horne.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, 1952, {{after the}} Maxim bout, Robinson <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> title and retired {{with a record}} of 131–3–1–1. He began a career in show business, singing and tap dancing. After about three years, the decline of his {{businesses}} and the lack of success in his performing career made him decide to return to boxing. He resumed training in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Wallhead soon turned {{professional}} and on 30 April 2005, {{he made his}} debut at Cage Warriors: Ultimate Force. Jim fought Leslee Ojugbana, utilising knee strikes from the clinch, whilst preventing Ojugbana from succeeding with takedown attempts. After one-sided striking from Wallhead, Ojugbana <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> back and Wallhead was able {{to pull off a}} rear naked choke for his debut win after just 64 seconds.|$|E

6000|$|... 'There it is,' thought Felix. 'Up to a point, they'll move--not up to THE point. It's all fiddling. One won't <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> shooting; another won't <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> power; a third won't <b>give</b> <b>up</b> her week-ends; {{a fourth}} won't <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> freedom. Our {{interest}} in the thing is all lackadaisical, a kind of bun-fight of pet notions. There's no real steam.' And abruptly changing the subject, he talked of pictures to the pleasant Bigwig in the sleepy afternoon. Of how this man could paint, and that man couldn't. And in the uncut grass the peacock slowly moved, displaying his breast of burning blue; and below, the gardeners worked among the gooseberries.|$|R

5|$|When Nasr died in 1098, Usama's father, Majd Al-Deen Abi Salamah Murshed (1068- 1137) {{became the}} emir of Shaizar and the {{surrounding}} cities. However he soon <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> position to Usama's Uncle (Iz Al-Deen Abi Al-Asaker Sultan Mrdad), Sultan, since Murshid {{was more interested in}} studying religion, writing the Quraan and hunting than matters of politics.|$|E
5|$|Beatty had {{a concept}} for a Dick Tracy film in 1975. At the time, the film rights were owned by Michael Laughlin, who <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> option from Tribune Media Services {{after he was}} {{unsuccessful}} in pitching Dick Tracy to Hollywood studios. Floyd Mutrux and Art Linson purchased the film rights from the Tribune in 1977, and, in 1980, United Artists became interested in financing/distributing Dick Tracy. Tom Mankiewicz was under negotiations to write the script, based on his previous success with Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980). The deal fell through when Chester Gould insisted on strict financial and artistic control.|$|E
5|$|Bhagavata Purana further {{states that}} Prithu {{performed}} ninety-nine ashwamedha yagnas (horse-sacrifices), but Indra, kings of the demi-gods, disturbed Prithu's hundredth one. The yagya was abandoned, Vishnu gave Prithu his blessings and Prithu forgave Indra for the latter's theft of the ritual-horse. It also {{states that the}} Four Kumaras, the four sage-incarnations of Vishnu, preached Prithu about devotion to Vishnu. After governing his kingdom for a long time, Prithu left with his wife Archi, to perform penance in the forest in his last days. He experienced Samadhi and voluntarily <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> body in the forest, and Archi went Sati on his funeral pyre.|$|E

5|$|Casimir, who {{formally}} <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> {{rights to}} several Silesian principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried {{to recover the}} region by conducting military activities against the House of Luxembourg (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the Gniezno Archdiocese by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; his successors did not continue his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{interest}} in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado. He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree in that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the Spanish Enlightenment, Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a freemason. He <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> religious studies to study law and get married, but never actually became a priest, {{so there was no}} defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of vocation.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, when Ernest was six, Henry Shackleton <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> {{life as a}} {{landowner}} {{to study}} medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, moving his family into the city. Four years later, the family moved again, from Ireland to Sydenham in suburban London. Partly this was in search of better professional prospects for the newly qualified doctor, but another factor may have been unease about their Anglo-Irish ancestry, following the assassination by Irish nationalists of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the British Secretary for Ireland, in 1882.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, van Meegeren <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> {{architecture}} {{studies and}} concentrated on drawing and painting at the art school in The Hague. On 8 January 1913, he received the prestigious Gold Medal from the Technical University in Delft for his Study of the Interior of the Church of Saint Lawrence (Laurenskerk) in Rotterdam. The award was given every five years to an art student who created the best work, and {{was accompanied by a}} gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Jim White, {{the coach}} at Los Angeles Harbor College, had watched Johnson play street basketball; feeling that Johnson excelled in defense, White {{asked him to}} enroll. Johnson <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> jobs and {{developed}} into a promising young guard, averaging 18.3 points and 12.0 rebounds per game and leading Harbor to a college junior state title. However, the young guard lacked discipline, often clashed with White and was thrown off the team three times in two years.|$|E
5|$|Matthias convoked the Diet to make {{preparations}} for an anti-Ottoman campaign in 1466. For the same purpose, he received subsidies from Pope Paul II. However, Matthias had realized that no substantial aid {{could be expected}} from the Christian powers and tacitly <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> anti-Ottoman foreign policy. He did not invade Ottoman territory and the Ottomans did not make major incursions into Hungary, implying that he signed a peace treaty with Mehmed II's envoy who arrived in Hungary in 1465.|$|E
