50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a first neutron-flanged tube {{for the oil}} logging (<b>electrical</b> <b>logging)</b> was {{designed}} {{at the request of}} Schlumberger, first of an ongoing collaboration.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} time in Russia in 1925, Baku {{engineer}} M.M. Skvortsov constructed a device for the automatic movement of a chisel, which became known as the [...] "automatic driller". By 1930, <b>electrical</b> <b>logging</b> tools were used in the wellbore by Schlumberger in the Surakhany oil field.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, the Schlumberger {{brothers}} in France developed the workhorse of all formation evaluation tools: the electric log. Electric logs have been improved {{to a high}} degree of precision and sophistication since that time, but the basic principle has not changed. Most underground formations contain water, often salt water, in their pores. The resistance to electric current of the total formation - rock and fluids - around the borehole is proportional to the sum of the volumetric proportions of mineral grains and conductive water-filled pore space. If the pores are partially filled with gas or oil, which are resistant to the passage of electric current, the bulk formation resistance is higher than for water filled pores. For the sake of a convenient comparison from measurement to measurement, the <b>electrical</b> <b>logging</b> tools measure the resistance of a cubic meter of formation. This measurement is called resistivity.|$|E
30|$|Conclusively, the {{combined}} {{interpretation of the}} <b>electrical</b> <b>logs</b> and the gamma log reveal {{that there is no}} clear indication of existence of any zone in this borehole favorable for hydro-fracturing neither within the Togo-sequence nor within the underlying Dahomeyan formation.|$|R
30|$|The three nearly uniform <b>electrical</b> <b>logs</b> {{indicate}} weathering down {{to approximately}} 16  m depth by showing very low resistances/resistivities to that depth, marked by (a) on Fig.  4 a and b. Obviously, the weathering has not caused {{a change in}} the gamma radiation compared to the radiation pattern in the hard rock below 16  m depth. The high resistance/resistivity of the uppermost section above zone (a) is most probably because of the section being a dry top soil layer followed by a gradually more saturated saprock above a water table at 8  m depth. This explanation is based on the fact, that water was filled into the borehole just before the geophysical logging was conducted {{in order to be able}} to measure the <b>electrical</b> <b>logs</b> within the whole open rock profile.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} how I have researched and developed new methods for {{the prediction of}} rock physical properties using genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic (GAFL).   These techniques are improvements on conventional methods providing two original but dissimilar tools for formation evaluation and reservoir characterisation. The premise behind the use of fuzzy logic {{in this context is}} that a reservoir can be broken down into several lithotypes, each having characteristic statistical distributions for <b>electrical</b> <b>log</b> values.   Fuzzy logic attempt to uncover the relationships between these distributions.   Genetic algorithms use a feedback technique that assumes a continuous functional relationship between the <b>electrical</b> <b>log</b> values and rock properties, generating and testing equations that fit predicted and observed responses.   Complex non-linear equations are “evolved” until the best fit is obtained.   Genetic algorithms provide the functional form of the equation as well as the constant parameters of the relationship. I have modified conventional GAFL techniques {{so that they can be}} more precisely calibrated and applied to geoscience problems more successfully.   This research analysed the characteristics of large data sets from several North Sea and Middle Eastern fields, and led to the design of software that automatically calibrates GAFL in a way that is less sensitive to noise and data outliers.   I describe the applications of these new techniques to permeability, litho-facies, porosity and shear velocity prediction;  the repair of poor <b>electrical</b> <b>logs</b> and the modelling of shaly sand equations. Permeability governs the movement of fluids through reservoir rocks and is therefore a critical input into reservoir models.   Permeability estimation is extremely challenging, as it is difficult to measure directly using current sub-surface logging technology.   GAFL was applied to predict permeability in the Northern North Sea oil fields.   The newly developed software provides an important and visual indication of the uncertainty associated with the predicted permeabilities.

40|$|The Qaidam basin {{is a large}} basin {{in western}} China where the {{thickness}} of Quaternary deposits has a range of 2000 - 3000 m at its subsiding depocentre. This study investigated the chronology of the Quaternary deposits, including palaeomagnetics, biostratigraphic correlation, rates of sediment accumulation, seismic reflection surveys and electrical property correlations. The results give a full interpretation of ages for the sequence from bottom to top. The oldest sequence age was defined by the first appearance of Microlimnocythere sinensis Huang, and {{was placed in the}} Gauss Epoch, estimated at approximately 3 Ma by extrapolation of accumulation rates. The M/G boundary occurs {{at the base of the}} third fossil zone of Ostracoda (the first appearance of Qinghaicypris crassa Huang), or at the marker layer K- 10 of the <b>electrical</b> <b>log</b> in the Sebei anticline area, considered here to be 2. 48 Ma. The Olduvai event in the fifth fossil zone, spanning electrical layers K- 4 and K- 3 in the Sebei area, occurs at reflection layer T- 0 (- 1) of seismic stratigraphy which could be stratigraphically correlated in the whole basin. The boundary of Early/Middle Pleistocene such as the Brunhes and Matsuyama (B/M) boundary, falls within the eighth fossil zone and coincides with electrical marker K- 0 (1). Two boundaries corresponding to Middle/Late Pleistocene and Pleistocene/Holocene occur at the bases of the 11 th and 12 th biozones respectively, neither of which can be correlated with seismic stratigraphy and <b>electrical</b> <b>logs</b> in the basin due to the lack of widely distributed lacustrine deposits since the Middle Pleistocene. The ages of the boundaries can be tested by deposition rates of different facies derived from the varves and synchronous deposits. As a result, geochronological sequences of subsurface stratigraphy could be established within a basin-wide area on the synchronology of seismic reflectors and correlations of <b>electrical</b> <b>logs</b> as well as biozones.

40|$|Electrical and {{acoustic}} image logs collected from well 58 A- 10 in crystalline rock {{on the eastern}} margin of the Coso Geothermal Field, CA, reveal different populations of planar structures intersecting the borehole. <b>Electrical</b> image <b>logs</b> appear {{to be sensitive to}} variations in mineralogy, porosity, and fluid content that highlight both natural fractures and rock fabrics. These fabric elements account for about 50 % of the total population of planar structures seen in the <b>electrical</b> image <b>log,</b> but locally approach 100 %. This fabric is unlikely to contribute to permeability in the reservoir. Acoustic image logs reveal a similar natural fracture population, but generally image slightly fewer fractures, and do not reveal rock fabric. Both logs also record textural properties of deformed materials within fractures; these textures can be related to variations in mineralogy, alteration, or porosity using the <b>electrical</b> <b>log</b> and can be used to infer slip history. In addition, locations of high fracture density occur adjacent to major faults, but also occur as zones confined within intervals of distinct rock type. The {{acoustic image}} logs collected in Well 58 A 10 reveal large numbers of drilling-induced borehole wall tensile fractures and breakouts. In addition, previously un-recognized drilling-induced petal-centerline fractures are evident in images of the borehole wall from this well. These features are thought to form just ahead of the drill bit and provide additional constraint on the orientation of the minimum horizontal stress. Both breakouts and petal-centerline fractures are difficult to identify in <b>electrical</b> image <b>logs</b> because of the low percentage of the borehole wall imaged. Analysis of induced structures in acoustic image logs indicates that the minimum horizontal stress is oriented along an azimuth of 102 º± 18 º.

Since there is no corresponding gamma radiation maximum at that depth section the resistivity minimum is not due to a lithological change but an indication of fracturing/weathering. However, this is a far too shallow depth for hydro-fracturing operation because of risk for pressure blow-up through the nearby overburden and a subsequent collapse or inflow of soil material from the overburden.|$|R

Though, since not lower than in the upper part of the fresh Togo-sequence from 15 to 22  m and also having the same high gamma radiation, the relatively lower resistance/resistivities between 40 and 50  m most probably is caused by a change in lithology from a quarzitic rock above 40  m to a schistose type of rock below 40  m depth and further down to the Dahomeyan at 52  m depth.|$|R

30|$|The lithological log is {{not having}} any {{information}} on the weathered mantle other than the 6  m thick lateritic soil layer at the top, which is reflected on the three completely uniform <b>electrical</b> <b>logs</b> Fig.  3 a and b, as having very low resistance/resistivities. However, the el-logs also indicate by still showing low, but slightly higher resistance/resistivities down to 14  m depth, marked by (a) on Fig.  3 a and b, that high degree of weathering continue into {{the upper part of}} the Togo-sequence. It is noteworthy that this 14  m thick mantle of lateritic soil and highly weathered, thus clayey rock with generally low resistance/resistivities does not correspond to a similar unambiguous pattern in the gamma radiation, e.g., a generally high radiation.|$|R

30|$|Hydrofracturing of low-yielding {{boreholes}} in hard rocks is {{a widely}} used technique in Africa for improvement of yield, thus making them qualified for installation of a hand-pump for domestic water supply. However, the success rate of the hydrofracturing campaigns seems not to be that high as generally claimed by contractors. One reason amongst others might be that the selection of zones for hydrofracturing in the individual borehole is based on pre-hydrofracturing investigation using conventional electrical logs only. Thereby, the zones selected are the occurring resistivity minima interpreted as weak zones with some fracturing. However, resistivity minima can also be caused solely by lithological reasons, which then in most cases could have been seen on a gamma log as corresponding increased gamma radiation. The advantages of using gamma logging in combination with conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>logging</b> technique for prediction of fractured zones in basement rocks is illustrated by investigations of three low-yielding boreholes located in different geological environments in crystalline basement rocks in Ghana.|$|E
30|$|Crystalline {{basement}} {{rocks are}} igneous or metamorphic rocks, where the inter-granular pore spaces are negligible {{and almost all}} groundwater flow takes place through cracks and fractures in the rocks (Banks and Robins 2002; Wright, 1992). In Ghana groundwater {{has proven to be}} the most economic and feasible source of portable water to dispersed rural communities (Gyau-Boakye and Dapaah-Siakwan 1999) and towns, which are not easily accessible to or with inadequate supply of treated surface water. Groundwater availability within the weathered and deeper fracture zones depend on the thickness and extension of the fractured sections, sustainable and the relative depth of the water table. The thicker the weathering profile, the more sustainable the water-bearing potential. However, due to the complex interactions of the various factors affecting weathering and fracturing, water-bearing zones may not be present at all at some locations (MacDonald and Davies 2000). These fracture zones in hard rock environment play an essential and critical role in fluid flow within the subsurface, such as the movement and accumulation of groundwater as well as transport of contaminants (Karous and Mares 1988). Geophysical borehole logging is a subsurface technique that has applications {{in a wide range of}} fields such as geotechnical, hydrogeological, mining or hydrocarbon investigations. Its application can be found in areas such as identification of lithology and correlating stratigraphy where cores have not been recovered from all of the boreholes at the site (Monier-Williams et al. 2009). According to Telford et al. (1990) electrical log is the oldest geophysical logging technique that measures the formation electrical properties in the vicinity of the borehole. It is important to note that conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>logging</b> can only be run in open fluid-filled portion of the borehole (Keys 1997). Among the <b>electrical</b> <b>logging</b> suite are the resistivity and SPR logs which can investigate the formation resistivity and resistance, respectively, of a geologic medium (Telford et al. 1990). They can be used to identify fractures or shear zones that may contain water or conductive minerals (e.g., graphite, massive sulfides, etc.) in hard rocks (Telford et al. 1990). These borehole logging tools offer one of the most reliable ways of detecting fractured sections intercepted by the borehole, since some of these fractures may be masked and detected as a single anomaly during a surface geophysical measurements (Agyekum 2009; Awini 2009; Ratnakar and Singh 2008; Krishnamurthy et al. 2003; Lee et al. 1991; Lee 1985). Gamma log is an important and standard nuclear radiation logging tool, which can be operated in both cased and opened boreholes filled with air, water or drilling fluid, giving them an advantage over <b>electrical</b> <b>logging</b> suites (Kearey et al. 2002; Driscoll 1986). The gamma log device is a passive system without a radioactive source and it provides a continuous record of the amount of natural gamma radiation emitted by the intercepted geologic material of the borehole. It is generally used as one of the primary tool for lithological investigation (Keys 1997). For instance in Ghana, Agyekum et al. (2013) deployed the natural gamma detectors embedded in the five exploratory logging tools to investigate significant discrepancies between the logging results and the driller’s/geologist’s logs results on reported drilled depths, construction depths, and screen settings of boreholes in the Voltaian sedimentary rocks.|$|E
30|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of resistivity logging-while-drilling (LWD) tool response in complex borehole environments {{is of great}} importance for interpretation of measurement data and characterization of oil reservoirs. The simulation results can provide important theoretical guidance for designing novel <b>electrical</b> <b>logging</b> instruments and interpreting real-time logging data. In this paper, higher-order vector finite element method {{had been used to}} investigate the resistivity LWD tool response by changing coils spacing, transmitting frequency and structure of antenna system in the anisotropic formation. Numerical simulation results indicate that the change of T–R 1 spacing is an obvious influence on the investigation depth and detecting precision of the resistivity LWD tool, and the change of R 1 –R 2 spacing can affect the resolution of the thin-layer distinguish. The change of transmitting frequency can improve the resolution of low-resistivity formation and high-resistivity formation of resistivity LWD tool. The change {{of the structure of the}} antenna system can provide accurate geosteering drilling information to directional resistivity LWD tool. Simulation results also indicated that the higher-order vector finite element method has good convergence speed and calculation accuracy and it is suitable to simulate the response of resistivity LWD tools.|$|E

Comparing saturation from Archie with the one from Sigma log taken 2  years after the convectional logging in Well- 1 showed that there was mud dissipation and oil reoccupation of the vacant pores. The Sigma log taken 4  years later confirmed the oil movement during production. The water saturation from Sigma log indicated that the zone of interest contained 20 – 25 % water saturation which confirmed the core interpretation.|$|R

30|$|With {{regard to}} the <b>electrical</b> <b>logging</b> {{technology}} in the petroleum industry, almost all {{research has focused on}} the detection and interpretation of formation resistivity. However, more and more complex and unconventional reservoirs have been discovered, and the traditional, simple geophysical conductive model cannot solve the problems of strongly heterogeneous reservoirs, such as low porosity and low permeability oil reservoirs, tight oil zones, and shale gas zones. Although scholars have proposed various solutions and models for some important questions to describe the electrical conductivity mechanism in rocks (Chelidze and Gueguen 1999; Chelidze et al. 1999; Asami 2002), it is increasingly difficult to accurately determine fluid types and calculate the saturation of hydrocarbon. In 1988, Clark et al. proposed an electromagnetic propagation tool (EPT) to measure the dielectric constant of the formation at frequencies of 2  MHz– 1.1  GHz (Glover et al. 1994 a, b, 1996; Clark et al. 1990). This method can identify fluid types and calculate the fluid saturation in high porosity and high permeability reservoirs. Dong and Wang (2009) studied the dielectric constant of several common minerals, including quartz, calcite, and dolomite, within a frequency range from Hz to GHz level, and they identified pore structures and the distribution of formation water using the dielectric constant. In 1985, Lockner and Byerlee (1985) studied the complex resistivity of rocks; later, other scholars also studied the complex resistivity of rocks. However, due to the extraordinarily complex heterogeneity of porous rocks, there are still many disputes over the conductive and dielectric mechanisms in rocks (Clavier et al. 1984; Zemanek 1989; Hamada and Al-Awad 1998). Scholars have proposed many conductive models for rocks, of which the most representative is the dual-water argillaceous sandstone conductive model proposed by Waxman and Smits in 1968 (Waxman and Smits 1968; Knight and Nur 1987; Hassoun et al. 1997).|$|E
40|$|The vadose zone is the {{unsaturated}} zone between the ground surface and water table. This zone is of much importance as {{it acts as}} a link between surface water and ground water. Knowledge of soil moisture in this zone is very much essential to understand the meteorologic, hydrologic and agronomic process. Flow and transport in the {{unsaturated zone}} are more complex compared to saturated medium, as the pores in unsaturated zone are partly filled by air and partly by water. Most of vadose zone studies are done on agricultural plots where anthropogenic activities govern the vadose zone flows. Vadose zone studies in natural pristine conditions such as in forested areas where no anthropogenic activities are present are very limited that too in Indian conditions are rare. The present research work deals with understanding of the flow behavior in the vadose zone in a small experimental forested watershed called Mule Hole. Mule Hole watershed is 4. 5 km 2 and located in Bandipur National Park in Chamrajnagar District of Karnataka state, {{in the southern part}} of India. The forest is of deciduous type with 3 to 4 months of leafless dry period. The watershed has mean annual 25 years rainfall of 1120 mm and mean yearly temperature is 27 o. The rainfall pattern is bimodal i. e. it receives rainfall during South West Monsoon (June -September) and North East Monsoon (October – December) with dominant rainfall occurring during South West Monsoon. Human activity is minimal as watershed is a part of Bandipur National Park, dedicated to wildlife and biodiversity preservation. The watershed consists of around 80 % of red soils, and black soil and saprolite covering the rest. The first part of the study involves soil moisture measurements by neutron probe and electrical resistivity measurements by geophysical method and their linking, i. e. developing volumetric soil moisture vs electrical resistivity relationship. The second part of the study involves application of neutron probe soil moisture measurement in identifying relationship between soil and erosion in the watershed. The third part involves development of two dimensional (2 D) vadose zone model for watershed and validating it with measured data. The last part involves development of three dimensional model of watershed and validating it with observed data. Vadose zone is briefly described in chapter 1 along with its governing equations. Different soil moisture measurement techniques including invasive and non – invasive ones are also discussed. Different vadose zone modeling software which are public domain as well as commercial ones are also discussed. The chapter ends with organization of this thesis. Chapter 2 reviews relevant literature related to this study with focus on soil moisture measurement techniques and vadose zone flow modeling. Different soil moisture measurement techniques, their applications and limitations are reviewed. In the soil moisture measurement techniques, invasive and non – invasive types are reviewed. In the modeling part, different vadose zone models for 2 D and 3 D flow along with its applications and limitations are reviewed. Also a brief review about application of HYDRUS 2 D/ 3 D model is done which is used for the vadose zone modeling in this thesis. Chapter 3 introduces study area Mule Hole watershed, which is a forested watershed located in Bandipur National Park, Karnataka. India. The watershed has mean annual 25 years rainfall of 1120 mm and mean yearly temperature is 27 o. The watershed has average regolith thickness or vadose zone of 17 m with roots of the trees able to penetrate up to groundwater. A toposequence T 1 is identified in the watershed which has red soil – black soil confluence where soil moisture measurements and electrical resistivity measurements are carried out. The toposequence consists of 8 layers with organic layer forming the top layer followed by 3 red soil layer with 2 black soil layers intruding from stream into red soil layers and sandy weathered horizon at base of red and black soil. Also a sandy horizon at the top of black soil. Soil moisture measurements with neutron probe and electrical resistivity measurements with <b>electrical</b> <b>logging</b> tool which are done on toposequence periodically for two years are explained and the data are presented in this chapter. These data are used for validation of vadose zone models. Chapter 4 discusses in detail about comparison of electrical resistivity by geophysical method and neutron probe logging for soil moisture monitoring in a forested watershed. The electrical resistivity data and soil moisture data are compared for different soils and existence of relationship between them are studied and discussed in this chapter. For the red soil, existence of relationship between volumetric soil moisture content and electrical resistivity is found. Chapter 5 discusses soil moisture measurements as a tool to study erosion processes in forested watershed. Hydrodynamic behavior of the red soil – black soil system at toposequence T 1 is studied using neutron probe soil moisture measurements. Two distinctive types of erosional landforms have been identified at T 1 viz, rotational slips (Type 1); seepage erosion (Type 2),which are highlighted by neutron probe soil moisture measurements. Based on the observations relative chronology of formulation of different soil horizons are studied, which guided in developing four-stage model showing the relative chronology in the recent formation of the soil cover at downslope. Chapter 6 discusses application of 2 D vadose zone modeling using HYDRUS – 2 D model at two experimental sites in forested watershed where soil moisture monitoring and groundwater monitoring have been conducted. At the first site, which is toposequence T 1 in the forested watershed, where soil moisture measurements are done, three case studies for comparison of daily scale data with hourly scale data and effects of internal layering by clubbing red soil layers and black soil layers to equivalent red soil and black soil layers respectively are performed. The model is run for two years. In that, first year results are used for calibrating the model where measured soil moisture content data are used to get soil hydraulic parameters for all the three cases by inverse modeling using Marquardt – Levenberg algorithm which is a part of HYDRUS 2 D. The parameters thus obtained fall under particular soil range and performed efficiently in predicting soil moisture content. The second year results of model run is used for validation of the model in all the three cases where simulated soil moisture content is compared with measured soil moisture content. It is found that model is performing well and match between measured and simulated soil moisture contents is good in all the three cases. It can be said that having hourly scale data with detailed layering information is always advantageous in modeling soil moisture content. But, in absence of hourly scale data or finer scale data and absence of detailed layering information, the soil moisture model can also perform well. The scale of data and detailed layering information has minimal effect on soil moisture modeling. At the second site ERT profile near the watershed outlet has five monitoring wells are available and all layering information regarding regolith and hard rock layer distribution profiles. The soil hydraulic parameters obtained at toposequence T 1 for soil and sandy weathered horizon are used and tested at this site to simulate the groundwater levels. The parameter for rock layer is estimated by testing different hydraulic parameters from HYDRUS database. The results are validated using observed groundwater levels at the site. The results show significant match between observed and simulated groundwater levels. Chapter 7 discusses 3 D modeling of Mule Hole forested watershed using HYDRUS – 3 D model. A three layer model of Mule Hole along with its topographic details is modeled. The layering information is derived from geophysical study done at 12 Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) profiles distributed in the watershed. The three layers considered are top soil layer followed by sandy weathered layer and bottom rock layer. Anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity, root water uptake and sloping water table are introduced to make the model more realistic. Soil hydraulic parameters obtained during 2 D vadose zone modeling of toposequence T 1 are used initially for soil and sandy weathered layers and are subsequently tuned to make model more efficient. Different scenarios are considered to test flux as well as constant head boundary conditions and effect of different porosities for rock layer. The model is run for 7 years and model simulations are validated with observed groundwater levels from monitoring wells across the watershed. The result shows good fit between simulated and observed groundwater levels especially for monitoring well which has shallow groundwater level. It is found that porosity in the rock layer is not uniform and there exist different porosities for the rock layer across the watershed. Also the distribution of sandy weathered zone requires improvement. The model is also able to predict ET closer to ET predicted by COMFORT model which was developed earlier. Also the model shows rise in groundwater fluxes as groundwater starts replenishing. Over all, the 3 D model of Mule Hole watershed in HYDRUS – 3 D worked well with satisfactory results and HYDRUS – 3 D can be used for modeling small forested watersheds.

The applicability of these parameters in reservoir calculations is, in many cases, reservoir specific. Therefore, {{it is imperative that}} determination of these parameters in the laboratory should be conducted on selective core samples that represent the distinctive rock types and geologic facies. An experimental program has been conducted to determine the electrical and petrophysical parameters of Shu’aiba carbonate reservoir, which is located in southeastern Saudi Arabia. Shu’aiba reservoir is a heterogeneous carbonate formation with various facies due to digenetic alteration of the original rock fabric. The measured electrical and petrophysical properties include formation resistivity factor FRF, cementation exponent m, saturation exponent n, porosity φ, permeability K, capillary pressure Pc, and irreducible water saturation Swir. The results revealed that changes in electrical {{parameters are}} accompanied by changes in rock type and geologic facies.

While {{a detailed analysis of}} the chemical composition of a geothermal fluid can only be obtained from a water sample, an {{estimate of}} the total dissolved solids (TDS) in equivalent sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration can be obtained from well logs. TDS can also be useful in geological correlation between wells. TDS can be determined directly from a pulsed neutron log and a porosity log, (if the type of formation is known), or from the water resistivity, R{sub w}, and the temperature, T. Three approaches are used to find R{sub w}, and thus TDS. The first method uses a dual induction focused log and information from the log heading. Next, is found by employing an <b>electrical</b> <b>log</b> and a porosity log. The last approach utilizes the spontaneous potential log and header data.

Electric logging and wireline survey methods are fully developed techniques for measuring the parameters needed to assess a geopressured zone before setting casing. Formation subsidence, though it may be slow to develop can be measured using radioactivity tracer surveys. The reports states three conclusions. (1) Existing well logging and surveying methods and equipment are generally satisfactory for testing and sampling and sampling a geothermal-geopressured resource. (2) No significant areas of research are needed to predict, detect, and evaluate geopressured formations for their potential as geothermal resources. (3) Static and dynamic testing procedures using existing technology are satisfactory to test, sample and analyze a geopressured reservoir. [DJE 2005...|$|R
