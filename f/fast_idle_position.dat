40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a valve arrangement, in particular {{for use in}} pneumatic controls. Since pneumatically activated actuators have a certain leakage rate, the control valve (pilot valve) must remain in permanently open state {{in order to maintain}} the actuator in the open position. This requires high holding forces. The valve arrangement according to the invention, however, consumes energy only for the switchover process from one state to the other and can maintain the selected state without the use of any energy. This is achieved by means of an inlet and an outlet valve, whereby at least the inlet valve is a microvalve which has an <b>idle</b> <b>position</b> in addition to the open and the closed <b>positions.</b> In the <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> there is a gap between the closing element and the valve seat of the microvalve, said gap being so dimensioned that the leakage rate of the actuator is compensated by the gas flowing through the gap. No energy is consumed in the <b>idle</b> <b>position</b> assumed by the valve when n o external forces are acting on it. In a special design, the valve closes automatically when a defined pressure difference exists...|$|R

50|$|The issue {{involves}} a friction device in the pedal {{designed to provide}} the proper “feel” by adding resistance and making the pedal steady and stable. This friction device includes a “shoe” that rubs against an adjoining surface during normal pedal operation. Due to the materials used, wear and environmental conditions, these surfaces may, over time, begin to stick and release instead of operating smoothly. In some cases, friction could increase {{to a point that}} the pedal is slow to return to the <b>idle</b> <b>position</b> or, in rare cases, the pedal sticks, leaving the throttle partially open.|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, the throttle plate rotates within the throttle body, opening the throttle passage to allow more air into the intake manifold. Usually an airflow sensor measures this change and communicates with the ECU.

Often a throttle position sensor (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the throttle plate to provide the ECU with information on whether the throttle is in the <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> wide-open throttle (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.|$|R

Simulation results show that it provides significantly <b>faster</b> <b>idle</b> channel detection than conventional single-stage random searching. Several system-level issues are also investigated including the settling time of the phase-locked loop (PLL) in the frequency synthesizer, which determines the channel switching time.

50|$|There are {{two primary}} types of {{throttle}} position sensors (TPS): a potentiometer or a non-contact sensor Hall Effect sensor (magnetic device). A potentiometer is a satisfactory way for non-critical {{applications such as}} volume control on a radio, but as it has a wiper contact rubbing against a resistance element, dirt and wear between the wiper and the resistor can cause erratic readings. The more reliable solution is the magnetic coupling, which makes no physical contact, so will never be subject to failing by wear. This is an insidious failure as it may not provide any symptoms until there is total failure. All cars having a TPS have {{what is known as}} a 'limp-home-mode'. When the car goes into the limp-home-mode it is because the accelerator and engine control computer and the throttle are not talking to each other {{in a way that they}} can understand.
