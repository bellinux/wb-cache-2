25|$|A ban on absinthe {{was enacted}} in Germany on 27 March 1923. In {{addition}} to banning {{the production of}} and commercial trade in absinthe, the law {{went so far as}} to prohibit the distribution of printed matter that provided details of its production. The original ban was lifted in 1981, but the use of Artemisia absinthium as a <b>flavouring</b> <b>agent</b> remained prohibited. On 27 September 1991, Germany adopted the European Union's standards of 1988, which effectively re-legalised absinthe. Unlike Switzerland and France, there are no further restrictions.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{liquorice}} {{is used as}} a <b>flavouring</b> <b>agent</b> for tobacco, particularly US blend cigarettes, {{to which}} liquorice lends a natural sweetness and a distinctive flavour and makes it easier to inhale the smoke by creating bronchodilators, which open up the lungs. [...] Liquorice flavours are also used as candies or sweeteners, particularly in some European and Middle Eastern countries. Liquorice extracts have a number of medical uses, and they are also used in herbal and folk medications. Excessive consumption of liquorice (more than 2mg/kg/day of pure glycyrrhizinic acid, a liquorice component) may result in adverse effects, and overconsumption should be suspected clinically in patients presenting with otherwise unexplained hypokalemia and muscle weakness.|$|E
50|$|Flavoured syrups {{are made}} by infusing simple syrups with <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> during the cooking process. A wide variety of <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> can be used, often in {{combination}} with each other, such as herbs (rosemary), spices (chipotle chilis; cardamom), or aromatics (orange peel; lemongrass; ginger). For instance, syrupus aromaticus is prepared by adding certain quantities of orange flavouring and cinnamon water to simple syrup. This type of syrup is commonly used at coffee bars, especially in the United States, to make flavoured drinks. Infused simple syrups {{can be used to}} create desserts, or, to add sweetness and depth of flavour to cocktails.|$|R

40|$|In a 5 x 5 Latin {{square with}} 12 -day periods, 35 {{yearling}} Hereford steers, 358 +or- 32 kg, {{were randomly assigned}} to one of 5 groups to estimate the effects of adding <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> to grass-legume silage at feeding time. <b>Flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> chosen represented major taste groups: sweet (0. 025 % aspartame (Asp) as fed), acid (0. 625 % hydrochloric acid (HCl) as fed), salt (0. 6 % sodium chloride (NaCl) as fed) and monosodium glutamate (MSG at 1 % as fed). Daily intakes were measured. Monosodium glutamate increased silage intake (P< 0. 05). It is suggested that adding MSG may be of possible practical use as a silage additive to increase silage intake by yearling steers. ...|$|R
2500|$|Most {{liquorice}} {{is used as}} a <b>flavouring</b> <b>agent</b> for tobacco. For example, M Worldwide {{reported in}} 2011 that about 63% of its liquorice product sales are to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavour enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of American blend cigarettes, moist snuff, chewing tobacco, and pipe tobacco. [...] American blend cigarettes made up a larger portion of worldwide tobacco consumption in earlier years, and the percentage of liquorice products used by the tobacco industry was higher in the past. M Worldwide sold approximately 73% of its liquorice products to the tobacco industry in 2005. A consultant to M Worldwide's predecessor company stated in 1975 that it was believed that well over 90% of the total production of liquorice extract and its derivatives found its way into tobacco products.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{deals with}} the various aspects of {{commonly}} used <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> for the preparation of medicaments. Flavour refers to a mixed sensation of taste, touch, smell, sight and sound, all of which involve a combination of physio-chemical and physiological actions that influence the perception of substances.

Descriptive statistics and correspondence analysis (CA) were used for data analysis. The following food categories were identified: dough, gruel, drinks (from pulp); sauces (from leaves, seeds and kernels), and <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents</b> (from kernels). CA showed that the food use of baobab parts varies among ethnic groups. Most ethnic groups have similar opinions about the difficulty of certain processing operations, in particular seed decortication, grinding and sieving operations for product recovery.

50|$|Papad can be {{prepared}} from different ingredients and methods. Arguably, the most popular recipe uses flour ground from hulled split black grams (urad dal). Black gram flour is mixed with black pepper, salt, and {{a small amount of}} vegetable oil and a food-grade alkalai, and the mixture is kneaded. A well-kneaded dough is then flattened into very thin rounds and then dried and stored for later preparation and consumption. Papad may also contain rice, jackfruit, sabudana, etc., as main ingredients. Cracked black pepper, red chilli powder, asafoetida, or cumin or sesame seeds are often used as <b>flavouring</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
