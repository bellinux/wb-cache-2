40|$|The length {{measurement}} technique for the storage ring at the Sychroton Radiation Research Center (SRRC) {{is based on}} <b>invar</b> <b>wire.</b> To keep the alignment tolerance in the ± 0. 10 mm range for the magnets along the 120 m circumference, the calibration and length measurement accuracy for the <b>invar</b> <b>wire</b> {{should be in the}} range of ± 0. 03 mm. Major contributed errors in both calibration and length measurement are identified. To minimize the errors we have implemented certain improvements in the area of instruments, fixtures and baseline. After we reduce systematic errors through the hardware approach, the computation chart is introduced to compensate to the systematic errors. From network analysis, the result is very consistent in both length and angular measurements. 1...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{concepts}} of precision surveying are briefly reviewed, and an historical account is given of instruments and techniques {{used during the}} construction of the Proton Synchrotron (1954 - 59), the Intersecting Storage Rings (1966 - 71), and the Super Proton Synchrotron (1971). A nylon wire device, distinvar, <b>invar</b> <b>wire</b> and tape, and recent automation of the gyrotheodolite and distinvar as well as auxiliary equipment (polyurethane jacks, Centipede) are discussed in detail. The paper ends summarizing the present accuracy in accelerator metrology, giving an outlook of possible improvement, and some aspects of staffing for the CERN Survey Group. (0 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|The task of {{establishing}} a new base line in the northwest of The Netherlands was entrusted to the subcommission Triangulation of the Netherlands Geodetic Commission. The measurements themselves were performed under supervision {{of members of the}} staff of the Netherlands Triangulation Service (Mr. HAARSMA) and of the Sub-Department of Geodesy of the Delft University of Technology (Messrs. BAKKER, KRIJGER and DE MUNCK). The first stage of their work consisted of a detailed reconnaissance, test measurements, and an examination of the precision attainable in the measurement of the base and its extension to a side of the primary network. The results of these studies were laid down in a report submitted to the subcommission Triangulation. This preliminary report, parts of which are included in the present report, was discussed and approved in full by the Netherlands Geodetic Commission at a meeting held in December, 1964. The actual measurements were carried out under the responsibility of the authors of this publication. Mr. HAARSMA {{was in charge of the}} preparations and angle measurements, Mr. BAKKER of the <b>invar</b> <b>wire</b> measurements, Mr. DE MUNCK of the geodimeter measurements and Mr. KRIJGER of the theoretical studies. In accordance with their duties they made the following contributions to the present report: Mr. HAARSMA: Introduction, section...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{we have seen a}} {{worldwide}} increase in the demand for electric conductors which have a large transmission capacity to meet rapidly growing electricity consumption. The use of ZTACIR (Aluminum Conductor Invar Reinforced) can double the capacity of overhead power transmission line without extra infrastructure construction. In particular, aluminum clad <b>invar</b> alloy <b>wire,</b> which is highly resistant to corrosion, reduces transmission loss, and produces less CO 2 emissions, is increasingly demanded. The authors have worked to develop a high-strength aluminum clad <b>invar</b> alloy <b>wire</b> by enhancing the durability of the conventional <b>invar</b> alloy <b>wire.</b> The newly developed wire is as strong as steel wire and can therefore be used as the core wire of high voltage overhead transmission line. This paper features the characteristics of the developed <b>invar</b> alloy <b>wire...</b>|$|R

A "distinvar" device, invented by the group, using calibrated <b>invar</b> <b>wires</b> stretched between the fixed survey pillar (on the left) and a fixed point on the magnet.

40|$|Current {{techniques}} for manual and automated determination of decametre-range are reviewed from information gained by extensive literature search and from visits {{made to a}} wide cross section of European establishments concerned with large-scale dimensional measurements. The reviews, which contain nearly 200 references, provide background information needed by systems designers. A 12 m steel measuring base is described which was length stabilised to within 3 parts in 10 for periods in excess of 500 hours. Temperature of the internal water flow is monitored by a contact thermometer which controls the heat input. The {{theory and practice of}} tensioned-wire dimensional transducers are given which enables this new-class of dimensional measuring instrument to be designed. Two distinct groups of instrument described are those for transducing continuous length changes into electrical signals with better than 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 error and those for detecting changes of 1 part in 10 ^ 10 or smaller, of a nominally fixed length. Continuous subdivision transducers with 12 m and 1 m range are reported which incorporate mechanical mechanisms for obtaining adjustable absolute length, reduction of in-scale accuracy, errors, linear rotary output, rapid following response and simple temperature compensation. A method and practical apparatus are described which uses this type of transducer for automatic control of the position of a workhea moved on a cartesian-frame manipulator. Actual two-dimensional position is measured on a trilateral basis, a technique which eliminates the need for a massive framework when machining or inspecting large workpieces. In-situ numerically-controlled machining is possible with this system. A second frameless technique is described for automatically recording roundness variations of large rings or spigots. Repeatability of 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 or better has been proven to be possible with inexpensive equipment. This method illustrates the use of deformation wire-transducers for dynamic dimensional measurement. A similar type of instrument was used for creep determination of invariwires and carbon-fibres supported on the 12 m base. Results are given which have shown that 1 part in 10 ^ 8 length stability is attainable over considerable periods. It is shown that measurement of earth strains is possible with an <b>invar</b> <b>wire</b> tensioned by a simple beam-balance. Details are given of an experiment performed in a tunnel in which solid-earth tidal strains are recorded within hours of installation. Several other possible applications are discussed for which tensioned-wire transducers seem suited. The use of position-sensitive photocells in dimensional metrology is outlined with particular reference to wire transducers where linear and rotary movements may need monitoring. It is shown that they are a simple and economic way to measure small displacements of millimetre range...|$|E
