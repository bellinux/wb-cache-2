To process variously workpiece according to shape, size and materials, the rotating and contacting forces of the developed grinding machine can be changed by air pressure. The surface roughness of processed workpiece can be also attained to state of mirror <b>face</b> by <b>grinding</b> precisely the sliding face with changing the rotating speed of diamond wheel. It is possible to {{be attached to the}} various machine tools because the super-mirror <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> machine using variable air pressure is a small size. The grinding efficiency is elevated because it can be worked by two or more grinding machines attached to concurrently a machine tool for the large workpiece. In this study, results show that the cusp height of the super-mirror <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> machine for the particle size of 100 and 1500 No. /mm 2 is lower than that of the conventional one because the vibration is reduced by rotating very fast the diamond wheel with a pressed air and it can be processed by rotating the diamond wheel with a constantly varied air pressure perpendicular to workpiece surface, and that the workpiece in the super-mirror <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> machine for the particle size of 3000 No. /mm 2 can be processed to state of mirror face that is rarely seen by the cusp height. It is also found that the surface hardness of both the conventional and the super-mirror <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> machines are increased as the particle size of diamond wheel is reduced...|$|R

There are several developments for grinding wheels and methods for determining optimum grinding parameters which enable good surface properties to be obtained. Another potential to achieve better surface quality for dry grinding is the intentional change in process kinematics. This change makes it possible to carry out the task of cooling, namely lubrication of the contact area, and cooling and evacuation of the chips. This paper proposes innovative face-grinding kinematics in order to improve the surface properties for {{tool grinding}}.

40|$|Grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manufacturing processes, especially when high surface qualities have to be realized or if hard or brittle materials have to be machined. Often the grinding performance is limited by workpiece failure due to a high thermal load in the contact zone. Therefore structured or patterned grinding wheels are frequently used to reduce the thermal load in the contact zone. In this paper a new patterning method will be introduced by using a fly-cutting kinematic for the structuring process. In <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> experiments the patterned grinding wheels showed great potential to enhance the overall grinding performance by significantly decreasing process forces and grinding burn. The reduction of the thermal load in the contact zone can be explained by an improved coolant flow through the contact zone, which was measured with a specially designed coolant collecting bin...|$|R

In respect to the main sources of residual stress generation, i. e., plastic and thermal deformation, machining process was carried out in two types of cooling environment. The results indicate significant influence of heat removal since differences between the two grinding modes are virtually nonexistent for liquid cooling, whereas dry grinding results in higher compressive normal residual stresses for down-cut mode in comparison to the up-cut...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} paper, a novel {{conditioning}} method for superabrasive grinding wheels based on surface structuring with ultrashort pulsed lasers is investigated. A picosecond laser (pulse duration tp = 10 ps) is utilised to ablate regular micro patterns into {{the surface of}} CBN grinding tools, aiming to reduce grinding forces and improve grinding efficiency. The proposed structuring method enables {{a high degree of}} control and flexibility regarding pattern geometry and feature size. An analysis of the ablated structures does not reveal any significant thermal deterioration of the abrasive grits resulting from the laser process. Grinding performance and wear behaviour of the structured tools are tested in a <b>face</b> <b>grinding</b> process of hardened steel type 100 Cr 6 (60 HRC). The test results show that the structured tools enable between 25 to 50 % lower forces and significantly improve force stability in long-term grinding operation, due to an enhanced self-sharpening effect of the tool. However, the best surface finish is still achieved with the non-structured tools. The experimental results further indicate that the pattern geometry has a much stronger influence on the grinding behaviour than the degree of structuring (meaning the percentage of active wheel surface compared to a non-structured tool) ...|$|R
