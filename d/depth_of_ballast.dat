40|$|The {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> railway {{is usually}} {{consisted of a}} graded layer of granular media <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> placed above naturally deposited subgrade. The ballast layer is responsible for limiting the vertical stress magnitudes applied to the weaker subgrade and also prevents the vertical and lateral train-induced sleeper movements. In recent years, the progressive use of faster and heavier trains has compromised the ability <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> to resist such movements due to the increased magnitude <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage (degradation). Therefore, accurate determination <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage is important. The amount <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage can be estimated by comparing the gradation (particle size distribution) curves of fresh and degraded ballast, using a ballast breakage index. However, the Australian railway authorities currently rely on the visual inspection for estimating ballast breakage. Despite {{the fact that the}} visual inspection is convenient, as it does not require transport <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> samples or testing, it is subjective and can lead to uneconomical maintenance cycles. In this paper, an attempt is made to utilise the digital imaging technique for gradation analysis and breakage estimation <b>of</b> <b>ballast.</b> The technique is fast and convenient, and can be applied to both the laboratory and field conditions, hence, can be used successfully to replace the visual inspection <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage...|$|R

50|$|The {{appropriate}} {{thickness of}} {{a layer of}} track ballast depends on the size and spacing of the ties, the amount of traffic on the line, and various other factors. Track ballast should never be laid down less than 150 mm thick; and high-speed railway lines may require ballast up to 1/2 m thick. An insufficient <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> causes overloading of the underlying soil, and in unfavourable conditions overloading the soil causes the track to sink, usually unevenly.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{defective}} wheels and/or irregularities of the rails generate impact forces. Generally vertical impact forces are determined using either field measurement or 2 D simulation models. As part of ongoing research on degradation of wagon-track system, a three-dimensional wagon - track system dynamics (3 DWTSD) model with the potential to predict the simultaneous occurrence of vertical and lateral impact forces has been developed at the Centre for Railway Engineering. The influence of two important track parameters, namely, the sleeper spacing and the ballast depth to the dynamic impact has been examined using the 3 DWTSD model and presented in this paper. The peak vertical and lateral impact forces at the wheel-rail contact patch, and the vertical impact force at the pad, the ballast, the subballast and the sUbgrade are reported in addition to the peak displacements of the track components. The results show that the larger spacing of the sleepers and the lower <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> produce soft track condition which leads to larger track deflection and smaller wheel-rail impact forces...|$|E
40|$|Engineered {{pavements}} are a {{key part}} of the transport asset that includes flexible road pavements, railway formations and airport runways. Their design, construction and maintenance need to be economically and environmentally optimised, while meeting serviceability criteria over the design life of the pavement. The main serviceability criteria used for railway track design are the permanent deformation and track stiffness. Subgrade stiffness influences the design <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> and compacted formation layers are used to improve stiffness and reduce stresses induced in the natural subgrade. The track stiffness also influences vehicle/track interaction and wear, energy required for movement, and ride quality. Knowledge of the stiffness is required for safe and economic design of the railway track structure. Several factors influence the stiffness or resilient modulus of compacted formation material including stress state, material type, and soil physical state (density and water content). A laboratory investigation was conducted on a representative subballast material, at a range of water contents, using a Cyclic Triaxial Apparatus and Cyclic Hollow Cylinder Apparatus to investigate these aspects. The resilient modulus of the clayey sand material reduced as the applied deviator stress increased, and increased under higher confining stresses and matric suction. It was found that the resilient modulus increased by a factor of six due to a reduction in water content, and thus the increase in matric suction. Principal stress rotation, representative of train induced stresses, reduced the measured resilient modulus by approximately 13 % for optimum water content specimens with reducing influence for dry of optimum specimens. The results from this work emphasise the benefit of matric suction, and thus the need for well drained formation layers. They also highlight the risk of reduced stiffness and increased deformation of railway formation subject to long periods of rainfall or wetting and the potential impact of predicted climate change. Simplified stress path testing using a Cyclic Triaxial Apparatus overestimates resilient modulus, especially for saturated material subject to large number of cycles. However, the use of more advanced testing of the resilient modulus using the Cyclic Hollow Cylinder Apparatus is only suggested where high cyclic shear stresses are expected...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringEric J. FitzsimmonsThe rail industry's recent {{shift towards}} larger and heavier railcars has {{influenced}} Class III / short line railroad operation and track maintenance costs. Class III railroads {{earn less than}} $ 38. 1 million in in annual revenue and generally operate first and last leg shipping for their customers. In Kansas, Class III railroads operate approximately 40 percent of the roughly 2, 800 miles (4, 500 km) of rail; however, due to the current Class III track condition they move lighter railcars at lower speeds than Class I railroads. The State of Kansas statutorily allots $ 5 million to support rail improvement projects, primarily for Class III railroads. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to conduct an inventory of Kansas’s Class III rail network to identify the track segments in need of this support that would be most beneficial to the rail system. Representatives of each railroad were contacted and received a survey requesting information regarding the operational and structural status of their systems. The data collected were organized and processed to determine the sections of track that can accommodate the heavier axle load cars that are currently being utilized by Class I railroads. This study identified that Class III railroads shipped over 155, 000 carloads of freight in 2016 and 30 percent of Kansas’s Class III track can currently accommodate heavy axle cars. The increased load from the increased railcar size has also increased the risk of damage to railroad’s track structure. Railroad ballast is the free draining granular material that supports the track structure. As the track ages, small particles can fill the voids of the granular material which is a process known as fouling. Established methods for determining the fouling of a section of ballast are destructive tests that usually require the railroad to restrict or reroute traffic on its network. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a nondestructive geophysical surveying method that measures the time required for electromagnetic wave impulses to reflect off differing subsurface interfaces. Historically, GPR surveys of track structures primarily determine the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> and track geometry. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the viability of utilizing the laboratory’s existing GPR equipment to develop a methodology of measuring ballast fouling nondestructively. A 48 x 48 x 48 in (1. 2 x 1. 2 x 1. 2 m) test box was built. The test box was filled with 48 in (1. 2 m) of clean and ballast. Tests were run on dry and partially saturated material, wetted using 6 gallons (22. 7 L). GPR data were collected hourly for the first 6 hours, then at the multiples of 12 and 24 hour marks for one week. Sand was chosen as an absorbent geologic material for the second stage of testing since no fouled ballast could be acquired at the time of the study. A 27 x 18 x 18 in (0. 69 x 0. 46 x 0. 046 m) box was filled with sand and wetted with water in one gallon (7. 5 L) increments. GPR scans and samples to determine the water content were collected after the addition of each gallon. The data collected were processed to determine soil properties. Preliminary results from this research indicate that the GPR set up utilized can effectively determine the dielectric constant of geologic materials including ballast, although the dielectric constant is highly dependent on the volumetric moisture content of the material...|$|E

This study was performed on granite ballast and breakdown fouling and has three phases: performing GPR survey on full-scale laboratory models with different amount of fouling and water content; performing box test with equivalent dynamic Heavy Axle Load (HAL) up to 2, 500, 000 cycles on the reconstituted samples of first phase; performing CIDC triaxial tests on the reconstituted samples of first phase.
