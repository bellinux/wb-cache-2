A potential {{consequence of}} a hedonistic conceptualization of happiness that stresses the maximization of subjective well-being (consisting in part {{of the absence of}} negative emotions) is that such a conceptualization, which seems to be dominant in the West, makes it difficult to accept hardship, negative affect, and unhappiness as possible integral parts of a good life. <b>Having</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> eastern eudaimonistic theories of well-being accept the existence of negative feelings and anhedonia in a truly happy life.

5000|$|Throughout someone's life, {{they are}} {{constantly}} learning while using their senses. An {{important factor in}} sensory integration is perception. There are three steps on how perception is created. First is sensation, when as individuals, we capture the energies from our environment and push them onto our orifices and rubbing against our skin, forming brain friendly electrical language. [...] Second is routing, when the sensation is translated into head-speak and sent off to the appropriate regions of the brain for further processing. [...] Third the perception formed, when the various senses merge {{and sent to the}} brain. [...] However, no scientist is entirely sure how brain perception works. Although Medina did arrive to this conclusion: the sensory information absorbed in an event through our sense translates into electrical signals, dispersing {{in different parts of the}} brain, perceiving the event as a whole. [...] This can be concluded with the majority of scientists. Furthermore, Medina states the brain relies on past experiences to decide how to combine these signals. [...] Thus two people can perceive the same event in very different ways. Next, all the senses have evolved over time to work together. For example, an individual’s vision influences their hearing-which implies that learning is at its best when stimulated with several senses at once. In addition, Medina explains that the sense of smell has the gift of bringing back memories. [...] He theorized that the sense of smell bypasses the thalamus and heads straight its destination, which includes the site of emotions known at the amygdala. [...] <b>Having</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Medina's dream school setting would incorporate multiple senses in a school setting and the specific scents in a work/business setting, thus enhancing your level of learning.|$|E
