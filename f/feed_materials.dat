5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald <b>Feed</b> <b>Materials</b> Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E

After the war in 1946, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was created to control the future of the project. Among other nuclear projects, the AEC {{produced}} fabricated uranium fuel cores at locations such as Fernald <b>Feed</b> <b>Materials</b> Production Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1974, the AEC gave way to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which was tasked with regulating the nuclear power industry, and the Energy Research and Development Administration, which was tasked to manage the nuclear weapon, naval reactor, and energy development programs.|$|E

500|$|Nichols, who {{concentrated}} {{his attention}} on ore procurement, <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> and the plutonium project, was promoted to colonel on 22 May 1943. On 13 August, he replaced Marshall as District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District. [...] As District Engineer, Nichols was responsible for both the uranium production facility at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge and the plutonium production facility at the Hanford site. One of his first tasks as district engineer was to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge, although its name did not change. For his wartime work on the Manhattan Project, Nichols was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the United States Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of the phosphorus in animal feeds originates from the vegetal <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> to compose these feeds. However, up to 80% of the phosphorus present in vegetal <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> {{is in the form}} of phytate. Unfortunately, and in contrast to ruminants, poultry and pigs lack the enzyme necessary to break down this phytate-phosphorus. Therefore, phosphorus digestibility of plant phosphorus varies between 6% and 50%, and it is assumed that at least two thirds of the organic phosphorus in the diet is unavailable for pigs and poultry. That’s why normally phosphorus in the form of high quality inorganic feed phosphates has to be supplemented to diets of high producing farm animals.|$|E

50|$|Semi-solid metal (SSM) casting is a {{modified}} die casting process that reduces or eliminates the residual porosity present in most die castings. Rather than using liquid metal as the <b>feed</b> <b>material,</b> SSM casting uses a higher viscosity <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> that is partially solid and partially liquid. A modified die casting machine {{is used to}} inject the semi-solid slurry into re-usable hardened steel dies. The high viscosity of the semi-solid metal, along {{with the use of}} controlled die filling conditions, ensures that the semi-solid metal fills the die in a non-turbulent manner so that harmful porosity can be essentially eliminated.|$|R

50|$|Steelmaking {{has existed}} for millennia, {{but it was not}} commercialized on a massive scale until the 19th century. The ancient craft process of {{steelmaking}} was the crucible process. In the 1850s and 1860s, the Bessemer process and the Siemens-Martin process turned steelmaking into a heavy industry. Today there are two major commercial processes for making steel, namely basic oxygen steelmaking, which has liquid pig-iron from the blast furnace and scrap steel as the main <b>feed</b> <b>materials,</b> and electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking, which uses scrap steel or direct reduced iron (DRI) as the main <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> Oxygen steelmaking is fuelled predominantly by the exothermic nature of the reactions inside the vessel where as in EAF steelmaking, electrical energy is used to melt the solid scrap and/or DRI materials. In recent times, EAF steelmaking technology has evolved closer to oxygen steelmaking as more chemical energy is introduced into the process.|$|E

30|$|However, {{from the}} seven {{membranes}} investigated, {{two of the}} three membranes with the best water permeate flow velocity were also the membranes with best lactate permeate flow velocity.

The obtained order of the membranes performances according to permeate flow velocity was not significantly altered by the change of the <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> from deionized water to fermentation broth. Therefore, deionized water, using the presented method, can already be adequate <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> for the membrane evaluation if the desired process material is not available in sufficient quantities, due to limited storage capacities or a great amount of membranes to be investigated.|$|R
