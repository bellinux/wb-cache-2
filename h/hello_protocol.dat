40|$|This {{document}} specifies {{an extension}} of OSPFv 3 to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF interface type for MANETs. OSPF-MDR {{is based on the}} selection of a subset of MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs. The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together form a biconnected CDS for robustness. This CDS is exploited in two ways. First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back out the receiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies. Second, adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much better scaling in dense networks. The CDS is constructed using 2 -hop neighbor information provided in a <b>Hello</b> <b>protocol</b> extension. The <b>Hello</b> <b>protocol</b> is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only changes in neighbor states. Options are specified for originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising less topology information.

However, too small a value of HelloInterval will result in an increased chance of network congestion causing loss of several consecutive Hellos, thus leading to false breakdown of adjacency between routers. Such false alarms not only disrupt network traffic by causing unnecessary routing changes but also increase the processing load on the routers which may potentially lead to routing instability. In this paper, we investigate the following question- What is the optimal value for the HelloInterval that will lead to fast failure detection in the network while keeping the false alarm occurrence within acceptable limits? We examine the impact of both network congestion and the network topology on the optimal HelloInterval value.

The architecture relies on commercially available IEEE 802. 16 - 2004 (WiMAX) equipment that can be employed to build routers and gateways to a wired network. The topology construction and maintenance are based on a modified Dijkstra shortest path algorithm that maximizes a combined metric of path qualities and gateway load. Path qualities are derived from link qualities determined by SINR measurements. The channel allocation greedily allocates the locally least-interfered channel. The protocol includes four sub-protocols: a join protocol, a <b>hello</b> <b>protocol,</b> a leave protocol, and a conflict resolution protocol to resolve inconsistencies in topology data across the network.
