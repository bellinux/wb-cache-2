5|$|The {{service is}} also used {{as a form of}} civil disobedience: in 2010, users {{expressed}} outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the Spartacus film and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> bombing an airport if they cancelled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{some things}} on the show evolved into running gags. For example, Rudi Carrell always made <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Mike Krüger's nose, who in turn made <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the Dutch and their caravans and about Carrell's age. Kalle Pohl {{was the victim of}} <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> dwarfism, Bernd Stelter about fat people, Oliver Welke about baldness, Jochen Busse about ironing creases and Gaby Köster had to suffer <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> women.|$|R
50|$|Aldrich <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> {{sending a}} Somalian suspect to Guantanamo.He <b>joked</b> <b>about</b> {{thinking}} about murdering his own wife. He {{is a graduate}} of Grinnell College and the University of Minnesota Law School.|$|R
50|$|Comedy {{television}} show Saturday Night Live satirized ESPN's {{use of the}} phrase, pointing out the difference in society's reaction to racial <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Asian people versus racial <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> black people. In the skit, three sports commentators were featured happily making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Lin's race, while a fourth drew contempt for making similar comments about black players.|$|R
5|$|Pearl {{returns to}} her {{penthouse}} apartment. She is visited by Captain Steel, {{who says he has}} been thinking about her recently and regrets their breakup. When he says that he still loves her and {{would like to have a}} relationship with her again, Pearl declines. The next night, she goes to a nightclub with Olivia and Jennifer. They have fun <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> the fortunes, and Pearl admits she is a little sad hers did not come true. Pearl goes to a coffee house and cries when the fortune's deadline passes without anyone talking to her. Friday morning, Pearl is leaving for work when she meets a man who is about to knock on her door. He says he works at the coffee house she visited, and that she left her wallet behind. After a conversation, Pearl and the man arrange a date.|$|E
5|$|The film's idea {{originated}} in the late 1990s in screenwriter K. V. Vijayendra Prasad mind. At that time, he was <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> a housefly seeking revenge on a human {{in a conversation with}} his son S. S. Rajamouli. Prasad later developed the idea as a script for an English-language film set in 1830s America, in which an African-American boy dies in an attempt to free his family from slavery and is reincarnated as a fly. After completing Maryada Ramanna (2010), Rajamouli reconsidered the concept after thinking of directing a film that was distinct from any other. He decided to make Eega a bilingual film in Telugu and Tamil– each scene including speech was filmed twice, once for each language. The Tamil version, titled Naan Ee, was Rajamouli's directorial debut in Tamil cinema. The film was presented by Daggubati Suresh Babu of Suresh Productions.|$|E
25|$|Crosby {{also got}} {{consistent}} laughs by frequently <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> his more famous brother Bing Crosby's vast wealth.|$|E
50|$|Some roastees {{have stated}} that certain topics are off-limits. Pamela Anderson, for example, {{prohibited}} <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> her Hepatitis C infection. Joan Rivers disallowed <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> her daughter, Melissa and William Shatner asked that {{the death of his}} wife not be mentioned. Others, like David Hasselhoff, have imposed no limits on the topics. Donald Trump only prohibited anyone making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> him not being as wealthy as he says he is. Although Charlie Sheen initially agreed to no restrictions on his roast, he later said during an interview with Jay Leno that he requested <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> his mother be edited out of the broadcast.|$|R
50|$|Meta-joke {{refers to}} several {{somewhat}} different, but related categories: self-referential <b>jokes,</b> <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>jokes</b> (also known as metahumor), and joke templates.|$|R
2500|$|A Sickipedia <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> {{stricken}} Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba on {{the evening}} of his cardiac arrest on the pitch at White Hart Lane caused outrage on Twitter. In February 2009, the site was criticized as [...] "monstrous" [...] for its <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the death of Francesca Anobile, and one of the site's users reported [...] "very real threats of legal action". In October 2012, a 19-year-old from Chorley, Lancashire, was jailed for copying and pasting Sickipedia <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> abducted children April Jones and Madeleine McCann onto Facebook.|$|R
25|$|While usually {{associated}} with the political right, Pat Robertson has endorsed environmental causes. He appeared in a commercial with Al Sharpton, <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> this, and urging people to join the We Can Solve It campaign against global warming.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} escape Twomey gave an {{exclusive}} interview to German magazine Der Spiegel, where the reporter said people throughout Europe were <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> the incident as [...] "the escape of the century". Irish rebel band the Wolfe Tones wrote a song celebrating the escape called [...] "The Helicopter Song", which was immediately banned by the government yet still topped the Irish popular music charts after selling twelve thousand copies in a single week.|$|E
500|$|Reubens {{auditioned for}} Saturday Night Live for the 1980–1981 season, but Gilbert Gottfried, {{who was a}} close friend of the show's {{producer}} and had the same acting style as Reubens, got the place (ironically, Gottfried would later get in trouble for <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> Reubens' indecent exposure arrest as an award presenter at the Emmys). Reubens was so angry and bitter that he decided he would borrow money and start his own show in Los Angeles using the character he had been developing during the last few years, [...] "Pee-wee Herman".|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Durst {{announced}} that the band's third studio album would be titled Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. The press thought he was <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> this title. The album title is intended {{to sound like a}} fictional band; the phrase [...] "Chocolate Starfish" [...] refers to the human anus, and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an [...] "asshole". Borland contributed {{the other half of the}} album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn't have hot dog or meat-flavored water.|$|E
500|$|Hunter {{reports that}} Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, {{and it was}} Johnson that, [...] "on the first {{approaches}} of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned." [...] However, {{at no time did}} Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the Universal Visiter. In <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> writing for the Universal Visiter, Johnson claimed: [...] "for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer." ...|$|E
500|$|Froissart {{writes of}} the meeting in his Chronicles, saying that Isabeau stood {{motionless}} while being inspected, exhibiting perfect behavior {{by the standards of}} her time. Arrangements were made for the two to be married in Arras, but on the first meeting Charles felt [...] "happiness and love enter his heart, for he saw that she was beautiful and young, and thus he greatly desired to gaze at her and possess her". She did not yet speak French and may not have reflected the idealized beauty of the period, perhaps inheriting her mother's dark Italian features, then unfashionable, but Charles most certainly approved of her because the couple were married three days later. Froissart documented the royal wedding, <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> the lascivious guests at the feast and the [...] "hot young couple".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{her style}} of humor, which often relied on making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> {{her own life}} and satirizing the lives of celebrities and public figures, was {{sometimes}} criticized as insensitive. Her <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Elizabeth Taylor and Adele's weight, for instance, were often commented on, although Rivers would never apologize for her humor. Rivers, who was Jewish, was also criticized for making <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the Holocaust and later explained, [...] "This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor", adding, [...] "my husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust." [...] Her <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> {{the victims of the}} Ariel Castro kidnappings similarly came under criticism, but she again refused to apologize, stating, [...] "I know what those girls went through. It was a little stupid joke." [...] She received multiple death threats throughout her career.|$|R

500|$|Bhatti {{was already}} known to EastEnders {{executive}} producer Bryan Kirkwood when he auditioned for the part, as Kirkwood and Bhatti worked on Coronation Street {{at the same}} time. Bhatti was the only actor who auditioned for the part of Yusef. In fact, Wadia recommended Bhatti to Kirkwood to play Yusef, as she [...] "thought that he definitely had the quality that Yusef would need—which is a very ambiguous but charming quality!" [...] Bhatti explained to Digital Spy that the EastEnders cast are very welcoming. He explained: [...] "They're so welcoming. There's a lot of <b>joking</b> <b>about.</b> I'm {{having a great time}} at EastEnders - it's a real privilege to be here. I've known Nitin and Nina Wadia, who plays Zainab, {{for a very long time}} and we've always got on very well. Nitin and I play tense scenes together so it's nice that we can have a laugh afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|Internal {{investigations}} {{were started}} in February by the Multi-National Force– Iraq, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (which examined the actual killings), and Major General Eldon Bargewell (who examined the Marines' {{response to the}} killings). A news article that alleged a massacre had occurred was published in March. Haditha became a national story in mid-May due to comments made by anti-war Congressman and former Marine John P. Murtha. Murtha incorrectly claimed the number of civilians killed was much higher than reported and that the Marines had [...] "killed innocent civilians in cold blood." [...] Murtha's broader point about troop misbehavior was reinforced by news of another killing where a squad of Marines executed an Iraqi man and then planted an AK-47 near his body in Hamdania, near Abu Ghraib, {{as well as the}} controversial Internet video Hadji Girl, showing a Marine <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> killing members of an Iraqi family.|$|E
500|$|The {{child sexual}} abuse {{allegations}} of 2003 resulted in a long trial two years later. Sneddon was the lead investigator again, {{as well as the}} trial prosecutor. The trial ended with Jackson being acquitted on all counts. The two investigations being controlled by Sneddon have led to complaints that he was motivated by a [...] "vendetta" [...] against Jackson. Evidence to support these claims include Sneddon <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> Jackson's greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and sarcastically saying, [...] "Like the sheriff and I really are into that kind of music". He then preceded to call Jackson [...] "Wacko Jacko" [...] and shouting [...] "we got him, we finally got him" [...] to the media when he had only just begun an investigation and had gathered limited information or evidence. [...] "D.S." [...] was sung outside the courtroom by a group of Jackson's fans every day the trial took place.|$|E
5000|$|Caution had to {{be taken}} with <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> drink, with not too many allowed to be made in any single programme. Also to be avoided were {{derogatory}} references to solicitors, miners and [...] "the working class". Banned too was any reference to The McGillycuddy of the Reeks, or <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> his name, in response to previous complaints.|$|R
40|$|<b>Jokes</b> <b>about</b> stupidity are {{extremely}} common in most countries, as ethnic, national, regional and locality jokes, political <b>jokes,</b> <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> occupations and social classes, and blonde and Essex-girl jokes. The {{aim of this}} paper is to provide a theory that will explain why such diverse groups of people should be the butts of what is essentially the same joke. It will also explain jokes that are the opposite of the stupidity jokes, the widespread <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the canny (clever, crafty, calculating, stingy), whether <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> ethnic groups, regional groups, townspeople or occupations. The key explanatory variables are first, the dominance of centre over periphery whether defined in geographical, cultural, language or social class terms and second, among the powerful, the contrast between those who hold arbitrary monopoly power based on control of the state and the means of force and those who have achieved their position through legitimate competition...|$|R

500|$|After the 1941 season, {{with his}} batting in decline, Oana {{worked as a}} pitcher during a barnstorming tour of Mexico. [...] Rogers Hornsby took over as the manager at Fort Worth in 1942, and Oana badgered Hornsby for a chance as a pitcher. [...] According to one account, Hornsby was {{reportedly}} prepared to release Oana, who was not hitting well, and said to Oana, [...] "Hank, you hit like a pitcher," [...] to which Oana replied, [...] "I am a good pitcher." [...] Hornsby initially thought that Oana was <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> being a pitcher, but finally relented and allowed him to pitch in relief one day in Houston. [...] In Oana's first 76 innings as a pitcher in 1942, he compiled a 0.76 earned run average (ERA), threw 50 consecutive innings without an earned run, and pitched a no-hitter. [...] In mid-July 1942, Oana's scoreless streak became national news, and resulted in a feature story in The Sporting News. In a total of 25 games as a pitcher during the 1942 season, Oana compiled a 16–5 record with a 1.72 ERA.|$|E
500|$|Labor campaigned {{under the}} slogan [...] "It's Time", {{an echo of}} Menzies' {{successful}} 1949 slogan, [...] "It's Time for a Change". Surveys showed that even Liberal voters approved of the Labor slogan. Whitlam pledged an end to conscription {{and the release of}} individuals who had refused the draft; an income tax surcharge to pay for universal health insurance; free dental care for students; and renovation of aging urban infrastructure. The party pledged to eliminate university tuition fees and establish a schools commission to evaluate educational needs. The party benefited from the support of the proprietor of News Limited, Rupert Murdoch, who preferred Whitlam over McMahon. Labor was so dominant in the campaign that some of Whitlam's advisers urged him to stop <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> McMahon; people were feeling sorry for him. The election saw the ALP increase its tally by 12seats, mostly in suburban Sydney and Melbourne, for a majority of nine in the House of Representatives. [...] The ALP gained little beyond the suburban belts, however, losing a seat in South Australia and two in Western Australia.|$|E
500|$|On December 18, 2003, Jackson was {{formally}} charged with seven counts {{of child sexual}} abuse and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent in order to commit a child sexual abuse felony against Gavin Arvizo. Earlier that year, a Granada Television documentary, called Living with Michael Jackson, showed the pop star holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with Arvizo. Jackson denied these allegations, saying that the sleepovers were in no way sexual in nature. Sneddon again led the effort to prosecute Jackson. These prosecutions led to complaints that Sneddon was motivated by a [...] "vendetta" [...] against Jackson. Evidence to support these claims include Sneddon <b>joking</b> <b>about</b> Jackson's greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and saying, [...] "Like the sheriff and I really are into that kind of music." [...] He then proceeded to call Jackson [...] "Wacko Jacko" [...] and shouting [...] "We got him, we finally got him" [...] to the media, when he had only just began an investigation and had gathered limited information or evidence.|$|E
50|$|As a result, Leno was {{initially}} {{not allowed to}} tell <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of The Tonight Shows opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the trial. Stand-ins included Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Brad Garrett, and Dennis Miller, among others. The gag order was challenged, and {{the court ruled that}} Leno could continue telling <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.|$|R
5000|$|Patients {{and staff}} have made <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the NHS to one another, {{on a daily}} basis, {{throughout}} time. However, {{it is very hard}} to locate and to understand these. [...] Sometimes 'everyday' <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> the NHS are mentioned in passing in newspaper coverage. For example, one letter published by the Daily Mail in October 1988 described the experiences of an NHS secretary who 'seethed with anger' when hearing a consultant <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> spending his days on a golf course. [...] The People's History of the NHS project at the University of Warwick has collected more such memories on its website, and invites contributions for more.|$|R
