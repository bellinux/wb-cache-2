50|$|On 11 September 1957, she was {{released}} to the Cruiser Olympia Association, restored to her 1898 configuration and became a museum ship under their auspices. The main 8-inch guns and turrets, scrapped before World War I, were replaced with sheet metal fabrications. In January 1996, when faced with mounting debt and tremendous <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenances,</b> the Cruiser Olympia Society merged with the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia.|$|R
25|$|The {{first line}} closure took place when the Portstewart Tramway ceased {{operating}} on 31 January 1926 due to continuing losses, <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance</b> and obsolete equipment. The NCC sponsored a replacement bus service.|$|E
25|$|The {{reversal}} of funding in 2003 {{led to a}} backlog of <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance</b> and left Via unable to replace or refurbish life-expired locomotives and rolling stock. Regardless, Via ridership increased from 3.8million in 2005 to 4.1million in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{disaster}} remains under debate. The Indian government and local activists argue that slack management and <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance</b> created a situation where routine pipe maintenance caused a backflow of water into a MIC tank, triggering the disaster. Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) contends water entered the tank through an act of sabotage.|$|E
25|$|Iron Road Railways {{declared}} bankruptcy for its subsidiary company in fall 2002. The former CPR main line from Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu to Brownville Junction {{was sold to}} Rail World Inc. in January 2003. Rail World formed the MMA as a subsidiary and engaged in aggressive cost cutting for freight train operations and continued to <b>defer</b> <b>maintenance</b> on the tracks {{to the point where}} much of the track is now in marginal condition.|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} which provides {{an approach to}} planning {{the maintenance of a}} deteriorating facility. The methodology consists of using a Markov chain to model the deterioration, finding a maintenance policy which minimizes the expected maintenance cost using dynamic programming, and testing the optimal policy with simulation. As an illustrative example, the problem of scheduling maintenance for roadways was addressed. A minimum economical state was identified at which maintenance should be applied according to the optimal policy. The methodology also permits the quantification of the costs of <b>deferring</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Particularly useful information is obtained by simulating the optimal policy under a variety of scenarios. ...|$|R
50|$|Completed in 1972 as {{headquarters}} of the Continental Insurance Company, the building is among the earlier of San Francisco's modern skyscrapers.

25|$|Despite the {{worsening}} financial situation, the NCC {{introduced a}} number of measures {{in an attempt to}} improve the railway's competitive position. Services were accelerated and, although the poor condition of the track due to <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance</b> meant that {{it was not possible to}} attain pre-war timings, strenuous efforts were made to ensure that trains adhered to the published schedules.|$|E
25|$|In October 2016, the Boston Globe {{reported}} that the Green Line had {{the highest number of}} derailments and accidents on light rail lines in the United States in 2015. The number of incidents had been increasing for several years due to <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance</b> on tracks and wheels, which resulted in more low-speed derailments of Type 8 cars.|$|E
25|$|Most freight was for {{the rural}} hinterland, but along the SOL there were coal mines near Ohura and Tangarakau, and also sawmills. One freight train {{operated}} each weeknight each way along the line carrying freight between New Plymouth and Auckland, interchanging at Taumarunui. In recent years the <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance</b> issues meant these services operated under heavy speed restrictions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954 the flashy Patrick B. McGinnis led a proxy {{fight against}} {{incumbent}} president Frederic C. [...] "Buck" [...] Dumaine Jr., vowing to return {{more of the}} company's profit to shareholders. McGinnis won control of the railroad and appointed Arthur V. McGowan, a longtime McGinnis acquaintance, Vice President. McGinnis attempted to accomplish many of his financial goals by <b>deferring</b> <b>maintenance.</b> McGinnis also spent money on a flashy new image for the company: green and gold trim was replaced by black, red-orange and white. McGinnis and McGowan had Chrysler Imperial automobiles custom made {{so that they could}} travel along the railroad's tracks to their country estates in Litchfield County, Connecticut. When McGinnis departed 22 months later he left the company financially wrecked, a situation exacerbated by hurricane damage in 1955.|$|R
5000|$|Tesla {{announced}} plans to locate its [...] "Gigafactory" [...] battery production facility at TRIC in September 2014. To support the projected travel demand of 6,000 vehicles per day, the Nevada Department of Transportation's Board of Directors approved a design-build project to complete the southern extension of USA Parkway in an expedited manner, two years earlier than projected. The project, which involves NDOT taking over USA Parkway for $43 million, is planned for completion in December 2017 and was expected to cost between $65 million and $70 million. The funds to fast-track the USA Parkway build-out were obtained by <b>deferring</b> <b>maintenance</b> projects on seven other northern Nevada highways. The contract price is $75.9 million. 80 workers are on site 24/6 building the road in stages, with paving started in October 2016.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Forest Service has more miles of trail {{than it has been}} able to maintain, resulting in a persistent maintenance backlog with a range of negative effects. In fiscal year 2012, the agency reported that it accomplished at least some maintenance on about 37 percent of its 158, 000 trail miles and that about one-quarter of its trail miles met the agency's standards. The Forest Service estimated the value of its trail maintenance backlog to be $ 314 million in fiscal year 2012, with an additional $ 210 million for annual maintenance, capital improvement, and operations. Trails not maintained to quality standards have a range of negative effects, such as inhibiting trail use and harming natural resources, and <b>deferring</b> <b>maintenance</b> can add to maintenance costs. ...|$|R
25|$|As of 2012, the J. Edgar Hoover Building {{is nearing}} the end of its useful lifespan. It is {{suffering}} from deterioration due to <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance</b> and mediocre design. The FBI, General Services Administration, and Government Accountability Office agree that the building is no longer appropriate for the FBI, but the cost of building a new headquarters has led to inaction for several years.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 2002 Brighton {{passenger}} {{service was}} suspended west of Brighton Beach {{due to the}} complete rebuilding of the Coney Island – Stillwell Avenue terminal station, which had deteriorated due {{to the effects of}} salt water corrosion and <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance.</b> On May 23, 2004, one week short of the 85th anniversary of the Brighton Beach Line's original entry into Stillwell Avenue terminal, service resumed between Brighton Beach and the terminal.|$|E
25|$|By 1973 JRC's {{operational}} deficit {{had risen}} to J$3.4 million, and in 1975 it was nearing J$4 million and carrying a J$11 million loan. The government was paying over J$1.4 million in subsidy to keep the island's trains running. However, the financial crisis had led to a backlog of <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance,</b> with stock and buildings also neglected. In 1974 the May Pen-Frankfield line closed, with the Bog Walk-Port Antonio line closing in 1975.|$|E
40|$|Control {{decisions}} within future energy networks {{may take}} account of the health and condition of network assets, pushing condition monitoring within the smart grid remit. In order to support maintenance decisions, this paper proposes a circuit breaker prognostic system, which ranks circuit breakers in order of maintenance priority. By monitoring the SF 6 density within a breaker, the system not only predicts the number of days to a critical level, but also incorporates uncertainty by giving upper and lower bounds on the prediction. This prognostic model, which performs linear regression, will be described in this paper, along with case studies demonstrating ranking breakers based on maintenance priority and prognosis of a leaking breaker. Providing an asset manager with this type of information could allow improved management of his/her assets, potentially <b>deferring</b> <b>maintenance</b> to a time when an outage is already scheduled...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{optimisation}} models, {{supported by}} suitable data, can assist decision making about allocating funds between alternative maintenance tasks {{and about the}} size of the maintenance budget. The maintenance optimisation problem is, in essence, to find the optimum balance between the costs and benefits of maintenance, while taking into account various constraints (Dekker 1996). For a given road segment, choices have to be made between alternative treatment types and the times to implement those treatments. Where maintenance funds are limited, there is an additional problem of balancing the competing needs of the different segments. Maintenance tends to be underfunded relative to investment because the smaller, less obvious nature of maintenance works relative to new infrastructure (Semmens 2006, Zeitlow 2006). But <b>deferring</b> <b>maintenance</b> in the short term can be expensive in the long term, a point that can be brought to the attention of decision makers by quantifying the costs of underfunding maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Shrinking {{budgets are}} forcing many DoD {{facilities}} to <b>defer</b> <b>maintenance</b> and reduce non-mission critical operations. This thesis provides a detailed {{presentation of the}} non-violent inmate labor program utilized by the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Oakland, California to reduce routine operating costs. The inmate labor program is examined to identify costs, benefits, obstacles, and potential for future use at other DoD installations. This thesis was accomplished through interviews of individuals familiar with the FISC Oakland non-violent inmate labor program and review of documents, correspondence and literature pertaining to the program. A chronology of events was constructed, key participants identified, and quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the inmate labor program are presented. The non-violent inmate labor program at FISC Oakland operated for over five years, providing nearly eight million dollars of supplementary labor to the facility and relieving a constrained operating budget.

25|$|The New York City Subway {{tried to}} keep its budget {{balanced}} between spending and revenue, so <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance</b> became more common, which drew a slow but steady decline {{of the system and}} rolling stock. Furthermore, the workers were consolidated into the Transport Workers Union in 1968. A pension was set up, and workers were allowed to retire after 20 years of service without any transitional period. About a third of the most highly experienced staff immediately retired, resulting in a large shortage of skilled workers.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{the state}} of Alaska bought the {{railroad}} from the U.S. government for $22.3 million, based on a valuation determined by the US Railway Association. The state immediately invested over $70 million on improvements and repairs that made up for years of <b>deferred</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The purchase agreement prohibits the Alaska Railroad from paying dividends or otherwise returning capital to {{the state of}} Alaska (unlike the other Alaska quasi-entities: Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC), and Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA)).|$|E
