40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the tracheal pressures for dierent percentages of stenotic constriction, ow simulations are performed on a realistic geometry based on CT-scans of a patient for sedentary breathing (15 l/min) and normal breathing (30 l/min) conditions using a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes approach for unstructured hexahedral meshes. Turbulence modeling is based on low Reynolds number Yang-Shih k " model. The realistic airway model in itself is highly irregular {{and the presence of}} stenosis adds to its geometrical complexity, resulting in very complex ow patterns with ow separations and skewed velocity proles. Detailed analysis of these ows is presented for 0 %, 49 %, 75 %, 84 % and 91 % stenotic constrictions. The pressure drop shows modest increases with the degree of narrowing up to 75 % constriction, beyond which it steeply rises. Such a pattern agrees with the appearance <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> symptoms only when patients already show a very marked stenosis. In order to temporarily <b>ease</b> work <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> a decrease <b>of</b> the pressure drop is sometimes induced by having the patient inhale heliox. An additional ow analysis is performed with heliox as the working uid. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nasal strips {{are used}} by athletes, people who snore, and asthmatics to <b>ease</b> the burden <b>of</b> <b>breathing.</b> Although there are some {{published}} studies that demonstrate higher flow with nasal strips, none had directly measured {{the effect of the}} strips on nasal resistance using the airflow perturbation device (APD). The APD is an inexpensive instrument that can measure respiratory resistance based on changes in mouth pressure and rate of airflow. Method This study tested forty-seven volunteers (14 men and 33 women), ranging in age from 17 to 51. Each volunteer was instructed to breathe normally into the APD using an oronasal mask with and without nasal strips. The APD measured respiratory resistance during inhalation, exhalation, and an average of the two. Results Results of a paired mean t-test comparing nasal strip against no nasal strip were statistically significant at the p = 0. 05 level. The Breathe Right™ nasal dilator strips lowered nasal resistance by an average of 0. 5 cm H 2 0 /Lps from an average nasal resistance of 5. 5 cm H 2 0 /Lps. Conclusions Nasal strips reduce nasal resistance when measured with the APD. The effect is equal during exhalation and during inhalation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of lung function {{is the central}} part of the patients with cystic fibrosis assessment but we consider that exercise testing become an important tool in the continuous evaluation which is an indicative of prognosis and functional capacity and care of these patients. The 6 minute walk test is used to assess the individual’s response to exercise. The aim of the study is to design an exercise training program, based on 6 minute walk test and to evaluate the effects of this complex protocol including incentive therapy, individualized supervised training program: swimming, trampoline, walking, jogging, aerobic gymnastic, cycling 3 times per week and airway clearance techniques. Material and method: We conducted a 6 -month study, on 20 patients from the Romanian National Cystic Fibrosis Center, aged between 12 and 18. The inclusion criteria were: FEV 1 or FVC lower than 60 % of predicted, SpO 2 lower than 94 % at rest.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Partial assist {{ventilation}} reduces work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> {{in patients}} with bronchospasm; however, {{it is not clear}} which components of the ventilatory cycle contribute to this process. Theoretically, expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), by reducing expiratory breaking, may be as important as inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) in reducing work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> during acute bronchospasm. METHOD: We compared the effects of 10 cmH 2 O of IPAP, EPAP, and continuous positive airwaypressure (CPAP) on inspiratory work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) in a canine model of methacholine-induced bronchospasm. RESULTS: Methacholine infusion increased airway resistance and work <b>of</b> <b>breathing.</b> During bronchospasm IPAP and CPAP reduced work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> primarily through reductions in transdiaphragmatic pressure per tidal volume (from 69. 4 +/- 10. 8 cmH 2 O/l to 45. 6 +/- 5. 9 cmH 2 O/l and to 36. 9 +/- 4. 6 cmH 2 O/l, respectively; P < 0. 05) and in diaphragmatic pressure-time product (from 306 +/- 31 to 268 +/- 25 and to 224 +/- 23, respectively; P < 0. 05). Pleural pressure indices <b>of</b> work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> were not reduced by IPAP and CPAP.

CPAP and EPAP similarly increased EELV above control by 93 +/- 16 ml and 69 +/- 12 ml, respectively. The increase in EELV by IPAP of 48 +/- 8 ml (P < 0. 01) was significantly less than that by CPAP and EPAP.

BAKGRUNN: Mange KOLS-pasienter har stor symptombelastning og høyt nivå av stress og angst, som kan føre inn i en ond sirkel av utmattelse, sosial tilbaketrekning og oppgitthet. Rehabiliteringstilbudet til lungesyke omfatter medikamentell egenbehandling, trening og tverrfaglig psykoedukasjon. Det har vært lite fokus på hva som kan gi lindring når pasientene har lite overskudd til aktiv rehabilitering. Behandling med berøringsmetoden taktil stimulering har i mange år vært gitt til ulike pasientgrupper i Sverige med lindrende formål. Det er ikke funnet studier som omfatter KOLS-pasienter. FORSKNINGSSPØRSMÅL: Hvordan oppleves behandling med taktil stimulering av KOLSpasienter med stress, angst eller utmattelse? På hvilke måter kan taktil stimulering som faglig tilnærming bidra til KOLS-pasienters rehabiliteringsprosess? HENSIKT: Hensikten med å prøve ut systematisk berøring til KOLS-pasienter er å undersøke om denne typen behandling kan bidra til å gjenvinne balanse og overskudd, slik at pasientene lettere kan takle stress eller angst knyttet til sykdom og livssituasjon. Studien vil kunne gi et grunnlag for beslutning om dette eller lignende tilbud kan være et aktuelt {{supplement}} til dagens metoder for mestring av stress/angst hos KOLS-pasienter, eventuelt danne grunnlag for videre forskning. METODE: Kvalitative metoder ble benyttet for å få fram pasientenes opplevelse av behandlinger med taktil stimulering. Fire informanter med ulik grad av KOLS fikk en serie på ti taktilbehandlinger en eller to ganger i uken. De skrev dagbok etter hver behandling og deltok i to fokusgruppeintervjuer med seks måneders mellomrom etter avsluttet behandling. I analysen av datamaterialet ble en modifisert variant av Giorgis firetrinns metode benyttet (Malterud, 2003). TEORI: Jeg har valgt å belyse deltakernes beskrivelser med teori hentet fra positiv psykologifeltet, ”The broaden-and-build {{theory of}} positive emotions”, som sier at positive følelser og tanker kan bidra til utvidelse av tanke-handlingsrepertoiret, utvikle motstandsressurser og sosial støtte og fremme helse og livskvalitet (Fredrickson, 1998, 2001). EMPIRISKE FUNN: Deltakerne uttrykte at behandlingene ga en helhetlig opplevelse av kropp og sinn. De ble mer klar over egne vesentlige behov ut fra sin aktuelle livssituasjon. De rapporterte at de klarte å takle stress og angst bedre, selv om ytre stressfaktorer ikke ble redusert. De beskrev at de opplevde indre ro, balanse og harmoni og bedre kroppsoppfatning. De uttrykte også at de opplevde positive tanker og følelser under og etter behandlingene. Noe lettere pust i utførelse av hverdagsaktiviteter, økt matlyst og smertelindring ble rapportert. Dette er også beskrevet i litteraturen (Uvnäs-Moberg, 2000; Olsson, 2004; Henricson & Billhult, 2010). Det er vanskelig å si noe om varighet av virkninger ut fra denne studien. Deltakerne ga uttrykk for at opplevelsen av avspenthet kunne sitte i kroppen i flere dager etter en behandling, og at de senere kunne fremkalle avspenning ved å visualisere behandlingene. De opplevde at dette ga dem en buffer mot stress og angst. DISKUSJON: Spørsmål som diskuteres er hva en slik tilnærming kan bety i forhold til håp og muligheter i en rehabiliteringsprosess. Behandlingene synes å gi en form for utvidet sanseopplevelse som gir assosiasjoner til en tilstand av ”mindfulness” eller bevisst tilstedeværelse. Det diskuteres om dette kan bidra til å utvide tanke- og handlingsrommet og igangsette en positiv snøballeffekt i rehabiliteringsprosessen, slik Fredricksons (1998, 2001) ”broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions” illustrerer. Mulige tiltak for å opprettholde virkninger etter taktilbehandlinger vurderes, som for eksempel oppmerksomhetstrening (de Vibe & Moum, 2006; Kabat-Zinn, [1990] 2009). KONKLUSJON OG IMPLIKASJONER FOR PRAKSIS: Deltakerne gir tydelige signaler om at som del av et helhetlig rehabiliteringstilbud vil taktilbehandlinger være et gode for pasientene. På bakgrunn av denne studien anbefales videre utprøving av taktil stimulering som behandling til lungesyke med stress, angst eller utmattelse. Stress- og angstreduksjon er viktig i alle faser av rehabiliteringsprosessen. Det er i dag et begrenset antall utøvere av taktil stimulering i norsk helsevesen. Det har vært arrangert kurs for utøvere med ulik faglig bakgrunn i samarbeid med Kommunal Kompetanse. Spørsmålet er om helsevesenet vil prioritere slik behandling uten at effektstudier er gjennomført. Det er behov for mer forskning når det gjelder virkninger, hvem som vil ha størst nytte av behandlingen, i hvilket omfang og hva som kreves av oppfølging for å opprettholde virkninger. TITLE: Breathing space for COPD patients: How can tactile touch {{contribute to the}} rehabilitation process for COPD patients suffering from stress, anxiety or fatigue? BACKGROUND: Many COPD patients have a heavy burden of symptoms {{and high levels of}} stress and anxiety. This can lead to viscious circles of fatigue, social withdrawal and giving up hope for the future. Pulmonary rehabilitation offers training the self-management of medication, physical exercise and a multidisciplinary educational programme. Limited attention has been given to the relief of symptoms in periods when patients have little capacity to participate in active rehabilitation. Treatments with the Swedish method tactile touch has for many years been given to groups of patients to relieve various symptoms. To the author’s knowledge there are, to date, no studies including COPD patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do COPD patients with stress, anxiety or fatigue experience tactile touch treatments? In what ways can tactile touch treatment contribute to COPD patients’ rehabilitation process? AIM: To assess the patient’s perspective of whether tactile touch contributes to restoring balance and energy, so that patients are better able to cope with stress or anxiety caused by their disease and life stressors. This study will provide the basis for deciding if this treatment should be offered {{as an integral part of}} the regular rehabilitation programme to address the symptoms of stress and anxiety and will generate further research questions for investigation. METHODS: Qualitative methods were used to explore the patients’ experience of treatment with tactile touch. Four participants with different grades of COPD received a series of ten tactile treatments once or twice a week. They recorded diary notes after each treatment and participated in two focus group interviews with six months interval after the treatments were finished. A modified version of Giorgi’s “Four steps method” was used to analyse the data (Malterud, 2003). THEORY: A theoretical perspective from the field of positive psychology, ”The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions” (Fredrickson, 1998, 2001) was used to discuss the meaning of the findings. This theory suggests that positive emotions can contribute to a broadening of the thoughtaction repertoire, build resilience and social support and enhance health and quality of life. FINDINGS: The participants reported that following the treatments they experienced a wholeness of body and mind. They became more aware of the essential needs in their life situation. They reported that they had experienced being able to deal with stress and anxiety in a better way, even if the external stressors were not reduced. They described experiencing feelings of inner peace, balance and harmony, as well as improved body perception. They also reported that they had experienced positive thoughts and emotions during and following the treatment. Improved <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> during daily activities, increased appetite and pain relief were reported by participants. These findings are consistent with those reported previously in the literature (Uvnäs-Moberg, 2000; Olsson, 2004; Henricson & Billhult, 2010). Participants reported that the relaxation response could remain in the body for several days after treatment and that they could reproduce the relaxation response by visualizing their treatments. They felt that this offered a buffer against stress and anxiety. It is difficult to comment on the long-term effects of tactile touch in people with COPD from this study. DISCUSSION: Questions that are discussed are what this kind of treatment could offer in relation to hope and the potential possibilities when associated with the rehabilitation process. Tactile touch treatments seem to provide a sort of broadened experience that gives associations to “mindfulness” or conscious presence. Could this approach contribute to a broadened thought-action pattern and start a positive “snowball” effect as proposed by Fredrickson’s (1998, 2001) “broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions”? Possible ways of maintaining the effects of tactile touch are considered, such as mindfulness training (de Vibe & Moum, 2006; Kabat-Zinn, [1990] 2009). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Participants clearly express the opinion that tactile touch may benefit patients when integrated into a holistic rehabilitation programme. On the basis of this study further exploration of tactile touch as treatment to COPD patients with stress, anxiety or fatigue is recommended. Reduction of stress and anxiety is important throughout the rehabilitation process. Today there are a limited number of practicioners of tactile touch in the Norwegian public health services. Training of practitioners with various professional background has been arranged in cooperation with “Kommunal Kompetanse”. The question is whether the public health system will give priority to such treatment without the evidence of larger studies demonstrating a quantitative effect in people with COPD. More research is needed to establish who would benefit from this treatment as well as the quantity and frequency required to give and maintain an effect. Master i rehabiliterin...|$|E

40|$|Background: Dysfunctional {{breathing}} (DB) is {{implicated in}} {{physical and psychological}} health, however evaluation is hampered by lack of rigorous definition and clearly defined measures. Screening tools for DB include biochemical measures such as end-tidal CO 2, biomechanical measures such assessments <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> pattern, breathing symptom questionnaires and tests <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> function such as breath holding time. Aim: This study investigates whether screening tools for dysfunctional breathing measure distinct or associated aspects <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> functionality. Method: 84 self-referred or practitioner-referred individuals with concerns about their breathing were assessed using screening tools proposed to identify DB. Correlations between these measures were determined. Results: Significant correlations where found within categories of measures however ccorrelations between variables in different categories were generally not significant. No measures were found to correlate with carbon dioxide levels. Conclusion: DB cannot be simply defined. For practical purposes DB is probably best characterised as a multi-dimensional construct with at least 3 dimensions, biochemical, biomechanical and breathing related symptoms. Comprehensive evaluation <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> dysfunction should include measures <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> symptoms, breathing pattern, resting CO 2 and also include functional measures such a breath holding time and response <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> to physical and psychological challenges including stress testing with CO 2 monitoring. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
