The result shows the <b>floating</b> <b>shaft</b> can achieved load sharing, the support stiffness is an important factor, decreasing the input shaft support stiffness, load sharing performance becomes better and vibration decreases by increasing the displacement of shaft. To study effect of errors, every errors change separately while others’ ideal. Every errors affect load sharing in different way, gear 4 manufacturing error and shaft 2 assembly error affect load sharing most, load sharing cannot achieve by decreasing one error...|$|E
40|$|Design analysis, detail design, fabrication, and {{experimental}} evaluation {{was performed on}} two self acting <b>floating</b> ring <b>shaft</b> seals for a rocket engine turbopump high pressure 24132500 n/sq m (3500 psig) hot gas 533 K 9500 F) high speed 3142 rad/sec (30000 rmp) turbine. The initial design used Rayleigh step hydrodynamic lift pads to assist in centering the seal ring with minimum rubbing contact. The final design used a convergent tapered bore to provide hydrostatic centering force. The Rayleigh step design was tested for 107 starts and 4. 52 hours total. The leakage was satisfactory; however, the design was not acceptable due to excessive wear caused by inadequate centering force and failure of the sealing dam caused by erosion damage. The tapered bore design was tested for 370 starts and 15. 93 hours total. Satisfactory performance for the required life of 7. 5 hours per seal was successfully demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs a new {{technical}} approach, {{wave energy}} converter by using vertical motion {{of water in the}} multiple water chambers were developed to realize actual wave power generation as eco-environmental renewable energy. And practical use of {{wave energy converter}} was actually to require the following conditions: (1) setting up of the relevant device and its application to wave power generation in case that severe wave loading is avoided; (2) workability in installation and maintenance operations; (3) high energy conversion potential; and (4) low cost. In this system, neither the wall(s) of the chambers nor the energy conversion device(s) are exposed to the impulsive load due to water wave. Also since this system is profitable when set along the jetty or along a long floating body, installation and maintenance are done without difficulty and the cost is reduced. In this paper, we describe the system which consists of a <b>float,</b> a <b>shaft</b> connected with another shaft, a rack and pinion arrangement, a ratchet mechanism, and rotary type generator(s). Then, we present the dynamics model for evaluating the output electric power, and the results of numerical calculation including the effect of the phase shift of up/down motion of the water in the array of water chambers aligned along the direction of wave propagation...|$|R
5000|$|Delville's growing {{interest}} in Idealist art led him to instigate a succession from L'Essor {{to start a new}} exhibition society called Pour L'Art. Many of the younger artists of L'Essor followed him which led to the dissolution of that group. Pour L'Art became one of the noted avant-garde exhibition societies on Brussels at the time. The leading avant-garde exhibition forum at the time was Les XX. Following Les XX, Pour L'Art invited international artists as well, several of whom became well known in Symbolist circles, including Carlos Schwabe, Alexandre Séon, Chales Filiger and Jan Verkade. Their first exhibition took place in November 1892 and the works displayed were executed in either an Impressionist or Symbolist idiom. Delville designed the poster for the first exhibition depicting a long-necked sphinx - a key symbol of the period - cupping a flaming chalice in her hands. Delville's main work of that year was his L'Idole de la Perversité which can be considered one of the major images of the period. The new group received a largely positive press during the time. The group was closely associated with Joséphin Péladan's Salons de la Rose+Croix in Paris, and Péladan was frequently invited to lecture in Brussels at the time by members of the Pour L'Art group.The second exhibition of the Pour L'Art group took place in January 1894. Significantly the society also included the applied, or decorative arts, which were become widely popular at the time and a particular feature of Art Nouveau. Tapestries, bookbindings, and wrought-iron work was displayed alongside the paintings. The influence of Delville and Péladan was evident in the predominance of idealist works of art influenced by late fifteenth-century Florentine art, the work of Gustav Moreau, Puvis de Chavannes and the tendency towards large-scale figure compositions. The show was enthusiastically received by the press. Delville's main works exhibited that year was his celebrated La Mort d'Orphée (1893, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels) and his outstanding Mysteriosa or Portrait of Mrs Stuart Madame Stuart Merrill (1892, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels). His work was enthusiastically praised in the press. The leading critic Ernest Verlant wrote: One of the principal members of the Pour L’Art group, in view of his talent and astonishing fecundity, is Jean Delville, who is also a writer and a poet; with a powerful imagination that is funereal and tormented. These epithets are equally suited to his large painting La Proie, a crimson vision of apocalyptic murder, similar to his vast composition from last year, Vers l’inconnu, and of several before that. … Here and there, for example, in L’homme du glaive, the Murmure profane, and Mysteriosa, he pushes the intensity of expression to its extreme. Elsewhere, as in Satana, he draws together, rather bizarrely, esoteric attributes in a figure derived from da Vinci. But we are able only to express praise in front of Orphée, a dead head <b>floating</b> between the <b>shafts</b> of a large lyre; in front of Elegia, a long and supple female body appearing under the spurting and cascading waters of a fountain; in front of Au Loin and Maternitas, two figures pensively leaning on their elbows, of which the first of the two has a great nobility. These works are monochrome, or nearly so. Their expression is accurate, fine, subtle, refined, not too explicit, and all the more eloquent.The final Pour L'Art show took place in January 1895. Delville also participated for the last time in Péladan's Salons de la Rose+Croix. This was the year when he began preparing the formation of his own exclusively Idealist exhibition Society, the Salons d'Art Idéaliste, which opened the following year. By this time the Pour L'Art Salons were well-established, successful and enthusiastically supported by the contemporary press. Delville's L'Ange des splendeurs (1894, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels), was Delville's main work of that show. Although not widely praised it stands, according to Brendan Cole, as one of his initiatory paintings par excellence of Delville's oeuvre ...|$|R
