In OFDM system, inter-carrier interference (ICI) occurs due to FO which is caused by an oscillator of a transmitter and receiver, and degrades {{the performance of}} a receiver. Thus, FO should be estimated and compensated to improve {{the performance of a}} receiver. FO can be normalized to subcarrier spacing in OFDM system, and consists of fractional frequency offset (FFO) and integer frequency offset (IFO) accordingly. FFO is estimated in time domain using cyclic prefix (CP), and IFO is estimated in frequency domain with unique synchronization sequence (USS) of preamble due to the structure of DVB-C 2 frame. Because the estimation of FO is influenced by CP length and <b>echo</b> <b>channels</b> shown in the DVB-C 2 specification, we simulate the mean square error (MSE) of FO estimation w. r. t CP length and <b>echo</b> <b>channels.</b> The results of simulation show that MSE is reduced as CP length is longer. In addition, MSE is improved as E b/N 0 increases. However, MSE of the estimated FO tends to saturate at high E b/N 0 when <b>echo</b> <b>channels</b> are used. In addition, it increases when the maximum delay spread between <b>echo</b> <b>channels</b> is longer. shows the two types of <b>echo</b> channels; <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> 1 (EC 1) and <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> 2 (EC 2) [2], [3]. Because EC 2 has the longer maximum delay spread than EC 1, EC 2 is inferior to EC 1. Thus, we simulate the MSE of the estimated FO under various channel conditions. II.

40|$|In {{the past}} years, {{a number of}} {{researchers}} have investigated the use of digital echo cancellation systems for transmission technologies based on discrete multi-tone (DMT) modulation, such as that used in asymmetrical digital subscriber lines (ADSL) and the likes. Almost all the existing papers report on equal transmission rate systems, while little attention has been given to the multi-rate case. In fact, the first multi-rate echo canceller structure was developed by Ho et al., and has always been referred since. In this thesis, two sets of simplified techniques are developed. The first one reports on a fast initialization technique of the echo canceller. The method consists of replacing the first least mean square (LMS) iteration of the <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> estimate by the solution of a system cost function in which circular convolution is assumed. The simplification of the method resides in the fact that no known sequence is used, and thus, no protocol is required. The second simplified technique developed aims to reduce the computational complexity of the multi-rate echo canceller structure at the lower transmit rate side of the link, e. g. the line terminal side in ADSL. In this case, the echo canceller located in the terminal, processes the signals in the entire frequency bandwidth (higher rate). During the processing, the <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> that is estimated corresponds in fact to the imperfect hybrid channel combined with the lowpass filtering action of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and the time-domain equalizer(TEQ). In such a situation, the frequency taps representing the estimated <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> decay rapidly above the cutoff frequency of the DAC filter. In this work, we exploit this specific structure of the <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> to reduce the computational complexity of the echo cancellation processing by setting a portion of the high frequency echo tap coefficients to zero, and by exploiting certain properties of the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) algorithm. Experimental simulations for an ADSL-like configuration involving 32 tones on the upstream and 256 tones on the downstream, showed that by employing the new proposed approach, the computational complexity can be reduced by a factor of as much as 53 % {{while at the same time}} improving the achievable bitrate by 35 kbps. Furthermore, in regards of the initialization technique, the <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> estimate convergence can be reached after around 6 iterations as compared to 15 for usual LMS algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Channel {{estimation}} {{is required}} in virtually all communication systems: wireless, optical, and electrical systems. Modern mobile wireless devices undertake channel estimation repeatedly and audio communication systems of all varieties repeatedly estimate the echo-path <b>channel</b> so that <b>echos</b> can be cancelled. The channel estimation {{must be carried out}} repeatedly because the channel will vary while communication is taking place. This dissertation examines channel estimation in both acoustic and wireless cases. Echo cancellation has become ubiquitous because it is superior to other echo management techniques whenever the <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> can successfully be estimated. Echo cancellation relies on the correct estimation and modelling of the <b>echo</b> <b>channel.</b> Despite much research into advanced echo cancellation techniques, there remains acoustic applications where the channel is too dynamic for existing <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> estimation techniques to succeed. An echo cancellation simulation environment has been developed to facilitate the simulation of dynamic echo environments and the monitoring of the results and the internal state of echo cancellation algorithms. This environment enables the monitoring of the overall result and the internal state of the echo cancellation algorithms. Object oriented programming techniques are used to achieve the flexibility needed to do this for diff�erent algorithms, diff�erent stimulus or test signals, diff�erent background noise and diff�erent channels. While most acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>channels</b> are essentially linear, speakers can introduce non linearity to an <b>echo</b> <b>channel,</b> depending on their quality. A simpli�fed non linear <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> model of this situation is used, and a non linear algorithm for echo cancellation developed that estimates the parameters of this model. Second order statistics are used in techniques for channel estimation in wireless systems. Their use is necessary, given the dynamic nature of wireless channels. To date, however, there have been few attempts to fully utilise second order statistics as part of channel estimation for acoustic systems. The optimal linear estimator of the channel is identif�ed that fully takes the second-order statistics of the channel variation into account. Test signals are often used in the estimation of wireless channels. They are also used in the estimation of acoustic channels. Equations characterising the optimal (in the sense of least-squares estimation error for �fixed power) test signal based on the second order statistics of the channel and of the noise are developed. The power advantage of an optimal test signal over white noise as a signal is unbounded as the channel statistics vary. Channel autocovariances may be represented by covariance matrices. The model off�ered by a covariance matrix is often too complicated for use in practice, however. A model of intermediate complexity has been developed that remains suffiently flexible to encapsulate desirable features of a channel autocovariance while being �significantly simpler to use. The simplified model of a channel autocovariance has been used to randomly generate autocovariance matrices that are suitable for use in the testing the method for fi�nding optimal test signals...|$|R

These systems brought torrential rainfall over the southwestern plain of Taiwan. The plan position indicators of CWB Chiku Doppler weather radar illustrate that the intense echoes had developed into convective lines with bulge, which are often referred to quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS). The constant altitude plan position indicators of Chiku radar show that there existed a significant weak <b>echo</b> <b>channel</b> in rear of the apex, splitting intense echoes (> 40 dBZ) into two parts. The radial velocity reveals that a cyclonic shear was located on {{the northern part of}} the linear system between 2 to 5 km levels in altitude.

The result is shown in Figs.  11 c and 12 c. We observe that, as the number of antennas increases on the AP, the achieved channel division improvement decreases for both frequency bands. This is due to channels between users tending to be more orthogonal, regardless of the frequency selectivity, as the number of antennas become much more than the number of selected users. In addition, the throughput performance improvement due to channel division is more significant in the 5.2 -GHz band as compared with the 2.4 -GHz band.|$|R

To separate up- and downstream signals, the ADSL standard allows the use of echo cancellation resulting in improved bit rates, reach, and/or noise margins. In DMT-based modems, typically, the mixed time/frequency (MTF) domain echo canceling scheme, as proposed by Ho et al., is implemented. This technique estimates the echo filter in the frequency domain using the least mean square (LMS) algorithm with the transmitted echo symbols as update directions.

However, transmitting extra power on such tones is often undesired. In this paper, we present an alternative echo canceling scheme referred to as the circulant decomposition canceler (CDC), which works without extra power requirements and with comparable complexity as the method of Ho et al. Similar to MTF echo canceling, the CDC scheme can easily be incorporated into a multirate environment with different transmit and receive rates and can also cheaply be combined with per-tone equalization and double talk cancellation to allow fast tracking and/or convergence {{in the presence of a}} far-end signal. status: publishe...|$|R
