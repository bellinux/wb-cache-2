60|$|Our party {{amounted}} to seven. The first stage was very interesting. The day was powerfully hot, {{and as we}} passed through the woods, everything was motionless, excepting the large and brilliant butterflies, which lazily fluttered about. The view seen when crossing the hills behind Praia Grande was most beautiful; the colours were intense, and the prevailing tint a dark blue; {{the sky and the}} calm waters of the bay vied with each other in splendour. After passing through some cultivated country, we entered a forest which in the grandeur of all its parts could not be exceeded. We arrived by midday at Ithacaia; this small village is situated on a plain, and round the central house are the huts of the negroes. These, from their regular form and position, reminded me of the drawings of the Hottentot habitations in Southern Africa. As the moon rose early, we determined to start the same evening for our sleeping-place at the Lagoa Marica. As it was growing dark we passed under one of the massive, bare, and steep hills of granite which are so common in this country. This spot is notorious from having been, for a long time, the residence of some runaway slaves, who, by cultivating a little ground near the top, contrived to eke out a subsistence. At length they were discovered, and a party of soldiers being sent, the whole were seized {{with the exception of one}} old woman, who, sooner than again be led into slavery, dashed herself to pieces from the summit of the mountain. In a Roman matron this would have been called the noble love of freedom: in a poor negress it is mere brutal obstinacy. We continued riding for some hours. For the few last miles the road was intricate, and it passed through a desert waste of marshes and lagoons. The scene by the <b>dimmed</b> <b>light</b> of the moon was most desolate. A few fireflies flitted by us; and the solitary snipe, as it rose, uttered its plaintive cry. The distant and sullen roar of the sea scarcely broke the stillness of the night.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{addition}} of two 3 -h periods of very <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> one before and one after a normal 8 -h photope-riod, advances sexual maturity in pullets {{by about a}} week. This trial tested the hypothesis that <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> given before a short day of normal intensity is linked to form a more stimulatory day length and that <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> given after it is photosexually ignored. Pullets were reared from 2 d of age on 8 -h photoperiods. From 10 wk, they were contin-ued on 8 -h photoperiods, transferred to 16 h, or given an 8 -h period of <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> (0. 09 lx) immediately {{before or after the}} main 8 -h photoperiod. The bright/dim and dim/ bright groups matured at the same age, thus disproving the hypothesis tested.

First, photographs of the mice were taken in <b>dimmed</b> <b>light.</b> Then bioluminescent images were taken with an exposure time of 10  s. The <b>dimmed</b> <b>light</b> images were merged with the corresponding bioluminescent images and the light emissions transformed into pseudocolours.

30|$|In case {{of blood}} and tissue samples, {{electrophoresis}} is performed at high pH (>[*] 13) which facilitates denaturation of DNA (because of the disruption of hydrogen bonds between double-stranded DNA) and expression of alkali labile sites as frank breaks. The electrophoresis would pull the damaged DNA towards the anode thus making the distinct ‘tail’ of the comet. Electrophoresis is conducted at 4  °C with constant voltage 0.7  V/cm for blood (Bajpayee et al. 2005) and organs/tissue for 30  min. All steps are performed under <b>dimmed</b> <b>light</b> (Shukla et al. 2014).|$|E

40|$|Due {{to our own}} {{preference}} for bright light, we tend to forget that many insects are active in very <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> Nocturnal insects possess in general superposition compound eyes. This eye design is truly optimized for <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> as photons can be gathered through large apertures comprised of hundreds of lenses. In apposition eyes, on the other hand, the aperture consists of a single lens resulting in a poor photon catch and unreliable vision in <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> Apposition eyes are therefore typically found in day-active insects. Some nocturnal insects have nevertheless managed {{the transition to a}} strictly nocturnal lifestyle while retaining their highly unsuitable apposition eye design. Large lenses and wide photoreceptors enhance the sensitivity of nocturnal apposition eyes. However, as the gain of these optical adaptations is limited and not sufficient for vision in <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> additional neural adaptations in the form of spatial and temporal summation are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Reaction of {{iodoacetic acid}} with cupric {{carbonate}} in water in <b>dimmed</b> <b>light</b> yields green Cu(ICH 2 COO) (2 center dot) H 2 O (1). From X-ray crystallography, {{it is found}} to be a tetra-acetato bridged copper(II) dimer with the water molecules occupying the apical positions. In thermogravimetry, the coordinated water molecules are lost in the temperature range 50 - 100 degrees C. From magnetic susceptibility measurements in the temperature range 300 - 1. 8 K, the exchange coupling constant J {{is found to be}} - 142 (1) cm(- 1) and g = 2. 18 (2) with the spin Hamiltonian H = - 2 J{S-Cu 1 center dot S-Cu 2 }. It reacts with 2, 2 '-bipyridine (bpy) to yield [Cu(bpy) (2) I]I. It oxidises thiophenol to Ph-S-S-Ph under dry N- 2 atmosphere...|$|E
30|$|Looking {{first at}} which cases have the fewest LMM-based {{significant}} differences, photo appears best, with only 36 out of 150 comparisons different. Pano follows with 40, and static with 52. Since, {{as stated in}} section Statistical Analysis, lack of significance does not indicate {{that there is a}} match for the remaining conditions, we look at which cases have the most DMOS bars within the boundaries of small Cohen’s d effect size. From this perspective, static is the best with 51 matches, followed by photo with 49 and pano with 34. Overall, these numbers showed that although two-thirds or more of the comparisons were not significantly different from the real space, roughly only one-third of the differences were small enough to be considered a match according to our Cohen’s d small effect size threshold. Looking closely at Fig.  5, it is apparent that some lighting conditions match better than others. For many attributes the mean differences seem to be especially large for the <b>dimmed</b> <b>light</b> conditions (9 – 12) compared {{to the rest of the}} conditions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLow {{temperatures}} {{result in}} lower metabolic cellular activity, thus slowing down cell division and growth. This is advantageous where a plant scientist might seek to store important germplasm without {{the risks associated}} with low temperature storage. In this study, two cold temperatures above freezing, namely 4 and 10 °C, were tested to assess for how long PLBs could be preserved without a significant loss in regeneration ability (i. e., the ability to form neo-PLBs). Control treatments were cultured at 25 °C on Teixeira Cymbidium (TC) medium at a 16 -h photoperiod at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 45 μmolm− 2 s− 1. For the cold treatments, each was replicated in the dark and at low light intensity (12 -h photoperiod and a PPFD of 10 μmolm− 2 s− 1). All cultures were sub-cultured six times onto fresh medium every 60 days, for approximately 1 year. On the 7 th subculture, all neo-PLBs were prepared uniformly and replated onto standard TC medium under light conditions described above for the control. 45 days after the 7 th subculture and just before subcultures 1 – 6, the number of neo-PLBs per half-PLB was measured. The number of neo-PLBs that formed under different treatments depended strongly on the temperature and light conditions with most neo-PLBs forming under control conditions, although that number dropped significantly as the temperature was dropped to 10 °C and then even more to 4 °C, the same trend being observed when explants were cultured and subcultured under dim light, with organogenesis being more strongly negatively influenced in darkness. For all low-temperature treatments, as well as the <b>dimmed</b> <b>light</b> and darkness treatments, the number of neo-PLBs increased significantly when recultured, on the 7 th subculture, onto control TC medium under control environmental conditions, almost as high as the control values. In contrast, the control values decreased, with significantly fewer neo-PLBs by the 7 th subculture relative to the control, indicating that new PLBs should be induced from shoot cultures {{at least once a year}} to maintain their vitality...|$|E

40|$|The sweat bee Megalopta (Hymenoptera: Halictidae), {{unlike most}} bees, flies in {{extremely}} <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> And although nocturnal insects are often equipped with superposition eyes, which greatly enhance light capture, Megalopta performs visually guided flight with apposition eyes. We examined how light limits Megalopta's flight behavior by measuring flight times and corresponding light levels and comparing them with flight trajectories upon {{return to the}} nest. We found the average time to land increased in <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> an effect due not to slow approaches, but to circuitous approaches. Some landings, however, were quite fast even in the dark. To explain this, we examined the flight trajectories and found that in <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> landings became increasingly error prone and erratic, consistent with repeated landing attempts. These data agree well with the premise that Megalopta uses visual summation, sacrificing acuity {{in order to see}} and fly at the very <b>dimmest</b> <b>light</b> intensities that its visual system allows...|$|R
