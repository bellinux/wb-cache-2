25|$|On 16 December 2010, the Court of Justice of the European Union {{upheld a}} local Maastricht {{ban on the}} sale of {{cannabis}} to foreign tourists, restricting entrance to coffee shops to residents of Maastricht. The ban did not affect scientific or medical usage. In 2011, the Dutch government introduced a similar national system, the wietpas ("cannabis pass"), restricting access to Dutch coffeeshops to residents of the Netherlands. After protests from local mayors about the difficulty of implementing the issuing of wietpasses, Dutch parliament in 2012 agreed to replace the pass by any proof of residency. The new system has led to a slight reduction in <b>drug</b> <b>tourism</b> to cannabis shops in Maastricht {{but at the same time}} to an increase of drug dealing on the street.|$|E
25|$|A {{government}} committee {{delivered in}} June 2011 a report about Cannabis to the Dutch government. It includes {{a proposal that}} cannabis with more than 15 percent THC should be labeled as hard drugs. Higher concentrations of THC and <b>drug</b> <b>tourism</b> have challenged the current policy {{and led to a}} re-examination of the current approach; e.g. ban of all sales of cannabis to tourists in coffeeshops from end of 2011 was proposed but currently only the border city of Maastricht has adopted the measure in order to test out its feasibility. According to the initial measure, starting in 2012, each coffeeshop was to operate like a private club with some 1,000 to 1,500 members. In order to qualify for a membership card, applicants would have to be adult Dutch citizens, membership was only to be allowed in one club.|$|E
25|$|One of the proposals, {{known as}} the 'Coffee Corner Plan', {{proposed}} by then-mayor Leers and supported unanimously by the city council in 2008, was to relocate the coffeeshops from the city centre {{to the outskirts of}} the town (in some cases near the national Dutch-Belgian border). The purpose of this plan was to reduce the impact of <b>drug</b> <b>tourism</b> on the city centre, such as parking problems and the illegal sale of hard drugs {{in the vicinity of the}} coffeeshops, and to monitor the sale and use of cannabis more closely in areas away from the crowded city centre. The Coffee Corner Plan, however, has met with fierce opposition from neighbouring municipalities (some in Belgium) and from members of the Dutch and Belgian parliament. The plan has been the subject of various legal challenges and has not been carried out up to this date (2014).|$|E

40|$|About the book: Recent {{years have}} seen growing media and {{political}} attention {{to the issue of}} tourism and crime in a number of countries. The high profile cases of the Madeleine McCann abduction and the murder of Meredith Kercher have received huge media attention in the UK, and raised concerns about crimes against tourists. At the same time, issues such as <b>drugs</b> <b>tourism,</b> sex tourism and alcohol-related crime and disorder among holidaymakers, have highlighted crimes and rule-breaking more generally committed by tourists. To date, however, this tourism-crime nexus has received little scholarly attention. Tourism and Crime: key themes is the first book to address this gap. It provides a critical examination of a range of topics, including criminal offending against tourists, tourists as offenders, and policy-responses to tourist crime. It focuses on a number of subjects including tourism and property crime, the tourist as victim, the 'naming and shaming' of specific 'danger travel spots', the governance of safety in 'stateless' spaces, cooperation between justice authorities in different jurisdictions, <b>drugs</b> <b>tourism,</b> plus a range of other relevant issues. With contributions from an international team of highly respected authors and researchers, Tourism and Crime: key themes brings together concepts, ideas and empirical evidence from two distinct fields of research enquiry - criminology and tourism studies - and maps out a cross-disciplinary research agenda for scholars and policy-makers in this area. In this chapter the following topics are considered: Child sex tourism Extra-territorial legislation Obstacles to enforcement The role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the media Children’s own accounts of child prostitution...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the impact on}} crime of a localized policing experiment that depenalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis in the London borough of Lambeth. Theory suggests such a policy will: (i) impact {{the size of the}} market for cannabis in Lambeth as well as neighboring boroughs as drug users move to Lambeth to purchase cannabis; (ii) allow the police to reallocate effort towards other types of crime. We investigate whether such changing crime patterns are observed during and after the depenalization policy is introduced in Lambeth using administrative records on criminal offences by drug type, by specific drug offences that proxy demand and supply side criminal activities, and for seven types of non-drug crime. We find that depenalization in Lambeth led to an increase in cannabis possession offences that persisted well after the policy experiment ended. Half of the increase is attributable to <b>drugs</b> <b>tourism</b> into Lambeth from neighboring boroughs after depenalization. We find little evidence that the policy caused the police to reallocate effort towards Class-A drug crime, rather the evidence suggests the police in Lambeth reallocate their effort towards non-drug crime: there are significant reductions in five non-drug crim...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, the Vereniging van Nederlandse Gemeenten (VNG, the {{organisation}} of Dutch municipalities) organised a wiettop ("weed summit", a wordplay on the flowery tops that cannabis is made of), attended by 33 Dutch mayors from both {{big and small}} municipalities and various political parties. Reasons for the summit were <b>drugs</b> <b>tourism</b> in border regions (the mayors of Roosendaal and Bergen op Zoom had just announced an intention to close all coffeeshops), the strong link with illegality (including laundering of money through coffeeshops) and the discrepancies between {{the policies of the}} various municipalities. At this wiettop, all mayors agreed that regulation of the 'backdoor' was desirable. Rob van Gijzel, mayor of Eindhoven announced he intended to start a 'monitored pilot' of issuing licenses for the production of cannabis. But near the borders, the front door should also be (better) regulated, forbidding sales to foreigners. This would also greatly decrease the demand at the backdoor. Intentions were to discuss the results of the wiettop with the national government before the end of 2008. As of 2014, this discussion is still ongoing. A majority of mayors and users have extended the wish to allow some form of regulated, legal, cultivation for sale to the coffeeshops as this would lower the crime/violence rate, solve the backdoor issue and can generate some income. However, liberal minister Ivo Opstelten has blocked any such proposals so far and has refused to investigate it altogether. The mayors are still trying to force the minister to at least investigate the situation and allow a pilot to be conducted.|$|R

40|$|Background The Dutch {{coffee shop}} policy was {{tightened}} in 2012. Two additional criteria that coffee shops must adhere {{to in order}} for them to be tolerated came into force: the private club and the residence criterion. Coffee shops were only permitted to give access to members and only residents of the Netherlands were permitted to become a member. This tightened policy sought to make coffee shops smaller and more controllable, to reduce the nuisance associated with coffee shops and to reduce the number of foreign visitors attracted by the coffee shops. Enforcement began in the southern provinces. The private club criterion was abolished at the end of 2012. Methods A sample of fourteen municipalities with coffee shops was drawn. Seven in the south were treated as an ‘experimental group’ and the others as ‘comparison group’. A baseline assessment and follow-ups at six and 18 months were performed. A combination of methods was applied: interviews with local experts, surveys with neighbourhood residents, coffee shop visitors and cannabis users, and ethnographic field work. Results <b>Drugs</b> <b>tourism</b> to coffee shops swiftly declined in 2012. The coffee shops also lost a large portion of their local customers, since users did not want to register as a member. The illegal market expanded. Neighbourhood residents experienced a greater amount of nuisance caused by dealer activities. After abolishment of the private club criterion, residents of the Netherlands largely returned to the coffee shops. Drug tourists still remained largely absent. Neighbourhood residents experienced more nuisance from coffee shops again. Illegal cannabis sale was tempered. No effect on cannabis use was found. Conclusion The quick and robust shifts in the users’ market in reaction to the policy changes illustrate the power of policy, but also the limitations caused by the dynamic and resilient nature of the Dutch cannabis supply market...|$|R

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the prevalence of both scabies and head lice is increasing and also that both conditions are becoming refractory to pesticide treatment. Using information obtained from the Office of National Statistics, Royal College of General Practitioners Weekly Returns Service, Department of Health, local surveys of school children from Bristol and drug sales of insecticides, we have confirmed {{that there has been a}} rise in the prevalence of both conditions. We have shown that scabies is significantly more prevalent in urbanized areas (P < 0. 00001), north of the country (P < 0. 000001), in children and women (P < 0. 000001) and commoner in the winter compared to the summer. Scabies was also shown to have a cyclical rise in incidence roughly every 20 years. Head lice were shown to be significantly more prevalent in children and mothers (P < 0. 000001) though both conditions were seen in all age groups. Head lice were also less common during the summer. Host behaviour patterns, asymptomatic carriage, <b>drug</b> resistance and <b>tourism</b> from countries or districts with a higher incidence may be important factors in the currently high prevalence of both scabies and head lice...|$|R

40|$|Although postcolonialism {{has emerged}} as one of the most {{significant}} theoretical movements in literary and cultural studies, it has paid scant attention to the importance of trade and trade relations to debates about culture. Focusing on the past two centuries, this volume investigates the links among trade, colonialism, and forms of representation, posing the question, ‘What is the historical or modern relationship between economic inequality and imperial patterns of representation and reading?’ Rather than dealing exclusively with a particular industry or type of industry, the contributors take up the issue of how various economies have been represented in Aboriginal art; in literature by North American, Caribbean, Portuguese, South African, First Nations, Australian, British, and Aboriginal authors; and in a diverse range of writings that includes travel diaries, missionary texts, the findings of the Leprosy Investigation Commission, early medical accounts and media representations of HIV/AIDS. Examining trade in commodities as various as illicit <b>drugs,</b> liquor, bananas, <b>tourism,</b> adventure fiction, and modern Aboriginal art, as well as cultural exchanges in politics, medicine, and literature, the essays reflect the widespread origins of the contributors themselves, who are based throughout the English-speaking world. Taken as a whole, this book contests the commonplace view promoted by some modern economists-that trade in and of itself has a leveling effect, equalising cultures, places, and peoples-demonstrating instead the ways in which commerce has created and exacerbated differences in power...|$|R
40|$|Host and visitor {{interactions}} {{are important in}} determining a destination 2 ̆ 7 s sustainability. According to social exchange theory, negative outcomes from deviant tourism-related behaviours such as illicit drug-related activities can result in reduced host and guest support for <b>tourism.</b> While <b>drug</b> use may attract some guests it can also deter others and may also result in an inauthentic experience. Thus, reconciling host and visitor perceptions and aspirations can often be problematic. This paper examines how hosts and guests in Nimbin, Australia, a destination {{with a reputation for}} a relaxed attitude towards illicit <b>drug</b> use, view <b>tourism.</b> The paper draws upon three studies – an online content analysis, a survey of guest expectations and behaviours, and a stakeholder workshop of hosts – undertaken between 2007 and 2010 to demonstrate how the drug culture image of the town is affecting the host-guest nexus. Online discourse strongly emphasised a permissive drug image within Nimbin while the stakeholder workshop revealed that many hosts are unhappy with this emphasis. A substantial majority of guests to Nimbin are attracted by the town 2 ̆ 7 s reputation/image however they appear to be less interested in the drug culture than in the alternative lifestyle.

40|$|The {{retail sale}} of {{cannabis}} in coffee shops is tolerated in the Netherlands, provided that certain criteria are met. Two criteria were added in 2012 : the private club and the residence criterion. The {{plan was to}} implement them first in the southern provinces {{and later in the}} other provinces.
