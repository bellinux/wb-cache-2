5|$|By 1896 {{the family}} had hit another period of {{financial}} trouble, and Hastings left Charterhouse to move to continental Europe {{with his mother and}} older brother Archie until there was enough money for the family to return to London. The family initially moved to Ajaccio in Corsica, where they bought several old guns and taught Hastings and his brother <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot.</b> After six months in Ajaccio the family moved again, this time to the Ardennes, where they also learnt how to fish and ride horses.|$|E
5|$|His brother Howard Burnham (1870–1918), born {{shortly before}} {{the family moved to}} Los Angeles, lost one leg at the age of 14 and {{suffered}} from tuberculosis. During his teenage years he lived with Fred in California and learned from his brother the art of Scoutcraft, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot,</b> and how to ride the range, all in spite of his wooden leg. Howard moved to Africa, became a mining engineer in the Johannesburg gold mines, and later wrote a text book on Modern Mine Valuation. He traveled the world and for a time teamed up with Fred on Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico. During World War I, Howard worked as a spy for the French government, operating behind enemy lines in southwest Germany. Throughout the war he used his wooden leg to conceal tools he needed for spying. From his death bed, Howard returned to France via Switzerland and shared his vital data and secrets with the French government: the Germans were not opening a new front in the Alps and {{there was no need to}} move allied troops away from the Western Front. Howard was buried at Cannes, France, leaving behind his wife and four children. He had been named after his second cousin, Lieutenant Howard Mather Burnham who was killed in action in the American Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Lawrence dyed {{her blond}} hair dark for the part of Katniss. She also {{underwent}} extensive training {{to get in shape}} for the role, including archery, rock and tree climbing, combat, running, parkour, and yoga, and had an accident {{on the last day of}} her six-week training phase, in which she hit a wall while running at full speed, but was not seriously injured. Other stars who dyed their hair for the movie include Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. Lionsgate hired Olympic bronze medal-winning archer Khatuna Lorig to teach Lawrence <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cody, {{together}} with his wife, toured England with a shooting act. Maud used the stage name Lillian Cody, which she kept {{for the rest of}} her performing career. In London, they met Mrs Elizabeth Mary King (née Davis), wife of Edward John 'Ted' King, a licensed victualler, and mother of four children, Edward, Leon, Vivian and Liese. Mrs King had stage ambitions for her sons. In 1891, Maud taught the boys <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot,</b> but then later returned to the USA alone. Evidence suggests that by the autumn of 1891, Maud was unable to perform with her husband because of injury, morphine addiction, the onset of schizophrenia, or a combination of these ills.|$|E
25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, {{it was usually}} post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

50|$|Herzog tours a {{substantially}} renovated apartment {{that he and}} his family shared with Kinski and other boarders, looks at the first film clip he ever saw of Kinski, and presents footage from the sets of their various movies. He recounts the heated and sometimes violent altercations between them, including the oft-repeated story of <b>how</b> he threatened <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> Kinski should he leave the production of Aguirre. He also draws on footage from Burden of Dreams (1982), a documentary about the making of Fitzcarraldo, which was a particularly difficult film for their relationship.|$|R
25|$|Notes {{from his}} lectures {{indicate}} that, {{at the start}} of his time in the Mediterranean, useful working ranges for heavy guns without telescopic sights were considered to be only 2000 yards, or 3000–4000 yards with such sights, whereas {{by the end of his}} time discussion centred on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> effectively at 5000 yards. This was driven by the increasing range of the torpedo, which had now risen to 3000–4000 yards, necessitating ships fighting effectively at greater ranges. At this time he advocated relatively small main armaments on capital ships (some had 15inch or greater), because the improved technical design of the relatively small (10inch) modern guns allowed a much greater firing rate and greater overall weight of broadside. The potentially much greater ranges of large guns was not an issue, because no one knew how to aim them effectively at such ranges. He argued that 'the design of fighting ships must follow the mode of fighting instead of fighting being subsidiary to and dependent on the design of ships.'. As regards how officers needed to behave, he commented, 'Think and act for yourself' is the motto for the future, not 'Let us wait for orders'.|$|E
25|$|In 1882, in {{the town}} of Old Stump, Arizona, a cowardly sheep farmer named Albert Stark (Seth MacFarlane) is dumped by his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) {{as a result of his}} {{withdrawal}} from a gunfight. He prepares to leave for San Francisco, believing that the frontier offers nothing for him. Meanwhile, infamous outlaw Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson) robs and kills an old prospector (Matt Clark) for a gold nugget. He orders his right-hand man Lewis (Evan Jones) to escort his wife Anna (Charlize Theron) to Old Stump to lie low while he continues his banditry. Lewis and Anna arrive in Old Stump under the guise of two siblings intending to build a farm, but Lewis is arrested after shooting the Pastor's (John Aylward) son (Dylan Kenin) in a saloon. During the ensuing fight, Albert saves Anna from being crushed to death by two of the brawlers, and the two become close friends. They attend a county fair where Louise's new boyfriend, the haughty Foy (Neil Patrick Harris), challenges Albert to a shooting contest. Albert is defeated, but Anna steps in and defeats Foy. Foy mocks Albert, who angrily challenges Foy to a duel in a week's time. Anna then spends the week teaching Albert <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot.</b>|$|E

They are caught between the legal world and the illegal underworld, belonging to neither and able to trust only one another. Though initially startled by Raynor's intensity, Cates insists she is capable of doing {{whatever it takes to}} get the job done. Later at Raynor's apartment, he teaches Cates <b>how</b> <b>to</b> properly <b>shoot</b> up heroin. Cates informs Raynor that she was instructed <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fake drug use at the police academy, which prompts a strong rebuke from Raynor. He informs her in no uncertain terms that she will be put in situations where she will have to take the drugs they will be buying. The drug dealers they will be doing business with are not stupid, and if she tries to fake drug use in front of them, she will get both of them killed.|$|R

Some media have treated this as a horror perpetrated by a single airline that bullies passengers, or by a business model that forces overbooking. It {{is a mistake to}} look so narrowly at the sources of harm. A few reports, and many Asian American social media users, have mentioned the possibility of racism. As I write, no mainstream news source or commentary has mentioned ageism.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of guns on people’s aggressive attitudes and behaviors. We used 46 students from a small liberal arts college in Durango, Colorado. They were broken into a control and an experimental group. The experimental group was shown a video of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> safely <b>shoot</b> a gun, and the control group was shown a video of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> make strawberry shortcake. The dependent variable was their aggressive attitudes and behaviors resulting from the video they were shown. We found that the control group said they would act more aggressively, but they showed less aggressive behavior because they gave strangers less vile hot sauce to drink in a follow-up measure. These findings did not support our hypothesis that the participants showed the gun video would have more aggressive attitudes and behaviors. This research illustrates the importance of further research on this subject, because many people assume that guns inspire violence, but this assumption cannot be made without further evidence...|$|R
5000|$|Tracer: These have {{a hollow}} back, {{filled with a}} flare material. Usually this {{is a mixture of}} {{magnesium}} metal, a perchlorate, and strontium salts to yield a bright red color, although other materials providing other colors have also sometimes been used. Tracer material burns out after a certain amount of time. Such ammunition is useful to the shooter as a means of learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> point <b>shoot</b> moving targets with rifles. This type of round is also used by all branches of the United States military in combat environments as a signaling device to friendly forces. Normally it is loaded at a four to one ratio with ball ammunition and is intended to show where you are firing so friendly forces can engage the target as well. The flight characteristics of tracer rounds differ from normal bullets due to their lighter weight.|$|R

500|$|The {{character}} of Meacham also presents an unconventional take on Christian principles {{to support the}} film's main theme of redemption. According to Favreau, Meacham's teaching Doc <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> not only references similar scenes in other Westerns but also [...] "teach him {{how to be a}} person". Meacham's dying words to Jake, [...] "God don't care who you were, Son, only who you are", speaks of the central theme of redemption. The hummingbird that Jake sees at various points in the film is a [...] "good spirit" [...] that could represent either Alice or Ella; an alternate theory is that Ella was an angel that helped Jake [...] "get over" [...] Alice. Favreau also suggested a back-story to Cowboys & Aliens: the über-alien is the mastermind of the invasion; all other aliens are [...] "worker bees", possibly genetically engineered by another species of aliens that remained on their home planet and sent the worker bees as conquistadors.|$|E

Gas lines were also buried in the sand to supply {{a steady stream of}} flames. Many of the scenes and lines of dialogue were improvised, such as Andy throwing a rock at a duck and Jim guiding an unsuspecting Karen into the water. For Pam's speech, Daniels and Celotta knew it was important, and discussed with Ramis for about 45 minutes about <b>how</b> best <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> it. Many different takes were shot, and Celotta thought Fischer [...] "was so amazing, take after take after take." [...] Ramis believed the past 28 episodes had contained a slow build-up to this scene.
