The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, Letizia Ramolino, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child. Napoleon's maternal <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> married into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal Joseph Fesch, would fulfill a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E
5|$|Gorman {{said that}} his Catholic <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> {{secretly}} married Albert Victor, and that his mother, as the legitimate daughter of Albert Victor, was the rightful heir to the throne. He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged {{as part of a}} conspiracy to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth. In the original television series, the story is depicted as the belief of Gorman but not of the detectives. Captivated by Gorman's story, journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further, and eventually published his research as the book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution in 1976.|$|E

For National Museums Liverpool's Eight Hundred Lives project, Morrissey wrote that the house had been in his family since {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. His <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> been married there and his mother was born there. In 1971, the family moved to a larger, modern house on the new estates at Knotty Ash, and Seldon Street was later demolished.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, {{analysis}} of historical data {{found that the}} length of a female's post-reproductive lifespan was reflected in the reproductive success of her offspring and the survival of her grandchildren. Interestingly, another study found comparative effects but only in the maternal grandmother—paternal <b>grandmothers</b> <b>had</b> a detrimental effect on infant mortality (probably due to paternity uncertainty). Differing assistance strategies for maternal and paternal <b>grandmothers</b> <b>have</b> also been demonstrated. Maternal grandmothers concentrate on offspring survival, whereas paternal grandmothers increase birth rates.|$|R

5|$|Fuchs {{entered the}} University of Leipzig in 1930, {{where his father}} was a {{professor}} of theology.

Fuchs continued his studies in mathematics and physics at the university. In October 1931, his mother committed suicide by drinking hydrochloric acid. The family later discovered that his maternal <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> also taken her own life.|$|E

But, the basis for the parole was proved unfounded as Sharma's <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> already died in 2008. During the second extension of the parole for another 30 days, Sharma was seen partying in a discothèque in Delhi. His mother, whose illness was also the basis for the parole, was seen at a media briefing promoting a ladies cricket tournament at his family-run hotel in Chandigarh.

25|$|Bamber {{launched}} two unsuccessful lawsuits {{while in}} prison to recover {{a share of}} his family's estate. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing {{that he should have}} inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, and that he was owed 17 years' back rent from his cousins who were living there. The <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested, and most of the inheritance went to June Bamber's sister. In 2004 Bamber went to the High Court again to claim a share of the profits from the Bambers' caravan site in Maldon. He had retained his shares after his conviction, but had sold them to pay the legal costs arising from his claim on his grandmother's estate. The court ruled that he was not entitled to any profit from the site because of his conviction.|$|E
25|$|If {{the law is}} made as it {{now stands}} respectable {{families}} in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be {{denied the right to}} intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of… colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.|$|E
