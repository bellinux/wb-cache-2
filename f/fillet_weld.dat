500|$|The basic {{technique}} for GMAW is quite simple, since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch (head of tip). By contrast, in gas tungsten arc welding, the welder must handle a welding torch {{in one hand}} and a separate filler wire in the other, and in shielded metal arc welding, the operator must frequently chip off slag and change welding electrodes. GMAW requires only that the operator guide the welding gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded. [...] Keeping a consistent contact tip-to-work distance (the stick out distance) is important, because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas. Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications. The orientation of the gun is also importantit should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces; that is, at 45 degrees for a <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface. The travel angle, or lead angle, is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel, and it should generally remain approximately vertical. However, the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas usedwith pure inert gases, the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section, while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide.|$|E

Thus, understanding the behavior of <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> under various types of loading is important, and numerical simulations can provide increased insight into this topic. This paper concerns finite element simulations of previous quasi-static and dynamic (impact) tests on <b>fillet</b> <b>welds.</b> The test specimens employed were structural steel components joined by either longitudinally or transversely oriented <b>fillet</b> <b>welds.</b> In the simulations, the material of the <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> was modeled using a shear-modified Gurson model, which accounts for material softening in both low and high stress triaxiality regimes. Additionally, strain rate and temperature dependencies were incorporated in the material model with a modified Johnson–Cook constitutive relation for the matrix material. Several types of material tests were conducted to identify the parameters entering the material model. For the quasi-static component tests and simulations, a good agreement was observed {{in terms of both}} force–deformation curves and failure mechanisms. The simulations of the dynamic tests predicted appreciably higher force levels and weld deformations at failure than those obtained in the corresponding experiments. A parameter study showed that these discrepancies may partly be due to inaccurate values used for the material parameters related to strain-rate hardening and thermal softening. Finally, a comparison was made between simulations with the shear-modified Gurson model and a simpler material model that does not account for void-induced softening. The simpler model employed the Cockcroft–Latham failure criterion, uncoupled from the constitutive relations. This model was unable to capture the response of the <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> to the same extent as the shear-modified Gurson model...|$|R

50|$|A {{year later}} in March 1981, the investigative report {{concluded}} that the rig collapsed owing to a fatigue crack {{in one of its}} six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg {{to the rest of the}} rig. This was traced to a small 6 mm <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of lamellar tearing in the flange plate and cold cracks in the butt weld. Cold cracks in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened flange plate, the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in the North Sea), seemed to collectively play a role in the rig's collapse.|$|E

50|$|An {{intermittent}} <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> is {{one that}} is not continuous across a joint. These welds are portrayed as a set of two numbers {{to the right of the}} triangle instead of just one. The first number as mentioned earlier refers to the length of the weld. The second number, separated from the first by a “-”, refers to the pitch. The pitch is a measurement from midpoint to midpoint of the intermittent welds. Intermittent welding is used when either a continuous weld is not necessary, or when a continuous weld threatens the joint by warping. In some cases intermittent welds are staggered on both sides of the joint. In this case, the notation of the two triangles aren't directly on top of each other. Instead, the side of the joint to receive the first weld will have a triangle further to the left than the following side’s triangle notation. As an end result of alternating intermittent fillet welds at each side, the space between welds on one side of the joint will be the midpoint of the opposite side’s weld.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{technique}} for GMAW is quite simple, since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch (head of tip). By contrast, in gas tungsten arc welding, the welder must handle a welding torch {{in one hand}} and a separate filler wire in the other, and in shielded metal arc welding, the operator must frequently chip off slag and change welding electrodes. GMAW requires only that the operator guide the welding gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded. Keeping a consistent contact tip-to-work distance (the stick out distance) is important, because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas. Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications. The orientation of the gun is also important - it should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces; that is, at 45 degrees for a <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface. The travel angle, or lead angle, is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel, and it should generally remain approximately vertical. However, the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas used - with pure inert gases, the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section, while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide.|$|E

5000|$|Fillet welding {{notation}} {{is important}} to recognize when reading blueprints. The use of this notation tells the welder exactly what is expected from the manufacturer. The symbol for a <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> is {{in the shape of a}} triangle. This triangle will lay either below a flat line or above it with an arrow coming off of the flat line pointing to a joint. The flat line is called [...] "reference line". The side on which the triangle symbol is placed is important because it gives an indication on which side of the joint is to be intersected by the weld. It is recognized that there are two different approaches in the global market to designate the arrow side and other side on drawings; a description of the two approaches is contained in International Standard ISO 2553, they are called [...] "A-System" [...] (which is more commonly used in Europe) and [...] "B-System" [...] (which is basically the ANSI/AWS system used in the US). In [...] "A-System" [...] two parallel lines are used as reference line: one is a continuous line, the other is a dashed line. In the [...] "B-System", there is only one reference line, which is a continuous line. If there is a single reference line (B-System) and the triangle is positioned below the line, then the weld is going to be on the arrow side. If there is a single reference line ("B-System") and the triangle is positioned above the line, then the weld is going to be on the opposite side of the arrow.When you find an arrow pointing to a joint with two triangles, one sitting below and one sitting above the line even with each other, then there is intended to be a <b>fillet</b> <b>weld</b> on the arrow side of the joint as well as the opposite side of the joint. If the weld is to be continuous around a piece of metal such as a pipe or square, then a small circle will be around the point where the flat line and arrow pointing to the joint are connected. Manufacturers also include the strength that the weld must be. This is indicated by a letter and number combination just before the flat line. Examples of this are [...] "E70" [...] meaning the arc electrode must have a tensile strength of [...] There are also symbols that describe the aesthetics of the weld. A gentle curve pointing away from the hypotenuse means a concave weld is required, a straight line parallel with the hypotenuse calls for a flat faced weld, and a gentle curve towards the hypotenuse calls for a convex weld. The surface of the weld can be manipulated either by welding technique or by use of machining or grinding tools after the weld is completed. When reading a manufacturers blueprints, you might also come across weld dimensions. The weld can be sized in many different ways such as the length of the weld, the measurements of the legs of the weld, and the spaces between welds. Along with a triangle, there will usually be a size for the weld for example (”x”) to the left of the triangle. This means that the vertical leg of the weld is to be ” whereas the horizontal leg is to ”. To the right of the triangle, there will be a measurement of exactly how long the weld is supposed to be.If the measurements of the drawing are in mm the welds are likewise measured in mm. For example, the weld would be 3 x 10, the mm being understood automatically.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Fillet</b> <b>welds</b> {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} arc welding joint type in the fabrication industry with about 80 % of all arc welded joints worldwide. Alt-hough the joint is well established, there are many aspects to consider when pro-ducing an ideal weld. This paper reveals and connects several problematic issues related to the joint type and the difficulties to fabricate a weld with correct strength, cost, and quality. Excessive <b>welding</b> of <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> is common, resulting in increased fabrication cost. There could be several causes for this; the designers do not customize the weld demand for the different stress levels and the production adds even more to handle the variation in the process. Previous studies shows that the combination of these factors can result in 100 % extra weld metal, compared to what should be needed to fulfil the strength demands. Inspections are another contributor to excess welding. The capability of the weld size measurement method used by welders and inspectors is unsatisfactory. Measurement system analyses show that the scatter from the measurement system itself is in the same range as the scatter from the process. A critical summary of the current state-of-the-art is that <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> are hard to specify and fabricate with the right size, that the measuring method is incapable and the connection between size and strength is weak. ...|$|R
