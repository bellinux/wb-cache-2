5000|$|A {{potential}} problem involving alkahest is that, if it dissolves everything, then it cannot be placed into a container {{because it would}} dissolve the container. However, the alchemist Philalethes specifies that alkahest <b>dissolves</b> only composed <b>material</b> into their constituent, elemental parts; hence, a hypothetical container made of a pure element (say, soil) would not be dissolved by alkahest. The old remark [...] "spit is the universal solvent" [...] satirizes the idea, suggesting that instead of a solvent that would <b>easily</b> <b>dissolve</b> anything, the only [...] "real" [...] solvent to anything {{is a great deal}} of hard work. In modern times, water is sometimes called the universal solvent as well, because it can dissolve a large variety of substances, due to its chemical polarity and amphoterism.|$|R

50|$|Lye in {{the form}} of both sodium {{hydroxide}} and potassium hydroxide is used in making soap. Potassium hydroxide soaps are softer and more <b>easily</b> <b>dissolved</b> in water than sodium hydroxide soaps. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are not interchangeable in either the proportions required or the properties produced in making soaps.|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} is nowhere exposed in outcrop because its minerals are <b>easily</b> <b>dissolved</b> by water. Intact sequences are usually found at depths {{of more than}} 500 m below ground surface, where they are protected by overlying aquitards. The potash deposits of Saskatchewan and North Dakota lie at depths exceeding 950 m.|$|R
50|$|Trinitromethane as {{a neutral}} {{molecule}} is colorless. It is highly acidic, easily forming in intensely yellow anion, (NO2)3C−. The pKa of trinitromethane has been measured at 0.17 ± 0.02 at 20 °C, which is remarkably acidic for a methane derivative. Trinitromethane <b>easily</b> <b>dissolves</b> in water {{to form an}} acidic yellow solution.|$|R
5000|$|Impede Technology {{is used in}} <b>easily</b> <b>dissolved</b> tablets and {{involves}} the addition of an inactive ingredient polymer matrix, which {{has been shown to}} form a thick gel and start a conversion process of crushed pseudoephedrine (PSE).

2500|$|Polystyrene is {{chemically}} very inert, being {{resistant to}} acids and bases but is <b>easily</b> <b>dissolved</b> by many chlorinated solvents, and many aromatic hydrocarbon solvents.

[...] Foamed polystyrene is used for packaging chemicals.|$|R
50|$|DBB- This {{grade is}} pebble sized and whitish yellow in color with about 90-95% purity. This is an economy grade, ideal for {{production}} of low-end varnishes. Its solubility is good. It can contain some black copal {{but it is}} still <b>easily</b> <b>dissolved</b> in alcohol solvent mixtures. It is also the most common grade for use in incense.|$|R
50|$|Oak Island lies on a glacial tumulus {{system and}} is {{underlain}} {{by a series}} of water-filled anhydrite cavities, which may be responsible for the repeated flooding of the pit.

50|$|Uranium is {{a highly}} soluble, {{as well as a}} radioactive, heavy metal. It can be <b>easily</b> <b>dissolved,</b> transported and precipitated within ground waters by subtle changes in {{oxidation}} conditions. Uranium also does not usually form very insoluble mineral species, which is a further factor in the wide variety of geological conditions and places in which uranium mineralization may accumulate.|$|R

25|$|In the nitro{{phosphate}} {{process or}} Odda process (invented in 1927), phosphate rock {{with up to}} a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with nitric acid (HNO3) to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2).

50|$|In pre-modern Europe, these {{interests}} were {{reflected in the}} character of marriages. They were private, arranged contracts that could be <b>easily</b> <b>dissolved</b> in the event of child production being compromised by the woman's infertility or infidelity. With the entry of the Church into marriage arrangements, different definitions of marriage emerged. Lifelong marriages were demanded,but with a concern to regulate sexuality, particularly the sexuality of women.|$|R
