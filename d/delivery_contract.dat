2500|$|Pan American Airways, Incorporated (PAA) {{was founded}} as a shell company on March 14, 1927 by Air Corps Majors Henry H. [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold, Carl A. Spaatz, and John H. Jouett as a {{counterbalance}} to the German-owned Colombian carrier SCADTA, operating in Colombia since 1920. SCADTA lobbied hard for landing {{rights in the}} Panama Canal Zone, ostensibly to survey air routes for {{a connection to the}} United States, which the Air Corps viewed as a precursor to a possible German aerial threat to the canal. Arnold and Spaatz drew up the prospectus for Pan American when SCADTA hired a company in Delaware to obtain air mail contracts from the U.S. government. Pan American was able to obtain the U.S. mail <b>delivery</b> <b>contract</b> to Cuba, but lacked any aircraft to perform the job and did not have landing rights in Cuba.|$|E

The reasons given were the perverse incentives, the lack of additionality, the lack of environmental integrity,the under-mining of the Montreal Protocol, costs and ineffectiveness and the distorting effect of a few projects in advanced developing countries getting too many CERs. From 23 December 2011, CERs from HFC-23 and N2O destruction projects were banned from use in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, unless they had been purchased under future <b>delivery</b> <b>contracts</b> entered into prior to 23 December 2011.

He continued with the postal <b>delivery</b> <b>contract</b> established by his predecessor, and came to an arrangement with the proprietor of the Marine Baths on Wakefield Quay whereby he could sell concession tickets covering a return fare and use of the baths.|$|E
