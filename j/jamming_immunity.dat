50|$|The Vikhr missile {{laser beam}} control system {{provides}} for its precise guidance owing to data transmission to the missile {{in the course}} of its launch, which is excluded in homing systems. The Vikhr missile control system has high <b>jamming</b> <b>immunity</b> because its receiver faces the carrier, thereby protecting it from jamming signals.|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} {{weapon system}} is called A-213-Vympel-A, which comprises the AK-630M Gun Mount, MR-123-02 Fire Control Radar System, and SP-521 Electrical-Optical Tracker. A single MR-123 radar system can simultaneously control two guns, either two 30 mm gun mounts, or two 57 mm gun mounts, or one 30 mm gun and one 57 mm gun. The radar system can engage aerial and surface targets at 4 km and 5 km respectively. The electro-optical system can detect a MiG-21-sized aerial target 7 km away, while torpedo boat-sized surface targets {{can be detected}} at a range of up to 70 km. Features include surveillance and tracking modes, high <b>jamming</b> <b>immunity,</b> laser range finder and TV optical sight. It is in operation on almost all Russian Navy ships from fast attack boats to the Kirov battlecruiser.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA {{way to increase}} <b>jamming</b> <b>immunity</b> and to decrease the intercept probability of a communication system is to use spread spectrum (SS) techniques. In this report a frequency hopping SS system (transmitter and receiver) is presented. This system is designed, built, and tested to send and receive digitized voice by utilizing a single chip delta modulator/demodulator. The report describes the circuitry employed, lists the important parameters {{of the system and}} includes photographs of various waveforms. The recovered audio is of good quality using digital data rates as low as 25 kilobits per second. A hopping rate of 100 hops per second is used in the design. [URL] Turkish Nav...|$|E
40|$|Any {{frequency}} selective {{device with}} an ongoing drift will cause observed spectra to be variously and simultaneously scaled {{in proportion to}} their source distances. The reason is that detectors after the drifting selection will integrate instantaneous electric or magnetic field values from successive sinusoids, and these sinusoids would differ in both frequency and phase. Phase differences between frequencies are ordinarily irrelevant, and recalibration procedures at most correct for frequency differences. With drifting selection, however, each integrated field value comes from *the sinusoid of the instantaneously selected frequency at its instantaneous received phase*, hence the waveform constructed by the integration will follow the drifting selection with a phase acceleration given by the drift rate times {{the slope of the}} received phase spectrum. A phase acceleration is literally a frequency shift, and the phase spectrum slope of a received waveform is an asymptotic measure of the source distance, as the path delay presents phase offsets proportional to frequency times the distance, and eventually exceeding all initial phase differences. Tunable optics may soon be fast enough for realizing such shifts by Fourier switching, and could lead to pocket X-ray devices; sources continuously variable from RF to gamma rays; capacity multiplication with <b>jamming</b> and noise <b>immunity</b> in both fibre and radio channels, passive ranging from ground to deep space; etc. Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures.

40|$|Considered {{possibility}} {{of creating a}} multisensory information converter (MSPI) based on new fiber-optic functional element-digital-to-analog (DAC) fiber optic converter. The use of DAC fiber-optic provides <b>jamming</b> <b>immunity</b> combined with low weight and cost of indicators. Because of that MSPI scheme was developed based on parallel DAC fiber-optic (Russian Federation Patent 157416). We {{came up with an}} equation for parallel DAC fiber-optic. An eleborate general mathematical model of the proposed converter. Developed a method for reducing conversion errors by placing the DAC transfer function between i and i + 1 ADC quantization levels. By using this model it allows you to obtain reliable information about the technical capabilities of a converter without the need for costly experiments...|$|E
40|$|The major {{advantages}} of pulse compression are low pulse-power {{which makes it}} suitable for solid-state devices, higher maximum range, good range resolution and better <b>jamming</b> <b>immunity.</b> The matched filter is the optimal linear filter for maximizing the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) in the presence of additive stochastic noise. Pulse compression is an example of matched filtering. But this matched filter output consists of unwanted but unavoidable side lobes. For multiple-target radar, the side lobes of the compressed pulse must be considered in the system design because of the likelihood of false alarms. At the receiver the signal processor uses weighting filters which are not matched to the transmitted waveform. When this filter is not matched to the transmitted waveform then filter output consists of unwanted but unavoidable side lobes. In this paper a new technique is proposed to suppress the side lobes of radar signals that result from standard matched filtering. This technique produces better peak side lobe ratio than all other conventional side lobe reduction techniques. In simulation the results of this filter technique for compound Barker codes is compared with the other side lobe reduction techniques...|$|E
