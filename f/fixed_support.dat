40|$|The {{target of}} this {{research}} is to study the property of the assumptions in the yield line theory and to give practical design method to be used in design. This work is meant to cover an investigation of six slabs. The support condition of these slabs were simply <b>supported,</b> simply and <b>fixed</b> <b>supported,</b> and <b>fixed.</b> The reinforcement arrangement used is isotropic reinforcement. The yield line theory was used as the method of solution to obtain the ultimate load. To verify the analytical results, experimentally the six rectangular two- way slabs subjected to uniformly distributed load are simulated by 16 point loads with various combinations of the possible boundary conditions (simply supported at all edges, <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at one short edge and simply supported at the remaining edges, <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at one long edge and simply supported at the remaining edges, <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at two short edges and simply supported at the other edges, <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at two long edges and simply supported at the two short edges, and the last slab was <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at all edges. Data of the experimental work including deflection readings, and yield line patterns are presented.) Experimental results are discussed and comparisons are made between the theoretical and experimental result. Finally conclusions are drawn and recommendations are presented. It can be concluded that the difference between the experimental and theoretical failure loads were small and mainly on the conservative side. Significant increase in load carrying capacity of isotropically reinforced <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> slabs is due to compressive membrane action imposed by horizontal restraints. Also similar yield line patterns for theoretical and experimental cases were observed...|$|R

2500|$|Numbers in grey are {{balanced}} moments; arrows (→/←) {{represent the}} carry-over of moment {{from one end}} to the other end of a member.* Step 1: As joint A is released, balancing moment of magnitude equal to the fixed end moment [...] develops and is carried-over from joint A to joint B.* Step 2: The unbalanced moment at joint B now is the summation of the fixed end moments , [...] and the carry-over moment from joint A. This unbalanced moment is distributed to members BA and BC in accordance with the distribution factors [...] and [...] Step 2 ends with carry-over of balanced moment [...] to joint C. Joint A is a roller support which has no rotational restraint, so moment carryover from joint B to joint A is zero.* Step 3: The unbalanced moment at joint C now is the summation of the fixed end moments , [...] and the carryover moment from joint B. As in the previous step, this unbalanced moment is distributed to each member and then carried over to joint D and back to joint B. Joint D is a <b>fixed</b> <b>support</b> and carried-over moments to this joint will not be distributed nor be carried over to joint C.* Step 4: Joint B still has balanced moment which was carried over from joint C in step 3. Joint B is released once again to induce moment distribution and to achieve equilibrium.* Steps 5 - 10: Joints are released and fixed again until every joint has unbalanced moments of size zero or neglectably small in required precision. Arithmetically summing all moments in each respective columns gives the final moment values.|$|E

5000|$|In the Riefler escapement, {{the energy}} {{required}} to keep the pendulum swinging is instead supplied by bending the short straight spring strip which suspends the pendulum. [...] The {{upper end of the}} suspension spring is not attached to a <b>fixed</b> <b>support</b> as in most clocks, but instead is attached to a heavy metal bearer, which pivots on two aligned knife-edges on its underside which rest on flat agate plates. The bending point of the suspension spring is in alignment with the line of contact of the knife-edges. When the pendulum passes its bottom point, the escape wheel is unlocked and pushes the bearer, and the bearer pivots suddenly on its knife edges by a small angle, flexing the spring. The spring is bent by a small amount in addition to that caused by the swing of the pendulum, and thus provides the impulse for the next swing. So the suspension spring is used for two functions: suspending the pendulum and giving it impulse.|$|E

5000|$|A {{close look}} at the fixed duct support photo shows several {{properties}} or round ring supports. 1) there are stiffeners at roughly 60 degrees on center. This duct ring is fabricated from 2 rolled WT's, welded at the center. This is a smaller duct, with light loads, so that the bottom flange was slightly modified by support clearance requirements. A small gap is shown for placing the duct PTFE slide bearing, although a <b>fixed</b> <b>support</b> could also be inserted in this gap. In the background of this photo is a duct flange. The duct flange normally has 3/4" [...] bolts at 6" [...] nominal; spacing. Duct flange angle thickness needs to be designed for duct plate tensile stresses, as flanges will bend. 5/16" [...] or 3/8" [...] angle thicknesses are common. [...] See above photo of round duct elbows, transitions, and stiffeners. The duct elbow radius, are from 1 1/2 to 2 times the duct diameter. The round duct has ovaling, and shipping rings at 20 foot nominal spacing, and larger support rings at supports. The Y split has suction stiffeners at the duct intersection.

5000|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} by the Canadian Pacific Railway between 1898 and 1900. Four barges were built to move steel beams into position. During the winter (1899-1900) workmen toiled day and night chopping channels to keep the ice clear for the barges to pass so that work could continue on the superstructure. Considerable construction delays were caused by the severe winter conditions. By September 1900 the four <b>fixed</b> <b>support</b> spans were complete. The Canadian Society of Civil Engineers held its annual meeting in Ottawa in order that its members might tour the bridge works and see the preparations being made for placing the centre span. The bridge's main cantilever centre span was, {{at the time of}} construction, the longest in Canada and the fourth longest in the world. Both records are now held by the Quebec Bridge. The centre span was successfully put in place on October 7, and a locomotive made a trial run on December 12, 1900. On February 18, 1901 the bridge was officially inaugurated as the Interprovincial Bridge as it had been built by the Ottawa Interprovincial Bridge Company. The name was changed in September 1901 to the [...] "Royal Alexandra Bridge" [...] in honour of the new Queen during the visit of her son, the Duke of Cornwall and York, later George V.|$|E
