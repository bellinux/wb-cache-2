He has said, [...] "If somebody's <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> entertainment purposes, that's one thing. But if they claim to be communicating with the dead, I don't care if they're from my hometown, I don't care if they're my family members: I'll expose them and tell them what they really are." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Quietus in March 2017, Leary talked about the group possibly making a new album, their first in 16 years: [...] "We've all been busy with our own separate things, and I've {{done a lot of}} producing in the past few years, and I've got to the point now where I feel like I've done <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a while, so it's time to make a new Butthole Surfers album. Especially now that Trump is president, jeez! If there was ever a time for a Butthole Surfers album it's fucking now. It just doesn't get any weirder than that." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Pearl Jam {{went for}} a two-week session at Henson. It {{was the first time}} the band spent a {{considerable}} amount of time recording outside of Seattle since 1996's No Code. McCready said, [...] " [...] we got together with Ed and it really started getting more cohesive, we took that momentum down to Los Angeles with Brendan... It was a great idea to get us out of Seattle. You've gotta get out [...] your comfort zone, and we've talked about <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the past ten years and kind of haven't, so we trusted Brendan's judgment." [...] In April 2009, the band {{went for a}} two-week session to finish the album with O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album took a total of thirty days in the studio to get finished, and O'Brien stated [...] "we had 90% of the record cut in the first nine days".|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} a five song-medley, which {{in an interview}} with Billboard magazine, McCartney said that it was previously [...] "something I wanted to revisit" [...] as [...] "nobody had been <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a while." [...] The medley was a set of intentionally written material, whereas the medley that McCartney had worked on on the Beatles' Abbey Road was actually made up of [...] "bits we had knocking around." [...] The medley starts off with [...] "Vintage Clothes", which McCartney [...] "sat down one day" [...] to write, that was [...] "looking back, [...] looking back.", about life. It was followed by the bass-led [...] "That Was Me", which is about his [...] "school days and teachers", the medley, as McCartney stated, then [...] "progressed from there." [...] The next songs are [...] "Feet in the Clouds", about the inactivity while one is growing up, and [...] "House of Wax", about the life of being a celebrity. The final song in medley, [...] "The End of the End", was written at McCartney's Cavendish Avenue home while playing on his father, Jim's, piano.|$|E
500|$|On May 2, 2013, Jeff Hanneman died {{of liver}} failure in a Los Angeles hospital. A week later, the {{official}} {{cause of death}} was announced as alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of condition until shortly before his death. King has announced his desire for the band to continue, but Araya was more uncertain, stating, [...] "After 30 years, it would literally be like starting over," [...] and expressing doubts that Slayer's fanbase would approve of such a change. In March 2015, Araya revealed that the band had recorded one song prior to Hanneman's passing, and that the song would appear on the album. The result was the song [...] "Piano Wire". Araya explained that Hanneman would be a part on the album when King later dismissed the claim saying, [...] "Jeff Hanneman isn't physically playing on this record. Somebody reported some bullshit. People say shit when they don't know what's actually going on. Even though Jeff's song, [...] "Piano Wire", was recorded during the last album cycle, I played all the guitar. I've been <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> years. Since he has no lead on that song, he's not on it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ron and Tammy" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Troy Miller. The episode featured comedian and actress Megan Mullally in a guest appearance as Ron's ex-wife, Tammy. Mullally is the real-life wife of Nick Offerman, who plays Ron. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur conceived {{the idea for the}} story, and asked Offerman whether he and Mullally would be opposed to her playing such a terrible character. Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea. Mullally said she enjoyed the script, particularly the dialogue of Ron describing Tammy, more than Tammy's part herself. Offerman and Mullally improvised many of their on-screen fights, as well as the varied methods of unusual kissing between the two characters. During the diner scene, in which Ron and Tammy switch between violent fighting and passionate kissing, Offerman accidentally pulled a diner table out of the wall after placing Mullally on top of it and kissing her. The scene was used in the final episode. Offerman said of filming the diner scenes, [...] "At the end of <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a few hours, we said, you know that feels like it was five weeks worth of really good therapy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Los Angeles was {{incorporated}} as an American city on April 4, 1850. Five months later, California was admitted into the Union. Although the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo required the U.S. to grant citizenship to the Indians of former Mexican territories, the U.S. {{did not get}} around to <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> another 80 years. The Constitution of California deprived Indians of any protection under the law, considering them as non-persons. As a result, {{it was impossible to}} bring an Anglo to trial for killing an Indian or forcing them off their property. Anglos concluded that the [...] "quickest and best {{way to get rid of}} (their) troublesome presence was to kill them off, (and) this procedure was adopted as a standard for many years." ...|$|E
