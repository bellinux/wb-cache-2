Horsetails have retained several ancient features and are also characterized by a particularly high chromosome count (n = 108). Whole-genome duplications (WGDs) have been uncovered in many angiosperm clades and have been associated with the success of angiosperms, both in terms of species richness and biomass dominance, but remain understudied in nonangiosperm clades. Here, we report unambiguous evidence of an ancient WGD in the fern linage, based on sequencing and de novo assembly of an expressed gene catalog (transcriptome) from the giant horsetail (Equisetum giganteum). We demonstrate that horsetails underwent an independent paleopolyploidy during the Late Cretaceous prior to the diversification of the genus but did not experience any recent polyploidizations that could account for their high chromosome number. We also discuss the specific retention of genes following the WGD and how this may be linked to their long-term survival.

It serves as a good system for investigating the genetic regulation of secondary cell wall biosynthesis and wood formation. The reference genome sequence for Eucalyptus grandis allows investigation of the global transcriptional reprogramming that accompanies tension wood formation in this global wood fibre crop. We report the first comprehensive analysis of physicochemical wood property changes in tension wood of Eucalyptus measured in a hybrid (E. grandis 9 Eucalyptus urophylla) clone, as well as genome-wide gene expression changes in xylem tissues 3 wk post-induction using RNA sequencing. We found that Eucalyptus tension wood in field-grown trees is characterized {{by an increase in}} cellulose, a reduction in lignin, xylose and mannose, and a marked increase in galactose. Gene expression profiling in tension wood-forming tissue showed corresponding down-regulation of monolignol biosynthetic genes, and differential expression of several carbohydrate active enzymes. We conclude that alterations of cell wall traits induced by tension wood formation in Eucalyptus are a consequence of a combination of down-regulation of lignin biosynthesis and hemicellulose remodelling, rather than the often proposed up-regulation of the cellulose biosynthetic pathway.

40|$|Wood {{formation}} {{is a complex}} developmental process governed by genetic and environmental stimuli. Populus and Eucalyptus are fast-growing, high-yielding tree genera that represent ecologically and economically important species suitable for generating significant lignocellulosic biomass. Comparative analysis of the developing xylem and leaf transcriptomes of Populus trichocarpa and Eucalyptus grandis together with phylogenetic analyses identified clusters of homologous genes preferentially expressed during xylem formation in both species. A conserved set of 336 single gene pairs showed highly similar xylem preferential expression patterns, as well as evidence of high functional constraint. Individual members of multigene orthologous clusters known {{to be involved in}} secondary cell wall biosynthesis also showed conserved xylem expression profiles. However, species-specific expression as well as opposite (xylem versus leaf) expression patterns observed for a subset of genes suggest subtle differences in the transcriptional regulation important for xylem development in each species. Using sequence similarity and gene expression status, we identified functional homologs likely to be involved in xylem developmental and biosynthetic processes in Populus and Eucalyptus. Our study suggests that, while genes involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis show high levels of gene expression conservation, differential regulation of some xylem development genes may give rise to unique xylem properties.

The diversity and evolution of the transcriptional networks regulating this process have not been studied extensively. We investigated patterns of species-level nucleotide diversity in the promoters of cellulose synthase (CesA) genes from different Eucalyptus tree species and assessed the possible roles of DNA sequence polymorphism in the gain or loss of cis-elements harboured within the promoters. Promoter regions of three primary and three secondary cell wall-associated CesA genes were isolated from 13 Eucalyptus species and were analysed for nucleotide and cis-element diversity. Species-level nucleotide diversity (π) ranged from 0. 014 to 0. 068, and different CesA promoters exhibited distinct patterns of sequence conservation. A set of 22 putative cis-elements were mapped to the CesA promoters using in silico methods. Forty-two percent of the mapped cis-element occurrences contained singleton polymorphisms which resulted in either gain or loss of a ciselement in a particular Eucalyptus species. The promoters of Eucalyptus CesA genes contained regions that are highly conserved at the species (Eucalyptus) and genus (with Arabidopsis and Populus) level, suggesting the presence of regulatory modules imposing functional constraint on such regions. Nucleotide polymorphisms in the CesA promoters more frequently created new cis-element occurrences than disrupted existing cis-element occurrences, a process which may be important for the maintenance and evolution of cellulose gene regulation in plants.

DArT is an affordable, high-throughput marker technology {{for the construction of}} high-density genetic linkage maps. Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla are commonly used to produce fast-growing, disease tolerant hybrids for clonal eucalypt plantations in tropical and subtropical regions. We analysed 7, 680 DArT markers in an F 2 pseudo-backcross mapping pedigree based on an F 1 hybrid clone of E. grandis and E. urophylla. A total of 2, 440 markers (31. 7 %) were polymorphic and could be placed in linkage maps of the F 1 hybrid and two pure-species backcross parents. An integrated genetic linkage map was constructed for the pedigree resulting in 11 linkage groups (n= 11) with 2, 290 high-confidence (LOD≥ 3. 0) markers and a total map length of 1, 107. 6 cM. DNA sequence analysis of the mapped DArT marker fragments revealed that 43 % were located in protein coding regions and 90 % could be placed in the recently completed draft genome assembly of E. grandis.

Systemic induced defences in long-lived tree species, such as Eucalyptus grandis, could provide resistance against subsequent biotic challenges. Terpenoids are {{a class of}} plant-specialized metabolites implicated in defence against herbivores and pathogens. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the systemic induction of terpenoids in E. grandis clones challenged with the fungal pathogen Chrysoporthe austroafricana. Ramets of E. grandis clones previously classified as moderately resistant (TAG 5) and susceptible (ZG 14) were inoculated with C. austroafricana on the main stem, with mock-inoculated ramets to serve as controls. Leaf tissue was harvested 3 days post-inoculation and terpenoid levels were measured using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Foliar mRNA abundance profiles of four candidate terpenoid biosynthesis pathway genes were compared in inoculated and mock-inoculated ramets of each genotype. Monoterpene levels differed between clonal genotypes and p-cymene was induced systemically in TAG 5. Expression profiling of geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (EgrGPPS), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (EgrFPPS 2), myrcene synthase (EgrTPS 084) and b-caryophyllene synthase (EgrTPS 038) show induction of transcripts involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in leaves following pathogen challenge on the main stem. Together these results suggest that resistant and susceptible Eucalyptus genotypes may have different constitutive and induced terpenoid profiles. The significance of the systemic induction of terpenoid levels in TAG 5 and terpenoid biosynthesis transcripts in both genotypes in response to C. austroafricana challenge in the stem, and their role in defence against secondary biotic attack, remains to be determined.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} plantation forestry as a renewable source of cellulosic biomass has {{emphasized the need}} for tools to study the unique biology of woody genera such as Eucalyptus, Populus and Pinus. The domestication of these woody crops is hampered by long generation times, and breeders are now looking to molecular approaches such as marker-assisted breeding and genetic modification to accelerate tree improvement. Much {{of what is known}} about genes involved in the growth and development of plants has come from studies of herbaceous models such as Arabidopsis and rice. However, transferring this information to woody plants often proves difficult, especially for genes expressed in woody stems. Here we report the use of induced somatic sector analysis (ISSA) for characterization of promoter expression patterns directly in the stems of Populus and Eucalyptus trees. As a case study, we used previously characterized primary and secondary cell wall-related cellulose synthase (CesA) promoters cloned from Eucalyptus grandis. We show that ISSA can be used to elucidate the phloem and xylem expression patterns of the CesA genes in Eucalyptus and Populus stems and also show that the staining patterns differ in Eucalyptus and Populus stems. These findings show that ISSA is an efficient approach to investigate promoter function in the developmental context of woody plant tissues and raise questions about the suitability of heterologous promoters for genetic manipulation in plant species.

40|$|Deforestation and {{fragmentation}} of once large and continuous forests are {{probably one of}} the most important and widespread human-induced changes that have been made to forests worldwide. Small forest fragments will contain small tree populations, which are more prone to extinction and to losses of genetic variation through increased random genetic drift, selfing and mating among closely related individuals. A good understanding of the processes that shape genetic diversity across generations within tree populations is therefore indispensable for the evaluation and conservation of the evolutionary potential of trees in the long term and for increasing individual tree performance in the short term. Nevertheless, despite the field of <b>forest</b> landscape <b>genetics</b> has been an attractive science domain throughout the past decades, our knowledge of the genetic consequences of anthropogenic disturbances for tree populations remains relatively limited. Furthermore the effects of forest fragmentation and forest management practices on the genetic diversity of tree populations are highly debated in the scientific literature, resulting in what is known as the paradox of forest fragmentation genetics. This thesis aimed at gaining better insights into the effects of human land use and forest management activities on the genetic diversity, gene flow and inbreeding of small and fragmented pedunculate oak populations (Quercus robur L.). To do so, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted, in which we first conducted a meta-analysis of the available literature on <b>forest</b> landscape <b>genetics.</b> Subsequently we examined the maintenance of genetic diversity, contemporary gene flow and individual tree performance in small and fragmented pedunculate oak stands in Northern Belgium. Based on our meta-analysis, we could reject the traditional idea that woody plant species are relatively resistant to genetic losses following habitat fragmentation, as they were as prone to genetic erosion as herbaceous species studied in earlier meta-analyses. Although wind-pollinated species are presumed to have extensive pollen flow, we found evidence for pollen limitation and genetic losses, which were similar to those observed in insect-pollinated species. When we compared the results of this meta-analysis with what was found in our in-depth study on pedunculate oak, no clear losses of genetic diversity were observed across generations in the studied pedunculate oak stands. This suggest that the effective population sizes (Ne) were large enough to avoid the negative impacts of genetic drift and inbreeding. Since high out-of-plot pollen immigration rates were observed in all study plots, extensive pollen flow may have counteracted the negative genetic consequence associated with small tree populations. Nevertheless, even under high out-of-plot pollen immigration rates, we found that an important fraction of mating events occurred at short distances between neighbouring trees. Also in our study plots, less diverse local pollen pools were obtained insmall and low-density forest stands, which suggested that pollen limitation due to a restricted number of local mating partners was not totally compensated by the observed high out-of-plot pollen immigration rates. Ultimately, this may increase the likelihood of inbreeding in subsequent generations. The heterozygosity level of tree individuals should however be maximized in natural populations, as we detected a weak but significant relationship between heterozygosity and tree performance. Moreover our study was one of the first that showed an effect of high drought stress levels on the strength of the observed heterozygosity-fitness correlations. This suggests that in view of climate change the genetic consequences of forest fragmentation could be further exacerbated. To mitigate the potential negative genetic consequences through increased inbreeding and to maintain rare, potentially adaptive alleles in small pedunculate oak stands, Ne. should be maximized in the seedling cohort. In this respect conservation resources should be directed to establish genetic connectivity across fragmented oak populations. However this is not always realistic in the highly fragmented forest landscapes of Northern Belgium, through which more customized management practices are needed to maintain or increase Ne. Supplementation of natural regeneration by composite provenancing may be a good option to maintain and increase genetic diversity in small and fragmented oak stands and to enlarge the evolutionary potential to current and future environmental changes. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND : Eucalyptus {{species and}} {{interspecific}} hybrids exhibit valuable growth and wood properties {{that make them}} a highly desirable commodity. However, these trees are challenged by {{a wide array of}} biotic stresses during their lifetimes. The Eucalyptus grandis reference genome sequence provides a resource to study pest and pathogen defence mechanisms in long-lived woody plants. E. grandis trees are generally susceptible to Chrysoporthe austroafricana, a causal agent of stem cankers on eucalypts. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the defence response of E. grandis against C. austroafricana. RESULTS : Hormone profiling of susceptible and moderately resistant clonal E. grandis genotypes indicated a reduction in salicylic acid and gibberellic acid levels at 3 days post inoculation. We hypothesized that these signaling pathways may facilitate resistance. To further investigate other defence mechanisms at this time point, transcriptome profiling was performed. This revealed that cell wall modifications and response to oxidative stress form part of the defence responses common to both genotypes, whilst changes in the hormone signaling pathways may contribute to resistance. Additionally the expression of selected candidate defence response genes was induced earlier in moderately resistant trees than in susceptible trees, supporting the hypothesis that a delayed defence response may occur in the susceptible interaction. CONCLUSION : The ability of a host to fine-tune its defence responses is crucial and the responses identified in this study extends our understanding of plant defence, gained from model systems, to woody perennials.
