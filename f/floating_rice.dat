Water is pumped from the river using ten large Archimedes' screws which were first installed in the 1990s. The irrigated areas are run as cooperatives with approximately 2,100 families cultivating small plots. Nearly all the rice produced is consumed by the families themselves. The yields are still relatively low and the farmers are being encouraged to change their agricultural practices.|$|E
25|$|The Thais never {{lacked a}} rich food supply. Peasants planted rice {{for their own}} {{consumption}} and to pay taxes. Whatever remained was used to support religious institutions. From the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, however, a remarkable transformation took place in Thai rice cultivation. In the highlands, where rainfall had to be supplemented by a system of irrigation that controlled the water level in flooded paddies, the Thais sowed the glutinous rice that is still the staple in the geographical regions of the North and Northeast. But in the floodplain of the Chao Phraya, farmers turned to a different variety of rice—-the so-called <b>floating</b> <b>rice,</b> a slender, non-glutinous grain introduced from Bengal—-that would grow fast enough {{to keep pace with}} the rise of the water level in the lowland fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{landscape}} of the river basins is a very wide, flat, well-watered plain continuously refreshed with soil and sediment brought down by the rivers. The lower central plain from the delta north to Ang Thong Province is a flat, low area {{with an average of}} two metres above sea level. Further north and into the plains of the Ping and the Nan the elevation is over 20 m. Then the mountains that are the natural boundary of the Chao Praya watershed form a divide, which has, to some degree, historically isolated Thailand from other Southeast Asian civilisations. In northern Thailand the divide roughly corresponds to a long section of the political border of the country today. Southern portions of the divide's boundary correspond less to the nation's political border, because isolation in this area was prevented by the ease of transportation along the lowlands surrounding the Gulf of Thailand, allowing a unified Thai civilisation to extend beyond the watershed without issue. The slightly higher northern plains have been farmed for centuries and saw a major change from the 13th century during the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries and the Ayutthaya Kingdom that succeeded it when rice growing intensified with the introduction of <b>floating</b> <b>rice,</b> a much faster-growing strain of rice from Bengal. The southern swamps meanwhile changed radically from the 18th century when King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke moved the capital of Siam to Bangkok, and a process of canalisation and cultivation began, especially as Thailand began to export rice from 1855.|$|E

40|$|The African and Asian <b>floating</b> <b>rices</b> {{were grown}} under {{different}} rising water conditions, and internode elongation ability with increasing water depth was measured. In 5 cm/ 2 daysubmerged lot, all varieties having LEI {{positions at the}} 8 th and 9 th internodes could grow {{until the end of}} the experiment along with the increase of the water depth in both species. In these varieties, differences between species in almost growth characters were not observed. Among varieties having LEI positions from the 10 th to 12 th internodes, one African and one Asian variety failed to grow. No varieties having LEI position at the 13 th internode could grow, because its average internode length was considerably short. Among varieties with LEI positions from the 8 th to lith internodes in 10 cm/ 2 day-submerged lot, 4 African varieties and one Asian variety did not grow. All varieties with LEI positions from the 12 th to 14 th internodes could not grow. From these results, it was suggested that under slow rising water conditions, internode elongation ability of both African and Asian <b>floating</b> <b>rices</b> was almost the same.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} that measures vibrations {{originating in the}} motion of a rice transplanting mechanism consisting of the four bar linkage was produced. lts purpose was to make clear influences of the motion on the supporting member, that is, how the motion makes the member bibrate. The dynamic characteristics in a coupled system of this apparatus and mechanism were analyzed, and it was shown by theory and experiment that the fluctuating force caused by the motion had the most influence on the supporting member. Methods of controlling the fluctuating force were examined. The main results were as follows. 1) Influences of the fluctuating force may be estimated by assuming that the stational link is fixed on the inertial system. 2) The more the transplanting mechanism {{is removed from the}} center of rotation of the supporting member when the center is stational in inertial system, or from the center of gravity of the same member when the center is not stational, the larger becomes the influence of the fluctuating force,compared to that of the fluctuating torque on the crank shaft. 3) The optimum center of gravity to control the fluctuating force exists in every link. In type Ⅱ of the transplanting finger, according to optimization of the center of gravity on the coupler, the fluctuating force decreased about 40 % by calculation. 4) To be balanced with maximum term in the fluctuating force expanded to Fourier series, the rotating additional mass may be determined by calculation methods. Concerning the phase of the mass, the experimental result agreed with the calcuation result, but concerning the radius of rotation of the mass, the former was acceptable being about 20 % smaller than the latter. 5) Effects produced by the phase difference between one crank and the other crank were best at 180 degrees. Compared with the same phase, the fluctuating force sustained by the <b>float</b> in the <b>rice</b> transplanter decreased about 90 %. It was impossible to detect the placement of pitching angle at 240 rpm (rotation speed of the crank shaft) in the experiment using the test bed. 6) The phase difference between two transplanting fingers should be 180 /n degrees in to eliminate n dimensional higher harmonic term. In many transplanting fingers, fundmental wave's amplitude in maximum, and the higher the dimension becomes, the smaller the amplitude of higher harmonic becomes. Therefore it is good to control the fluctuating force so that the phase difference between two fingers is 180 degrees and between two sets (1 set = 2 fingers) is 90 degrees. The practical arrangement and phase difference, however, must be determined allowing for a lateral rolling and the construction of seedling feeding mechanism in addition to the fluctuating force. 7) The position vector of resultant center of grevity in the transplanting finger moves in a circuit under conditions described by equation (80). Components of the fluctuating force are cycled sinusoidally. From equation (80),(83), the fluctuating force still becomes zero, and the position vector is constant. 8) The relationship in equation (80),(83) generally never makes the fluctuating torque change as a sine curve nor makes it to be zero. In a special case of the relationship (equation (74),(76)),only the effect of the inertial moment in each link remains, and the torque can be expressed by equation (90) ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>rice</b> is {{planted in}} dry ground {{and allowed to}} {{establish}} as young plants. The area becomes flooded which triggers the rice's elongation ability.

In plants which were at least 21 days old, 7 days of submergence led to a 3 - to 5 -fold increase in internodal length. During submergence, the ethylene concentration in the internodes increased from about 0. 02 to 1 microliters per liter. Treatment of nonsubmerged plants with ethylene also stimulated internode elongation. When ethylene synthesis in partially submerged plants was blocked with aminooxyacetic acid and aminoethoxyvinylglycine, internode elongation was inhibited. This growth inhibition was reversed when ethylene biosynthesis was restored with 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC).

Reservoir management and climate change have large impacts on the inflow patterns into the Inner Niger Delta and thus on the extent and duration of the flooded surface area, {{which in turn is}} closely linked to ecological integrity, livelihoods, and food production within the delta region. A vulnerability assessment concept, developed in the framework of the WETwin project, is used to investigate the impacts of existing and planned upstream dams on food demands and supply in the Inner Niger Delta under different climate and population growth scenarios. The impacts on the water balance and inundation patterns were simulated using a process-based eco-hydrological modelling system equipped with an inundation module and a reservoir module. Both projected climate change and upstream reservoir management lead to a significant reduction of peak discharges during the rainy season and hence to serious losses of potential agricultural areas within the Inner Niger Delta. The effectiveness of the planned extension of irrigated rice areas within the Inner Niger Delta, in order to mitigate the losses of areas suitable for <b>floating</b> <b>rice,</b> was investigated as adaptive measure.
