25|$|A (normalised) {{cleavage}} {{such that}} the composition of two transport morphisms is always a transport morphism is called a splitting, and a fibred category with a splitting is called a split (fibred) category. In terms of <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> functors the condition of being a splitting means that the composition of <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> functors corresponding to composable morphisms f,g in E equals the <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> functor corresponding to f ∘ g. In other words, the compatibility isomorphisms cf,g of the previous section are all identities for a split category. Thus split E-categories correspond exactly to true functors from E to the category of categories.|$|E
25|$|It can {{be shown}} (see Grothendieck (1971) section 8) that, inversely, any {{collection}} of functors f*: FS → FT together with isomorphisms cf,g satisfying the compatibilities above, defines a cleaved category. These collections of <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> functors provide a more intuitive view on fibred categories; and indeed, it was in terms of such compatible <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> functors that fibred categories were introduced in Grothendieck (1959).|$|E

25|$|Fibre bundles: Fibre {{products}} {{exist in}} the category Top of topological spaces and thus by the previous example A(Top) is fibred over Top. If Fib is the full subcategory of A(Top) consisting of arrows that are projection maps of fibre bundles, then FibS is the category of fibre bundles on S and Fib is fibred over Top. A choice of a cleavage amounts to a choice of ordinary <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> (or pull-back) functors for fibre bundles.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} maps (or morphisms) from one sheaf to another; sheaves (of a {{specific}} type, such as sheaves of abelian groups) with their morphisms {{on a fixed}} topological space form a category. On the other hand, to each continuous map there is associated both a direct image functor, taking sheaves and their morphisms on the domain to sheaves and morphisms on the codomain, and an <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> functor operating in the opposite direction. These functors, and certain variants of them, are essential parts of sheaf theory.|$|E

In other words, an E-category is a fibred category if inverse images always exist (for morphisms whose codomains are {{in the range of}} projection) and are transitive.|$|E

25|$|Direct and inverse {{images of}} sheaves Every {{continuous}} map f : X → Y between topological spaces induces a functor f ∗ from {{the category of}} sheaves (of sets, or abelian groups, or rings...) on X to the corresponding category of sheaves on Y, the direct image functor. It also induces a functor f −1 from the category of sheaves of abelian groups on Y to the category of sheaves of abelian groups on X, the <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> functor. f −1 is left adjoint to f ∗. Here a more subtle {{point is that the}} left adjoint for coherent sheaves will differ from that for sheaves (of sets).|$|E
25|$|If F is a fibred E-category, it {{is always}} possible, for each {{morphism}} f: T → S in E and each object y in FS, to choose (by using the axiom of choice) precisely one <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> m: x → y. The class of morphisms thus selected is called a cleavage and the selected morphisms are called the transport morphisms (of the cleavage). A fibred category together with a cleavage is called a cleaved category. A cleavage is called normalised if the transport morphisms include all identities in F; {{this means that the}} inverse images of identity morphisms are chosen to be identity morphisms. Evidently if a cleavage exists, it can be chosen to be normalised; we shall consider only normalised cleavages below.|$|E
25|$|One can invert the {{direction}} of arrows in the definitions above to arrive at corresponding concepts of co-cartesian morphisms, co-fibred categories and split co-fibred categories (or co-split categories). More precisely, if φ: F →E is a functor, then a morphism m: x → y in F is called co-cartesian if it is cartesian for the opposite functor φop: Fop → Eop. Then m is also called a direct image and y a direct image of x for f = φ(m). A co-fibred E-category is anE-category such that direct image exists for each morphism in E and that the composition of direct images is a direct image. A co-cleavage and a co-splitting are defined similarly, corresponding to direct image functors instead of <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> functors.|$|E

25|$|A {{function}} or map {{from one}} topological space to another is called continuous if the <b>inverse</b> <b>image</b> of any open set is open. If the function maps the real numbers {{to the real}} numbers (both spaces with the Standard Topology), then this definition of continuous {{is equivalent to the}} definition of continuous in calculus. If a continuous function is one-to-one and onto, and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. But the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.|$|E
