A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles {{contract}} faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether left atrial size and ejection fraction are related to left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>pressures</b> in patients with coronary artery disease. Background. In patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>pressures</b> can be estimated by using Doppler mitral and pulmonary venous flow velocity variables. However, because these flow velocities are age dependent, additional variables that indicate elevated left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>pressures</b> are needed to increase diagnostic accuracy. Methods. Echocardiographic left atrial and Doppler mitral and pulmonary venous flow velocity variables were correlated with left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>pressures</b> in 70 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Results. Left atrial sin and volumes were larger and left atrial ejection fractions were lower in patients with elevated left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>pressures.</b> Mean pulmonary wedge pressure was related to mitral E/A wave velocity ratio (r = 0. 72), left atrial minimal volume (r = 0. 70), left atrial ejection fraction (r = − 0. 66) and atrial filling fraction (r = − 0. 66). Left ventricular end-diastolic and A wave pressures were related to the difierence in pulmonary venous and mitral A wave duration (both r = 0. 77). By stepwise multilinear regression analysis, the ratio of mitral E to A wave velocity was the most important determinant of pulmonary wedge (r = 0. 63) and left ventricular pre-A wave (r = 0. 75) pressures, whereas the difference in pulmonary venous and mitral A wave duration was the most important variable for both left ventricular A wave (r = 0. 75) and left ventricular end-diastolic (r = 0. 80) pressures. The sensitivity of a left atrial minimal volume > 40 cm 3 for identifying a mean pulmonary wedge pressure > 12 mm Hg was 82 %, with a specificity of 98 %. Conclusions. Left atrial size, left atrial ejection fraction and the difference between mitral and pulmonary venous flow duration at atrial contraction are independent determinants of left ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>pressures</b> in patients with coronary artery disease. The additive value of left atrial size and Doppler variables in estimating <b>filling</b> <b>pressures</b> and the possibility that left atrial size may be less age dependent than other mitral and pulmonary venous flow velocity variables merit further investigation...|$|R

At rest, ANF concentrations were sixfold higher in patients with CHF than in normal subjects (at rest: 53 +/- 12 vs 8 +/- 1 pmol. l- 1; P less than 0. 02). End-systolic ventricular volumes were increased threefold in patients with CHF (P less than 0. 02) despite normal mean central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP). A positive correlation was found between end-systolic ventricular volumes and plasma ANF (r = 0. 93, P less than 0. 001). During exercise, ANF rose by 120 % over basal values both in patients with CHF and in normal subjects (P less than 0. 01). Volumes higher than normal in patients with CHF increased further at E 2 (P less than 0. 05) {{in contrast to a}} decrease of systolic volumes recorded in normal subjects (P less than 0. 05). <b>Filling</b> <b>pressures</b> rising abnormally in patients with CHF correlated with plasma ANF during exercise (r = 0. 53, P less than 0. 02 for PAP; r = 0. 51, P less than 0. 05 for PWP).

Methods. Forty-nine patients were studied in the cardiac catheterization laboratory with simultaneous Doppler echocardiography using high fidelity catheters to compare left ventricular diastolic <b>filling</b> <b>pressures</b> (pre–A wave left ventricular pressure) and Doppler mitral inflow at baseline and during reduction of preload during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver (n = 27) or sublingual nitroglycerin (n = 36), or both (n = 14). Doppler measurements consisted of E (initial peak velocity), A (velocity at atrial contraction), deceleration time (time from E velocity to deceleration of flow extrapolated to baseline) and absolute A wave velocity (A′ [peak A wave velocity minus velocity at onset of atrial contraction]). Results. In patients with high pre–A wave pressure (≥ 15 mm Hg), there was a greater change in the E/A′ ratio during the Valsalva maneuver than in patients with a normal pre–A wave pressure (− 1. 22 ± 1. 1 vs. − 0. 35 ± 0. 17; p = 0. 02).
