One potential strategy to cope with competitiveness challenges {{is to focus on}} research and technological innovation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present the results of the project EUROCROP (Agricultural research for improving arable crop competitiveness – EUROCROP - [URL] aimed at the identification of research priorities for arable crop competitiveness. The project adopts a definition of competitiveness based on a combination of economic competitiveness and social/environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the project utilises both a crop chain and a <b>horizontal</b> <b>issue</b> perspective, and develops research priorities through the interaction of the scientific level (expert group approach) and the stakeholder level (scenario analysis). The main result of the project is the elaboration of approximately eighty research topics. Among these, the main areas for research identified are A: Risk management and adaptation of arable farming; B: Innovation in cropping systems for high environmental and economic performances; C: Limiting the impact of arable crop cropping systems on green-house gas emissions; D: Better understanding of public concern about arable crop production and products and communication with global and local societies. The project confirms that a number of well established research topics retain their importance (e. g. yield improvement, plant protection). However, they require cautious coordination with an increasingly complex system of short term priorities.

40|$|Abstract: Decentralized {{decision-making}} in {{supply chain}} management is quite common, and often inevitable, due to {{the magnitude of the}} chain, its geographical dispersion, and the number of agents that play a role in it. But, decentralized decision-making is known to result in inefficient Nash equilibrium outcomes, and optimal outcomes that maximize the sum of the utilities of all agents need not be Nash equilibria. In this paper we demonstrate through several examples of supply chain models how linear reward/penalty schemes can be implemented so that a given optimal solution becomes a Nash equilibrium. The examples represent both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> coordination <b>issues.</b> The techniques we employ build on a general framework for the use of linear reward/penalty schemes to induce stability in given optimal solutions and should be useful to other multi-agen...|$|R

In a second step, the study offers an overview {{and analysis of the}} negotiating process in its broader context. Additionally, negotiating proposals on stage-specific and <b>horizontal</b> <b>issues</b> of the dispute settlement mechanism are presented and analysed in depth with regard to their background, their contents and their potential implications. In a third step, the difficulties faced by negotiators in completing the DSU review are explored. Policy recommendations for further negotiations are made and the chances of a future agreement are evaluated. Finally, the study is also intended to offer a one-stop point of departure for other researchers who wish to explore further specific aspects of the DSU review.

40|$|This book {{provides}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} wheat production developments in the Eurasian region and assesses the potential contribution of the region to domestic and international food security. In particular, the book covers policy and institutional developments of the agricultural sector in Eurasia with a special focus on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>issues</b> relevant to the current and future potential growth of the wheat production, such as land policy, credit and finance, privatization, farm restructuring, and environmental challenges. Global food security is a major societal concern in the light of an increasing population, which is projected to grow from around seven billion today to almost 10 billion in 2050. Two most likely ways to achieve the much needed food production growth are: expansion of land cultivation or increase in crop yields and total factor productivity. The only region with a significant amount of uncultivated arable land that {{is at the same time}} experiencing rising agricultural productivity is the “Eurasian wheat belt,” comprising of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the Central Asian countries (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kirgizstan). This makes the region a potential hotspot for driving the future growth of global agriculture. Such prospects require a detailed investigation of Eurasia’s future perspectives in terms of food production (with a focus on wheat) and its potential contribution to regional and global food security.

40|$|Globalization, internationalization, integration, deregulation, {{as well as}} {{technological}} advances have provided the impetus for mergers of stock exchanges to facilitate cross-border listings and trading. Cross-border mergers trigger a series of different issues to be analyzed. The focus of our analysis will be on regulatory and competition law issues arising from cross-border stock exchange mergers. From a competition law standpoint, stock exchange mergers may have a severe impact on the competition among stock exchanges and thus lead to higher fees or lower quality of service. The {{focus will be on}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>issues</b> arising from such mergers. Thus, this Article will provide an analysis of the following issues: (1) the provision of primary listing services to domestic companies; (2) the provision of secondary listing services and primary listing services to companies seeking listings outside their domestic market, (3) the provision of on-book equities trading services; (4) markets for bonds and derivatives trading, and (5) markets for information services as well as information technology services. Some permutations of cross-border stock exchange mergers may induce competitive harm that leads to a post-merger market characterized by a lower degree of competition, and thus a lower degree of innovation and improvement in exchange services. The burden falls on competition authorities to ensure that effective and sufficient competition remains after any consolidation in the stock exchange industry. It should be emphasized that sound and effective regulation {{is the key to the}} development and integration of stock exchanges in the global market. Effective regulation will provide confidence and attract investors, allowing stock exchanges to grow and interact.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{remains to}} be a major societal concern. In the light of the current expectations of population growth, world food production has to be massively increased to sustain the associated food demand rise. While agricultural productivity was rising during recent decades in the US, Europe and also in some developing countries, the corresponding growth rates lately appeared to be slowing down. In fact, the only world region with a significant amount of arable land, which currently is not under cultivation and which at the same time is, moreover, experiencing rising productivity figures, is the so called 'Eurasian wheat belt', comprising of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the Central Asian countries, namely Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kirgizstan. In this light, the Joint Research Centre and the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development organized a thematic workshop, held during 20 – 22 May 2014 in Istanbul/Turkey, set up to bring experts on the matter together and to discuss to what extent these countries could play a role for regional and international food security. Following the workshop analysis and discussion, this report provides a comprehensive technical overview of the wheat production, and the main factors to achieve full production potential across the Eurasian wheat belt with regards to national, regional and global issues of cereal supply and food security in evolving global markets. It reviews key <b>horizontal</b> <b>issues,</b> such as land policy, credit and finance, privatization, farm structures, social consequences of transition, environmental challenges, against the backdrop of agrarian reforms implemented during the transition period.

40|$|The U. S. {{health care}} system is {{organized}} around markets.   There has, however, been ongoing concern about the functioning of these markets, so much so that some have despaired of these markets working at all. The policy response to this concern has been disjointed. Health care markets are subject to many regulations and interventions. Some of these policies have attempted to substitute regulation for competition, regulating entry and investment (certificate of need laws, health planning) or price (all-payer regulation). At the same time, health care markets have been subject to antitrust enforcement. Recent years have seen a shift away from regulatory policies and toward competition. Antitrust policy towards health care markets has become much more vigorous since the early 1970 s.   Antitrust is intended to ensure the efficient functioning of these markets. As a consequence, competition and antitrust policy have become prominent issues in health policy. Economic research is vital to addressing issues in competition and antitrust in health care. This includes issues of market definition and detecting anticompetitive conduct. In rule of reason cases, where benefits are weighed against costs, it includes measuring the loss of welfare resulting from a particular practice against any gains resulting from it. In this chapter we consider research issues in the analysis of competition and the application of antitrust to health care markets. We outline our views on the analytical issues and review the relevant literatures both from health economics and industrial organization and antitrust generally. Our focus is mainly on hospitals and interactions between hospitals and insurers. This is due, in part, to where there has been antitrust activity. Physician markets are for the most part very unconcentrated, and as such they do not lend themselves to the kinds of anticompetitive conduct the antitrust laws prohibit.   Although issues of competition and antitrust in pharmaceutical markets are fascinating and important, they differ in some fundamental ways from markets for health care services, and as such, we exclude them from this chapter. In what follows we first discuss the optimality of antitrust in health care markets, then <b>horizontal</b> <b>issues</b> in health care markets. This is followed by a discussion of vertical issues, and finally, by a conclusion and a set of recommendations for future research. ...|$|E

Such overlays are built over {{a large number of}} distributed computational agents, virtually organized in colonies or virtual organizations, and ruled by a leader (broker) who is elected democratically (vox populi, vox dei) or imposed by system administrators (primus inter pares). Every agent asks the broker to log in the colony by declaring the resources that can be offered (with variable guarantees). Once logged in, an agent can ask the broker for other resources. Colonies can recursively be considered as evolved agents who can log in an outermost colony governed by another super-leader. Communications and routing intra-colonies goes through a broker- 2 -broker PKI-based negotiation. Every broker routes intra- and inter- service requests by filtering its resource routing table, and then forwarding the request first inside its colony, and second outside, via the proper super-leader (thus applying an endogenous-first-estrogen- last strategy). Theoretically, queries are formulæ in first-order logic equipped with a small program used to orchestrate and synchronize atomic formulæ (atomic services). When the client agent receives notification of all (or part of) the requested resources, then the real resource exchange is performed directly by the server(s) agents, without any further mediation of the broker, in a pure peer-to-peer fashion. The proposed overlay promotes an intermittent participation in the colony, since peers can appear, disappear, and organize themselves dynamically. This implies that the routing process may lead to failures, because some agents have quit or are temporarily unavailable, or they were logged out manu militari by the broker due to their poor performance or greediness. We aim to design, validate through simulation, and implement these foundations in an overlay network computer system. (From [Liquori-Cosnard TGC- 07 paper]) ...|$|E

We make SPADOCK, an adaptive pipeline system which is builtunder distributed system architecture with the utilization ofHTML 5 WebSocket, then measure its performance. Parametersused for the measurement includes latency, workload, andbandwidth. The result shows that SPADOCK could reduceserving latency by 68. 28 % compared with the conventional web,and it is 20. 63 % faster than BigPipe...|$|R
40|$|Antitrust {{policy has}} evolved {{substantially}} {{in the last}} two decades. Although the incorporation of new empirical methods has {{played a critical role in}} this evolutionary process, with only a few exceptions experimental tools have not been employed. This omission is unfortunate, because appropriately constructed experiments can uniquely provide important insights. This paper summarizes some of our recent research as a means of illustrating the potential value of antitrust policy experiments. Over the last twenty years, antitrust enforcement policy has evolved substantially. A primary impetus for this evolution has been the continuing advancement of oligopoly theory.

It presents projects from the initial provision of a topographic map and specifications through to the investment and user cost estimates of a particular highway. Vertical and <b>horizontal</b> alignment, drainage <b>issues,</b> and potential environmental impacts are also discussed. Intended for use by senior undergraduate and graduate students, this edition: expands on environmental reporting concerns; presents a discussion of economic cost analysis and its applications; includes an outline of route selection and design methods aided by digital terrain and computerized alignment modeling; and furthers realism of design and evaluation in the classroom...|$|R
