'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that was coming from hers. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I have never heard {{anything}} as amazing as this.

500|$|By {{the second}} half of 1814, {{following}} his long and almost continuous campaigns throughout Europe during the last ten years, the health of General Nansouty badly deteriorated. He was suffering from his wounds, some of which were very recent, but, above all from war fatigue. On his death bed, he is recorded to have said: [...] "I have carefully reflected upon all my action ever since I was born and <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I have not done anyone wrong." [...] He is also said to have reasserted his Christian faith and to have asked that his son be recommended for the King's protection, as a favour for his services. Just before passing away, he told his son that his heritage would be to follow his example and live an honourable and blameless life. General Count Étienne-Marie-Antoine-Champion de Nansouty died on 12 February 1815 in Paris, leaving behind his wife and their only son. A pension of 6,000 Francs per year was granted to the General's widow by the King of France. His final resting place is at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, division 27. The engraving on his tombstone reads: ...|$|E
500|$|Sometimes Levin {{wrote about}} frivolous, even farcical matters, {{such as a}} series of mock-indignant {{articles}} about the sex-lives of mosquitoes. At other times he wrote about matters of grave moral importance, unfailingly denouncing authoritarian regimes whether of the left or the right. He observed, [...] "I am barred by the governments concerned from entering the Soviet Union and the lands of her empire {{on the one hand and}} South Africa on the other. These decrees constitute a pair of campaign medals that I wear with considerable pleasure and I have a profound suspicion of those who rebuke me for partisanship while wearing only one". He wrote regularly about the arts. Music was a recurrent theme; he was notorious for his addiction to Wagner, and other favourite composers included Schubert and Mozart. He wrote about performers he admired, including Otto Klemperer, Alfred Brendel, and Kiri Te Kanawa. He turned less regularly to the visual arts, but when he did his views were clear-cut and trenchantly expressed. He wrote of a Pre-Raphaelite exhibition in 1984, [...] "Never, <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> not even at the exclusively Millais exhibition in 1967, have I seen so much sickening rubbish in one place at one time". His knowledge and love of literature were reflected in many of his writings; among his best-known pieces is a long paragraph about the influence of Shakespeare on everyday discourse. It begins: ...|$|E

2500|$|Years {{later he}} observed, [...] "My parents never read a book. I never <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> saw them {{sit down and}} read a book. So {{it was always a}} mystery to them—where do these books come from, and who {{actually}} writes them? And our son wants to go into a business like that?!!" [...] He ignored their warnings and [...] "lived to regret not listening", acknowledging that he hadn't realized how hard a writing career would be.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{management}} of Abatino, Baker's stage and public persona, {{as well as her}} singing voice, were transformed. In 1934, she took the lead in a revival of Jacques Offenbach's opera La créole, which premiered in December of that year for a six-month run at the Théâtre Marigny on the Champs-Élysées of Paris. In preparation for her performances, she went through months of training with a vocal coach. In the words of Shirley Bassey, who has cited Baker as her primary influence, [...] "...she went from a 'petite danseuse sauvage' with a decent voice to 'la grande diva magnifique'...I swear <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> I have never seen, and probably never shall see again, such a spectacular singer and performer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{had their}} own files on Sukarno and the Japanese {{commander}} in Sumatra approached him with respect, wanting to use him to organise and pacify the Indonesians. Sukarno {{on the other hand}} wanted to use the Japanese to gain independence for Indonesia: [...] "The Lord be praised, God showed me the way; in that valley of the Ngarai I said: Yes, Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with Dai Nippon...For the first time <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I saw myself in the mirror of Asia." [...] In July 1942, Sukarno was sent back to Jakarta, where he re-united with other nationalist leaders recently released by the Japanese, including Mohammad Hatta. There, he met the Japanese commander General Hitoshi Imamura, who asked Sukarno and other nationalists to galvanise support from Indonesian populace to aid Japanese war effort.|$|E

60|$|Oh! what a brute was that! In {{bulk and}} height it {{appeared}} to be half as big again as any of its tribe which I had known <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>life's</b> experience. It was enormous, unearthly; a survivor perhaps of some ancient species that lived before the Flood, or at least a very giant of its kind. Its grey-black sides were scarred as though with fighting. One of its huge tusks, much worn at the end, for evidently it was very old, gleamed white in the moonlight. The other was broken off about halfway down its length. When perfect it had been malformed, for it curved downwards and not upwards, also rather out to the right.|$|R
