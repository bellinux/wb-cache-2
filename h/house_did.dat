50|$|Angela's death infuriates Camilo, the pilot, {{who knows}} that Machiche is {{directly}} responsible for Angelas's suicide. Camilo takes the monk's revolver and kills Machiche. Despairing, Cristobal jumps behind Camilo and strangles him with a shovel. Now there are three dead bodies. Angry, Don Graci gives orders to bury Camilo and Machiche and cremate Angela's body in the oven. The next day {{the survivors of the}} house abandon it. Don Graci gives Cristobal his freedom. The four men leave the property. Sometime later, Angela's boyfriend arrives to the abandoned house calling out her name. He reads the four rules at the entrance of the mansion of Araucaima: If you enter this <b>house,</b> <b>do</b> not leave. If you leave this <b>house,</b> <b>do</b> not go back.

5|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would allow a casino in Prince George's County. The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft. The bill passed the Senate, but the <b>House</b> <b>did</b> not vote on it. The bill was passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to allow a casino in Prince George's County, which was passed via referendum in November 2012. After one season of live racing, Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft {{for the next two}} years. The only exception is if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George's County casino.|$|E
5|$|Although Nash was {{responsible}} for the street's general development, some individual buildings were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and Sir John Soane, amongst others. By 1819, the Crown were receiving regular rent and the street was becoming established. At first, it was called New Street and became a dividing line between Soho, which had declined socially and economically, and the fashionable squares and streets of Mayfair to the west. Carlton <b>House</b> <b>did</b> not last long following completion of the works and was demolished in 1829, to be replaced by Carlton House Terrace, also designed by Nash.|$|E
5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too could be brought to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house {{that had been used}} as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the <b>house</b> <b>did</b> not reveal Mengele or any members of his family, and the neighborhood postman said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so he had to give up.|$|E

5|$|On immigration, Moran {{supported}} a pathway to citizenship {{for illegal immigrants}} and did not support decreasing the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country or the enforcement of federal immigration laws by state and local police. He was a cosponsor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform ASAP Act of 2009 (H.R.4321), which the <b>House</b> <b>did</b> not pass. He was given an overall immigration reduction grade of D by NumbersUSA. The American Immigration Lawyers Association scored him as having voted 31 times for the organization's position and 7 times against the organization's position.|$|E
5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose <b>house</b> <b>did</b> you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E
5|$|In the 1912 presidential election, Lane {{supported}} Democratic {{candidate and}} New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, though {{he declined to}} make campaign speeches on Wilson's behalf, citing ICC policy that commissioners act in a nonpartisan manner. Wilson was elected on November 5, 1912, and on November 21 the commissioner {{spent much of the}} day with Colonel Edward M. House, the President-elect's advisor, who would {{play a key role in}} selecting Cabinet appointees. The possibility of Lane becoming Secretary of the Interior was discussed, but he indicated he was happy in his present position. After the meeting, Lane had second thoughts, and asked House if he would have a free hand as Interior Secretary. House indicated that were he to prove capable in the position, Wilson would not interfere. Colonel <b>House</b> <b>did</b> not immediately recommend Lane for the job, but went on to consider other candidates, such as former San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan and Wilson friend Walter Page.|$|E

25|$|It {{was built}} to house the Victoria amazonica, {{the largest of the}} Nymphaeaceae family of water lilies. This plant was {{originally}} transported to Kew in phials of clean water and arrived in February 1849, after several prior attempts to transport seeds and roots had failed. Although various other members of the Nymphaeaceae family grew well, the <b>house</b> <b>did</b> not suit the Victoria, purportedly because of a poor ventilation system, and this specimen was moved to another, smaller, house.|$|E

Izzuddin however soon became the victim of a smear campaign organized by his uncle Al Ameer Abdul Majeed Rannabandeyri Kilegefaanu and cousin Hassan Fareed. Ultimately he was discredited and banished in 1934 to the isolated southerly island of Fuvahmulah where he died in 1938.|$|E

25|$|Purge Incomplete – Mary Jo Bole's exhibit {{explores the}} history of {{plumbing}} at the penitentiary. Interestingly, the building had running water before the White <b>House</b> <b>did.</b> Consisting of sculptural pieces made of resin, brass, and frosted glass, Bole's designs are modeled after John Haviland's original design for the plumbing at Eastern State Penitentiary. The exhibit includes views of the plumbing {{from the vantage point}} of those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing. Additionally, the exhibit showcases the sculptures as having both opaque and translucent factors, in which the translucent parts will glow within the cells.|$|E
25|$|Of course, many conjectural {{decisions}} were made, {{such as the}} precise locations of the exterior doors and the size and locations of the windows. On the interior, {{the location of the}} staircase to the loft and the form of the large open hearths and built-in bed box also involved conjecture, but were based on historical precedent. In the original Brooklyn Museum installation, there were two bed boxes on the exterior wall of the north room. When the house was moved to its present location in 2006, it was decided that if the <b>house</b> <b>did</b> have a bed box it more logically was on an interior wall next to the hearth as you now will see it.|$|E
25|$|Johnson made eleven {{international}} {{trips to}} twenty countries during his presidency. He flew 523,000 miles aboard Air Force One while in office. His October 1966 visit to Australia sparked demonstrations from anti-war protesters. One {{of the most}} unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before Christmas in 1967. The President began the trip by going to the memorial service for Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, who had disappeared in a swimming accident and was presumed drowned. The White <b>House</b> <b>did</b> not reveal in advance to the press that the President would make the first round-the-world presidential trip. The trip was 26,959 miles completed in only 112.5 hours (4.7 days). Air Force One crossed the equator twice, stopped in Travis Air Force Base, Calif., then Honolulu, Pago Pago, Canberra, Melbourne, Vietnam, Karachi and Rome.|$|E
