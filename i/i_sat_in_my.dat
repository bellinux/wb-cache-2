5|$|We {{destroyed}} the aircraft and all munitions, everything. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fighter and fired the guns {{into the woods}} where all the fuel had been dropped, and then jumped out. We destroyed twenty-five perfectly good fighters. They {{would be nice to}} have in museums now.|$|E
500|$|Foley {{accepted}} {{the failure of}} the film saying, [...] "I knew it was doomed before even filming started. The day before the first shoot, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hotel and looked to the script thinking, 'Damn, wish I could re-write this whole thing.' After the film released, my dad called me up saying 'you know The New York Times are calling it the worst film of the year." [...] He recalled that both he and Madonna chose to overlook {{the failure of the}} film, and remembered one incident when he met Madonna at a hotel lobby. [...] "She just looked to me once and said, 'So it's a flop right?' That's the only time she ever mentioned the film. Even Sean also never mentioned it in front of her." [...] In another article in The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that Madonna's real personality is of a [...] "knowing, shrewd, pragmatic young woman, a performer of invigorating energy who still looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe, even with short hair, but who has much more in common with the enthusiastic, unembarrassed, comic tartness of Jean Harlow, somehow let loose on the streets of New York in the 80's." [...] However, he felt that Who's That Girl failed to portray that image, leading to its failure. The first half of the film showed a different personality of Madonna, trying to be comical, which was not accepted by the public.|$|E
60|$|I {{stood on}} one foot, as it were, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> rickety chair.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair. The {{appearance}} of his twin-brother {{in the story}} was a complication in itself. Two criminals escaped from the Assizes, instead of one! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hammock {{and gazed}} {{out across the}} plain at this thrilling and majestic sight, and I suppose that Billali noticed it, for he brought his litter alongside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most preposterous!" [...] I exclaimed, {{and then}} {{suddenly}} realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of <b>my</b> soul, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair {{and stared at him}} in blank amazement.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} morning, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{office at the}} prison, setting all things in order for whoever should succeed me, Martina entered, as she had done before.|$|E
60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the 20th of June 1845, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room at York Fort, musing on the probability of my being dispatched to some other part of the Company's wide dominions.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. 'Twas dead of the night, when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dwelling; One glimmering lamp was expiring and low; Around, {{the dark}} tide of the tempest was swelling, Along the wild {{mountains}} night-ravens were yelling,-- They bodingly presaged destruction and woe. [...] 5 ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{no sound}} in the room except the lapping voices of the fire, but we two listened intently, and she at least took comfort from what she heard. She {{recovered}} herself and half rose. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> still <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair by the screen.|$|R
60|$|One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell, {{about the}} hour {{when a man}} gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down {{in her lap and}} made a little face of disappointment.|$|R
6000|$|I {{raised my}} hand. Mr. Marx whispered, [...] "Now!" [...] And the bouquet was lying at her feet. She {{picked it up}} gracefully, shot a coquettish glance up towards me, and then the curtain fell, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair, feeling quite {{convinced}} that I had made an utter fool of myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is my house," [...] he said. [...] "I do {{not often}} leave it. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{sleeping}} chamber behind"--he {{pointed to the}} silken curtains through which he had passed--"I heard your entrance and guessed with pain and regret at your mission." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Craig!" [...] she cried. [...] "Craig! I saw {{his face}} as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair there, talking to the Captain. I saw a man's white face--nothing else. He must have been leaning over the rail. He heard me call out and he disappeared." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{comes to}} me that for some days, three or four, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cell at the palace, for here I was kept because, as I learned afterwards, it was feared that if I were removed to that State prison of which I had been governor, some attempt would be made to rescue me.|$|E
60|$|I {{arrived at}} the office so soon, after all, that I had half an hour's {{loitering}} about the Commons, before old Tiffey, who was always first, appeared with his key. Then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> shady corner, {{looking up at the}} sunlight on the opposite chimney-pots, and thinking about Dora; until Mr. Spenlow came in, crisp and curly.|$|R
5000|$|Moore {{was born}} in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and aside from his family's brief move to San Francisco, California in 1964/65, {{grew up in the}} Twin Cities area. [...] "I didn't have any friends and really didn't want any. <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room and played Beatle songs and wrote my own," [...] he claims. At this point, he was known as Rick Moore.|$|R
6000|$|At breakfast, the Indian, evidently {{curious to}} know what would be {{expected}} of him the next day, asked me how I spent the Sunday when at home. I told him that <b>I</b> commonly <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chamber reading, etc., in the forenoon, and went {{to walk in the}} afternoon. At which {{he shook his head and}} said, [...] "Er, that is ver' bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me think," [...] {{said the}} old man. [...] "For how many Christmas times running, have <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> warm place, and never had {{to come out in}} the cold night air; and have made good cheer, without being {{disturbed}} by any such uncomfortable, wretched sight as him there? Is it twenty, William?" ...|$|E
60|$|So he went, and for {{the next}} two hours or more <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> private room dictating letters to Heliodore on matters {{connected}} with the duties of my office. The work came to an end at last, and I was preparing to take my evening ride on a led mule when Martina entered the room.|$|E
60|$|But my knee {{was bothering}} me terribly. As well as I could make out, the kneecap seemed {{turned up on}} edge {{in the midst of}} the swelling. As <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bunk {{examining}} it (the six hunters were all in the steerage, smoking and talking in loud voices), Henderson took a passing glance at it.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{coming to}} UNM, Hobson {{broke down and}} cried. [...] "You always wished that you were there and playing on that level," [...] Hobson said. [...] "When I finally got there, <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room and just thanked God and cried {{for a couple of}} hours because I finally got to the place where I always wanted to get." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{at dinner}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> prime, And glimpsed <b>my</b> face <b>in</b> the sideboard-glass, And started as if I {{had seen a}} crime, And prayed the ghastly show might pass.|$|R
60|$|Not {{having this}} {{resource}} open to me, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> myself down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bedroom, to consider--if {{the matter of}} Dubourg went any further--what it was my business to do next.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> howdah, half dazed. I hardly {{heard what}} they were saying. My heart danced like the elephant. Then it stood still within me. I was only aware of a feeling of faintness. Luckily for my {{reputation}} as a mighty sportswoman, however, I just managed to keep up, and did not actually faint, as I was more than half inclined to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{one day he}} died--O {{that awful}} day! <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room with the {{curtains}} down. I couldn't endure the sunlight. I pretended to be sick. I was numb with agony and yet I could do nothing. I couldn't even send a rose to lay on his coffin. I couldn't even speak his name. I could only lie there like a prisoner gagged and on the rack--to suffer--suffer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The next day, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> place, I became {{conscious}} {{there was}} some one standing near; and behold, it was herself! I kept my seat, at first in the confusion of my mind, later on from policy; and she stood, and leaned a little over me, as in pity. She was very still and timid; her voice was low. Did I suffer in my captivity? she asked me. Had I to complain of any hardship? ...|$|E
60|$|There came no summons from Rowchester, and I dined alone. I {{must have}} dozed over my after-dinner {{cigarette}}, for {{at first that}} soft rapping seemed {{to come to me}} from a long way off. Then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair with a start. My cigarette had burnt out, my coffee was cold. I had been asleep, and outside some one was knocking at my' front door.|$|R
40|$|Now the cab {{was leaving}} the {{downtown}} area and was entering the residential district. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> forward <b>in</b> <b>my</b> seat {{and looked out the}} window. Apparently this was not a fashionable neighborhood, but middle class and decaying. I had never been there before and looked at the big, dirty frame houses, old, stone churches with dead ivy clinging to them, and maples, bare of their leaves and dripping in the rain...|$|R
6000|$|... "The curious thing," [...] he remarked, {{with the}} manner of a man who makes a trivial conversation, [...] "is that I didn't think--at all. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> with her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> arms amidst the stones--in a sort of lethargy--stagnant.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> usual nook, {{and looked}} at him with the light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he {{occupied}} an arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was {{his tone}} all along. He was {{perfectly}} respectful, perfectly polite. Sometimes for days {{not a word}} would be exchanged between us; sometimes he would come up and talk, or rather, try to talk, for it was seldom that he got any answer from me. As a rule <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> deck chair with Anna beside me, and {{he sat on the}} other side of the deck, or walked up and down, smoking or talking with that man who was with him.|$|E
6000|$|Another time, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> study, {{the weight}} of my {{greatest}} folio [...] books brake down {{three or four of}} the highest shelves, when I sat [...] close under them, and they fell down every side me, and not one of [...] them hit me, save one upon the arm; whereas the place, the weight, the [...] greatness of the books was such, and my head just under them, that it [...] was a wonder they had not beaten out my brains, &c.|$|E
50|$|John Chapman of the New York Daily News wrote, This is by {{no means}} a {{historical}} tract or a sermon on the birth of this nation. It is warm with a life of its own; it is funny, it is moving... Often, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> enchanted <b>in</b> <b>my</b> seat, it reminded me of Gilbert and Sullivan in its amused regard of human frailties.... The songs and lyrics are, as I have indicated, remarkably original.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> back <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{corner and}} looked out into the darkness. Feurgéres, {{opposite}} to me, was leaning back with half-closed eyes. From his soft, regular breathing it seemed almost as though he slept. For me there was no thought of rest or sleep. I made plans only to discard them, rehearsed speeches, appeals, threats, only to realize their hopeless ineffectiveness. And underneath it all was a dull constant pain, the pain which stays.|$|R
6000|$|... "The curious thing," [...] he remarked, {{with the}} manner of a man who makes a trivial conversation, [...] "is that I didn't THINK--I didn't think at all. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> with her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> arms amidst the stones--in a sort of lethargy--stagnant.|$|R
