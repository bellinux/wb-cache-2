5|$|<b>Dyslexia</b> is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of <b>dyslexia</b> are problems within the brain's language processing. <b>Dyslexia</b> is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. <b>Dyslexia</b> is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E
5|$|The film raised {{awareness}} {{of the issue of}} <b>dyslexia,</b> and prompted more open discussions among parents, schools, activists, and policymakers.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} {{the character of}} a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra <b>Dyslexia</b> Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). <b>Dyslexia</b> eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in {{the final version of the}} script.|$|E
5|$|Neurolinguistic {{techniques}} {{are also used}} to study disorders and breakdowns in language, such as aphasia and <b>dyslexia,</b> and how they relate to physical characteristics of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Nikumbh returns, and {{subsequently}} {{brings up the}} topic of <b>dyslexia</b> in class, and offers a list of famous people who were dyslexic. Later, Nikumbh reveals to Ishaan, that he too is a dyslexic and faced problems similar to Ishaan. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using remedial techniques developed by <b>dyslexia</b> specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve.|$|E
5|$|Born in Florida, Cox {{struggled}} in school due to severe <b>dyslexia.</b> His teachers {{advised him to}} get a job in which he worked with his hands, so he studied sculpture at the University of South Florida, and majored in art. Cox took a job as an insurance agent after college, but his income disappointed him, and he sought out higher-paying work.|$|E
5|$|Ishaan's {{situation}} changes {{when a new}} art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, {{joins the}} school's faculty. An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with developmental disabilities, Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly {{different from that of}} his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of <b>dyslexia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{publicly}} {{announced in}} 2009 {{that he had}} been battling <b>dyslexia</b> for his entire life. During his early years, Ryan struggled to read and write in school; however, he was not formally diagnosed until testing confirmed he had the disorder in 2007. Ryan utilizes color-coded playbooks and game plans when coaching on the sidelines to aid his comprehension.|$|E
5|$|Caitlyn Marie Jenner {{was born}} William Bruce Jenner on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York, to Esther Ruth (née McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner. Her {{father was an}} arborist. She has two sisters, Lisa and Pam. Her younger brother, Burt, {{was killed in a}} car {{accident}} in Canton, Connecticut on November 30, 1976, shortly after Jenner's success at the Olympic Games. As a young child, Jenner was diagnosed with <b>dyslexia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade.

5|$|Jason Miller portrayed Parseghian in the 1993 film Rudy, which chronicled Rudy Ruettiger's {{determination}} to overcome his small size and <b>dyslexia</b> and play for Notre Dame in 1974. Parseghian saw Ruettiger's drive and placed {{him on the}} scout team, but resigned {{at the end of}} the year. Devine, Parseghian's successor, put Ruettiger in on defense {{at the end of the}} final game of the 1975 season, and Ruettiger recorded a sack.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, {{bookseller}} Waterstones asked Rowling and 12 {{other writers}} (Sebastian Faulks, Doris Lessing, Lisa Appignanesi, Margaret Atwood, Lauren Child, Richard Ford, Neil Gaiman, Nick Hornby, Michael Rosen, Axel Scheffler, Tom Stoppard and Irvine Welsh) {{to compose a}} short piece of their own choosing on a single A5 card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities <b>Dyslexia</b> Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel that concerns Harry's father, James Potter, and godfather, Sirius Black, and takes place three years before Harry was born. The cards were collated and sold for charity in book form in August 2008.|$|E
5|$|On his day off, Nikumbh {{sets off}} to Mumbai, to visit Ishaan's parents. Nikumbh is {{surprised}} to learn that Ishaan is passionate about painting, and shows great talent in art. Nikumbh then asks Mr Awasthi as to why he sent Ishaan to a boarding school. Mr Awasthi replies that Ishaan was an ill-mannered boy and was a poor student. Nikumbh shows Ishaan's mother her son's notebooks and gives an analysis of the script. Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words. Mr Awasthi tries to dismiss it as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness. Nikumbh demonstrates what Ishaan experiences every day at school. He states that Ishaan has <b>dyslexia</b> as well as he may be having other conditions, which make him a difficult child.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Allardyce {{was born}} in October 1954 on the Old Park Farm Estate, Dudley, the son of Robert Allardyce (1916–1989) and Mary Agnes Allardyce (1918–1991). His father was a police sergeant. Both parents {{originated}} from Scotland with his father from Nairn and his mother from Dumfries. He has an older sister, Mary, born in Scotland in 1939 and an older brother, Robert junior, born in 1951. Allardyce was educated at Sycamore Green Primary School and later at Mons Hill School, having been unsuccessful in his Eleven plus exam. He discovered in later life that he suffers from <b>dyslexia.</b> As a child, he supported Wolverhampton Wanderers and dreamed {{that one day he}} would play at and manage the club.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{continues}} in Lima {{with a new}} generation of students but also follows some of the McKinley graduates from the third season, notably to the fictional New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA) in New York City. The season follows the club through a loss at the Sectionals competition (episode 9) and subsequent reinstatement when the winning Dalton Academy Warblers were found to have used banned substances (human growth hormone) (episode 12) before winning at the Regionals competition (episode 22), which meant they would be attending their third consecutive National show choir competition. In the meantime, Rachel Berry and Kurt Hummel navigate NYADA and their lives as aspiring performers, plus their relationships with Finn and Blaine. Issues during the season include sex, bulimia, gender identity, child molestation, <b>dyslexia,</b> school violence, and pregnancy scares. Former main cast members Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) were credited as guest stars, while previously recurring glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) was promoted to the main cast.|$|E
25|$|Deep <b>dyslexia</b> {{is usually}} {{classified}} as an acquired reading disorder, {{as opposed to}} a developmental <b>dyslexia,</b> in previously literate adults as a consequence of a brain injury. However, recently, developmental deep <b>dyslexia</b> has also been reported in children with Williams syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Way was {{diagnosed}} with <b>dyslexia</b> {{at a young age}} and was told by his teachers he would never read or write however Way describes his <b>Dyslexia</b> as an advantage.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Castles and Coltheart {{describe}} developmental <b>dyslexia</b> as two prevalent {{and distinct}} varieties using the subtypes of Alexia (acquired <b>dyslexia),</b> Surface and Phonological <b>Dyslexia.</b> Understanding these subtypes {{is useful in}} diagnosing learning patterns and developing approaches for overcoming visual perception impairments or speech discrimination deficits. Cestnick and Coltheart (1999) demonstrated what these underlying deficits are in part, through unveiling different profiles of phonological versus surface dyslexics. Surface <b>Dyslexia</b> is characterized by subjects who can read known words but who have trouble reading words that are irregular. Phonological <b>Dyslexia</b> is characterized by subjects who can read aloud both regular and irregular words but have difficulties with non-words and with connecting sounds to symbols, or with sounding out words. Phonological processing tasks predict reading accuracy and comprehension. Cestnick and Jerger (2000) and Cestnick (2001) further demonstrated distinct processing differences between phonological and surface dyslexics. Manis et al. 1996, concluded that there were probably more than two subtypes of <b>dyslexia,</b> which would be related to multiple underlying deficits.|$|E
25|$|As of 2003, current {{models of}} the {{relation}} between the brain and <b>dyslexia</b> generally focus on some form of defective or delayed brain maturation. More recently, genetic research has provided increasing evidence supporting a genetic origin of <b>dyslexia.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Ziegler {{and colleagues}} {{claimed that the}} <b>dyslexia</b> {{suffered}} by German or Italian dyslexics {{is very similar to}} the one suffered by English dyslexics (readers of different—shallow versus deep orthographic systems), supporting the idea that the origin of <b>dyslexia</b> is mostly biological.|$|E
25|$|Cruise is {{an outspoken}} {{advocate}} for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, Mimi Rogers. Cruise struggled with <b>dyslexia</b> {{at an early age}} and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome <b>dyslexia.</b>|$|E

25|$|People with <b>dyslexia</b> {{generally}} {{suffer from}} a decreased reading speed, which {{can be caused by}} many different variables. There are many remedies to try and combat these deficits, depending on what biological theory of <b>dyslexia</b> they are based on. One such idea is based on magnocellular deficit, where magnocellular pathways are uncoordinated, causing the skipping or re-reading of lines.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Wydell and Butterworth {{reported}} {{the case study}} of an English-Japanese bilingual with monolingual <b>dyslexia.</b> Suggesting that any language where orthography-to-phonology mapping is transparent, or even , or any language whose orthographic unit representing sound is coarse (i.e. at a whole character or word level) should not produce {{a high incidence of}} developmental phonological <b>dyslexia,</b> and that orthography can influence dyslexic symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Whale {{has often}} spoken of his <b>dyslexia</b> {{and is a}} patron of the National Literacy Association.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, {{researchers}} Lyytinen et al. {{are searching}} for {{a link between the}} neurological and genetic findings, and the reading disorder. There are many previous and current theories of <b>dyslexia,</b> but one that has much support from research is that, whatever the biological cause, <b>dyslexia</b> is a matter of reduced phonological awareness, the ability to analyze and link the units of spoken and written languages.|$|E
25|$|Orton {{observed}} that reading deficits in <b>dyslexia</b> {{did not seem}} to stem from strictly visual deficits.|$|E

25|$|While the {{symptoms}} of deep <b>dyslexia</b> listed above are different and independent impairments of reading, it is rare to find an individual who only displays some {{of the characteristics of}} it; indeed, most patients presenting with semantic paralexias, a hallmark symptom of the disorder, also demonstrate all of the other symptoms. This has resulted in deep <b>dyslexia</b> being considered a symptom-complex and has led to much research into why this variety of symptoms may co-occur in so many patients.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2008, Wai Ting Siok et al. {{describe}} how <b>dyslexia</b> is language dependent, and especially between alphabetic and non-alphabetic writing systems.|$|E
