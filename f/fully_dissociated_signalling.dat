50|$|A {{strong acid}} {{is one that}} is <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> in aqueous solution. For example, {{hydrochloric}} acid, HCl, is a strong acid.|$|R
50|$|A {{strong base}} {{is one that}} is <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> in aqueous solution. For example, sodium hydroxide, NaOH, is a strong base.|$|R
50|$|The heat of {{neutralization}} of a <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> acid with a <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> base {{is approximately}} -56kJ/mol. The reaction is thus strongly exothermic, and is an excellent basis {{for a wide range}} of analysis in industry. An advantage for the industrial analyst is that the use of stronger titrants (1 to 2 mol/L) permits a reduction in the amount of sample preparation, and samples can often be directly and accurately dispensed into the titration vessel prior to titration.|$|R
5000|$|A weak {{electrolyte}} {{is one that}} is never <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> (i.e. there are a mixture of ions and complete molecules in equilibrium). In this case there is no limit of dilution below which the relationship between conductivity and concentration becomes linear. Instead, the solution becomes ever more <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> at weaker concentrations, and for low concentrations of [...] "well behaved" [...] {{weak electrolyte}}s, the degree of dissociation of the weak electrolyte becomes proportional to the inverse square root of the concentration.|$|R
30|$|The {{coupling}} {{between the}} proton conductivity and the Nafion relaxations {{can be understood}} considering the degree of dissociation of the protonic charges in fully hydrated Nafion. Previous reports offered some insight into this phenomenon [23]. The authors have shown that during the conductivity measurements at high relative humidity, a maximum of four water molecules are solvating the protonic charges, indicating that the protons are not <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> from sulfonic groups. As such, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that if charges are not <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> from sulfonic groups, the proton conduction must exhibit a dependence on both water content and chain motion.|$|R
5000|$|... as {{the acid}} and the base are <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> and neither the cation B+ nor the anion A− are {{involved}} in the neutralization reaction. The enthalpy change for this reaction is -57.62 kJ/mol at 25C.|$|R
2500|$|Potassium bromide, {{a typical}} ionic salt, is <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> and near pH 7 in aqueous solution. It {{serves as a}} source of bromide ions. This {{reaction}} is important for the manufacture of silver bromide for photographic film: ...|$|R
40|$|Purified {{lipopolysaccharide}} vesicles dissociate when {{treated with}} ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and then reassemble when dialyzed against Mg 2 +. Purified outer, lipopolysaccharide membrane (L membrane) is partially dissociated by treatment with EDTA and <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> upon further treatment with Triton X- 100. Both the partially and <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> L membrane can be reassembled by dialysis against Mg 2 +. Reassembly of lipopolysaccharide or L membrane {{in the presence}} of intact flagella results in specific attachment of flagellar basal bodies to vesicles via the L and sometimes the M ring. Lipopolysaccharide and L membrane appear to be composed of substructures bound together by both Mg 2 + (divalent cation) -mediated and hydrophobic bonds...|$|R
50|$|Weak {{electrolyte}}s. A {{weak electrolyte}} {{is one that}} is not <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated.</b> As such it has a dissociation constant. The dissociation constant can be used to calculate the extent of dissociation and hence, make the necessary correction needed to calculate activity coefficients.|$|R
25|$|Some salts are not <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> in solution. Examples include MgSO4, famously {{discovered}} by Manfred Eigen {{to be present}} in seawater as both an inner sphere complex and an outer sphere complex. The solubility of such salts is calculated by the method outlined in dissolution with reaction.|$|R
40|$|Compound A (CpdA), a plant-derived phenyl {{aziridine}} precursor, {{was recently}} {{characterized as a}} <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, acting via activation of the glucocorticoid receptor, thereby down-modulating nuclear factor-?B-mediated transactivation, but not supporting glucocorticoid response element-driven gene expression.

25|$|The {{modifier}} (aq) in {{this equation}} was implied by Arrhenius, rather than included explicitly. It {{indicates that the}} substances are dissolved in water. Though all three substances, HCl, NaOH and NaCl are capable of existing as pure compounds, in aqueous solutions they are <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> into the aquated ions H+, Cl−, Na+ and OH−.|$|R
25|$|Nitric acid is {{normally}} {{considered to be}} a strong acid at ambient temperatures. There is some disagreement over the value of the acid dissociation constant, though the pKa value is usually reported as less than −1. This means that the nitric acid in diluted solution is <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> except in extremely acidic solutions. The pKa value rises to 1 at a temperature of 250°C.|$|R
5000|$|The {{value of}} the heat {{capacity}} ratio here is between the 1.67 of <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> air molecules and the lower value for very hot diatomic air (1.2), and under conditions of an atomic fireball is (coincidentally) close to the S.T.P. (standard) gamma for room temperature air, which is 1.4. This gives the value of Taylor's S constant to be 1.036 for the adiabatic hypershock region where the constant R5/t2 condition holds.|$|R
5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|R
25|$|Phosphotungstic acid is {{the strongest}} of heteropolyacids. Its {{conjugate}} base is the PW12O403− anion. Its acidity in acetic acid has been investigated and shows that the three protons dissociate independently rather than sequentially, and the acid sites are of the same strength. One estimate of the acidity is that the solid has an acidity stronger than H0 =13.16, which would qualify the compound as a superacid. This acidic strength means that even at low pH the acid is <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated.</b>|$|R

40|$|Osmotic {{pressure}} in biological fluids {{is one of}} the most important physical values. Different solutions at the same temperature and the same concentration (activity) of ions have the same osmotic pressure. This means that a big molecule of protein for instance has the same osmotic effect as the small ion of sodium. Osmolality expresses the number of dissolved particles in a given weJght of solvent. The solution of one mole of each <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> compound has the. osmotic pressure of 22. 412 atm. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Useful {{parameters}} {{that can}} predict return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) {{in patients with}} cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) have not been established. We previously reported the usefulness of anion gap (AG) and albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) calculated from a blood sample obtained on arrival at the hospital for the prediction of ROSC. Otherwise, {{it has been reported}} that strong ion gap (SIG), which shows the difference between the levels of <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> cations and anions in the serum, is useful to predict the prognosis of critically ill patients...|$|R
40|$|The paper reports an {{experiment}} {{which is part}} of a program to measure the absolute values of the atomic photoionization cross sections of astrophysically abundant elements, particularly in stars and planetary atmospheres. An aerodynamic pressure-driven shock tube constructed from stainless steel with a quadratic cross section was used to measure the photoionization cross section of H I at 19 wavelength points from 910 to 609 A with experimental uncertainties between 7 and 20 %. The shock tube was used to produce <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> hydrogen and neon mixtures for the photoabsorption measurements...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the energy distribution function of the negative hydrogen ion H- in typical conditions for multicusp ion sources is presented. The case of H/H 2 mixture is studied by a Monte Carlo solution of the kinetic equation for H- transport. A simple analytical model is obtained for {{the case of a}} <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> H plasma and uniform reduced electric field (E/N). Results are in good agreement with the two-group distribution deduced from laser photodetachment experiments and explain the low energy group as an effect of the charge exchange collisions of negative ions with H atoms.

40|$|We perform {{large scale}} Quantum Monte Carlo {{simulations}} on dense liquid hydrogen system, namely employing long and equilibrated Molecular Dynamics simulations, using {{a large number}} of atoms, {{on a wide range of}} temperatures and pressures. We find that the transition from a molecular fluids towards a <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> one appears at higher pressures than previously believed, as we observe that a liquid with mixed atomic-paired character is stable over a wide range of pressures. The connection of this dissociative transition with the insulator to metal transition is also discussed and extensive tests on the accuracy of the method are reported...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a strong acid is {{hydrochloric}} acid, HCl, which has a pKa value, estimated from thermodynamic quantities, of −9.3 in water. The concentration of undissociated acid in a 1 M solution will be less than 0.01% of the concentrations of the products of dissociation. Hydrochloric acid {{is said to be}} <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> in aqueous solution because the amount of undissociated acid is imperceptible. When the pKa and analytical concentration of the acid are known, the extent of dissociation and pH of a solution of a monoprotic acid can be easily calculated using an ICE table.|$|R
40|$|A new plasma {{deposition}} {{technique is}} described. In this method a high density and strongly flowing argon plasma is admixed with monomers such as CH/sub 4 /, C/sub 2 /H/sub 2 /, SiH/sub 4 /, etc. Through effective charge transfer and dissociative recombination the ion charge {{is transferred to}} the <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> monomer fragments. As the to be deposited particles as C and Si have low ionization potentials they are preferably recharged. The method results in high deposition rates of a-C:H (up to 100 nm/s) and a-Si:H layers (30 nm/s). Properties of the layers are reviewed and a tentative model for plasma description is discusse...|$|R
40|$|We {{present for}} the first time the {{determination}} of molar conductances, Λ, of ionic liquids solutions (ILs) such as 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [emim][BF 4] and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [bmim][BF 4] as a function of temperature. The data was analyzed with Barthel’s lcCM model to obtain ionic association constants, KA, limiting molar conductances, Λo of these electrolytes. The examined ionic liquids are practically <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> in water over the whole temperature range (283. 15 to 318. 15 K). From the temperature dependence of the limiting molar conductivities the Eyring’s activation enthalpy of charge transport was determined. The Walden product values were also calculated...|$|R
50|$|As the {{recreational}} dosages used are always below the fully anaesthetic threshold and thus {{lower than those}} medically administered, the term 'overdose' needs to be seen a bit differentiated from other drugs. While with continued use, people may build up some degree of tolerance, leading {{to the use of}} higher dosages than medically advised, it is technically somewhat difficult to overdose on ketamine. An even higher dosage will just lead to full anaesthesia, amnesia, but no physical danger from the drug itself as long as the environment isn't dangerous. The user will become catatonic when <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated,</b> not experiencing any pain but also unable to move his/her body.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, steady {{improvements}} in organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance {{have been reported}} with power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching 9 %. Despite this rapid improvement, the mechanisms limiting the existing performance are not completely known; therefore {{a better understanding of}} the loss processes is necessary. In this respect a crucial role may be played by the charge transfer (CT) state, which is the intermediate state between the excitons and the <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> charges. In this review article we outline the dynamics of this intermediate state in light of their influence on the photovoltaic performance, with central emphasis on highly efficient polymer–fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells. ...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (S. Ghosal and Z. Chen Bull. Math. Biol. 2010, vol. 72, pg. 2047) {{it was shown}} that {{the evolution of the}} solute concentration in capillary electrophoresis is described by a nonlinear wave equation that reduced to Burger's equation if the nonlinearity was weak. It was assumed that only strong electrolytes (<b>fully</b> <b>dissociated)</b> were present. In the present paper it is shown that the same governing equation also describes the situation where the electrolytic buffer consists of a single weak acid (or base). A simple approximate formula is derived for the dimensionless peak variance which is shown to agree well with published experimental data. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} is {{not only}} excellent separation technique but it is often advantageously used for determination of physical-chemical parameters of compounds such as complexation constants of analyte and appropriate complexation agent. The most frequently used electrophoretic method for determination of complexation constants is affinity capillary electrophoresis. In the frame of this work the affinity capillary electrophoresis is used for determination of complexation constants of R and S enantiomers of flurbiprofen, particularly both its neutral and <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> form with neutral β- cyclodextrin. For this purpose we utilized classical method introduced in literature, where complexation constants are determined at two pHs, where analyte is <b>fully</b> and partially <b>dissociated,</b> respectively. Simultaneously, the complexation constants were observed by the new method based on multidimensional nonlinear regression, where all data measured at different pHs and β-cyclodextrin concentrations were utilized for evaluation. Results show that classical method can be highly confusing, especially if unsuitable pH is chosen for determination of stability constants of neutral form of analyte. Multidimensional regression method provides substantially more reliable data but with higher error of estimate [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Neutral coronae due to magnetospheric ion {{sputtering}} from the exobase are generated, and ion and neutral injection into the plasma torus are calculated, {{on the assumption}} {{of the existence of}} an atmosphere on Io and a consideration of that atmosphere's various possible characteristics. Through the inclusion of the sputtered atmospheric corona that emerges from an assumed unattenuated incident ion flux, it becomes possible to satisfy the supply rate to the torus with an exobase that is close to the surface; such an exobase would imply that the Io atmosphere is insufficiently robust to support a <b>fully</b> <b>dissociated</b> corona, and that a significant fraction of the incident plasma ions can penetrate to the surface to furnish a sputter source of atmospheric gas...|$|R
