2500|$|The Telegraph {{published}} {{an interview with}} Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, [...] "I begin to worry {{for a moment that}} Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fiction nerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross between James Brown, Judy Garland, André 3000 and Steve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." [...] She also compared Monáe to artists such as Annie Lennox, Lauryn Hill, and Corinne Bailey Rae. Her musical styles have been described as [...] "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz". The Guardian has noted some of her influences as: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Prince, Outkast, Erykah Badu, James Brown, Grace Jones, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Bernard Herrmann, Funkadelic and the Incredible String Band. Matthew Valnes likens her dancing style in the music video for [...] "Tightrope", to that of James Brown. In an opinion piece for The Quietus, John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within the Afrofuturism movement, pointing out her similarities to Sun Ra and George Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has stated that she has an alter-ego named Cindi Mayweather who according to Monáe is from the year 2719. In [...] she gave her alter-ego a back-story stating that she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human named Anthony Greendown. Monáe explained about Cindi, saying [...] "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>have-nots,</b> the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like the Archangel in the Bible, and what Neo represents to the Matrix." [...] In her second album, Cindi Mayweather returned to Earth to liberate Metropolitans from the Great Divide, an oppressive oligarchy that used time travel to [...] "suppress freedom and love". Chris Champion of The Observer described Metropolis and The ArchAndroid as [...] "psychedelic soul with a sci-fi twist". Matthew Valnes describes Monáe as innovating a more contemporary Neo-Afrofuturism, where her android role is used as a tool to critique the representation of Black female musicians in the funk genre. Funk music of the 1960's through the 1980's is a prevalent music style influencing Monáe. On the website for Monáe's Wondaland Arts Society Collective, they assert [...] "We believe there are only three forms of music; good music, bad music, and funk." [...] Monáe has also referred to herself as a [...] "funkstress".|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{popularly known as}} drones, impact the Westphalian {{sovereignty}} of those states in which the strikes are carried out. More broadly, the paper will investigate the wider implications drones have for an international system organised <b>and</b> based around <b>the</b> pillars of a Westphalian system of international relations. Territorial integrity and exclusion of external actors from a specific polity coupled with a monopoly of violence inside a certain territory are seen as {{the sine qua non}} elements of internal and external sovereignty. Analysing Westphalian sovereignty through the drone lens is important because the drone could act as a fundamental vehicle to analyse the state of affairs of the international system. The analysis conducted points to the drone as being the catalyst at the same time for a weakening <b>and</b> strengthening of <b>the</b> Westphalian state: a weakening for the states in which the strikes are carried out, and a strengthening for those states with UAVs capabilities which have dramatically expanded their reach to protect their citizens and project power in the international realm.

40|$|This paper reinterprets {{unpublished}} {{raw data}} collected between 1986 and 1989, {{at a time}} when <b>the</b> remote <b>and</b> regional populations of Australia were one of the last groups of settled people to receive broadcast television (and to a lesser extent, audible radio). Methodologically, the research was based on in-depth interviews with Western Australians carried out after a two-phase questionnaire survey - initially to Broome, Fitzroy Crossing, Homesteads and Gnowangerup, and Dianella, a metropolitan suburb (1987). The community groups involved were each representative of specific circumstance related by broadcast services. At the time of its Australia introduction, nationally-based satellite broadcasting was already more than a decade old in Canada. At one end of a consumer continuum remote WA responses to the introduction of AUSSAT broadcasts could be summarised as 2 ̆ 7 too little, too late, too expensive 2 ̆ 7. Across the range of participants, however, a nuanced picture can be constructed which indicates a mature response to the 2 ̆ 7 new 2 ̆ 7 ICt services.

Yet oddly enough, this injustice itself appeals rather to the comparative looker-on than to the heavily-handicapped players in person. They, poor creatures, dragging their log in patience, have grown so accustomed to regarding the world as another man's oyster, that they put up uncomplainingly {{for the most part}} with the most patent inequalities. Perhaps 'tis their want of imagination that makes them unable to conceive any other state of things as even possible--like the dog who accepts kicking as the natural fate of doghood. At any rate, you will find, if you look about you, that the chief reformers are not, as a rule, the ill-used classes themselves, but the sensitive and thinking souls who hate and loathe the injustice with which others are treated. Most of the best Radicals I have known were men of gentle birth and breeding. Not all: others, just as earnest, just as eager, just as chivalrous, sprang from the masses.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{economic}} development has received increasing attention since World War II, but for various reasons the conventional strategy of development has not resulted in a satisfactory standard of living {{for the majority of}} Third World states, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gap between <b>the</b> rich <b>and</b> poor nations <b>has</b> in most cases been growing wider. There were numerous attempts by the Third World to place the issue {{of economic development}} of the global agenda, but very little was accomplished. In the 1970 s the underdeveloped states increasingly called into question <b>the</b> reasoning, viability <b>and</b> fairness of accepted economic development strategies and made escalating demands for a radical restructuring of the entire international economic order. In 1974 the UN General Assembly held its first special session devoted to economic problems, and out of this came <b>the</b> Declaration <b>and</b> Action Programme on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order (NIEO). ^ The NIEO demands do not call for minor adjustments in the international economic order; rather, they demand a complete overhaul <b>and</b> restructuring of <b>the</b> system in order to place an emphasis on development and to ensure that immediate steps will be taken to achieve more equitable economic relations between <b>the</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>have-not</b> nations. ^ Recent trends in thinking in the developed states have begun to concentrate on the so-called basic human needs strategy as a possible solution to the problems of the 2 ̆ 2 poorest of the poor, 2 ̆ 2 i. e., those people within all developing countries who live in abject, chronic poverty <b>and</b> who <b>have</b> thus far been largely unaffected by development strategies. Basic needs are considered the minimum standard of living which a society should set for the poorest groups of its people. The basic human needs strategy would attempt a direct attack on poverty [...] as opposed to the traditional reliance on 2 ̆ 2 trickle-down. 2 ̆ 2 It would assign first priority to meeting certain minimum human requirements for jobs, food, shelter, and clothing, as well as to providing access to basic health, education and other services to all people. Basic needs would then consist of certain minimum requirements of a family for private consumption [...] adequate food, shelter, and clothing, as well as certain household equipment and furniture; and essential services provided by <b>and</b> for <b>the</b> community at large, such as safe drinking water, sanitation, public transport and health, educational and cultural facilities. ^ While the views of the Third World toward the NIEO are well known, no one has yet attempted to systematically ascertain what the political leadership in the developing nations thinks of the basic need strategy. The purpose of this research is to document <b>and</b> measure <b>the</b> attitudes held by the political leadership in Third World states toward the basic needs strategy. The findings reveal that while the Third World states accept many of the individual aspects of the strategy, they have a fundamental suspicion <b>and</b> hostility toward <b>the</b> strategy as a whole. Southern leaders reject the strategy as a First World attempt to maintain the present international hierarchy of states, sidestep more fundamental reform and as a ruse for continued intervention in their economies. This seems to at least partially indicate that the Third World elites are more concerned with inequalities among states than within states. It also may well mean that the basic needs strategy is destined to fail. ...|$|R

40|$|I {{believe that}} whoever owns {{a house in}} these times is wealthy. I wish I could own a house and not pay this rent. (2) The impact of global {{restructuring}} of the economy on the social geography {{of the city is}} twofold: at one extreme the pattern of stratification has changed with the emergence of new social layer of high-level professionals working in <b>the</b> finance sector <b>and</b> specialized services, at the other, there has been an increase in the informal, causal low-skilled, low-paid labour. The extreme inequality of the new era can distinguish itself with its magnitude in both social <b>and</b> spatial terms. <b>The</b> measurement of class-based inequality has been generally incorporated with income and earnings produced {{as a consequence of the}} sphere of production, i. e. labour market. The role of the household in the labour market is accepted as the main factor in determining the level of welfare and standard of living. However, in actuality, the factors that identify the income inequality cannot be limited by the sphere of production. There is common consensus that a social grouping identified by the sphere of reproduction (consumption) and exchange mechanism is needed for fully-fledge stratification and class analysis. This paper tries to show that not just income, but also the sphere of social reproduction including the housing dimension, has to be incorporated in the measurement of the deep social divide that exists between <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots.</b> <b>The</b> objective here is to discuss the criterion employed in the measurement of class based segregation in urban structure.

40|$|In Kansas Charley: The Story of a Nineteenth Century Boy Murderer, Joan Jacobs Brumberg {{analyzes}} {{the issues involved}} in capital punishment of juvenile offenders through the case study of Charley Miller, a teenager who committed a double murder and was executed in Wyoming in 1892. Brumberg portrays Miller as the pitiable product of a consumerist society that drew harsh distinctions between <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots.</b> <b>The</b> media, fascinated by violence resulting from the abuse of alcohol and weapons, helped shape public perceptions of how to punish youthful offenders. While Miller 2 ̆ 7 s case was far from typical, it still reflects problems with juvenile justice in America from the nineteenth century to the present. Orphaned at age six, Miller spent his adolescence at the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Aid Society of New York where he was frequently punished because of continuing bed wetting. He eagerly absorbed dime novels promoting violence and masculinity and, after an unsuccessful placement with a Minnesota farm family, began to crisscross {{the country on the}} rails. Gang-raped by a group of hobos in a boxcar near Omaha, Miller was so scared he bought a gun for protection. Soon after, when a couple of middleclass young men tramping on a lark rejected his overtures of friendship, a destitute and intoxicated Miller shot them in the head as they slept and stole some of their valuables. After a sensational three-day trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming, whose media coverage garnered him national attention, Miller was convicted of first-degree murder. A year and a half later, the seventeen-year-old was hanged despite repeated pleas for clemency from various groups. Brumberg effectively contextualizes Miller 2 ̆ 7 s story within the history of <b>the</b> state, region, <b>and</b> country. His case reveals the anxieties over industrialization and growing class divisions that affected all Americans, even those in rural areas. For instance, in the same year that Miller perpetrated his crime, persistent disputes between big operators and small-scale cattle ranchers erupted into armed conflict in Wyoming in what 2 ̆ 7 s {{come to be known as}} the Johnson County War.

Kelsey, Nikki, <b>and</b> Raul were <b>the</b> <b>Have-Nots</b> for <b>the</b> week. On Day 43, Maddy nominated Jared and Kelsey for eviction. On Day 44, Maddy, Jared, Kelsey, Nikki, Cassandra, and Raul scrapped in the Six Blind Mice Power of Veto competition. In this competition, HouseGuests had to crawl through a maze blindfolded while trying to reach each of the corners of the maze. In each corner, they need to dig up a circle, triangle, square, and star emblem out of a sand pit. The first HouseGuest to find all four emblems <b>and</b> hit <b>the</b> button {{in the center of the}} maze will win the Power of Veto. Jared won the Power of Veto. On Day 45, the HouseGuests were given the task to clean the House within 20 minutes. The HouseGuests passed their task and earned a pizza party. On Day 46, Jared took himself off <b>the</b> block, <b>and</b> Maddy named Raul as the replacement nominee. On Day 47, the HouseGuests were tasked with creating the best meme. Tim made <b>the</b> best meme <b>and</b> received a $1000 gift card from the Brick. On Day 49, Raul was evicted by a 6-1 vote, with Tim voting to evict Kelsey.|$|R

5000|$|In 2006, {{after having}} {{an excerpt from}} it {{published}} in the Atlantic, she released Hothouse Kids: The Dilemma of the Gifted Child, a book that examines the cultures of extreme child-rearing {{that can be found}} across the U.S. that puts heavy emphasis on early achievement. Quart turns a skeptical eye on the growing genius-building business that includes the Baby Einstein videos, the Scripps National Spelling Bee, and IQ tests. In a book that Publishers Weekly called [...] "first class literary journalism," [...] she paints a somber picture of what the life of a child prodigy really looks like. Along with social isolation that comes with obsessive interests, from soccer from three-year-olds to preaching to knitwear entrepreneurship, the hothouse kid is burdened by a premature emphasis on maturity and professionalism. Quart dubs this conflation of childhood, commerce and competition, the Baby Genius Edutainment Complex, which [...] "reflects a faith that if babies are exposed to enough stimulating multimedia content... bright children can be invented." [...] Quart — herself a gifted youngster who discussed modernist painting at age 5 and wrote her first novel at 7 — discovers, for every well-adjusted math wunderkind who transitions smoothly into a financial service wiz, there are two prodigies whose adult lives never live up to their parents' fantasies. Quart also confronts the fact that students who are stressed out by too many extracurricular gigs remain a tiny, privileged minority in a country where gifted programs are being gutted from public schools, and the minimal mandates of No Child Left Behind have driven the divide between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>have-nots</b> even wider.|$|E
5000|$|The Telegraph {{published}} {{an interview with}} Monáe, talking about her first studio album, in which the journalist Bernadette McNulty said, [...] "I begin to worry {{for a moment that}} Monáe may not just be a humourless science-fiction nerd, but actually an android herself, created in a laboratory as a super-musical cross between James Brown, Judy Garland, André 3000 and Steve Jobs, invented to test the desperate incredulity of music journalists." [...] She also compared Monáe to artists such as Annie Lennox, Lauryn Hill, and Corinne Bailey Rae. Her musical styles have been described as [...] "a soaring orchestral trip enlivened with blockbuster vocals, mysterious imagery and notes of Sixties pop and jazz." [...] The Guardian has noted some of her influences as: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Prince, Outkast, Erykah Badu, James Brown, Grace Jones, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix, Bernard Herrmann, Funkadelic and the Incredible String Band. In an opinion piece for The Quietus, John Calvert places Janelle Monáe within the Afrofuturism movement, pointing out her similarities to Sun Ra and George Clinton. He asserts that Janelle Monáe is innovating the genre. Monáe has stated that she has an alter-ego named Cindi Mayweather who according to Monáe is from the year 2719. In her first EP she gave her alter-ego a back-story stating that she was on the run after breaking the law in her home town of Metropolis by falling in love with a human named Anthony Greendown. Monáe explained about Cindi, saying [...] "The Archandroid, Cindi, is the mediator, between the mind and the hand. She's the mediator between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>have-nots,</b> the oppressed and the oppressor. She's like the Archangel in the Bible, and what Neo represents to the Matrix." [...] Chris Champion of The Observer described Metropolis and The ArchAndroid as [...] "psychedelic soul with a sci-fi twist".|$|E
50|$|The {{illustration}} on page 87 shows a {{young black}} male, {{appears to be no}} older than 16 and is filled with vibrant colors consisting of yellow, blue, green, and orange. Toyin herself says that, “this piece actually speaks of identity and how malleable it is. It's not something that you can really pin point with certainty, its very kind of…suspect I think” (Odutola Shaiman Gallery). This image follows a heavy chapter about Hurricane Katrina, the killings of Trayvon Martin, Mark Duggan, James Anderson, as well as {{a detailed description of the}} infamous Zinedine Zidane head-butt. This chapter included the struggles that the black community as a whole underwent during the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Rankine uses a quote from a local person present in New Orleans during the hurricane, “…it was the classic binary between the rich and the poor, between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>have-nots,</b> between the whites and the blacks, in the difficulty of all that” (Citizen, Pg. 83). The glare which resonates from the young boy’s eyes suggests an overwhelming sense of hopelessness and distress similar to the majority of the black population; however, the boy’s conscious decision to keep his chin elevated suggests that he has an optimistic view of life yet. The chapter touched upon an entire community of people feeling as if they were the last to be saved in an emergency situation, if at all. Another survivor on the scene stated, “We never reached out to anyone to tell our story, because there’s no ending to our story, he said. Being honest with you, in my opinion, they forgot about us” (Citizen, Pg. 84). “I don’t know what the water wanted. It wanted to show you no one would come. He said, I don’t know what the water wanted. As if then and now were not the same moment”(Citizen, Pg. 84). In a separate yet very close analysis and comparison of this illustration, Toyin Odutola created this picture and placed a multitude of muted colors versus brighter, more iridescent colors to illustrate the creative energy channels flowing through the young boy’s body. These channels represent the many experiences that he has gone through, both conscious and unconscious. The dark background also emphasizes the vibrant colors, forcing the viewer to strain their eyes, just as this boy has had to do growing up with no standard model to interpret his experiences. The illustration creates an almost stained glass affect, exhibiting the variations of the boy’s experiences thus far. Further thought brings you even deeper into the idea that these colors represent the more or less tarnished parts of the boy’s view of the world and himself.|$|E
