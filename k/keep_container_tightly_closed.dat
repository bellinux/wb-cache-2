Pressure-mediated ELISA (PELISA), carried out in 1 h shows more than a 2 -fold increase in absorbance value than the control experiment carried out {{at the same time and}} temperature without applying pressure. Estimation of analyte by the 1 -h PELISA method gives similar absorbance value to that obtained by 3 -h heat-mediated ELISA (HELISA) on an activated surface. As PELISA is sensitive, specific, and reproducible, it could be an excellent alternative to HELISA or conventional ELISA procedure. ### Introduction The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique is the back-bone of the diagnostic assay for detection of infectious and allergic diseases. Conventional ELISA is a time-consuming 18 h procedure. Earlier, we have shown that photoactivated microtiter plate (1) can reduce ELISA timing to around 7. 5 hours by binding an antigen or antibody by covalent bond rather than adsorption (2). We have further shortened the ELISA timings to around 3 h by doing it at higher incubation temperature on an activated polystyrene microtiter plate with results comparable to conventional ELISA carried out in 18 h (3). In this protocol, we reported a novel and rapid method for ELISA technique in which ELISA steps are carried out in one hour under pressure (4). ### Materials 1. 1 -fluoro- 2 -nitro- 4 -azidobenzene (FNAB, IUPAC nomenclature: 4 -azido- 1 -fluoro- 2 -nitrobenzene) can be purchased from Apollo scientific ltd, UK (cat no. 248 - 878 - 6). Alternatively, it can be made from 4 -fluoro- 3 -nitroaniline by a simple diazotization reaction as described earlier (1, 5) CAUTION. FNAB is explosive and should be handled with care, especially when using large quantities. We did not encounter any untoward incident while working with FNAB in last 12 years. - Polystyrene microtiter plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Germany). - Anti-human IgG, (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. I 3382) CAUTION Store all reagents at 2 - 8 ºC. If slight turbidity occurs upon prolonged storage clarify the solution by centrifugation before use. - Human IgG, (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. I 4506). - Anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate, (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. A 8419). - Rabbit IgG, (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. I 4508) - Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Sigma (USA). CRITICAL BSA solution should be filtered prior to use to avoid microbial contamination. - o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD), (Sigma Aldrich, USA cat. no. P 1526). Store in cool place. Recommended storage temperature: - 20 °C; <b>Keep</b> <b>container</b> <b>tightly</b> <b>closed.</b> CAUTION Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Avoid formation of dust and aerosols. - Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was prepared by mixing 0. 85 % Sodium chloride to 0. 01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7. 2). To make 0. 01 M phosphate buffer add 1. 217 g disodium phosphate, 0. 379 g monosodium phosphate. Add distilled water to make 1 liter solution. - Washing buffer was made by adding 0. 1 % Tween 20 to PBS. - Substrate -dye buffer was prepared by mixing 12 ml of citrate buffer (0. 025 M citric acid and 0. 05 M sodium phosphate dibasic, pH 5), 5 µl of hydrogen peroxide (30 % w/v), and 4 mg of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. - Stop Solution- 5 % sulphuric acid ### Equipment 1. Refrigerator (Godrej, India) - UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, USA) - Polystyrene microtiter plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Germany) - ELISA reader (Biorad iMark™ Microplate Reader, USA). - Pressure cooker (Hawkins Cookers Ltd., Mumbai, India). - 1 -m pressure tube made of natural rubber having i. d. 6 mm and o. d. 16 mm (Local supplier, Delhi, India) - Pressure gauge (Laser Gasses India, New Delhi, India) - Laboratory cylinder filled with argon gas (Laser Gasses India, New Delhi, India) ### Procedure 1. Activation of polystyrene surface The wells of a polystyrene plate were activated by coating with FNAB followed by photoactivation by UV light for 15 min at a wavelength of 365 nm as described (1). - CRITICAL We have decreased UV exposure time for activation of microtiter plate from 20 minutes to 15 minutes without any significant difference in results. 2. Designing of a pressure incubator Pressure incubator was designed from a 5 -L pressure cooker (Domestic kitchen pressure cooker, Hawkins Cookers Ltd., Mumbai, India). The pressure regulator (vent weight) from the lid was removed and one end of a 1 -m pressure tube (or laboratory high vacuum tube) was inserted through the vent pipe of the pressure cooker; the other end of the tube was connected to a three-way connector. One of the outlays of the connector is connected to a pressure gauge through a rubber tube and further connected to a laboratory argon cylinder. Third outlay of the connector was used for release of excess pressure and also release of pressure after each ELISA step. All PELISA steps were carried out inside the pressure incubator. 3. Detection of analyte - PELISA steps in the pressure incubator In the activated and untreated wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate capture molecule (anti-human IgG) was added and the plate was kept inside the pressure incubator. The pressure cooker was closed and a pressure of 1. 5 × 105 Pa was applied by opening the gas cylinder. In this pressure the plate was kept for 10 minutes after which the pressure was released. During this time capture molecule was immobilized in the activated and untreated wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate. After wshing, blocking was carried out similarly by applying pressure of 1. 5 × 105 Pa for 10 minutes. After the stipulated time period, the pressure was released and the plate was washed by washing buffer. Binding of analyte was carried out by adding the analyte to the wells and incubating the plate inside the pressure incubator 20 minutes by applying pressure of 2 × 105 Pa. Binding of secondary antibody-conjugate was also carried out similarly by applying pressure of 2 × 105 Pa for 20 minutes. After all the four ELISA steps were carried out inside the pressure incubator, the color development was done by adding 100 µl of substrate- dye buffer at room temperature outside pressure cooker. Color development was stopped by adding 20 µl of 5 % sulfuric acid and absorbance was recorded at 490 nm. - CRITICAL - CAUTION Pressure must be carefully monitored. Excess pressure may lead to explosion. Applying and release of pressure should be slow/ gradual and should not be abrupt. ### Timing 1. Activation of polystyrene surface –approx. 25 minutes - a) Coating of FNAB to polystyrene surface 5 - 10 minutes - b) UV light exposure- 15 minutes - c) Washing and drying – 5 minutes - Detection of Analyte – 1 hour + washing time after each step - a.) Immobilization of capture molecule (0. 25 μg/ 100 μL 0. 01 M carbonate buffer, pH 9. 6 /well) onto the photoactivated surface- 10 minutes by applying pressure of 150000 Pa (0. 15 megapascals) - b.) Blocking (200 µl/ well of 2 % BSA) - 10 minutes by applying pressure of 150000 Pa (0. 15 megapascals) - c.) Incubation of analyte (0. 25 μg/ 100 μL 0. 01 M PBS, pH 7. 2 /well) - 20 minutes by applying pressure of 200000 Pa (0. 20 megapascals) - d.) Incubation time of secondary antibody – enzyme conjugate (100 μLof 1 : 5000 v/v dilution /well) – 20 minutes by applying pressure of 200000 Pa (0. 20 megapascals). ### Anticipated Results - Pressure-mediated ELISA showed 2 - 3 -fold increase in absorbance value than control experiment carried out in the same time and temperature without applying pressure (fig 1). - PELISA is as good as 18 -h conventional ELISA or 3 -h HELISA. - PELISA is found to reduce assay time to 1 h without affecting specificity or sensi-tivity and could be a good substitute for immunoassay procedures widely used in clinical and research laboratories. ### References 1.

40|$|Authors: Sandeep Kumar Vashist ### Abstract We {{report a}} highly-sensitive chemiluminescent {{immunoassay}} (CIA) {{for the detection}} of human fetuin A (HFA), which is based on the leach-proof covalent crosslinking of anti-HFA capture antibodies on 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) -functionalized 96 -well chemiluminescent microtiter plates (CMTP) using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide. It has more than 3 -fold reduced overall assay duration than the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, it has a wide detection range i. e. 0. 3 pg/mL- 20 ng/mL and 125 -fold better analytical sensitivity than the commercial ELISA kit. The anti-HFA antibody-bound MTPs can be effectively stored in 0. 1 M PBS without any significant loss of functional activity. The developed HFA CIA is multisubstrate-compatible and can be employed for immunoassays {{on a wide range of}} commercially-relevant substrates that are being used in various biosensors/point-of-care diagnostics. ### Introduction The development of a robust, rapid and highly-sensitive immunoassay format for the precise detection of HFA is an absolute requirement for clinical disease diagnosis. HFA is a highly specific biomarker for atherosclerosis (1) and hepatocellular carcinoma (2), which is also involved in diabetes (3), cardiovascular diseases (4), arthritis, metabolism-associated syndrome (5), and malaria 6. It is a liver-derived protein that is secreted into the bloodstream in the concentration range of 450 - 600 µg/mL. The concentration of HFA changes significantly in various pathophysiological conditions (1, 7 - 9). Several immunoassay formats have been developed till date for HFA detection, which were mainly based on ELISA (10 - 11), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (12), microarray (13), and electrochemical luminescence (6). However, ELISA is still the most widely used format and the accepted clinical standard for HFA detection. But in recent years, several highly-sensitive chemiluminescent substrates, having wide detection range and improved analytical sensitivity, have been developed (14). The developed CIA (15), being the most sensitive immunoassay format for HFA detection in comparison to ELISA and SPR, can have potential applications in clinical diagnostics. APTES has been widely used for the leach-proof immobilization of biomolecules (16 - 19) as it enables high immobilization density, long-term stability, high reproducibility, and less biofouling. It has been extensively employed for the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems (20 - 22). In the present study, the covalent crosslinking of antibodies in a leach-proof manner on APTES-functionalized bioanalytical platform leads to higher functional antibody immobilization density that results in highly sensitive analyte detection. ### Reagents 1.

Wash the APTES-modified wells extensively with DIW (as described in step 1). **Antibody immobilization and BSA blocking (TIMING 1 h 30 min) ** 3. Mix 5 µL each of EDC (8 mg/mL) SulfoNHS (22 mg/mL) to make 10 µL of pre-mixed EDC-SulfoNHS solution. **CRITICAL STEP** The ratio of EDC and SulfoNHS is critical for optimum cross-linking. **? TROUBLESHOOTING** 4. Incubate 990 μL of anti-HFA capture antibody with 10 μL of EDC-SulfoNHS solution for 15 min at 37 ºC. 5. Incubate the EDC-SulfoNHS activated antibody in APTES-functionalized wells for 1 h at 37 ºC and|$|R
50|$|In {{the months}} of October and November, during the harvest of the first broad mustard, mustard green, radish and {{cauliflower}} leaves, large quantities of leaves accumulate — much more than can be consumed fresh. These leaves are allowed to wilt {{for one or two}} days and then shredded with a knife or sickle.Not only the leaves of the radish, the roots are also used to make a better quality gundruk. The roots of radish can be mixed with the leaves and smashed together. When it is smashed, care should be taken not to make pieces too small. In mountainous regions of central part of Nepal, the smashed radish and leaves are put into an earthenwares, compressed, and the mouth of <b>container</b> is <b>closed</b> <b>tightly.</b> It is then buried in safe and sunny place. It may be placed in an open place. After a few days, the acidity can be tasted or when it is ready, it can readily be known from its smell as well.It is then dried in sunlight. Thus made gundruk is more tasty, more flavorous and more acidic.|$|R
