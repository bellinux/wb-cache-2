40|$|In {{this study}} we present the results of arsenic {{concentration}} in water samples from public water supply system of city Zrenjanin and three Northern municipalities <b>Elemiš,</b> Taraš and Melenci taken every month during 2002, 2007 and 2011. Total arsenic content was determined using AAS technique with hydride generation system. Determined levels of arsenic in all investigated samples were more than 10 {{times higher than the}} maximum permissible limit recommended by WHO (10 μg/L) and even reached levels higher than 300 μg/L. During 2011 drinking water from 44 pump wells in Zrenjanin was also analyzed showing that more than 50 % of pump wells contain more than 10 μg As/L. These findings can be explained by geological characteristics of Northern region of Serbia belonging to Pannonian Basin which has aquifers that contain high concentration of naturally occurring arsenic. Results suggest that arsenic levels in this Serbian region are even higher than in other countries in the Pannonian Basin. Having in mind profound deleterious effects of arsenic on human health, different social, economical and technological measures are required in order to reduce arsenic concentration to acceptable limits...|$|R

50|$|<b>Elemi</b> resin is chiefly used commercially in {{varnishes}} and lacquers, {{and certain}} printing inks. It {{is used as}} a herbal medicine to treat bronchitis, catarrh, extreme coughing, mature skin, scars, stress, and wounds. The constituents include phellandrene, limonene, elemol, elemicin, terpineol, carvone, and terpinolene.|$|E
50|$|Elemicin is a {{constituent}} of the oleoresin and the essential oil of Canarium luzonicum (also {{referred to as}} <b>elemi).</b> Elemicin is named after this tree. One study found it to comprise 2.4% of the fresh essential oil. Elemicin is also present in the oils of the spices nutmeg and mace, with it comprising 2.4% and 10.5% of those oils respectively.|$|E
50|$|The hard {{transparent}} resins, {{such as the}} copals, dammars, mastic, and sandarac, are principally {{used for}} varnishes and adhesives, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins (frankincense, <b>elemi,</b> turpentine, copaiba), and gum resins containing essential oils (ammoniacum, asafoetida, gamboge, myrrh, and scammony) are more used for therapeutic purposes and incense. The resin of the Aleppo Pine is used to flavour retsina, a Greek resinated wine.|$|E
50|$|Gambier Parry {{developed}} a spirit medium {{for use on}} a specially prepared plaster or canvas ground and in 1862 he published his recipe. Originally it used beeswax, oil of spike lavender, spirits of turpentine, <b>elemi</b> resin and copal varnish, and was complex both in preparing the wall surface and applying the paint. With commercialisation the process was simplified and became widely known.|$|E
5000|$|Most resin or [...] "gum" [...] {{varnishes}} {{consist of}} a natural, plant- or insect-derived substance dissolved in a solvent, called spirit varnish or solvent varnish. The solvent may be alcohol, turpentine, or petroleum-based. Some resins are soluble in both alcohol and turpentine. Generally, petroleum solvents, i.e. mineral spirits or paint thinner, can substitute for turpentine. The resins include amber, dammar, copal, rosin, sandarac, <b>elemi,</b> benzoin, mastic, balsam, shellac, and a multitude of lacquers.|$|E
50|$|The word <b>elemi</b> {{has been}} used at various times to denote {{different}} resins. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the term usually denoted a resin from trees of the genus Icica in Brazil, and before that it meant the resin derived from Boswellia frereana. The word, like the older term animi, {{appears to have been}} derived from enhaemon (εναιμον): the name of a styptic medicine said by Pliny to contain tears exuded by the olive tree of Arabia.|$|E
50|$|Some resins when soft {{are known}} as 'oleoresins', and when {{containing}} benzoic acid or cinnamic acid they are called balsams. Oleoresins are naturally occurring mixtures of an oil and a resin; they can be extracted from various plants. Other resinous products in their natural condition are a mix with gum or mucilaginous substances and known as gum resins. Several natural resins are used as ingredients in perfumes, e.g., balsams of Peru and tolu, <b>elemi,</b> styrax, and certain turpentines.|$|E
50|$|It {{was opened}} in 1926 {{as a result}} of Róbert Szieberth’s idea. At the {{beginning}} it was called People’s Elementary School of Ullmann-telep Ullmann-telepi Állami <b>Elemi</b> Népiskola and it was housed at the building of current nursery school. Here were two classrooms in the first three years. It had 56, 120 and 181 students in 2, 4 and 6 classes respectively. Szieberth was the one, who proposed the building of the current building of the school. Since 1930 the school is also gets the name of the street where it is located.|$|E
50|$|Resins {{that are}} used in {{varnishes}} include amber, kauri gum, dammar, copal, rosin (pine resin), sandarac, balsam, <b>elemi,</b> mastic, and others. Shellac is also a resin. In the 1900s in Canada, resins from local trees were used to finish pianos. As a result, these now antique pianos are considered difficult to refinish. However, shellac can be used over the existing resins provided sufficient time is allowed for thin coats to cure. Thus the original finish can be returned to its original lustre while preserving the color and age-related crackle.|$|E
50|$|The {{trunks of}} Amyris species exude <b>elemi,</b> {{a type of}} balsam (oleoresin) that {{contains}} elemic acids, liquid sesquiterpenes, and triterpenes such as α- and β-amyrin among other components. It is used medicinally and in lacquers. The wood is often used for torches and firewood. Its high resin content causes it to burn brightly, and it will burn well even when green. In addition, the wood is hard, heavy, close-grained, can take a high polish, and repels dry wood termites. Essential oils containing caryophyllene, cadinene, and cadinol are extracted from A. balsamifera and A. elemifera. These are used in varnishes, perfumes, medicines, cosmetics, soaps, and incense.|$|E
50|$|MoiMoi is {{prepared}} by first soaking the beans {{in cold water}} until they are soft enough to remove the fine outer covering or peel. Then they are ground or blended (using a blender) until a fine paste is achieved. Salt, bouillon cube, dried crayfish, vegetable oil (or any edible oil such as palm oil) and other seasonings are added to taste. Some add sardines, corned beef, sliced boiled eggs, {{or a combination of}} these and other 'garnishes' to liven up MoiMoi. Such is referred to as having 'x' number of lives, 'x' representing the number of garnishes added. The most touted is MoiMoi <b>elemi</b> meje, which translates to Moi Moi with 7 lives.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} heat {{processing}} on the proximate composition and energy {{values of the}} seed kernel flours of African walnut AWand pulps of African <b>elemi</b> AE used as traditional snacks {{in most parts of}} Nigeria were investigated. In the AW values of moisture ash crude fibre and carbohydrate decreased from raw to heat treated samples while those of crude protein and crude fat generally increased. The increase or decrease in these values was not significant at the 5 level. For instance ash decreased from 6. 051. 71 in AWraw to 5. 450. 86 in AW 135. Crude fat was highest in AW 45 52. 82. 70 followed by AW 90 51. 71. 61 and was lowest in AWraw 49. 81. 08 while calorific value was highest in AW 45 612. 211. 7 followed by AW 90 609. 36. 23 and lowest in AWraw 593. 46. 75. Similar trends were observed in proximate composition of raw and macerated African <b>elemi</b> pulp flour and values between raw and heat processed samples did not generally differ significantly Pamp 7070. 05. In AWrawthe percentage crude protein crude fat and then energy value in kcal 100 g- 1 sample were 26. 2 49. 8 and 593. 4 respectively while in AEraw values were 14. 6 41. 9 and 568. 6 respectively. It can be concluded that both AW and AE are oil-rich seeds and pulps good nutrient sources that could contribute to the total protein ash and energy requirements of humans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Natural resins were {{frequently}} employed as adhesives or as components of oleo-resinous media in {{paintings in the}} past. The identification of vegetable resins is still an open problem. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze by GC-MS some vegetable resins frequently employed in paintings, such as Venice turpentine, dammar, copal, <b>elemi</b> in order to identify their main component in raw and aged samples. Some molecules are proposed as chemical “ markers ” to identify these natural resins. Results The results obtained on standards allowed us to successfully analyze sample collected from one work of art: the Madonna with the Infant and Angels by Antonello da Messina (XV century). Conclusion The results obtained confirm that the painting the artist originally used a mixture of linseed oil and natural resin (Venice turpentine) as binding medium. </p...|$|E
30|$|Geographically, {{the area}} {{falls within the}} {{rainforest}} in the southwestern part of Nigeria. The topography is generally undulating with most area lying above 250  m above sea level. The landscape is characterized by old plains, broken steep-sided outcrop dome rocks (Inselbergs) that may occur singularly or in crops of ridges. Such outcrops exist mainly in form of rugged hills at Ado-Ekiti (central part of study area) and Ikere-Ekiti in the southern part. The study area lies within the tropical climatic zone, characterized by alternating wet and dry season and drained by rivers such <b>Elemi,</b> Ureje, Ose, Ogbesse and their seasonal network of tributary and streams forming a somewhat dendritic drainage pattern (Fig.  1). The wet season was from April to October, dominated by heavy rainfall, while the dry season was from November to March. The mean annual rainfall was about 1, 500  mm while the mean annual temperature ranged from 25 to 30  °C.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that seeds and fruits but for their content of antinutrients could offer a cheap means of providing adequate nutrients to their consumer. The effect of processing on antinutrients contents of the pulp of African <b>elemi</b> AE Canarium schweinfurthii and kernel of African walnut AW Plukenetia conophora consumed as traditional snacks masticatories in Nigeria were investigated. The levels of the antinutrients in raw samples of the traditional snacks as well as their corresponding residual levels in samples subjected to graded doses of heat treatment were evaluated using standard methods. Saponins alkaloids cyanogenic glycosides and oxalate were obtained in both samples while AE contained tannins and flavonoids in addition. The concentrations of saponins 1. 000. 19 and flavonoids 14. 982. 91 in raw AE and saponins 1. 050. 13 in AW were increased by the processing methods. The rest of the antinutrients were decreased in both samples. The effects on saponins and oxalate became significant p 0. 05 as the processing time was increased. The plant foods with respect to the tolerable limits of the antinutrients could therefore be considered safe for human consumption at all levels of processing...|$|E
30|$|Canarium {{is a large}} genus in the Burseraceae family, {{consisting}} of around seventy-seven species, stretching from the African tropics across to Indo-Malaysia [15]. It {{is of particular interest}} in Papua New Guinea, a native home of Canarium luzonicum, which produces the commercially important Manila <b>Elemi,</b> used around the world for varnishes, ointments and aromatherapy. Canarium resin is used locally in Papua New Guinea for different purposes including caulking boats, making torches, and making tonics. Canarium indicum {{is referred to as the}} canarium nut tree because of its nut-like fruits [15] and in the Solomon Islands C. indicum is known as the Canarum almond for the same reason, as is C. salomonense and C. harveyi. McClatchey et al. [20] also notes a spiritual importance of C. salomonense in the northwest Solomon Islands, over other species including C. indicum, which is also commonly used in the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. They found that C. salomonense held more importance than C. indicum not because it was more important as a food resource (C. indicum nuts were eaten more often) but because C. salomonense trees were considered ‘sacred’. “Generally, C. salomonense is viewed as a critical resource but C. indicum can serve as a substitute in some but not all situations” [20] and McClatchey et al. noted that there was much more discrimination between use and importance of the species’ for healing, religious/ceremonial/ritualistic occasions, warfare, food storage/harvest/preparation and property ownership in favour of C. salomonense.|$|E
40|$|Fatty acid {{composition}} of plant food oil {{is important for}} its economic and nutritional value. Assessment of fatty acid contents of two Nigerian masticatories cum traditional snacks African walnut kernel AW and African <b>elemi</b> pulp AE were carried out. Samples were subjected to graded wet heat contact time based on their traditional methods of processing and their oil extract evaluated for fatty acid FA contents using chromatographic method. The processing methods had no statistically significant effect on both the oil and FA contents of the samples. Both samples contain nutritionally relevant levels of fat ranging respectively from 49. 81. 08 to 52. 82. 70 g 100 g sample and 41. 936. 03 to 42. 84. 61 g 100 g sample in AW and AE. A total of six fatty acids including two essential ones namely omega- 6 C 182 and omega- 3 C 183 were identified and quantified in the two plant foods. The predominant FAs in the plant foods were oleic acid 16. 121. 86 - 17. 111. 31 g 100 g fat linoleic acid 16. 881. 66 - 18. 801. 52 g 100 g fat and linolenic acid 55. 955. 68 - 57. 086. 57 g 100 g fat in AW and palmitic acid 48. 594. 35 - 50. 513. 29 g 100 g fat oleic acid 32. 023. 27 - 35. 741. 46 g 100 g fat and linoleic acid 15. 153. 57 - 15. 403. 82 g 100 g fat in AE. The study shows that on the average one serving of AW could supply about 41. 52 and 647. 09 of the Recommended Daily Intakes RDIs for the essential FAs Linoleic and Linolenic acids respectively while that of AE will supply about 29. 13 of the RDI for Lineleic acid. Based on their essential FAs contents the plant foods apparently have potentials for applications as nutraceuticals...|$|E
