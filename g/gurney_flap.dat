5|$|Some teams {{modified}} {{their cars}} {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull and Williams revised their brake ducts. Williams team changed their brake ducts at the front to improve airflow inside the tyres and direct the duct towards their car's central section more efficiently. Red Bull's brake ducts, which had been changed for the third consecutive Grand Prix, reintroduced a small fin seen at the Singapore Grand Prix; for Korea two aerodynamic fins were fitted and a larger duct was introduced. McLaren modified a version of their front wings first introduced in Singapore. The team added a vertical <b>gurney</b> <b>flap</b> and an additional vertical slot at the front wing endplate to improve airflow outside the front tyres and increase the amount of downforce and therefore grip produced by the bodywork. The team also brought a new rear wing and tested a new revision of their F-duct system that débuted at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. Ferrari revised their diffuser with curved profiles and one large middle plate designed to improve the extraction of air {{from the bottom of the}} F10.

40|$|The {{development}} and validation of an aerodynamic model for predicting the unsteady lift response of upstream miniature trailing-edge effectors (MiTEs) is detailed. MiTEs are active <b>Gurney</b> <b>flaps</b> that show potential {{for use in}} rotorcraft performance enhancement, vibration control, and noise control {{if they can be}} stored within the blade itself. This usually requires the MiTEs to be placed upstream of the blade trailing edge. OVERFLOW 2. 1 predictions demonstrate the formation and convection of an unsteady vortex immediately following MiTE deployment. These vortices introduce non-harmonic components in the unsteady aerodynamic response. A computationally-inexpensive model has been developed based on CFD results, which extends work previously done for trailing-edge MiTEs by accounting for the vortex effect. The approach is physics-based in order to minimize the number of constants and increase the model's generality. Predictions from the unsteady lift model are compared with CFD and experiments for different airfoils, MiTE deployment schedules, and different Mach numbers.

25|$|Prost {{took the}} 1989 world title after a {{collision}} with Senna at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the penultimate race of the season, which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing the <b>gurney</b> <b>flap</b> from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna. This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost's car faster on the straights, but slower through corners- a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally come next to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and tangling wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini {{and went on to}} claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which {{was not part of the}} track. A large fine and temporary suspension of his FIA Super License followed in the winter of 1989, and an irate Senna engaged in a bitter war of words with the FIA and its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan. Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made. Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place. Prost left McLaren for rivals Ferrari for the following year.|$|E

The use of lift-enhancing tabs (similar to <b>Gurney</b> <b>flaps)</b> on the lower surface near {{the trailing edge of}} both elements was investigated on four nap configurations. A combination of vortex generators on the flap and lift-enhancing tabs was also investigated. Measurements of surface-pressure distributions and wake profiles were used to determine the aerodynamic performance of each configuration. By reducing flow separation on the flap, a lift-enhancing tab at the main-element trailing edge increased the maximum lift by 10. 3 % for the 42 -deg flap case. The tab had a lesser effect at a moderate flap deflection (32 deg) and adversely affected the performance at the smallest flap deflection (22 deg). A tab located near the flap trailing edge produced an additional lift increment for all flap deflections. The application of vortex generators to the flap eliminated lift-curve hysteresis and reduced flow separation on two configurations with large flap deflections (greater than 40 deg). A maximum-lift coefficient of 3. 32 (17 % above the optimum baseline) was achieved with the combination of lift-enhancing tabs on both elements and vortex generators on the flap...|$|R
40|$|The use of flat-plate tabs (similar to <b>Gurney</b> <b>flaps)</b> {{to enhance}} the lift of multielement {{airfoils}} is extended here by placing them on the pressure side and near {{the trailing edge of}} the main element rather than just on the furthest downstream wing element. The tabs studied range in height from 0. 125 to 1. 25 % of the airfoil reference chord. In practice, such tabs would be retracted when the high-lift system is stowed. The effectiveness of the concept was demonstrated experimentally and computationally on a two-dimensional NACA 63 (sub 2) - 215 Mod B airfoil with a single-slotted, 30 %-chord flap. Both the experiments and computations showed that the tabs significantly increase the lift at a given angle of attack and the maximum lift coefficient of the airfoil. The computational results showed that the increased lift was a result of additional turning of the flow by the tab that reduced or eliminated now separation on the flap. The best configuration tested, a 0. 5 %-chord tab placed 0. 5 % chord upstream of the trailing edge of the main element, increased the maximum lift coefficient of the airfoil by 12 % and the maximum lift-to-drag ratio by 40 %...|$|R
40|$|High-lift system {{aerodynamics}} {{has been}} gaining attention in recent years. In an effort to improve aircraft performance, comprehensive studies of multi-element airfoil systems are being undertaken in wind-tunnel and flight experiments. Recent developments in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offer a relatively inexpensive alternative for studying complex viscous flows by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. Current limitations in computer resources restrict practical high-lift N-S computations to two dimensions, but CFD predictions can yield tremendous insight into flow structure, interactions between airfoil elements, and effects of changes in airfoil geometry or free-stream conditions. These codes are very accurate when compared to strictly 2 D data provided by wind-tunnel testing, as will be shown here. Yet, additional challenges must be faced {{in the analysis of}} a production aircraft wing section, such as that of the NASA Langley Transport Systems Research Vehicle (TSRV). A primary issue is the sweep theory used to correlate 2 D predictions with 3 D flight results, accounting for sweep, taper, and finite wing effects. Other computational issues addressed here include the effects of surface roughness of the geometry, cove shape modeling, grid topology, and transition specification.

40|$|Experimental {{studies on}} Eppler 61 airfoil {{were carried out}} in the 0. 55 m Low speed wind tunnel in the low Reynolds number range of 46, 000 to 164, 000. Surface {{pressures}} on the airfoil and total pressures in the wake were measured simultaneously and using these pressures, the lift and drag coefficients were computed. Lift and drag coefficients variations with incidence showed nonlinearity in the form of sudden jump at incidence of 8 ° at Reynolds number of 46, 000 and as the Reynolds number is increased the degree of non linearity decreases and the angle at which this occurs shifts to lower incidence angles. Analysis of surface pressure data showed that the nonlinearity is due to changes in the flow features on the airfoil from the separated flow over a large part of airfoil extending upto trailing edge to the reattachment of flow on the surface in the form of bubble. Comparison of lift coefficient with the data in the literature showed differences in both pre-stall and post stall characteristics; these are attributed to the measurement technique used to get the lift and drag coefficients, flow quality of tunnel, roughness on the airfoil surface and the accuracy of the airfoil profile.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study on unsteady effects of oscillating <b>Gurney</b> <b>flaps,</b> or microflaps, has been conducted. Two-dimensional unsteady airloads, lift, moment and drag, {{due to an}} os-cillating microflap were computed using a compressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow solver. The CFD results were generated with an overset mesh approach that captures oscillatory microflap motion. Three microflap configurations were examined so as to determine the type most suitable in terms of actuation efficiency and practical imple-mentation. Furthermore, a reduced order model (ROM) for the unsteady microflaps was developed based on CFD simulations, using the Rational Function Approximation (RFA) approach. The resulting RFA model is a state-space, time-domain aerodynamic model that accounts for unsteadiness, compressibility and time-varying freestream effect, suitable for use with comprehensive rotorcraft simulations. The agreement between the ROM and di-rect CFD calculations {{was found to be}} excellent even in presence of strong nonlinear flow effects.

40|$|On {{a typical}} transsonic transport-type aircraft, wave drag {{is only a}} minor {{component}} of the total drag at cruise speed compared to viscous drag and induced drag. It is, however, critical for the design since the sharp drag-rise with increasing Mach number basically limits the maximum economic cruise speed of an airplane. The cause of wave drag are the strong shocks developing on the upper side of the wing creating an increase in entropy {{as well as an}} increase in boundary layer thickness eventually leading to separation. Different approaches to reduce wave drag have been investigated. One possibility is to change the chordwise pressure distribution such that the formation of strong shocks is avoided. This can be achieved either by conventional trailing edge flaps or by trailing edge modifications such as <b>Gurney</b> <b>flaps</b> or Split flaps. Another option is to reduce shock strength directly by local interaction. This can be realized by spanwise slots or perforated skins or, much more e±ciently, by spanwise contour bumps, as has been successfully demonstrated in a number of research projects.

At very high gross-weights, or a combination of moderate weight and very high speed, large reductions in rotor power of up to 40 % were predicted, with the MiTEs working to alleviate rotor stall. The rotor disk angles of attack on the retreating side were significantly reduced, as was the drag over much of the retreating side. At moderate to low gross-weights and/or lower speeds, power reductions of up to 8. 74 % were still obtained, even when the baseline rotor was not stalled. In these cases the MiTEs more optimally redistributed the lift around the rotor disk, generally offloading of the outer rim of the rotor disk while moving lift inboard.

A thick trailing-edged blade section, AF 300, that was designed and tested in a recent work for small horizontal axis wind turbines to improve the turbine’s startup and performance at low wind speeds was chosen for this study. Experiments were performed on the AF 300 airfoil in a wind tunnel at different Re, flap heights and angles of attack. Pressure distributions were obtained across the surface of the airfoil and the lift and drag forces were measured for different cases. It was found that the flap considerably improves the suction on the upper surface of the airfoil resulting in a high lift coefficient. For some of the angles, in the case of 3 mm and 4 mm flaps, the peak Cp values on the suction surface were significantly higher compared to those without the flap. However, at angles of attack of 12 o and above, this unusually high Cp on the upper surface close to the leading edge caused flow separation for some cases as the flow could not withstand the strong adverse pressure gradient. The CFX results matched most of the experimental results without flaps, except that the suction peak was lower numerically. The difference was higher for the case with flaps.

40|$|The vortex hazard {{produced}} by large airliners and increasingly larger airliners entering service, combined with projected rapid {{increases in the}} demand for air transportation, is expected {{to act as a}} major impediment to increased air traffic capacity. Significant reduction in the vortex hazard is possible, however, by employing active vortex alleviation techniques that reduce the wake severity by dynamically modifying its vortex characteristics, providing that the techniques do not degrade performance or compromise safety and ride quality. With this as background, a series of experiments were performed, initially at NASA Langley Research Center and subsequently at the Berlin University of Technology in collaboration with the German Aerospace Center. The investigations demonstrated the basic mechanism for managing trailing vortices using retrofitted devices that are decoupled from conventional control surfaces. The basic premise for managing vortices advanced here is rooted in the erstwhile forgotten hypothesis of Albert Betz, as extended and verified ingeniously by Coleman duPont Donaldson and his collaborators. Using these devices, vortices may be perturbed at arbitrarily long wavelengths down to wavelengths less than a typical airliner wingspan and the oscillatory loads on the wings, and hence the vehicle, are small. Significant flexibility in the specific device has been demonstrated using local passive and active separation control as well as local circulation control via <b>Gurney</b> <b>flaps.</b> The method is now in a position to be tested in a wind tunnel with a longer test section on a scaled airliner configuration. Alternatively, the method can be tested directly in a towing tank, on a model aircraft, a light aircraft or a full-scale airliner. The authors believed that this method will have significant appeal from an industry perspective due to its retrofit potential with little to no impact on cruise (devices tucked away in the cove or retracted); low operating power requirements; small lift oscillations when deployed in a time-dependent manner; and significant flexibility with respect to the specific devices selected...|$|R
