500|$|While most of Zhang's early films {{had been}} {{historical}} epics, Not One Less {{was one of}} the first to focus on contemporary China. The film's main theme involves the difficulties faced in providing rural education in China. When Wei Minzhi arrives in Shuiquan village, the teacher Gao has not been paid in six months and the school building is in disrepair, and chalk <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> short supply that Gao gives Wei specific instructions limiting how large her written characters should be. Wei sleeps in the school building, sharing a bed with several female students. The version of the film released overseas ends with a series of title cards in English, the last of which reads, [...] "Each year, poverty forces one million children in China to leave school. Through the help of donations, about 15% of these children return to school." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Katherine and Jill were {{believed}} to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E

500|$|Journalist Catherine Putz {{commented on}} the phrase in a 2016 article for the {{international}} news magazine The Diplomat, and compared it to use of whataboutism by businessman and politician Donald Trump: [...] "Criticisms {{of human rights in}} the Soviet Union were often met with what became a common catchphrase: 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] She pointed out the folly of its use: [...] "It demands, by default, for a state to argue abroad only in favor of ideals it has achieved the highest perfection in." [...] Writing for the liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli journalist Chemi Shalev made a similar comparison: [...] "Trump told the New York Times this week that America <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> a mess in terms of civil liberties that it cannot lecture foreign countries anymore, which is an echo of old Soviet propaganda that responded to American reprimands with the retort 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] Shalev followed-up on this analysis in a subsequent article, writing: [...] "Trump conducts pro-Russian propaganda along the same lines as the old retort 'And You Hang Blacks' with which the Soviets tried to deflect U.S. criticism of their human rights abuses. He isn't troubled by Putin's political opponents being murdered, because 'people get killed here too'." [...] Writing for ChinaFile after Trump won the 2016 U.S. election, James Palmer feared an increase in racism [...] "would give a brutal new credibility to the old Soviet whataboutism whenever they were challenged on the gulag: 'But in America, you lynch Negroes'." [...] In her work Security Threats and Public Perception, Elizaveta Gaufman characterized the phrase as a form of reversing someone's line of reasoning against them. Gaufman wrote that by using this phrase in an argument, one was tacitly refusing to answer queries posted to them and instead responding with condemnations.|$|E

Lannes wrote, [...] "The Prussian army <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> a state of panic that the mere appearance of a Frenchman is enough to make it lay down its arms." [...] That night, Lasalle achieved an even more astonishing coup in the Capitulation of Stettin. Between 30 October and 3 November, the French captured Küstrin fortress, an artillery convoy, Hohenlohe's baggage train and guard, and Bila's brigade. Blücher and Winning decided to head northwest for Lübeck with their 22,000 troops. The Battle of Lübeck was fought on 6 November.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Francis Loraine Petre {{concluded}} that Stettin's surrender was [...] "shameful". Its adequate garrison and supplies {{would have allowed}} it to sustain a siege. Even if the fortress was indefensible, there was nothing preventing the troops from crossing to the east bank of the Oder, joining their Russian allies, and continuing the war. Lannes wrote to Napoleon, [...] "The Prussian army <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> a state of panic that the mere appearance of a Frenchman {{is enough to make}} it lay down its arms." [...] Napoleon congratulated Murat, [...] "My compliments on the capture of Stettin; if your light cavalry thus takes fortified towns, I must disband the engineers and melt down my heavy artillery." ...|$|E

He remarked, [...] "How happy, Sir, you must feel, to be thus peaceably employed in adorning your mansion, whilst all the country round <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> commotion." [...] Kilravock was a firm {{supporter of the}} house of Hanover, but his adherence was not solicited, nor were his preferences alluded to. The next day, the Duke of Cumberland called at the castle gate, and when Kilravock went to receive him, he bluffly observed, [...] "So you had my cousin Charles here yesterday."

He <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> haste that I was forced to go halves with him in hiring a packet boat at the rate of £5 on purpose to be almost “drounded,” or what was very near as extravagant a reason, to humour my fellow traveller, for we came over in so prodigious a storm that nothing but our light heads could have kept us from the bottom." ...|$|E
2500|$|The A74 {{evolved from}} the Glasgow – Carlisle mail route. Originally, this {{followed}} the course of Roman roads, but by the early 19th century, this had become impractical as a fast through route for mail coaches. The problem had been exacerbated by the ineffective use of turnpike tolls, most of which consisted of little more than trying to fill potholes with stones. After an accident at a bridge crossing Elvan Water, which killed two horses and destroyed a coach, the Post Office became fed up with trying to improve the route through the turnpike system and, considering {{it to be the}} {{one of the most important}} roads in Scotland, decided to seek alternative means to improve it. Thomas Telford stated that [...] "the existing road <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> as ruinous state as to occasion much delay", and he managed to obtain a grant under the guise of the Highland Road and Bridges Commissioners, to design engineering improvements to the route.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Kidman won {{critical}} {{praise for}} her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry's The Hours, which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that {{were applied to}} her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The New York Times wrote that, [...] "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain". Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first BAFTA, third Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech {{about the importance of}} art, even during times of war, saying, [...] "Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> turmoil?
