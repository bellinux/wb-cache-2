He advocated that the corporation discuss the issue directly and claimed doing so would increase the fair's credibility with the public.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Muntz {{decided to}} sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract {{customers}} to his showroom, where he would then try to sell them his projection TV systems. His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Technicolor Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a 1/4in(0.6cm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{questioning}} of Oppenheimer concerned {{his role in}} the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minds of the review panel.|$|E
5|$|North and South Korean forces {{suffered}} <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle, {{each side}} inflicted {{large numbers of}} casualties on one another. The exact numbers of casualties are impossible to determine. Both sides {{are known to have}} suffered heavily. Following the counterattack at Inchon, the North Korean units in the sector fled back North, {{no more than a few}} thousand troops from the NK 5th and 12th divisions were known to have returned to North Korea. US Casualties, in the meantime, were relatively light.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{fell back}} into Alessandria, having lost about half the forces they had committed. The Austrians had lost <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12 hours of fighting: 15 colours, 40 guns, almost 8,000 taken prisoner, and 6,500 dead or wounded. French {{casualties}} (killed and wounded) were {{on the order of}} 4,700 and 900 missing or captured, but they retained the battlefield and the strategic initiative. Desaix's body was found among the slain.|$|E

5|$|The early {{investigation}} into the size and nature of quasars drove the development of interferometry techniques in the 1950s; the Lovell telescope had an advantage due to its large collecting area, meaning that high sensitivity interferometer measurements can be made relatively quickly using it. As a result, the telescope featured <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discovery of quasars.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposing}} armies met at {{the village}} of Albuera. Both sides suffered <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing struggle and the French finally withdrew on 18 May. Beresford's army was too battered and exhausted to pursue, but was able to resume the investment of Badajoz. Despite Soult's failure to relieve the town, the battle had little strategic effect on the war. Just one month later, in June 1811, the Allies were forced to abandon their siege by {{the approach of the}} reconstituted French Armies of Portugal and Andalusia.|$|E
5|$|Dark Horse is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living in the Material World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse {{is associated with the}} controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour {{by a member of the}} Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began after}} the release of Tales of Eternia in 2000, taking {{approximately}} two years to complete, and was the last Tales game to be developed by the original Wolfteam before it became Namco Tales Studio. The scenario was handled by Japanese writing company Gekko, the characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata, and the music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura. The PSP port was made after a similar port of Eternia met with commercial success. It was a highly anticipated game, and Namco promoted it <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> months prior to release. The game sold over 700,000 units by January 2003, and received critical acclaim from both Japanese and western critics.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, McCool took 57 {{first-class}} wickets at {{a bowling}} average of 17.82; {{he was the}} fifth most prolific wicket-taker and had the fourth best average among Australia's seven frontline bowlers. With England agreeing {{to have a new}} ball available after every 55 overs, more frequently than the old rule of replacing the ball after every 200 runs, fast bowling dominated over spin. As a result, McCool did not play in the Tests, but was used <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tour matches so the leading pacemen could conserve their energy for the important matches. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall, he delivered the least overs because of his injured finger. McCool took five wickets in an innings three times, his best return being 7/78 against Cambridge University.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} was halted {{during the war}} years afterward, although the Tenth Mountain Division, which trained at nearby Camp Hale, came to appreciate Aspen and its skiing. Many of them came back to Aspen after the war, helping to expand and staff the ski resort. Coincidentally, Walter Paepcke, head of the Container Corporation of America, visited Aspen with his wife Elizabeth in the late 1940s, and found it an ideal place to establish a music festival they were planning. He invested <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city's redevelopment, and people began coming to Aspen again to live, work and play. While the Rio Grande's trains still ran, many new visitors and arrivals preferred to drive.|$|E

5|$|Humpback whales were hunted {{as early}} as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean {{and to a lesser extent}} in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century {{introduction}} of the explosive harpoon allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Chamakh was {{pursued by}} several {{professional}} clubs {{that wanted to}} obtain his services. He drew interest from Lens, Toulouse, Lorient, and Bordeaux. Chamakh eventually decided to sign with Bordeaux due to the club's infrastructure and training facilities and {{also because of the}} close proximity to his family. Upon his arrival, Chamakh was placed into the club's youth academy. For the 2001–02 season, he was promoted to the club's Championnat de France amateur 2 team in the fifth division. Chamakh was involved <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign of the team, coached by Jean-Louis Garcia. He appeared in 17 matches and scored six goals as the team finished first in their group, thus earning promotion to the Championnat de France amateur.|$|E
5|$|In the Fifth Test at Port Elizabeth, Davidson took 4/44 {{and then}} 5/38 {{in the second}} innings as he and Benaud took all ten wickets and South Africa were skittled for 144. Australia won by eight wickets and took the series 3–0. It was his best Test match haul to date. He scored 127runs at 21.17 and took 25 wickets at 17.0 in the Tests. He had success against Russell Endean and John Waite, dismissing both twice. Although {{he was unable to}} score <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tests, Davidson scored four of his nine first class centuries during the tour. In all, he had taken 72 wickets at 15.13 and scored 813runs at 54.20 for the entire tour. From this tour onwards, in 32 Tests, he was to take 170 wickets at 19.26 and score 1011runs at 27.32 in the {{remainder}} of his career.|$|E

As England agreed {{to have a new}} ball available after every 55 overs, fast bowling dominated in the Tests, so McCool was used <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tour matches to allow the leading pacemen to conserve their energy in preparation for the Tests. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall he bowled the least overs due to his injured finger. McCool had the worst economy rate among the regular bowlers, but he took his wickets at a faster rate; his strike rate was second only to paceman Ray Lindwall.|$|E
5|$|On November 24, 1835, Blackburn {{married his}} distant cousin, Ella Gist Boswell. Boswell's father, Dr. Joseph Boswell, {{had died in}} the Lexington cholera {{epidemic}} a year earlier. The couple's only child, son Cary Bell Blackburn, was born in 1837. Just before Cary's birth, Blackburn invested <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hemp rope and bagging industry and suffered a significant financial loss when the business venture subsequently failed. In 1843, Blackburn was elected as a Whig to the Kentucky House of Representatives and served a single, undistinguished term. He did not seek re-election, and in 1844, he and his younger brother opened a medical practice in Frankfort, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Santikhiri {{was chosen}} as the filming {{location}} for the subplot The Fortitude of the Buddha in the 2005 film 3 Needles. Although the narrative is supposed to be set in the rural southern province of Yunnan, director Thom Fitzergald stated that difficulties in obtaining permission from the Censorship Authority resulted in the decision to shoot the segment in Santikhiri instead. The segment, which stars Lucy Liu as a heavily-pregnant blood merchant, depicts the blood-selling scandals in China from the 1980s-2000s in which hundreds of thousands of people, mostly rural poor, contracted HIV through government sponsored campaigns to increase blood supplies. The traditional costume of the Akha people features <b>heavily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> segment, however the blood selling scandals mostly impacted rural villagers in Henan province.|$|E
