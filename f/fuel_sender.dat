5000|$|Vehicle: <b>fuel</b> <b>sender</b> unit, Light/Control stalk/Combination Switch (including shifter for light, turn signal), power windows, {{door lock}} systems, {{articulated}} shells.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel level}} sender units are {{physically}} different between the two models, this {{could be due to}} the differentmethods used to report the fuel level (B1-gauge, B2-LCD). The B1 model has a <b>fuel</b> <b>sender</b> with a round tank mounting, the B2 has a rectangular mounting plate, therefore the tanks are different also. The DFI fuel delivery hardware appears to be the same. The 1983 model also uses the same fuel pump and TBI setup as the B2.|$|E
40|$|Misfueling of {{a general}} {{aviation}} aircraft with a Jet Fuel instead of an Avgas can have dire consequences. In this paper simple non-destructive testing method is proposed using two capacitive <b>fuel</b> <b>senders</b> that are vertically displaced in a fuel tank by a small distance to detect such situation. Method is based on different readings for the same fuel level in a tank (as <b>fuel</b> <b>senders</b> are displaced). Each fuel has different dielectric constant. In case of correct fueling difference between these readings will always fall within narrow fixed interval...|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} {{distinct}} electrical systems {{that may be}} used in autogas systems - <b>fuel</b> gauge <b>sender,</b> <b>fuel</b> shut-off, closed loop feedback mixture control and injection control.|$|R
50|$|In some installations, the <b>fuel</b> gauge <b>sender</b> {{fitted to}} the autogas tank is matched to the {{original}} fuel gauge in the vehicle. In others, an additional gauge is added to display the level of fuel in the autogas tank separately from the existing petrol gauge.|$|R
