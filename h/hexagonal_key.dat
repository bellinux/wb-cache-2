They were introduced by Robert Bosanquet in the 1870s, and since the 1960s Erv Wilson has developed new methods of using and expanding them, proposing keyboard layouts (and some notations) including any scale made of a single generator within an [...] "octave" [...] (or more generally, period) of any size.|$|R

50|$|Organist, musicologist and {{inventor}} Hans Luedtke developed special Oskalyd extended {{organs and}} keyboards {{that could be}} used with any desired tone system. Rounded edge <b>hexagonal</b> shaped <b>keys</b> were to be arranged like honeycombs {{in such a way that}} intervals would be represented by unique vectors (i.e. a Generalized keyboard). He mentioned tunings with semi-, third-, and quartertones, methods for playing special glissandos, electronic switching between tunings or registers during performances, and he also outlined a notation system analogous to the keyboards and a direct opto-electric recording system.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Philips Research labs at Redhill, Surrey did a brief study into small, cheap {{keyboards}} for entering text on a telephone. One solution used {{a grid of}} <b>hexagonal</b> <b>keys</b> with symbols inscribed into dimples in the keys that were either {{in the center of}} a key, across the boundary of two keys, or at the joining of three keys. Pressing down on one of the dimples would cause either one, two or three of the hexagonal buttons to be depressed at the same time, forming a chord that would be unique to that symbol. With this arrangement, a nine button keyboard with three rows of three hexagonal buttons could be fitted onto a telephone and could produce up to 33 different symbols. By choosing widely separated keys, one could employ one dimple as a 'shift' key to allow both letters and numbers to be produced. With eleven keys in a 3/4/4 arrangement, 43 symbols could be arranged allowing for lowercase text, numbers and a modest number of punctuation symbols to be represented along with a 'shift' function for accessing uppercase letters. While this had the advantage of being usable by untrained users via 'hunt and peck' typing and requiring one less key switch than a conventional 12 button keypad, it had the disadvantage that some symbols required three times as much force to depress them as others which made it hard to achieve any speed with the device. That solution is still alive and proposed by Fastap and Unitap among others, and a commercial phone has been produced and promoted in Canada during 2006.|$|R

The inverted hexagonal phase (HII) belongs to the biologically most significant non-lamellar phospholipid phases in biomembranes. Hence the geometric properties and conditions of transition to the HII phase are nowadays widely studied. In our derivation of the free energy of lipid monolayers we assume that phospholipid molecules are in general anisotropic {{with respect to the}} axis perpendicular to the membrane plane. In our model the expression for the phospholipid monolayer free energy consists of two energy contributions: the bending energy which involves also deviatoric term, and the interstitial energy which describes the deformation energy due to stretching of the phospholipid molecule chains. On the basis of the derived expression for the phospholipid monolayer free energy we theoretically predict optimal geometry and physical conditions for the stability of the inverted <b>hexagonal</b> phase. <b>Key</b> words: inverted <b>hexagonal</b> phase, self-assembly of phospholipids, biomembranes, lamellar lipid phase, non-lamellar lipid phases Simulacije invertnih heksagonalnih lipidnih struktur Povzetek.

40|$|Dedicated to Professor Michael Hayes on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday Abstract: It is well known that rotation in three dimensions can be expressed as a quadratic in a skew sym-metric matrix via the Euler–Rodrigues formula. A generalized Euler–Rodrigues polynomial of degree 2 n in a skew symmetric generating matrix is derived for the rotation matrix of tensors of order n. The Euler– Rodrigues formula for rigid body rotation is recovered by n 1. A Cayley form of the nth-order rotation tensor is also derived. The representations simplify if there exists some underlying symmetry, as is the case for elasticity tensors such as strain and the fourth-order tensor of elastic moduli. A new formula is presented for the transformation of elastic moduli under rotation: as a 21 -vector with a rotation matrix given by a poly-nomial of degree 8. Explicit spectral representations are constructed from three vectors: the axis of rotation and two orthogonal bivectors. The tensor rotation formulae are related to Cartan decomposition of elastic moduli and projection onto <b>hexagonal</b> symmetry. <b>Key</b> Words: rotation, tensor, transverse isotropy, Cartan 1...|$|R
40|$|The Wiener {{number of}} a {{connected}} graph {{is equal to}} the sum of distances between all pairs of its vertices. A graph formed by a row of n hexagonal cells is called an n-hexagonal chain. A graph consisting of m s-hexagonal chains, where s runs from n to n Γ m+ 1, forming the shape of a trapezium is called an n Θ m hexagonal trapezium. A graph obtained by merging the base n-hexagonal chains of two n Θ m hexagonal trapeziums, forming a convex 6 -sided polygram, is called an n Θ m hexagonal bitrapezium.

40|$|The {{generation}} of nodal cross sections and equivalence parameters for prismatic VHTR core components is discussed. For fuel-block cross section generation, a conventional single-block {{model with a}} reflective boundary condition is used. A one-dimensional fuel-reflector model is proposed for reflector cross section generation in order to accurately represent the significant neutron spectrum variation at the core-reflector interface. Two-dimensional multi-block models are used for obtaining control rod cross sections for rodded fuel and reflector blocks to best approximate actual spectra in the blocks. The verification of the models was performed by generating cross sections with the DRAGON and HELIOS codes, using the cross section data in 2 -D and 3 -D DIF 3 D nodal calculations, and comparing the results to MCNP 4 C ones. The {{results show that the}} use of discontinuity factors reduces errors in nodal solutions for the multiplication factor and power distribution. Surface-dependent discontinuity factors are found essential for improving the accuracy of the power distribution of cores with asymmetrically rodded blocks when nodal calculations are performed with one node per <b>hexagonal</b> block. <b>Key</b> Words: Prismatic VHTR, equivalence theory, discontinuity factors, nodal solution 1...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial chemosensory {{proteins}} form large <b>hexagonal</b> arrays. Several <b>key</b> {{feature of}} chemotactic signalling depend on these large arrays, namely cooperativity between receptors, sensitivity, integration of different signals and adaptation. The best studied arrays are the membrane associated arrays {{found in most}} bacteria. Rhodobacter sphaeroides has two spatially distinct chemosensory arrays, one transmembrane and the other cytoplasmic. These two arrays work together to control a single flagellum. Deletion {{of one of the}} soluble chemoreceptors, TlpT, results in the loss of formation of the cytoplasmic array. Here we show the expression of TlpT in a tlpT deletion background results in the reformation of the cytoplasmic array. The number of arrays formed is dependent on the cell length, indicating spatial limitations on the number of arrays in a cell, and stochastic assembly. Deletion of PpfA, a protein required for the positioning and segregation on the cytoplasmic array, results in slower array formation upon TlpT expression and fewer arrays, suggesting it accelerates cluster assembly...|$|R
40|$|MnCoGe-based {{compounds}} are {{of interest}} {{with respect to the}} magnetocaloric effect due to a martensitic phase transition from the low-temperature orthorhombic phase to the high-temperature <b>hexagonal</b> phase. A <b>key</b> feature is that the transition temperature can be readily tuned to obtain a magneto-structural transition. Fe is an effective substitute for Mn or Co to stabilize the hexagonal phase at low temperature. Here we present initial 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements on (Mn 0. 96 Fe 0. 04) CoGe and Mn(Co 0. 96 Fe 0. 04) Ge samples doped with 0. 5 wt % 57 Fe. The martensitic transition temperatures were determined to be 239 K and 304 K with transition full widths at half maximum of 44 K and 39 K respectively as determined from x-ray diffraction experiments over the temperature range 10 – 310 K. The magnetic properties were studied over the temperature range 5 – 300 K and a magneto-structural transition found in Mn(Co 0. 96 Fe 0. 04) Ge. Analysis of the 20 K Mössbauer spectra reveals that the Fe atoms are distributed on both the Mn and Co sites and tend to prefer to occupy the Co site in both the (Mn 0. 96 Fe 0. 04) CoGe and Mn(Co 0. 96 Fe 0. 04) Ge samples.
