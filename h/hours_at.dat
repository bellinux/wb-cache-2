5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> {{a time in the}} bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of {{remaining}} active for a month without food {{and are able to}} survive on limited resources, such as the glue from the back of postage stamps. Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E
50|$|The Little Hours are {{the fixed}} daytime hours of {{prayer in the}} Divine Office of Christians, in both Western Christianity and the Eastern Orthodox Church. These Hours are called 'little' due to their shorter and simpler {{structure}} compared to the Night Hours. Traditionally, these times of prayer include Prime (First <b>Hour),</b> <b>at</b> 6 a.m., Terce (Third <b>Hour)</b> <b>at</b> 9 a.m., Sext (Sixth <b>Hour)</b> <b>at</b> noontime, and None (Ninth <b>Hour)</b> <b>at</b> 3 p.m. These prayer times derive from ancient Jewish practice and are mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles; the prayers consist mainly of psalms.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{there was}} no mention on the paper of the <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> which you came to the gymnasium--only of the <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> which you left. Consequently, certain lawless spirits would range the {{neighbourhood}} after lock-up, and, by putting in a quarter of an <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> the gymnasium before returning to their houses, escape comment. To this class belonged the shadowy forms previously mentioned.|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, for example, mayor Robert Wagner {{ordered an}} {{increase}} in the New York City Transit Police force from 1,219 to 3,100 officers. During the <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> which crimes most frequently occurred (between 8:00p.m. and 4:00a.m.), the officers went on patrol in all stations and trains. In response, crime rates decreased, as extensively reported by the press. In July 1985, however, the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City published a study showing riders abandoning the subway, fearing the frequent robberies and generally bad circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between the couples {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> the Music Box in Manchester. A hand-held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E
5|$|Sweltering / Yellowing: Unique {{to yellow}} teas, warm and damp tea leaves from after kill-green {{are allowed to}} be lightly heated in a closed container, which causes the {{previously}} green leaves to turn yellow. The resulting leaves produce a beverage that has a distinctive yellowish-green hue due to transformations of the leaf chlorophyll. Through being sweltered for 6–8 <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> close to human body temperatures, the amino acids and polyphenols in the processed tea leaves undergo chemical changes to give this tea its distinct briskness and mellow taste.|$|E

5|$|The chicks' {{eyes open}} after about four days and, {{at an age}} of about eight days, the young birds get their first down. If both parents perish, the ensuing {{intensive}} begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves. All the young in the nest leave it {{during the same period}} of a few <b>hours.</b> <b>At</b> this stage, they are normally able to fly. They start feeding themselves partly after one or two days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 at the latest.|$|E

At around 12:15, nine Japanese Betty bombers {{attacked}} the landing craft at Morobe, but inflicted no damage or casualties. On the night of 3/4 September, the final voyage to the landing beaches began. The landing was preceded by a short naval bombardment from five US destroyers. It was unopposed by Japanese land forces, with {{the small number of}} Japanese that were guarding the shore choosing to abandon their posts rather than fight.|$|E
