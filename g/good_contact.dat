25|$|Despite the {{connection}} to this general geographic region, {{it is difficult to}} determine from the Torah the exact boundaries of the tribe, to the extent that it is even uncertain whether Asher even had continuous territory. Sites which according to the Bible were allocated to Asher, and whose locations have since been identified, appear to be a scattered distribution of settlements rather than a compact and well-defined tribal region. Despite appearing to have had <b>good</b> <b>contact</b> with the markets of Phoenicia, Asher appears, throughout its history, to have been fairly disconnected from the other tribes of Israel; additionally it seems to have taken little part in the antagonism portrayed in the Torah between the Canaanites and the other tribes, for example in the war involving Barak and Sisera. Critical scholars generally conclude that Asher consisted of certain clans that were affiliated with portions of the Israelite tribal confederation, but were never incorporated into the body politic.|$|E
25|$|The Mehrgarh Period I (7000 BCE-5500 BCE) was Neolithic and aceramic, {{without the}} use of pottery. The {{earliest}} farming in the area was developed by semi-nomadic people using plants such as wheat and barley and animals such as sheep, goats and cattle. The settlement was established with simple mud buildings and most of them had four internal subdivisions. Numerous burials have been found, many with elaborate goods such as baskets, stone and bone tools, beads, bangles, pendants and occasionally animal sacrifices, with more goods left with burials of males. Ornaments of sea shell, limestone, turquoise, lapis lazuli and sandstone have been found, along with simple figurines of women and animals. Sea shells from far sea shore and lapis lazuli found as far away as present-day Badakshan, Afghanistan shows <b>good</b> <b>contact</b> with those areas. A single ground stone axe was discovered in a burial, and several more were obtained from the surface. These ground stone axes are the earliest to come from a stratified context in South Asia. Periods I, II and III are contemporaneous with another site called Kili Gul Mohammed.|$|E

2500|$|Magnet. This ensures a <b>good</b> <b>contact</b> {{when the}} contact closes. [...] It also {{provides}} hysteresis to prevent short heating cycles, {{as the temperature}} must be raised several degrees before the contacts will open. As an alternative, some thermostats instead use a mercury switch {{on the end of}} the bimetal coil. [...] The weight of the mercury {{on the end of the}} coil tends to keep it there, also preventing short heating cycles. [...] However, this type of thermostat is banned in many countries due to its highly and permanently toxic nature if broken. When replacing these thermostats they must be regarded as chemical waste.|$|E
2500|$|Christian was {{reckoned}} {{a typical}} renaissance king, and excelled in hiring in musicians and artists {{from all over}} Europe. Many English musicians were employed by him at several times, among them William Brade, John Bull and John Dowland. Dowland accompanied the king on his tours, and as he was employed in 1603, rumour has it he was in Norway as well. Christian was an agile dancer, and his court was reckoned the second most [...] "musical" [...] court in Europe, only ranking behind that of Elizabeth I of England. Christian maintained <b>good</b> <b>contact</b> with his sister Anne, who was married to James VI of Scotland. His other sister, Elizabeth, was married to the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and artists and musicians travelled freely between the courts.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{yet another}} Mafia turncoat, Antonino Giuffrè– arrested on 16 April 2002– the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's Forza Italia party {{to look after the}} Mafia's {{interests}}, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling Christian Democratic party, whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia's fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when Salvo Lima was killed in March 1992. [...] "The Lima murder marked the end of an era," [...] Giuffrè told the court. [...] "A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To be clear, that party was Forza Italia." [...] Dell'Utri was the go-between on a range of legislative efforts to ease pressure on mafiosi in exchange for electoral support, according to Giuffrè. [...] "Dell'Utri was very close to Cosa Nostra and a very <b>good</b> <b>contact</b> point for Berlusconi," [...] he said. Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano told Giuffrè that they [...] "were in good hands" [...] with Dell'Utri, who was a [...] "serious and trustworthy person".

When {{it was used to}} complete the communication at the electromotor, there was no sensible spark on making contact, but on breaking contact there was a very large and bright spark, with considerable combustion of the mercury. Then, again, with respect to the shock: if the hands were moistened in salt and water, and <b>good</b> <b>contact</b> between them and the wires retained, no shock could be felt upon making contact at the electromotor, but a powerful one on breaking contact.|$|E
6000|$|... 1190. The {{attachment}} and adjustment of the shell-lac stem {{was a matter}} requiring considerable care, especially as, in consequence of its cracking, it had frequently to be renewed. The best lac was chosen and applied to the wire i, {{so as to be}} in <b>good</b> <b>contact</b> with it everywhere, and in perfect continuity throughout its own mass. It was not smaller than is given by scale in the drawing, for when less it frequently cracked within a few hours after it was cold. I think that very slow cooling or annealing improved its quality in this respect. The collar g was made as thin as could be, that the lac might be as wide there as possible. In order that at every re-attachment of the stem to the upper hemisphere the ball h might have the same relative position, a gauge p (fig. 105.) was made of wood, and this being applied to the ball and hemisphere whilst the cement at m was still soft, the bearings of the ball at qq, and the hemisphere at rr, were forced home, and the whole left until cold. Thus all difficulty in the adjustment of the ball in the sphere was avoided.|$|E
