5|$|There {{were about}} 578,424 {{sheltered}} and unsheltered homeless {{persons in the}} U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional <b>housing</b> <b>program.</b> In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns {{at some point during}} the year, and most cases were not chronic. According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from one in seven in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Workers {{distributed}} about 4,100tons of {{food and}} 200,000litres of milk to the affected victims, by both land and air. In Veracruz, only 9helicopters were utilized to distribute food and water to isolated areas. About 948tons of medicine was also distributed. Helicopters assisted in transporting people to shelters. In Veracruz alone, 34people were rescued by boat and 1,131 by aircraft. In Puebla and Veracruz, 9,551troops were stationed to assist in relief work, utilizing 48helicopters, 4Hercules planes, and 10boats. Between Veracruz and Hidalgo, the Department of Social Development distributed about 18,500mattresses and other relief items. Workers quickly made repairs to highways, and by October19, all of the 28damaged federal highways were provisionally reopened; some of the reopened highways had to undergo additional construction work. The military worked to reopen other roads. In Veracruz, the Director of the Federal Electricity Commission noted that repairs to electrical systems were difficult {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the floods. Planes flew generators into Gutiérrez Zamora, Veracruz, mainly for hospitals, and by October20, 90% of the affected areas had their power restored. President Zedillo announced on October11 that the government would begin building new houses, part of the Emergency <b>Housing</b> <b>Program</b> initiative. In Puebla, the initial stages of the program would involve rebuilding 1,200houses and moving 500houses to safer lands. The Mexican government estimated that the <b>housing</b> <b>program</b> would help 37,000families. Mexico's agricultural ministry provided assistance for farmers to replant lost crops. Through the Temporary Employment Program, the federal government temporarily hired about 1million people who lost their homes or farms. Students gradually returned to school after repairs were made, and by October28, over 800,000students who were affected were able to return to school, including all of Oaxaca and Hidalgo. The area in Teziutlán, Puebla affected by the mudslide was never rebuilt, due to being labeled a high-risk area.|$|E

40|$|Public choice theorists {{predict that}} cities {{will not support}} local {{affordable}} <b>housing</b> <b>programs,</b> reasoning that city policy makers seek {{to provide the best}} cost-to-benefit ratio for public goods and services to attract residents and maintain fiscal health. This economic self-interest by cities results in interjurisdictional competition and the avoidance of redistributive policies such as affordable <b>housing</b> <b>programs.</b> Fur-thermore, some scholars argue that intergovernmental funding and mandates are necessary to motivate cities to support affordable <b>housing</b> <b>programs.</b> This article examines the relative influences of intercity competition and intergov-ernmental factors on local affordable housing expenditures. The analysis uses sur-vey data and data from the 1990 U. S. census. The findings show that intercity competition reduces the likelihood that cities will spend local dollars on <b>housing</b> <b>programs.</b> Intergovernmental factors, such as federal funding and state-mandated housing planning, on the other hand, positively influence cities to spend local funds on affordable <b>housing</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R

They announced that they could not find any violation of the law. But the question itself, posed by the Defense Housing Coordinator, created a number of doubts among influential individuals who could have protected and encouraged the program, rather than watch it be dismantled.|$|E
