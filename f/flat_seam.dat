50|$|Coverstitch {{is formed}} {{by two or}} more needles {{and one or two}} loopers. Like {{lockstitch}} and chainstitch, coverstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn. One looper manipulates a thread below the material being sewn, forming a bottom cover stitch against the needle threads. An additional looper above the material can form a top cover stitch simultaneously. The needle threads form parallel rows, while the looper threads cross back and forth all the needle rows. Coverstitch is so-called because the grid of crossing needle and looper threads covers raw seam edges, much as the overlock stitch does. It is widely used in garment construction, particularly for attaching trims and <b>flat</b> <b>seaming</b> where the raw edges can be finished in the same operation as forming the seam.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Ultrasonic seaming: the pertained {{technology}} {{for this research}} is identified {{as one of the}} alternatives which offers many advantages over traditional sewing. Ultrasonic technology was initially used for plastic welding. It has been utilized in automotive, electronics and electrical appliances, filtration, packaging, aerospace and apparel industries. However, the use of sewing machine, needle and threads still remains as the most popular method of joining fabrics together. The aim of this research is to investigate the possibility of constructing different types of seams for clothing using ultrasonic technology which is an existing technology that is not fully utilized and not fully realized the advantages associated with it in the apparel industry. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental reflective practice' was used as the main method for practical investigation. The basis for analysis was formed by reflections made during and after the experimentations. Findings: Though the construction of the seams are possible, due to thickness of the layers, LSc and LSe seam types were not successful in terms of quality. The bound seam type and the <b>flat</b> <b>seams</b> are possible using ultrasonic technology without the blade, the quality is not satisfactory when comparing to the conventional sewing technique. However, ornamental stitching (OS) and edge finishing (EF) with ultrasonic are possible and successful.

The results show that: if the A 3 round steelanchoris used to support in the experiment, the rocks loaded 240 kg began to appear local caving, the roof loaded 360 kg appear fully caving, the ultimate bearing capacity of the roof support structure is achieved, the falling height is 2. 4 m above the roof. As the distance beyond the bolt anchorage range, {{the stability of the}} roof is hardly to maintain. When we choose deformed steel bar bolt, the bearing capacity of supporting structure reach to 624 kg, 73 % is increased compared to A 3 round steel anchor, and the capacity is greater than the actual load in the overburden; the deformed steel bar bolt make the roof form a complete anchorage structure, increase the bearing capacity of the roof structure. The average depth of main coal seam in experimental mine is about 200 m, the average thickness is 5. 07 m, the height of roadway is 3. 5 m, the drivage is along the floor, the thickness of top coal in roadway roof is about 1. 5 m, the structure of the coal seam is organized, the preexisting fissures are developed, the bedding are obvious, it is nearly <b>flat</b> <b>seam</b> containing four or five layer...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of research into the potential of underground mining methods applicable to inclined thick seams (thickness greater than 3. 5 m, and seam dip of 15 - 35 degree) in the Quangninh coalfield, Vietnam. The primary objectives of this research are to investigate the most suitable underground methods applicable to inclined thick seams in the Quangninh coalfield and to improve understanding of the operational and geotechnical issues associated with the application of chosen methods in thick seams with steeply dipping conditions. From a risk and operational assessment, the Longwall Top Coal Caving (LTCC) method is considered most appropriate for inclined thick seams under the current mining conditions in Vietnam. The LTCC method offers great potential for the efficient extraction of thick seams by caving coal from the upper section during the mining of the lower section. This significantly reduces the development cost per tonne. Compared to High reach Single Pass Longwalling, the LTCC method offers a low extraction height, resulting in smaller and less expensive equipment and better face conditions. Results from this study identified that for extracting an inclined thick seam, the face retreating along the strike has better operational advantages and better cavability than the face retreating updip or downdip of the seam. The operational issues of the LTCC method when extracting inclined seams are: the stability of the support, transport in the mine, and the difficulties in roof control at the transition between face ends and the gateroads. In terms of geotechnical issues, better cavability of the top coal is anticipated for <b>flat</b> coal <b>seams</b> compared to inclined seams. In addition, the chain pillar for <b>flat</b> coal <b>seams</b> is subjected to a higher vertical stress distribution than that of inclined ones. An improved cavability assessment method for the categorisation of the cavability of the top coal with four categories, ranging from 1 (excellent cavability) to 4 (very poor cavability), was suggested to assist the feasibility and design stages of the LTCC application. The cavability assessment method was conducted by numerical analysis combined with back analysis from the database obtained from past LTCC practices...|$|R

40|$|N WESTERN EUROPE {{flexible}} structures, {{in particular}} pneumatic con-structions, are today predominatly {{made on the}} basis of PVC-coated polyester fabrics. For this purpose 4 standard types of fabric are currently available, the technical data of which are shown in Table 1. This table includes apart from the strength at room temperature, also the strength at 70 ° C. This elevated temperature was chosen because temperature measurements conducted on air-supported structures in West Germany have always given membrane temperatures below 70 °C so that 70 ° C represents an upper limit for test purposes. Which of the 4 materials will be selected depends on the loads to be expected, resulting from the design of the structure and the environmental influences to which it will be exposed. It has been found that in West Germany the most commonly used materials is type II. In addition to the materials presented here, there have, of course, been developed other materials for special structures requiring, for instance, extremely high translucence. Moreover, there are signs that in addition to the 4 standard fabrics included in Table 1, a so-called type V having a nominal strength of about 2000 N/cm may be find general acceptance. Apart from the materials, great importance must be attached to the joints. Here, too, 4 types of seams have developed, which can be used in any of the above-mentioned materials. The joints represented in Table 2 include the high frequency seam, the double lapped seam, the 4 -ply French seam, and the so-called combined seam, which consists of a 2 -ply <b>flat</b> <b>seam</b> which additionally been secured by high frequency welding...|$|E
40|$|The main way to {{increase}} the competitiveness of Kuznetsk coals produced by the open method is to reduce overburden works. On the open pits of the southern Kuzbass the <b>flat</b> coal <b>seam</b> strata are developed using transportless technology during overburden works. Open-pit fields are developed in combination: the lower part to the height of 32 - 44 m is worked out by low-cost transportless technology (producing cost of 1 m 3 of overburden is 22 - 24 rubles, the upper part - by high-cost transport technology (producing cost of 1 m 3 of overburden is 35 - 44 rubles) using shovels EKG- 10, EKG- 12. 5, EKG- 20 excavators and quarry dump trucks with the carrying capacity of 80 - 180 tons. The volume increase of the rock that is transferred to the internal dump will improve the economic indicators of coal mining. In addition, due to the flat bedding, {{the height of the}} rock mass, which is processed by transport technology, is constantly increasing. At the present time, this has led to the speed decrease in the movement of the working front of the transport zone and, as a consequence, to slowing down the development of transportless. The redistribution of overburden volumes between zones in the direction of increasing the volume by transportless technology will increase the speed of movement of the transport zone (while maintaining the same complex of mining and transport equipment) ...|$|R
30|$|In general, {{tributary}} area method {{is used to}} estimate the value of mining induced stress around a symmetrical excavation with low percentage of extraction. The scope of the {{tributary area}} method ends with high percentage of extraction and roof strata failure. Once the strata breaks and acquires a new state of equilibrium, an assessment of mining induced stress over coal pillars around the excavation becomes a challenging task. In fact, failure of overlying roof strata is mainly governed by the geology and strength of the strata. Due to further dimensional increase of the opening, mining induced stress is created by the immediate roof strata cantilevering over the goaf area and their magnitudes depend, mainly, on the length and thickness of the roof strata that overhang inside the goaf area. In past, a number of attempts (Sellers 1997; Majumder and Chakrabarty 1991) utilizing, both, simulation (Jaiswal et al. 2004; Mathur 1992) and field observations (Maleki 1992; Gale 1998) were made {{to understand the nature}} and amount of mining induced stress variation in and around an underground excavation due to coal mining. Jayanthu et al. (2004) found that the maximum vertical stress over rib and stook decreases with increase in working height during depillaring. Field investigations (Singh et al. 1996) showed that the nature of development of mining induced stress over pillar/stook at different stages of depillaring, for a nearly <b>flat</b> coal <b>seam,</b> is influenced by different parameters like depth of cover, characteristics of overlying strata, distance from face line, extraction height and goaf treatment.|$|R
40|$|German potash mining as an {{important}} part of the German mining industry has an over 150 -years old tradition. However, extraction at increasing depths of the potash seams in combination with the Room & Pillar mining method lead to lower extraction rates in underground mining due to rock mechanical restrictions resulting in increas-ing pillar sizes. Against this background the thesis makes a contribution to efforts to increase the extraction rate in German underground potash mining. Based on the mining method presently applied in <b>flat</b> potash <b>seams,</b> the author shows innovative approaches for suitable mining methods for increased extraction rates. For this purpose computer-based models were developed, the results are demonstrated and finally evaluated regarding optimization of extraction rates. Im-portant mining factors such as mineral extraction method, rock mechanics and back-fill operations influencing requirements of the mining method are characterized. The computer-based models include the following mining methods: Room & Pillar Mining, Room & Pillar Mining with Backfill Operations, Room & Pillar Mining with Pillar Recovery and Backfill Operations, Stope & Pillar Mining with Backfill Operations as well as Stope & Pillar Mining with Pillar Recovery and Backfill Operations. With the input of individual parameters in the computer-based models a modification of the underground mining method is possible. The computer-based models provide a functional tool for a technical and economic evaluation of the developed mining methods for flat potash deposits. Consequently the evaluation of the selected mining method for flat deposits can be determined in advance. Moreover the computer-based models provide a technical and economic optimization of the developed mining method...|$|R
