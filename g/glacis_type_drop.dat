40|$|Summary. — Southern Peru can {{be divided}} into 3 {{longitudinal}} zones : the coast range, high plains (about 3 000 ft) known as the Pampas, the main Sierra, gently sloping towards the aggradational Altiplano of lake Titicaca. Occasionally, the Pampas are separated from the Sierra by cristalline hills and intermediate brnins, the main one being the Arequipa trough, filled with a welded tuff, the sillar. The main chronological stages appear to be : — main uplift raising the late miocène Puna surface of erosion, cut in the Sierra, over the Pampas and Arequipa basin; an active volcanic period (chachani, then barroso) may have taken place after the uplift. The deposit of the sillar welded tuff is likely to have taken place during the chachani stage, which is about 3 million years old; — erosion in the Arequipa trough and correlative deposition of the <b>glacis</b> <b>type</b> alluvium of the Pampas; — joint uplift of all parts of the region (Coast range, Pampas, Arequipa basin, Sierra) in Pleistocene times, through a coastal warping or uplifting accounting for an uplift of about 3 000 ft.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} estimation over communication networks. Suppose a sensor is taking measurements of a dynamic process. However the process needs to be estimated at a remote location connected to the sensor through a network of communication links that drop packets stochastically. We {{provide a framework for}} computing the optimal performance in the sense of expected error covariance. Using this framework we characterize the dependency of the performance on the topology of the network and the packet dropping process. For independent and memoryless packet dropping processes we find the steady-state error for some classes of networks and obtain lower and upper bounds for the performance of a general network. Finally we find a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the estimate error covariance for general networks with spatially correlated and Markov <b>type</b> <b>dropping</b> process. This interesting condition has a max-cut interpretation. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{pertinent to}} {{various aspects of}} drop evaporation on a heated surface is reviewed. Both the laser shadowgraphic and direct photographic methods are employed to study thermal stability and flow structures in evaporating drops in all heating regimes. It is revealed that four flow regions exist in stable and unstable <b>type</b> <b>drops</b> at low liquid-film type vaporization regime. As the surface temperature is raised, the flow regions reduce to two. In the nucleate-boiling type vaporization regime, the interfacial flow structure changes due {{to a reduction in}} the Marangoni number as well as the dielectric constant of the liquid. An evidence of bubble growth in the drops is disclosed. The micro explosion of drops is found to occur in the transition-boiling type heating range. No drop explosion takes place in the spheriodal vaporization regime except when the drop rolls on to a microscratch on the heating surface. It is concluded that the mechanisms for triggering drop explosion include the spontaneous nucleation and growth phenomena and the destabilization of film boiling...|$|R
