The suitability of making Nd directly from Nd 2 O 3 by the FFC Cambridge process seems very attractive.

40|$|Many {{applications}} utilize {{rare earths}} {{as a part}} of their essential composition, such as: Ni-MH batteries, glass screen, magnets, fluorescent lightning, etc. These reactive elements are normally found as an oxide compound due to their affinity with oxygen. Their oxide formation exhibits a high standard free energy, which make them really stable. Consequently, extracting rare earths cannot be easily done with a simple acid-base reaction. It has been known that there are two reduction ways to extract rare earth, metallothermic reduction and molten salt electrolysis process. Metallothermic method is determined by standard free energy formation, melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure, viscosity, and density. As for molten salt electrolysis, it is not only determined with those factors, but also a <b>decomposition</b> <b>potential.</b> Molten salt or fused salt is used as an electrolyte, because it has an excellent electric conductivity, heat capacity, and can also act as a solvent. This work presents a comprehensive study on thermodynamic considerations of molten salt electrolysis for rare earth metals. Related publications 2 ̆ 7 results are analyzed and summarized. It reveals that a mixture of molten salts can help reduce the melting point (at its eutectic point) and increase their electric conductivity. Furthermore, rare earth fluoride as a solvent can help increase the rare earth oxide solubility as the feed, while alkali metals exhibit a contrast result. A higher temperature also result in higher solubility. In chloride molten salt electrolysis, a stable divalent ion will be produced and result in a low current efficiency.

40|$|Tese de mestrado. Biologia (Microbiologia aplicada). Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2014 Piriformospora indica is a root-colonizing {{endophytic}} fungus, {{belonging to}} the order Sebacinales (phylum Basidiomycota), that promotes plant growth and confers resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. The colonization of barley (Hordeum vulgare) roots by this fungus begins with a biotrophic growth phase, followed by a necrotrophic phase in which root cells are actively killed by the fungus. In this work we subjected the fungus to various C concentrations and sources (glucose and sucrose) {{in order to understand}} how C availability and source influence its life strategy. By varying C/N ratios (but not the C source), two morphologically and physiologically distinct phenotypes were discerned: a “compact” phenotype (low C/N conditions) and an “explorer” phenotype (high C/N conditions). Our results showed that the compact phenotype of P. indica has a higher <b>decomposition</b> <b>potential</b> than the explorer phenotype. Next, both phenotypes were tested in two hosts: maize (Zea mays) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). When colonizing the hosts, the phenotypes were indistinguishable and readapted their physiology to their new environments. Furthermore, both phenotypes were exposed to root exudates and soil extracts (two important elements of the rhizosphere), as well to TiO 2 nanoparticles (which had been suggested to enhance fungal performance) and again physiologically characterized. All three treatments affected the physiology of P. indica’s compact phenotype (low C/N conditions) but did not alter the normal physiology of P. indica’s explorer phenotype. While treatments with soil extracts and TiO 2 nanoparticles exerted a repressor effect on the fungal <b>decomposition</b> <b>potential,</b> exposure to root exudates stimulated the fungus’ ability to decompose N and P.

Clearfell forestry in Tasmanian wet eucalypt forest involves felling of all timber followed by a high intensity regeneration burn to provide a receptive mineral seedbed for seedling growth. Bacterial carbon production and cellulose <b>decomposition</b> <b>potential</b> (together referred to as OM processing) were measured seasonally 3 – 5 years before and 2 – 4 years after harvesting in each stream. We employed a staircase design (staggered harvesting treatments) within a multiple before–after control–impact design to distinguish harvesting effects from natural variation. Clearfell harvesting raised the yearly mean water temperature by between 0. 25 °C and 0. 94 °C, and raised the maximum water temperature by between 0. 84 and 1. 6 °C. Rates of cellulose decomposition were not significantly correlated with sediment temperature but bacterial carbon production showed weak, significant correlations with temperature in fine (r = 0. 20, P = 0. 01, n = 137) and coarse gravel sediment (r = 0. 39, P < 0. 001, n = 137). The response in OM processing to clearfell harvesting differed between years and among benthic habitats. In coarse gravel habitat, {{there was a significant}} decrease in rates of cellulose <b>decomposition</b> <b>potential</b> in the 2 nd and 4 th year after harvesting, and a significant decrease in bacterial carbon production in the 3 rd year after harvesting. However, we found a significant increase in rates of bacterial carbon production of fine sediment habitat in the 2 nd and 4 th year after harvesting. The contrasting response of OM processing between habitats indicates that habitat-specific changes occur after clearfell harvesting, which inhibit attempts to quantitatively predict downstream cumulative effects.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis has been to {{determine}} the usable voltage range of carbon-based supercapacitors (SC). Supercapacitors are a relatively new type of capacitors with a vast increase in capacitance compared to capacitors which utilize a dielectric as charge separator. A SC consists of two electrodes and an electrolyte separating the electrodes. The charges are stored by electrostatic forces in the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte, forming the so called electrochemical double-layer (EDL). With porous electrodes the effective surface area of the interfacial zone can be made very large, giving SCs a large storage capacity. The limiting factors of a SC is the <b>decomposition</b> <b>potential</b> of the electrolyte and the decomposition of the electrodes. For commercially manufactured SCs the electrolyte is usually an organic solvent, which has a <b>decomposition</b> <b>potential</b> of up to 2. 7 - 2. 8 V. Compared to aqueous electrolytes with a thermodynamic limit of 1. 23 V. The drawback of using non-aqueous electrolytes {{is that they are}} not environmentally friendly, and they increase the production cost. It is claimed that the voltage range can be up to 1. 9 V using aqueous electrolytes. Some researchers have focused on aqueous electrolytes for these reasons. In this thesis two different electrolytes were tested to determine if the voltage range could be extended. The experiments were conducted using a three electrode cell and performing cyclic voltammogram measurements (CV). The carbon electrodes were made of  two different sources of grahite, battery graphite or exfoliated graphite, and nano fibrilated cellulose was added to increase the mechanical stability. The results show that the oxidation potential of the carbon electrode was the positive limit. A usable potential of about 1 V was shown. However, when cycling the electrodes to potentials below the decomposition limit, for hydrogen evolution, interesting effects were seen. A decrease in reaction kinetics, indicating a type of conditioning of the electrode was observed. An increase in charge storage capacitance was also observed when comparing the initial measurements with the final, probably corresponding to an increase in porosity.

40|$|A strong {{connection}} to the landscape means that small headwater stream metabolism is easily disturbed by land management practices such as forestry. A current landscape ecology framework, the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm, was applied to examine the heterogeneity of small headwater stream metabolism {{and how it is}} affected by anthropogenic disturbance. Metabolism was examined at several scales to elucidate specific metabolic components and processes, including microbial community structure, bacterial carbon productivity, cellulose <b>decomposition</b> <b>potential,</b> algal accumulation, and ecosystem respiration and productivity. Firstly, in-stream metabolic patch dynamics was examined throughout a calendar year. Small headwater streams displayed very low metabolic rates dominated by heterotrophic processes. Predictable spatial and temporal patterns in population-level, community-level, and whole system-level metabolisms were observed, shaped by temperature, hydrology, and the physical and chemical properties of patches. Secondly, an inundation experiment was conducted to examine metabolic patch dynamics in a small headwater landscape. Inundation resulted in increased metabolic response and a change in the metabolic community profile of the terrestrial patch. It is suggested that regular, above-bank flows are likely to transfer the complexities of in-stream patch dynamics into the terrestrial environment, exemplifying the strong connection between headwater streams and the surrounding landscape. Thirdly, the impact of forestry on stream metabolism was examined by a survey of small headwater streams 2 - 5 years after logging. Forestry stimulated autotrophy and lead to increased metabolic rates. Methods that incorporate temporal variability, such as cellulose <b>decomposition</b> <b>potential,</b> provided a strong assessment of forestry impact and are recommended as robust indicators of disturbance. Fourthly, the potential recovery of stream metabolism from the impacts of forestry was examined by a survey of small headwater streams 2 - 15 years after logging. Only autotrophic processes displayed recovery over time, with a sustained change in heterotrophic form and function. It is suggested that, together, these surveys demonstrate a lack of resistance and resilience to forestry disturbance in the key metabolic processes of small headwater streams. Finally, through the description of metabolic patterns a metabolic ‘signature’ of small headwater streams is presented. The metabolic signature provides a characterisation of small headwater stream metabolism and contributes to our understanding of small headwater stream ecology...|$|E
