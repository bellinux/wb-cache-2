25|$|The {{terminal}} houses ten international gates {{that are}} capable of dual jet bridge loading and unloading. The gates contain two exit configurations depending on the arriving flight. Domestic arrivals follow an upper path directly into the terminal while international arrivals proceed downstairs to customs and immigration screening. The Customs and Border Protection processing center located in the terminal's lower level is designed to accommodate as many as 3,200 passengers per hour. International arriving passengers connecting to another flight are screened by TSA at a dedicated screening checkpoint within the international arrivals facility. Those passengers then <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> back {{into the center of the}} A concourse. Passengers arriving from international destinations who end their trip in Detroit (or connecting to a flight via North Terminal) <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> into a dedicated International Arrivals Hall on the lower level of the terminal.|$|E

5000|$|Hradčanská (...) is a Prague Metro {{station on}} Line A, between Dejvická and Malostranská stations. It {{is named after}} Hradčany, the {{district}} where Prague Castle is located (hrad means [...] "castle" [...] in Czech). However, the Castle itself is quite far from the station. This station originally had only one exit toward Milady Horákové street. It now has multiple exits on this street, on each site of the tram tracks. There is now also an <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> onto Dejvická street.|$|E
50|$|Early in {{the space}} shuttle program, NASA used the Plane Mate system of mobile lounge to move astronauts {{directly}} from the orbiter to crew facilities. A modified vehicle obtained from Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport in Baltimore, Maryland was used for shuttle landings at Edwards Air Force Base. A similar vehicle was used at the Kennedy Space Center to take astronauts directly from the orbiter to the Operations and Checkout building, where the vehicle was again lifted up for the astronauts to <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> onto the 2nd floor of the facility.|$|E

The southern edge of the CDP follows Interstate 96, which has no <b>exits</b> <b>directly</b> serving the community. Downtown Lansing is 12 mi to the southeast.|$|R
25|$|The {{fundamental}} principle of modern roundabouts is that entering drivers {{give way to}} traffic within the roundabout {{without the use of}} traffic signals. Traffic circles typically require circling drivers to give way to entering traffic. Generally, <b>exiting</b> <b>directly</b> from the inner lane of a multi-lane roundabout is permitted, given that the intersecting road has as many lanes as the roundabout. By contrast, exiting from the inner lane of a traffic circle is usually not permitted without first merging to the circle's outside lane.|$|R
25|$|The sublingual glands are a pair {{of major}} salivary glands located {{inferior}} to the tongue, anterior to the submandibular glands. The secretion produced is mainly mucous in nature; however, it is categorized as a mixed gland. Unlike the other two major glands, the ductal system of the sublingual glands does not have intercalated ducts and usually does not have striated ducts either, so saliva <b>exits</b> <b>directly</b> from 8-20 excretory ducts known as the Rivinus ducts. Approximately 5% of saliva entering the oral cavity comes from these glands.|$|R

50|$|Unlike many Disney dark rides {{that feature}} {{separate}} embarkation and debarkation areas, the Great Movie Ride {{had only a}} single combined unloading and loading area. The last people to exit the vehicles often passed the next group of guests waiting to board the vehicles. At the time the ride was designed (the mid to late 1980s), it was common throughout the theme park industry to have all major rides exit into a store selling merchandise associated with the attraction. The Great Movie Ride, however, did not <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> into a store and instead allowed guests to directly exit back outside into the park.|$|E
50|$|Starting at an {{intersection}} with Interstate 93 and New Hampshire Route 3A {{in the town}} of Bow, just south of the New Hampshire capital city of Concord, the highway runs a northwest path through the Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee Region. One <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> serves Concord (Exit 2) before the highway enters the neighboring town of Hopkinton. east-west New Hampshire Route 11 joins I-89 at Exit 11 and runs concurrently with it for about 3 mi before departing at Exit 12. At Exit 13 in Grantham, New Hampshire Route 10 enters I-89, and the pair of highways form another concurrency, this one for about 15 mi.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, the {{standard}} practice is that private businesses must buy up land near existing exits and {{build their own}} facilities to serve travelers. Such facilities often have tall signs {{that can be seen}} from several miles away (so that travelers have adequate time to make a decision). In turn, it is somewhat harder to visit such private facilities, because one has to first exit the freeway and navigate through several intersections to reach a desired business's parking lot, rather than <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> into a rest area's parking lot. Public rest areas are usually (but not always) positioned so as not to compete with private businesses.|$|E
5000|$|The Texas T avoids {{much of this}} lane-changing by {{providing}} vehicles in the left HOV lane (i.e., buses and carpools) with an <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> from the leftmost lane. Similarly, when entering the expressway, vehicles can merge directly into the leftmost lane. The ramp has a T shape because typically the most important destination for traffic is a transit center or business district located {{to one side of}} the expressway, and the ramp provides access only to and from this side. The bridge does not completely cross the expressway but terminates in the middle, forming a [...] "T." [...] A [...] "dual T-ramp" [...] design also exists, providing HOV lane access to and from both sides of the expressway.|$|E
50|$|Before Switzerland's {{integration}} into the Schengen Area in 2008, Pier F, {{also known as the}} French Sector, was used exclusively for passengers arriving from, or departing to destinations in France. It has two gates with jet bridges and four bus gates. The French Sector exists as a stipulation of an agreement between France and the Canton of Geneva dating from the 1960s, and enables travel between the neighboring French region of the Pays de Gex and the airport while avoiding Swiss territory and customs. The French Sector area still exists for passengers arriving from French destinations who wish to <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> to French territory and avoid Swiss customs controls, although passport control and immigration checks have been dropped as part of the Schengen Treaty.|$|E
50|$|The {{increased}} interest in and ownership of the automobile continued to change the Near East Side, as sprawl, regional shopping centers, and suburbs altered the character of cities. Two {{of the most dramatic}} events in the Near East were the construction of the interstate highways in the 1960s; Interstate 71 North and South, and Interstate 70 East and West. The new construction served as a hard barrier to the area, which further separated Broad Street from the rest of downtown. However, highway <b>exits</b> <b>directly</b> into the area further spurred development and simultaneously ended the use of Broad St as the main East-West travel road.|$|R
5000|$|For {{a typical}} late 20th-century power plant, {{superheated}} steam from the boiler is delivered through 14 - 16 in diameter piping at [...] and 1000 F to the high-pressure turbine, where it falls in pressure to [...] and to 600 F in temperature through the stage. It exits via 24 - 26 in diameter cold reheat lines and passes {{back into the}} boiler, where the steam is reheated in special reheat pendant tubes back to 1000 F. The hot reheat steam is conducted to the intermediate pressure turbine, where it falls in both temperature and pressure and <b>exits</b> <b>directly</b> to the long-bladed low-pressure turbines and finally exits to the condenser.|$|R

50|$|To {{preserve}} the Tower Theater, {{it was necessary}} for Corrigan Tower to build around the structure along Pacific Avenue. A new fire stair for evacuation of the theater balcony was constructed, which led from the balcony through the building to St. Paul Street. Corrigan Tower was separated by a 20 ft light well to {{preserve the}} north façade of the Tower Petroleum Building. The two buildings shared a wall only at the easternmost bay, which allowed occupants of Corrigan Tower to <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> into Tower Petroleum and access the building’s fire stair. The entrance to the building was located on St. Paul Street (although patrons could also enter through the Tower Petroleum Building), and the lobby featured 5 high speed elevators. The building became a popular location for insurance and financial service tenants.|$|E
50|$|In {{the upper}} part of the {{vertebral}} column, spinal nerves <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> from the spinal cord, whereas in the lower part of the vertebral column nerves pass further down the column before exiting. The terminal portion of the spinal cord is called the conus medullaris. The pia mater continues as an extension called the filum terminale, which anchors the spinal cord to the coccyx. The cauda equina (“horse’s tail”) is the name for the collection of nerves in the vertebral column that continue to travel through the vertebral column below the conus medullaris. The cauda equina forms as a result of the fact that the spinal cord stops growing in length at about age four, even though the vertebral column continues to lengthen until adulthood. This results in the fact that sacral spinal nerves actually originate in the upper lumbar region. The spinal cord can be anatomically divided into 31 spinal segments based on the origins of the spinal nerves.|$|E
5000|$|Texas freeways haveon heavily {{traveled}} {{since their}} 1948 beginnings with a several-mile stretch of Houston's Gulf Freeway, {{and are often}} under construction {{to meet the demands}} of continuing growth. As of 2005, there were 79,535 miles of public highway in Texas (up from 71,000 in 1984). Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) planners have sought ways to reduce rush hour congestion, primarily through High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes for vans and carpools. The [...] "Texas T", an innovation originally introduced in Houston, is a ramp design that allows vehicles in the HOV lane, which is usually the center lane, to <b>exit</b> <b>directly</b> to transit centers or to enter the freeway directly into the HOV lane without crossing multiple lanes of traffic. Timed freeway entrances, which regulate the addition of cars to the freeway, are also common. Houston and San Antonio have extensive networks of freeway cameras linked to transit control centers to monitor and study traffic.|$|E

25|$|NY434 begins {{south of}} the village of Owego at an {{intersection}} with NY96. The highway heads to the east as a two-lane road, closely paralleling the Southern Tier Expressway (NY17) as it runs along {{the southern edge of}} the Susquehanna River valley. The first junction along the route leads to exit64, the first of three <b>exits</b> <b>directly</b> connecting NY434 to the nearby freeway. Continuing on, NY434 serves a housing tract and a cluster of commercial properties at the southeastern edge of the village before heading into less developed areas of the town. For most of the next , NY434 runs directly alongside the eastbound lanes of the freeway, separated by only a fence in all but a handful of areas.|$|R
