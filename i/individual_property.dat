The most significant bill, {{and the one that}} generated the most debate, was a law giving married women <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> rights {{for the first time in}} state history. Other measures passed during the session included a basic coal safety measure, a common school statute, a measure prohibiting collusive bidding on tobacco, new regulations on grain warehouses, and a law providing free turnpikes. Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention of adolescent criminals. Brown also lobbied for the abolition of the state parole board; when the Assembly refused, Brown vowed to ignore the board's recommendations.|$|E

25|$|Most Shona {{cultures}} had a theoretically communal {{attitude towards}} land ownership; the later European concept of officiating <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> ownership was unheard of. Land {{was considered the}} collective property of all the residents in a given chiefdom, with the chief mediating disagreements and issues pertaining to its use. Nevertheless, male household heads frequently reserved personal tracts for their own cultivation, and allocated smaller tracts to each of their wives. Population growth frequently resulted in the over-utilisation of the existing land, which became greatly diminished {{both in terms of}} cultivation and grazing due to the larger number of people attempting to share the same acreage.|$|E
25|$|Women {{have played}} a pivotal role in Mexico's {{political}} struggles throughout its history, yet their service to the country did not result in political rights until the middle of the twentieth century. Women distinguished themselves in battle and command during the Mexican War of Independence (1810-1821), and also were employed as spies, provocateurs, and seductresses. Newspapers in 1812, harangued women {{to take part in the}} independence effort as they owed their countrymen a debt, for submitting to conquest and subordinating Mexico to Spanish rule. Mexican women did have some rights, including greater property rights, than their counterparts elsewhere in North America. Spanish colonial law, and Mexican law after independence, recognized the separate <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> of a husband and wife, as well as jointly owned property. There were feminist gains between 1800 and 1910, but they were typically individual gains and not a formalized movement.|$|E
25|$|Sulpician priests {{contributed to}} the parish {{community}} during the day, but at night they would return to their institutions. Jean-Jacques Olier attempted to control diverse social groups by having laymen of the community give reports on family life, poverty, and disorder. The Sulpicians were very strict in regards to woman and sexuality {{to the extent that}} they were eventually banned from the seminary unless it was for short visits in the external area with appropriate attire. The Sulpicians accepted aspirants to the company as long as they were priests and had permission from their bishop. The Sulpicians would thus recruit wealthy individuals since Sulpicians did not take vows of poverty. They retained ownership of <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> and were free to dispose their wealth. The Sulpicians soon came to be known for the revival of the parish life, reform of seminary life, and the revitalization of spirituality.|$|E

25|$|Panis in some hymns {{refers to}} merchants, in others to stingy people who hid their wealth {{and did not}} perform Vedic sacrifices. Some {{scholars}} suggest that Panis were semitic traders, but the evidence for this is slim. Professions of warriors, priests, cattle-rearers, farmers, hunters, barbers, vintners and crafts of chariot-making, cart-making, carpentry, metal working, tanning, making of bows, sewing, weaving, making mats of grass and reed are mentioned in the hymns of the Rig Veda. Some of these might have needed full-time specialists. There are references to boats and oceans. Book X of the Rig Veda refers to both eastern and western oceans. <b>Individual</b> <b>property</b> ownership did not exist and clans as a whole enjoyed rights over lands and herds. Enslavement (dasa, dasi) {{in the course of}} war or as a result of non-payment of debt is mentioned. However, slaves worked in households rather than production-related activities.|$|E
25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are times when {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|In Islam, {{there is}} no coverture, an idea central in European, American {{as well as in}} non-Islamic Asian common law, and the legal basis for the {{principle}} of marital property. An Islamic marriage is a contract {{between a man and a}} woman. A Muslim man and woman do not merge their legal identity upon marriage, and do not have rights over any shared marital property. The assets of the man before the marriage, and earned by him after the marriage, remain his during marriage and in case of a divorce. A divorce under Islamic law does not require redistribution of property. Rather, each spouse walks away from the marriage with his or her <b>individual</b> <b>property.</b> Divorcing Muslim women who did not work outside their home after marriage do not have a claim on the collective wealth of the couple under Islamic law, except for deferred mahr – an amount of money or property the man agrees to pay her before the woman signs the marriage contract.|$|E

500|$|The {{proprietary}} system was entirely {{different in the}} district of Malabar and the states of Cochin and Travancore where communal ownership of land did not exist. Instead, land was <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> mostly owned by the landowning gentry, to wit the Namboodiri and Nair people, who did not have to pay land-tax and held extensive freeholds of land rented to tenants for agricultural puroposes. [...] In return the Nairs supplied the king with fighting men in times of war while the Namboodhiris managed the upkeep of Hindu temples. These landlords were somewhat self-sufficient and had their own police and judicial systems such that the personal expenses of the Raja were minimal. However, landlords lost their exemption from the taxes on land if they disposed of it meaning that mortgage of land was more common than sale. Individual propreitorship of land was also common in the Telugu-speaking areas of the Presidency. The chieftains of the Telugu-speaking districts had more or less maintained an independent existence for a long time, furnishing the sovereign with armies and equipment in times of war. In return, their right to revenues from land remained unmolested. During the time of the British, most of land in the northern districts of the Presidency were parcelled out among these petty [...] "Rajahs".|$|E

Of the 1,471 <b>individual</b> <b>property</b> acquisitions, about 1,200 were appealed to the courts by the farmowners due to various legal irregularities.
