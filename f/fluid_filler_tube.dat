40|$|ABSTRACT: Traumatic brain {{injuries}} (TBI) caused by shock waves have attracted increased attention {{due to the}} large percentage of combat troops that have sustained such injuries in recent wars. Use of advanced body armor has decreased the number of fatalities due to ballistic impacts after explosions, increasing the percentage of observed non-fatal {{brain injuries}} from blast waves. A new design concept for a combat helmet liner is proposed that introduces solid and <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> materials inside channels in the foam liner to improve the attenuation of incoming shock waves.

40|$|Nature {{is replete}} with {{examples}} of embedded microvascular systems that enable efficient fluid flow and distribution for autonomic healing, cooling, and energy harvesting. The ability to incorporate microvascular networks in functional materials systems is therefore both scientifically and technologically important. In this PhD thesis, the direct-write assembly of planar and 3 D biomimetic microvascular networks within polymer and hydrogel matrices is demonstrated. In addition, the influence of network design of fluid transport efficiency is characterized. 	Planar microvascular networks composed of periodic lattices of uniformal microchannels and hierarchical, branching architectures are constructed by direct-write assembly of a fugitive organic ink. Several advancements are required to facilitate their patterning, including pressure valving, dual ink printing, and dynamic pressure variation to allow tunable control of ink deposition. The hydraulic conductance is measured using a high pressure flow meter {{as a function of}} network design. For a constant vascular volume and areal coverage, 2 - and 4 -generation branched architectures that obey Murray's Law exhibited the highest hydraulic conductivity. These experimental observations are in good agreement with predictions made by analytic models. 	 3 D microvascular networks are fabricated by omnidirectional printing a fugitive organic ink into a photopolymerizable hydrogel matrix that is capped with <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> of nearly identical composition. Using this approach, 3 D networks of arbitrary design can be patterned. After ink deposition is complete, the matrix and <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> are chemically cross-linked via UV irradiation, and the ink is removed by liquefication. Aqueous solutions composed of a triblock copolymer of polyethylene oxide (PEO) -polypropylene oxide (PPO) -PEO constitute the materials system of choice due to their thermal- and concentration-dependent phase behavior. Specifically, the fugitive ink consists of a 23 w/w% PEO-PPO-PEO (Pluronic F 127) solution, while matrix (25 w/w%) and <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> (20 w/w%) are composed of an acrylate-modified form of the Pluronic F 127 that can be subsequently photopolymerized. The ink and matrix concentrations exceed the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 22 w/w% and thus reside in a physical gel state. At their respective concentrations, they possess an elastic plateau modulus G' > 104 Pa needed for ink filament formation, shape retention, and support during the printing process. By contrast, the <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> is formulated below the CMC to facilitate its flow into void spaces created as the nozzle translates through the matrix during printing. After printing is completed, photopolymerization is carried out to yield a chemically cross-linked matrix from which the fugitive ink is removed leaving behind the desired 3 D microvascular network. 	 Due to the potential application of 3 D microvasularized hydrogels in tissue engineering, dye diffusion through the cured Pluronic F 127 -diacrylate matrix is investigated via fluorescent microscopy. Image analysis is used to extract diffusion profiles of the dye as a function of time. Extraction of the 1 -D Gaussian fitting parameters is used to determine the spatial peak variance  2 and plotted as a function of time to determine the dye diffusivity...|$|R

The majority of TBIs were caused by exposure to blast waves. Use of advanced body armor has decreased the number of fatalities due to impacts after the explosions, {{increasing the number of}} observed non-fatal brain injuries from the blast waves. A large number of TBIs due to impact hits are also reported in skiers, bicyclists, football players etc. A new design concept for the helmet liners is being proposed that introduces solid or <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> material in channels inside the helmet liner. The main emphasis has been to improve the attenuation of incoming shock waves in the Army helmets; however, some impacts studies were also carried out for sports helmets. Directed blast experiments in collaboration with Purdue University and numerical studies using the ConWep module available in ABAQUS v 6. 10 are carried out. <b>Fluid</b> <b>fillers</b> are modeled using the coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) functionality of ABAQUS. Preliminary results using flat plate sandwich structures with rectangular channels show that the use of high density filler material results in higher levels of blast mitigation. The peak transmitted overpressure is substantially reduced, while the duration of the positive pressure pulse and the rise time are increased leading to reduced pressure gradients. <b>Fluid</b> <b>filler</b> materials were also found to be promising. Viscosity was not found to be a potential mechanism for blast mitigation as hypothesized. No significant advantage of using circular or criss-cross channel geometries was observed. Prototypes of the first design of the helmet liner with channels have been fabricated, and their testing is under way. Development of a numerical model to observe the response to blast of the modified liner coupled with the Army's Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) and a human head is also currently in progress. Experimental impact studies were carried out comparing POC ski helmets with standard ski helmets. Over multiple impacts, POC ski helmets showed substantially lower peak accelerations.

The purpose of this project is the advancement of the knowledge in the field of shock wave mitigation strategies {{and the development of a}} helmet liner for protection against blast induced trauma. The proposed helmet liner design is based on the introduction of solid and <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> materials inside channels opened in the interior of a foam liner in order to enhance the attenuation of incoming shock waves. Primary investigated attenuation mechanisms include acoustic impedance mismatches between the filler and foam material interfaces, viscous effects of <b>fluid</b> <b>fillers,</b> porosity and particle size of solid filler materials. Specific goals of this research project include the reduction of the peak pressure and pressure gradient of the transmitted wave through the helmet liner and the enhancement of the spatial distribution of the energy of the incoming shock wave. (cont.) This research effort employed both shock tube experiments and numerical studies in order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed helmet liner design. Quantitative results have shown that the use of high density filler materials result in higher attenuation levels than low density materials while comparing to solid foam control samples. The peak transmitted overpressure and pressure gradient were significantly reduced with the use of high density materials while the duration of the positive phase was increased. This response resulted in lower overall impulse values of the transmitted wave. The use of high density filler materials also results in superior frequency distribution. by George Alexander Christou.

The foam-filled thin-walled circular tube was fabricated with high strength steel as its shell and polyurethane (PU) foam as its core. The PU foam was processed with an incorporation of kenaf fiber and recycled rubber particles at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % composition, respectively. The PU foam was produced based on three different fixed densities such as 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 gcm- 3. Foam compression test results indicated that composite foams with 6 % filler content exhibit better mechanical properties than polyurethane foam itself.

A comprehensive model which accounts for thermal transport in the molten-salt heat transfer <b>fluid</b> and the <b>filler</b> material in the tank is developed for exploring the effects of boundary conditions on thermocline performance. Heat loss from the tank under non-adiabatic boundary conditions is found to distort the temperature and salt flow distributions relative to the uniform conditions found in adiabatic thermoclines; as a result, the outflow temperature drops more rapidly in the former case. Such effects of non-adiabatic boundaries become insignificant at large salt-flow Reynolds numbers. As the Reynolds number increases beyond 250, the discharge efficiency of non-adiabatic thermoclines approaches that of the adiabatic counterparts.

The potential sources for {{the origin of the}} gases might be incomplete out-gassing process prior to filler application; re-gasification due to seal leakage in the filler applicator; and/or volatiles evolved from cure reaction products formed in the hardening process. We embarked on a study that involved conducting laboratory experiments with imaging diagnostics in order to deduce the seriousness of bubbling caused by entrained air and volatile fluids under space vacuum and low gravity environment. We used clear fluids with the similar physical properties as the epoxy-like filler material to mimic the dynamics of bubbles. Another aspect {{of the present study was}} to determine the likelihood of bubbling resulting from dissolved gases nucleating from solution. These experimental studies of the bubble expansion are compared wit...|$|R
40|$|The {{storage system}} in a {{concentrated}} solar plant is considered an important concern to increase the capacity factor of the plant by producing power during the night or in cloudy days. This paper presents different storage materials, and introduces several storage systems available. Moreover, the paper {{is focused on the}} analysis of a thermocline system, which consists on a single tank that typically works with molten salt and quartzite rock as storage media. A simulation model of heat charging and discharging process is designed with the numerical solution of non dimensional Schumann equations. These equations describe the heat transfer between the thermal <b>fluid</b> and the <b>filler</b> material. The model has been validated with experimental data, and the results have been compared with other models. Then, the proposed model is then used to design an alternative storage system for the solar plant AndaSol I. Moreover, the model has been used analyze the influence of the ratio between height and diameter of the tank in the energy storage efficiency. Finally, a comparison between three thermal storage fluids has been made in order to find out which Heat Transfer Fluid is better for the designed thermal storage tank...|$|R
