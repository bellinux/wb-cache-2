It shows {{that there is a}} relation between creation of content and the money collected, using a dataset of campaigns from the Kickstarter platform. Besides this, the study explores the comprehension of the society to these matters. A survey was made in a Higher Education Institution to evaluate if there is an awareness of the society to matters such as crowdfunding and Web 2. 0. The study started with a literature review that sustains this theory followed by the creation of two case studies. One case study made a model that explained relation between Web 2. 0 and a crowdfunding campaigns and another study that studies the awareness of the society to matters such as crowdfunding and Web 2. 0. Interesting conclusions were found, showing that these subjects are still <b>giving</b> the first <b>baby</b> <b>steps</b> and there is relation between some creations of contents, through Web 2. 0, and the money collected in a crowdfunding campaign...|$|R

This article presents the <b>Baby</b> <b>Steps</b> Program model, summaries of screening and referral data, {{and the results}} of 3 focus groups designed to assess the viability of introducing this model in pediatric practices and community health centers. A total of 3, 343 children received developmental screenings over 43 months.

40|$|The baby-step giant-step algorithm, due to Shanks, {{may be used}} {{to solve}} the {{discrete}} logarithm problem in arbitrary groups. The paper explores a generalisation of this algorithm, where extra <b>baby</b> <b>steps</b> may be computed after carrying out giant steps (thus increasing the giant step size). The paper considers the problem of deciding how many, and when, extra <b>baby</b> <b>steps</b> should be computed so that the expected cost of the generalised algorithm is minimised. When the logarithms are uniformly distributed over an interval of length n, the expected cost of the generalised algorithm is 6 % lower than that of Shanks (achieved at the expense of a slightly larger worst case cost). In some situations where logarithms are far from uniformly distributed, any baby-step giant-step algorithm that computes all its <b>baby</b> <b>steps</b> before taking a giant step must have innite expected cost, but the generalised algorithm has nite expected cost. The results are heuristic, but are supported by eviden [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Parents {{of young}} {{children}} often want to keep a variety of records on their children‟s early years, {{for the purposes of}} preservation of memories or at the request of their pediatrician. However, time constraints, motivation, and forgetfulness may hinder their ability to keep consistent records. We developed a system, <b>Baby</b> <b>Steps,</b> which is designed to improve the record-keeping process. In this paper, we present the results of a 3 -month deployment study of this technology with 8 families and their pediatricians. The study showed that when compared to a control condition, experimental design features of <b>Baby</b> <b>Steps</b> encouraged parents to more frequently collect and review records, provided higher confidence in reporting, and improved parent-pediatrician communication.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify the impacts of incentive-based education on the understanding and preparedness of a mother’s prenatal and postpartum experiences. <b>Baby</b> <b>Steps,</b> a non-profit incentive-based education program, was used as the research site. Clients of <b>Baby</b> <b>Steps</b> who have been involved in the program since a time during their pregnancy and who have had their baby between 3 - 12 months ago participated in this study.

40|$|We present three {{approaches}} for unsupervised grammar induction that {{are sensitive to}} data complexity and apply them to Klein and Manning’s Dependency Model with Valence. The first, <b>Baby</b> <b>Steps,</b> bootstraps itself via iterated learning of increasingly longer sentences and requires no initialization. This method substantially exceeds Klein and Manning’s published scores and achieves 39. 4 % accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal corpus. The second, Less is More, uses a low-complexity subset of the available data: sentences up to length 15. Focusing on fewer but simpler examples trades off quantity against ambiguity; it attains 44. 1 % accuracy, using the standard linguisticallyinformed prior and batch training, beating state-of-the-art. Leapfrog, our third heuristic, combines Less is More with <b>Baby</b> <b>Steps</b> by mixing their models of shorter sentences, then rapidly ramping up exposure to the full training set, driving up accuracy to 45. 0 %. These trends generalize to the Brown corpus; awareness of data complexity may improve other parsing models and unsupervised algorithms. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} “baby steps” is {{well-known}} among psychologists and movie buffs alike. In the classic movie “What About Bob,” Dr. Leo Marvin (played by Richard Dreyfuss) gives to Bob (Bill Murray), a highly dependent and worried individual, {{a copy of}} his book <b>Baby</b> <b>Steps.</b> Dr. Marvin explains, “It means setting small, reasonable goals for yourself. One day at a time, one tiny step at a time—doable, accomplishable goals. ” For many, the concept of “baby steps,” methodically working on simple, constrained pieces of a problem, is a useful approach in solving complex and difficult problems. Unfortunately, accomplishing large goals through small increments can take a considerable amount of time and coordination. And, in the case of solving world hunger, time is up. Prior attempts {{to address the issue of}} hunger have been based on <b>baby</b> <b>steps,</b> and now we must abandon such incremental approaches and focus on large-scale changes. Otherwise, the world will soon see a food crisis like never before. The first part of the paper asserts that increased access to financing is needed for smallholder farmers to help boost farm productivity and reduce food scarcity. The second part, describes a new protocol to an existing convention, the Cape Town Convention (defined below), that some argue will benefit agriculture financing. The paper concludes by considering the actual impact the new protocol would have on small farmers’ ability to reduce food and asserts that while the protocol might end up being a successful one, it is still just a <b>baby</b> <b>step</b> toward the stated goal of eliminating world hunger...|$|R
