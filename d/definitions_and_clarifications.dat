It also adds a new analysis of the scaling properties of routereflectors and confederations, leading to a new conclusion that route-reflection and confederations scale equally well in the general case and that the choice of the scaling technique employed by a network needs to be made on a basis other than the scalability metric we have analyzed. 2 Terminology [1] measures "scaling" in terms of the maximum number of BGP sessions any given router in the network must support. This is probably the best gross metric of how a BGP network scales. For convenience, we term this scaling metric the "BGP session degree" of a network. In addition, we introduce the term "CBGP" to mean "confederation-EBGP". 3 Corrections 3. 1 Tree Topologies [1] states in Section 2. 2 (paragraph 2) tha...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{financial}} globalisation in historical perspective, and its key contribution is to demonstrate the J-curve as an alternative depiction of financial globalisation since the classical Gold Standard period. As a preliminary and essential step, some <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarifications</b> on globalisation are provided in a literature review. Then, fundamental issues are considered to assess financial globalisation, so that both the goals and {{the boundaries of the}} thesis are clearly stated. Throughout the historical period in debate, there were two waves of financial globalisation: the first one occurring during the 1870 - 1914 period, and the second lasting {{from the end of the}} Bretton Woods agreements until the present day. The dominant approach in economics asserts that the degree of commercial and financial integration corresponds over time to a U-shaped pattern, i. e. markets presented high levels of integration during the forty years before WWI. Then, this integration collapsed in the years between the wars, recovering gradually after the Bretton Woods agreements until it reached again in the 1990 s the same pre- 1914 level of integration. The thesis approaches this model focusing on the financial side. Then, according to the U-curve, contemporary financial globalisation is not unprecedented. This thesis proposes an alternative view. In contrast to the mainstream U-curve, the empirical data provided indicates that today???s financial integration is unprecedented and more pervasive in some key financial markets than it was during the pre- 1914 era. The empirical evidence provided proposes that a J-shaped pattern is a more appropriate way to interpret how financial markets have evolved since the late 19 th century. The Jshape suggests that in some financial achieved a huge surge from the 1990 s to 2005, surpassing the previous level of integration. So, in these markets, contemporary financial globalisation is unprecedented from the 1990 s onwards. The J-curve does not mean that all financial markets became more globalised during the late 20 th century in comparison to the Gold Standard era, but only some that presented the U-shape from 1870 to 1995. Qualitative aspects of the J-curve are examined. The different institutional frameworks underlying each historical period are discussed revealing that new institutional arrangements, policy changes, technological advances in ICT and a wide range of financial innovations are the key driving forces that have spurred today???s financial globalisation to higher levels than in the past. Finally, the last chapter assesses the key macroeconomic implications of this new era for the world economy...|$|E

40|$|M. A. Our main {{objective}} in this M. A dissertation was to detect, define {{and evaluate the}} role, the function and {{the contribution of the}} Greek Press to the preservation of the national identity of the Hellenes in South Africa. Furthermore, to establish the Greek Press’ contribution to the salvage and the spreading of the Greek language and the Greek civilisation – the national and cultural heritage of the Hellenes – in the framework of the Greek Diaspora. For this purpose, besides the studying of the Greek newspapers, booklets and magazines, which are, naturally, our main source we, have considered it necessary to give <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarifications</b> to words, ideas and terms related to our study field. This will enable us to gain a deeper and better understanding of the subject and will assist us to give the most appropriate answers to the questions set out in the introductory note. Thus, following the planned scheme of work and applying the historical and comparative method of research work, this study has taken the following form: In the first chapter important terms were examined, meanings and definitions were established, like «istoria-history» and «glossa-language» etc. The communicative function of the language was explained and the term «media» was discussed extensively. More definitions were given on other terms like «Typos-Press» and «efimerida-newspaper» as well as a concise review {{of the history of the}} Greek Press in general. The contents of a Greek political newspaper were discussed, as well as the different forms of its function. Finally information was given on the Greek Press of the Diaspora and specifically on the Greek Press of Australia and Canada. The second chapter contains a concise History of Hellenism in South Africa as it is found written partially in books, research works, articles of Greek writers in South Africa and other historiographers. Here we have also examined the relationship between Greece and the Greek Community of South Africa, through the years. We discussed the meaning and the importance of Archives in general, with emphasis on the Archives of Hellenism in South Africa, «work in progress», and gave a historical review of the South African Greek Press. In the third chapter a list of the names of all the Greek newspapers, booklets and magazines published in South Africa and the former Rhodesia has been given in a chronological order. Examples and details of their appearance as well as the contents of the most long-standing ones are presented, with emphasis on the Nea Hellas of K. G. Nicolaidis. In the fourth chapter, which covers 100 years of Greek journalism in South Africa, we have presented the analysis of four representative newspapers, which are attached at the end of this MA-dissertation. Specifically, we have analysed a copy of Nea Hellas of 1919, of Africanis and Nea Hellas of 1950, of the Greek Press of South Africa of 1999 and of Hellenica Nea of 2002. We have analyzed them page by page and have commented on the most important themes/issues. The fifth chapter has covered the role and the function of the Greek Press of the Diaspora. By studying mainly the Greek newspapers we have established and assessed the role, function and the contribution of the South African Greek Press, and emphasized the importance of it by comparing it with the Greek Press of other countries of the Diaspora. Ιn the epilogue, the conclusions of this study are presented, as well as the very special characteristics of the South African Greek Press. Consequently, we followed the development of the journalism in South Africa, from K. G. Nicolaidis to Takis and Minas Constantopoulos and observed the shift of priorities on the themes of the newspapers, according to the needs of the Hellenes in South Africa, on the different times of their history. In general, we have found out that the Greek Press of the Diaspora, in South Africa and the former Rhodesia was a periodical Press, published twice a week, but never daily. The most common form of publication is the weekly and the fortnightly. In some cases monthly, every three months or even six months. Its main aims were the providing of news of Greece and news of the Community, its availability as means of communication among the Greeks in South Africa and other countries of Africa and also to provide educational and entertaining material. It is a Greek Press that has patriotic and advisory characteristics. It is the Greek Press of the Diaspora, like earlier on, the Greek Press of Tergesti and Oddysou, Smyrna and Egypt, as well as the Greek Press of Australia, Canada, the United States of America and of other countries of the Neo-Hellenic Diaspora. By studying the newspapers, the old and the new, the minor and the major, searching through the news, the articles and other publications, we rocognize those Hellenes that built churches, schools, Sporting Clubs and Old Age Homes. We understand the agony, the sorrows and the happiness of the Greeks of all generations in South Africa. We establish that they are the same Hellenes that always gave generously, not only to the needy in the motherland - Greece, but to the ones in South Africa as well. Τoday, the Greek Press in South Africa, consists of the newspaper, Hellenic News and a few community or other organizational magazines/ booklets. It is battling to survive under very limited subscriptions and not many advertisements, due to the drastic «dwindling» of the Community, mainly over the last two decades. We hope that these problems will be resolved with the assistance of the various Greek establishments in South Africa, as well as by more Greek subscribers, so that this Greek Press can continue offering its most valuable services to Hellenism in South Africa...|$|E

40|$|Zoroastrianism {{was founded}} by the prophet Zarathushtra ca 1400 to 1200 BCE and is {{generally}} acknowledged as the world 2 ̆ 7 s oldest monotheistic and revealed religion. It dominated three great Iranian empires, and influenced Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Mahayana Buddhism. At one point in time, their numbers surely seemed limitless.

This is an examination of the decline and subsequent change of this previously influential and vital religion. Zoroastrians have been able to maintain the major tenets of their practices and beliefs without much interruption for millennia. However, with more and more Zoroastrians moving into the global economy and the Western culture, secularization, modernity, and loss of an extensive, immediate community are causing new beliefs to be adopted and/or advanced by some of the faith. This shift in beliefs and values is causing disunity among members of the faith. Today Zoroastrian communities are on all inhabited continents and many different countries within those continents. This has forced the Zoroastrian communities worldwide into introspection, <b>definition,</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarification.</b> Contemporary Zoroastrians differ over how to keep their beloved faith alive and how to best remain true to its heritage and sustain its 2 ̆ 2 purity. 2 ̆ 2 There are currently two substantial efforts to maintain the identity of Zoroastrianism, characteristically reflecting an orthodox and a liberal approach. As criteria for evaluating the Zoroastrianism of modern day, I will utilize Steve Bruce 2 ̆ 7 s discussions of secularizations and its effects on religions as reasons for the current changes of the Zoroastrian faith.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To propose {{an initial}} agenda for a {{systematic}} international research strategy {{designed to meet}} the information needs of injury prevention worldwide. CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION OF ARTICLES: The world literature since 1977 was surveyed to obtain an overview of the current research effort on injury epidemiology and prevention.

CONCLUSIONS: There has been a recent upsurge of interest in injury prevention, although much of the work has been descriptive rather than analytical or evaluative. The implementation of existing knowledge has been patchy. To meet the information needs of effective injury prevention, several elements of an international research agenda are proposed.

Instead of working around these methodological issues, I chose to tackle them head on instead, focusing on some of the areas in SNA which lacked further research. This entails that the thesis has less of an appeal for practitioners as originally intended, aiming almost exclusively at fellow academics. The multi-disciplinary nature of SNA can be considered as both its strength and weakness. Strength, because the cross-fertilization and development in separate fields have made many of the advances in SNA possible. Weakness, because of the problems with common <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> conceptual <b>clarifications.</b> These strengths <b>and</b> weaknesses have influenced the structure this thesis, and have led to its somewhat eclectic constellation: The main part of the thesis consists of fiv...|$|R
5000|$|For Plato and Aristotle, {{dialectic}} involves persuasion, so when Aristotle {{says that}} rhetoric is the antistrophe of dialectic, he means that rhetoric as {{he uses the}} term has a domain or scope of application that is parallel to, but different from, the domain or scope of application of dialectic. In Nietzsche Humanist (1998: 129), Claude Pavur explains that [...] "the Greek prefix 'anti' does not merely designate opposition, {{but it can also}} mean 'in place of.'" [...] When Aristotle characterizes rhetoric as the antistrophe of dialectic, he no doubt means that rhetoric is used in place of dialectic when we are discussing civic issues {{in a court of law}} or in a legislative assembly. The domain of rhetoric is civic affairs and practical decision making in civic affairs, not theoretical considerations of operational <b>definitions</b> of terms <b>and</b> <b>clarification</b> of thought. These, for him, are in the domain of dialectic.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how EFL learners managed their real time interaction in a computer-mediated communication (CMC) environment called Schmooze University MOO. Fourteen undergraduates enrolled at two universities in Tokyo {{took part in}} weekly text chat sessions over a semester. Four task types were implemented; information-gap, jigsaw, decision-making and opinion-exchange. Qualitative data such as transcripts, field notes and questionnaires were analyzed {{within the framework of}} a case study. Findings indicated that the subjects actively managed their interaction, monitored their linguistic output, supported each other and exercised autonomy. Analysis of the transcripts revealed that the subjects consistently produced coherent target language output focused on the tasks, while at the same time, overcoming the challenge of communicating effectively in a new online environment. They achieved this considerable feat in part, by utilizing features of the environment designed to facilitate interaction. Moreover, they utilized a mix of transactional and interactional discourse management strategies that have been identified in the literature on native speaker interaction in real time CMC. Transactional strategies identified in the data were addressivity, time saving and feedback. Interactional strategies were the use of pseudonyms, positive and negative politeness, greetings, leave-takings and off-task discussion. These strategies enabled the subjects to track turns, provide feedback and build the social cohesion necessary for sustained communication in online environments. The analysis showed that as the project progressed, the subjects utilized a greater number and wider range of strategies than in the earlier sessions. The majority of these appeared the result of transfer from conventional forms of communication. However, others were adaptive and appropriate to the online nature of the interaction. These strategies that have not been reported in the literature on learner-learner interaction in CMC, were use of the to command, split turns, suspension dots, quotation and omission. The appearance of these medium induced strategies highlights the subjectsʼ increasingly sophisticated and successful attempts to deal with real time computer-based nature of the interaction. Analysis of the data further revealed that when communication problems arose the subjects overcome them by utilizing communication strategies involved in negotiation of meaning. The most frequent strategies identified in the data were <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>clarification</b> requests followed by self-, other-initiated correction and non-response. The subjects also made limited use of confirmation and comprehension checks. These strategies were more frequent in the jigsaw tasks than in the other task types. The data showed that learner-learner negotiation in this type of CMC broadly follows the model proposed for face-to-face interaction in conventional classrooms. However, analysis indicated that the interplay of proficiency levels, task, the computer-based nature of the interaction and sociocultural concerns appeared to influence the frequency of negotiation...|$|R
40|$|The bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the child marriages that occur mainly in the {{developing}} countries and their various causes and consequences. During such ceremonies is {{one or both of}} the betrothed is less than 18 years old. This work is divided into three chapters and its aim is to answer the question of whether or not children's weddings ultimately violate international standards to protect the rights of the child or not. The theoretical part provides the most important international declarations and conventions containing the rights of the child, published in the 20 th century. The second chapter is devoted directly to discussing marriages of children; contained therein is their <b>definition,</b> <b>and</b> then further <b>clarification</b> of where they occur and what leads parents or guardians of children to marry them. The third chapter {{deals with the}} analysis of violations of international standards to protect the rights of the child, either directly or in connection with the impacts of weddings of teenagers on their lives...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Flavor lexicons are {{a widely}} used tool for documenting and {{describing}} sensory {{perception of a}} selected food. Development of a representative flavor lexicon requires several steps, including appropriate product frame of reference collection, language generation, <b>and</b> designation of <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> references before a final descriptor list can be determined. Once developed, flavor lexicons {{can be used to}} record and define product flavor, compare products, and determine storage stability, as well as interface with consumer liking and acceptability and chemical flavor data. Lexicon characteristics A flavor lexicon is simply a set of words to describe the flavor of a product or commodity. A lexicon is then applied or practiced using descriptive sensory analysis techniques. A lexicon, like a specific technical dictionary, provides a source list to describe a category of products, such as commodities (cheese, beef, fish) or finished products (bread, orange juice, coffee, chocolate). Although the descriptive panel generates its own list to describe the product array under study, a lexicon provides a source of possible terms with references <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> for <b>clarification</b> (see AST...|$|R
