2500|$|The {{trailing}} side of {{the rotary}} engine's combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream which pushes back the flame front. With the conventional one or two-spark-plug system and homogenous mixture, this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber's trailing side in the mid and <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> ranges. Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent , and Toyota obtained a 7% economy improvement by placing a glow-plug in the leading site, and using Reed-Valves in intake ducts. This poor combustion in the trailing side of chamber {{is one of the}} reasons why there is more carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons in a Wankel's exhaust stream. A side-port exhaust, as is used in the Mazda Renesis, avoids one of the causes of this because the unburned mixture cannot escape. The Mazda 26B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark-plug ignition system. (At the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race in 1991, the 26B had significantly lower fuel consumption than the competing reciprocating piston engines. All competitors had the same amount of fuel available due to the Le Mans limited fuel quantity rule.) ...|$|E
50|$|When {{maximum power}} is demanded (<b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and load), intake valve closing timing is retarded to {{synchronize}} the intake air pulsations for larger air volume.|$|E
50|$|The DB 604 was a {{completely}} new Daimler-Benz engine design featuring a perfectly square stroke ratio of 135 mm x 135 mm. The short stroke ratio enabled the relatively <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of 3,200 rpm. The first engine tested in 1939 on the engine test stand achieved a power output of 1,725 kW (2,350 hp).|$|E
50|$|<b>Higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> can be reached, since burning {{continues}} in the prechamber.|$|R
5000|$|... the European {{version was}} {{equipped}} with the pre-production 75-degree crank pin offset for smoother operation at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|V-2K: V-2 with {{increased}} injection pressure and <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> 1939. Used in the KV-1 and KV-2, it produced 600 hp.|$|R
50|$|The {{cast-iron}} {{heads were}} designed with hemispherical combustion chambers {{and a single}} overhead camshaft over each head, operating shaft-mounted roller rocker arms. The valvetrain consisted of valves larger than those on Ford wedge head engines, made out of stainless steel and with sodium-filled exhaust valves to prevent the valve heads from burning, and dual valve springs. This design allowed for high volumetric efficiency at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike a crankshaft, a cam may {{easily have}} more than one throw per rotation. This allows more than one piston stroke per revolution. For {{aircraft}} use, this was an alternative to using a propeller speed reduction unit: <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> for an improved power-to-weight ratio, combined with a slower propeller speed for an efficient propeller. In practice, the cam engine design weighed more than the combination of a conventional engine and gearbox.|$|E
50|$|In a {{compression}} release engine braking {{system for a}} turbocharged internal combustion engine, excessive stress associated with opening the exhaust valves of the engine near top dead center of engine compression strokes when the engine is turning at high speed is prevented by reducing the intake manifold pressure from what it otherwise would be at that high speed. This is done by retarding the turbocharger so that its speed is less than it otherwise would be at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since the {{hydraulic}} pumps are positive-displacement type, the flow rate they deliver is {{directly proportional to}} the <b>speed</b> of the <b>engine.</b> This means that at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> the steering would naturally operate faster than at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Because this would be undesirable, a restricting orifice and flow-control valve direct some of the pump's output back to {{the hydraulic}} reservoir at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> A pressure relief valve prevents a dangerous build-up of pressure when the hydraulic cylinder's piston reaches {{the end of its}} stroke.|$|R
50|$|Centrifugal superchargers add {{additional}} boost as {{the speed}} of the motor increases. This means the centrifugal supercharger will provide more horsepower at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and less boost at lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Engines {{modified}} {{for power}} at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> such as auto racing engines, {{tend to have}} very rough idle unless the idle speed is raised significantly.|$|R
50|$|It {{is still}} a marked {{improvement}} on the inline four, whose pistons stop and start {{all at the same}} time, and is an improvement the inline-six shares with the inline-three - it is also the motivation for Yamaha's adoption of the cross-plane crank in its YZF-R1 motorcycle, with four unique piston phases. Inertial torque is typically only of concern in extreme situations, i.e. high reciprocating mass and / or <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> It can however affect low-speed running and flywheel sizing in any case.|$|E
50|$|Production aircraft, {{designated}} Henley III, entered {{service with}} Nos. 1, 5 and 10 Bombing and Gunnery Schools, {{as well as}} with the Air Gunnery Schools at Barrow, Millom and Squires Gate. Unfortunately, it was soon discovered that unless the aircraft were restricted to an unrealistically low tow speed of 220 mph (355 km/h), the rate of engine failures was unacceptably high, attributed to a cooling system matched to the Henley's original missions but inadequate when towing a target at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> but lower airspeed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the automotive uses listed above (i.e. in two-stroke-engine vehicles and early four-stroke Saabs), freewheels were used in some luxury or up-market conventional cars (such as Rovers and Cords) from the 1930s into the 1960s. Some engines of the period also tended to pass oil past the piston rings under conditions with a closed throttle and <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> when the slight vacuum in the combustion chamber combined with high oil pressure and {{a high degree of}} splash lubrication from the fast-turning crankshaft would lead to oil getting in the combustion chamber.|$|E
5000|$|While small-displacement, short-stroke automomobile {{engines are}} capable of very <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> {{motorcycle}} <b>engines</b> can have even higher redlines because of their comparatively lower reciprocating mass. For example, the 1986-1996 Honda CBR250RR inline 4-stroke has a redline of about 19,000 rpm. (Though due to regulations in Japanese motorcycle manufacturing this was later lowered to 18,000). While 4-stroke engines of small displacement {{are capable of}} very <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> it is once again the lack of useful torque at lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> due to [...] "efficiency" [...] requirements mandating small displacement engines with supposedly reduced emissions that require high speeds.|$|R
50|$|A variable-geometry {{turbocharger}} {{provides an}} improved response at widely-varied <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> With variable-incidence under electronic control, {{it is possible}} to have the turbine reach a good operating speed quickly or at lower <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> without severely diminishing its utility at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{performs}} {{similarly to}} BMW's Valvetronic system but with desmodromic {{control of the}} output cam, allowing VVEL to operate at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> (RPM). Other similar systems are offered Toyota (Valvematic).|$|R
50|$|Variable Geometry Turbomachine {{technology}} {{is used in}} turbocharger of diesel engines, where the turbo has variable vanes which control the flow of exhaust onto the turbine blades. A Variable Geometry Turbocharger has movable vanes which direct the flow of exhaust onto the turbine blades. Actuators are used to adjust the vane angles. Agle of vanes vary hroughout the range of RPM to optimize turbine behaviour. At <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> vanes are fully open and the exhaust is fully directed onto the turbine blades. At low engine speeds vanes are almost closed creating a narrow passage for the exhaust. This accelerates the exhaust towards the turbine blades, making them spin faster.|$|E
50|$|Consider a {{four-stroke}} engine, with a 1-3-4-2 firing order. When {{the exhaust}} manifold is short, the high pressure wave {{from the gas}} emerging immediately after cylinder No. 3’s exhaust valves open, for example, arrives at cylinder No.1 as it finishes its exhaust stroke and enters its intake stroke. As a result, exhaust gas which has just {{moved out of the}} cylinder is forced back inside the combustion chamber, increasing the amount of hot residual gas. With a short exhaust manifold, the high pressure wave arrives at the next cylinder within a short amount of time, causing this adverse effect to continue from low to <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Hence, shorter length causes contamination and produces lesser power.|$|E
50|$|The TDs (Tee Dee or Thimble Drome) {{had very}} high power for {{their size and}} ranged from 0.01 in³ (0.16 cc) to 0.09 in³ (1.5 cc) displacement. They were for serious hobbyists and too temperamental for mass markets.Note, on the Tee Dee shown, that light shows through the {{external}} ports, under the piston (sub induction). This engine cannot run properly with a muffler. Sub induction served to allow extra air into the cylinder at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> This increases the charge of mixture and makes the ignition timing track to engine speed to maintain power over {{a wider range of}} rpm. The cylinder head shown is of the low compression Bee type.|$|E
50|$|Extreme {{oversquare}} {{engines are}} found in Formula One racing cars, where strict rules limit displacement, thereby necessitating that power be achieved through <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> Stroke ratios approaching 2.5:1 are allowed, enabling <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> of 18,000 RPM while remaining reliable for multiple races.|$|R
50|$|The N45 was {{enlarged}} to 2.0 litres, to homologate the E90 320si for the World Touring Car Championship. The N45 {{was chosen}} over the N46, because {{its lack of}} variable valve timing allows <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Later {{versions}} featured DOHC with 16 valves {{for increased}} efficiency at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and a smoother power delivery. The hydraulic lifters are interchangeable between all DOHC RB and VG series engines accepting those with solid lifters.|$|R
50|$|Fuel-air mixture was {{generated}} by a Solex 4A1 carburetor. It is of the double-register type, as with the previous model W114. That means {{each of the two}} sets of mixing systems feeds three cylinders and each of these two sets is composed of a first relatively small mixing system for idling and a second, larger mixing system for higher load and higher speeds. At idle and up to about one-third load only the smaller tube of each set is mechanically operated by the accelerator pedal, while the second tube of each set is enabled by a vacuum cell only at high load and <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> All four (2 x 2) tubes are supplied with fuel by a central float chamber. The engine is equipped with gasoline feed line and gasoline return line (which usually was more typical for fuel injection engines) achieving a cooling effect which protects from vapor locks, that would cause starting problems in hot weather.|$|E
50|$|Variable-Length Intake Manifold (VLIM) is an {{internal}} combustion engine manifold technology.Four common implementations exist. First, two discrete intake runners with different length are employed, and a butterfly valve can close the short path. Second the intake runners can be bent around a common plenum, and a sliding valve separates them from the plenum with a variable length. Straight high-speed runners can receive plugs, which contain small long runner extensions. The plenum of a 6- or 8-cylinder engine can be parted into halves, with the even firing cylinders in one half and the odd firing cylinders in the other part. Both sub-plenums and the air intake are connected to an Y (sort of main plenum). The air oscillates between both sub-plenums, with a large pressure oscillation there, but a constant pressure at the main plenum. Each runner from a sub plenum to the main plenum can be changed in length. For V engines this can be implemented by parting a single large plenum at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> by means of sliding valves into it when speed is reduced.|$|E

50|$|At lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> the {{position}} of the camshaft is moved so the valves are opened later, as this improves idling quality and smooth power development.As the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> increases, the valves are opened earlier: this enhances torque, reduces fuel consumption and lowers emissions.At <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> the valves are opened later again, because this allows full power delivery.|$|R
50|$|A multi-plate wet {{slipper clutch}} {{transfers}} {{power to a}} six-speed, close-ratio transmission ideal for closed-course competition. The back-torque limiter automatically disengages the clutch (partially) under hard downshifting at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to prevent rear wheel hop during corner entry.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Honda {{released}} their Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC) system. Which {{switches to}} a separate cam profile at <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to improve peak power. Later versions added VVT as well as 3 stage valve lift.|$|R
50|$|The {{maximum amount}} of power {{generated}} by an engine {{is determined by the}} {{maximum amount of}} air ingested. The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size (cylinder volume), whether it is a two-stroke engine or four-stroke design, volumetric efficiency, losses, air-to-fuel ratio, the calorific value of the fuel, oxygen content of the air and speed (RPM). The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and lubrication. Valves, pistons and connecting rods suffer severe acceleration forces. At <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> physical breakage and piston ring flutter can occur, resulting in power loss or even engine destruction. Piston ring flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in. Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall, which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power. If an engine spins too quickly, valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves. This is commonly referred to as 'valve float', and it can result in piston to valve contact, severely damaging the engine. At high speeds the lubrication of piston cylinder wall interface tends to break down. This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about 10 m/s.|$|E

40|$|On hybrids of B-heavy oil and {{kerosene}} the {{cetane number}} and performance {{when they are}} applied in a practical diesel engine were studied. 　The results are as follows : (1) When kerosene is 20 % the cetane number is the highest. (2) As the cetane number increases, both the specific fuel consumption and the exhaust gas temperature become low values. (3) At <b>high</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and high power the improvement of engine performance owing to cetane number becomes distinct.

50|$|At <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and torques, the tumble flap {{is opened}} {{to achieve a}} better degree of filling. During this {{homogeneous}} mode of combustion, the engine functions like a conventional fuel injection <b>engine,</b> but with <b>higher</b> efficiency due to the higher compression.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to providing more air at <b>higher</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> the system also creates a swirl in the combustion chamber at lower rpms. The swirl makes for more efficient combustion, and {{is due to the}} asymmetric nature of the airflow with one intake runner closed.|$|R
