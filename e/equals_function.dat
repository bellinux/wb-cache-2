50|$|In calculus, the {{integral}} of any linear combination of <b>functions</b> <b>equals</b> the same linear combination of {{the integral}}s of the functions; this property is known as linearity of integration.

Linearity of integration is related to the linearity of summation, since integrals are thought of as infinite sums.|$|R
