5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E

Mikami stated that his goal was to bring survival horror back to its roots (<b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his last directorial work), as he was disappointed by recent survival horror games for having too much action.|$|E

5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E

25|$|Final Ending (1874) – when Wagner {{finally came}} to set the ending to music in 1874, he reverted to the 1852 revision, but shorn of its closing Feuerbachian lines. Although Wagner never set either the Schopenhauerian or the Feuerbachian lines, he did include them as {{footnotes}} in the final printed edition of the text, together with a note {{to the effect that}} while he preferred the Schopenhauerian lines, he declined to set them because their meaning was better expressed by the music alone. In other words, the ending he finally set to music is Schopenhauerian in its intention <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> never stated explicitly in the libretto.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the more}} {{developed}} countries of Asia and the Pacific, such as Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, have strong records in combating infectious diseases, infectious disease prevalence in South and Southeast Asia {{is almost as}} high as in Sub-Saharan Africa. The health care delivery system of the Asia and Pacific region—the majority of which is privately financed—is particularly vulnerable to economic downturns <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> offset to some degree by much of the region's reliance on traditional medicine from local practitioners. In South and Southeast Asia, reemergent diseases such as TB, malaria, cholera, and dengue fever are rampant, while HIV/AIDS, after a late start, is growing faster {{than in any other}} region.|$|E

25|$|Operation of an {{evaporator}} {{represents a}} costly consumption of main boiler steam, thus fuel. Evaporators for a warship {{must also be}} adequate to supply the boilers at continuous full power when required, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> rarely required. Varying the vacuum under which the evaporator works, and thus the boiling point of the feedwater, may optimise production for either maximum output, or better efficiency, depending on which is needed at the time. Greatest output is achieved when the evaporator operates at near atmospheric pressure and a high temperature (for saturated steam this will be at a limit of 100°C), which may then have an efficiency of 0.87kg of feedwater produced for each kg of steam supplied.|$|E
25|$|Males are {{territorial}} {{of their}} roosts, and will often fight other intruding males {{by means of}} boxing. Males follow a pattern of behavioral stages before fighting. This entails ear movements, head lifts, neck craning, wing unfolding, punch mimicking, and finally boxing with each other. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> aggressive behavior, either male is allowed to stop fighting and leave the conflict, and injuries usually aren't worse than a few scrapes and bruises. It is also shown that males use distinct vocalizations during conflicts, which {{might be used to}} determine the identity of the competitor, and based on that information, parts of the pre-fighting stages can be skipped, and the animals will begin boxing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a {{field with}} many uncertainties, it is {{expected}} that over the next 50 years climate changes will {{have an effect on the}} diversity of forest genetic resources and thereby on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests. Diversity of forest genetic resources enables the potential for a species (or a population) to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes, drought, pests, diseases and forest fire. However, species are not naturally capable to adapt in the pace of which the climate is changing and the increasing temperatures will most likely facilitate the spread of pests and diseases, creating an additional threat to forest trees and their populations. To inhibit these problems human interventions, such as transfer of forest reproductive material, may be needed.|$|E

500|$|The word Miṣr was {{an ancient}} Semitic root {{designating}} Egypt, but in Arabic {{also has the}} meaning of a large city or metropolis (or, as a verb, [...] "to civilize"), so the name Miṣr al-Fusṭāṭ could mean [...] "Metropolis of the Tent". Fusṭāṭ Miṣr would mean [...] "The Pavilion of Egypt". Egyptians to this day call Cairo [...] "Miṣr", or, colloquially, Maṣr, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> properly the name of the whole country of Egypt. The country's first mosque, the Mosque of Amr, was later built in 642 on the same site of the commander's tent.|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Amish Paradise", {{caused a}} minor {{controversy}} after rapper Coolio said that Yankovic had {{never asked for}} permission to record the parody. Yankovic traditionally secures permission from the artists he parodies, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not legally required, as parodies are covered under fair use guidelines, but when he inquired about [...] "Gangsta's Paradise", Yankovic was told by Scotti Brothers Records that Coolio had given permission. Coolio later claimed {{that he had not}} given such permission, making a statement at the Grammys saying that he did not appreciate Yankovic [...] "desecrating" [...] his song.|$|E

2500|$|This {{shows that}} the {{eigenvalues}} are 1, 2, 4 and 4, according to algebraic multiplicity. The eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 can be found by solving the equation Av = λ v. It is spanned by the column vector v = (1, 1, 0, 0)T. Similarly, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 2 is spanned by w = (1, 1, 0, 1)T. Finally, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 4 is also one-dimensional (<b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a double eigenvalue) and is spanned by x = (1, 0, 1, 1)T. So, the geometric multiplicity (i.e., the dimension of the eigenspace of the given eigenvalue) {{of each of the}} three eigenvalues is one. Therefore, the two eigenvalues equal to 4 correspond to a single Jordan block, and the Jordan normal form of the matrix A is the direct sum ...|$|E
