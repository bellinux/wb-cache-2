5000|$|Consequently, even if Pappé’s {{chronology}} is correct, {{and there}} is no reason to doubt this, the book does not provide a sufficient explanation for the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. No matter how meticulous the planning by the leaders of the Yishuv (settlers) was, it would have been to no avail without an unusual concatenation of international events (the genocide of European Jewry, the onset of the cold war, the closing of liberal democratic gates to Jewish refugees, the <b>emancipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>colonies</b> in North Africa, and last but not least the hegemony of the model of the ethnic nation-state as the only available avenue for national emancipation).|$|E

It was based on conservative ideals but presented as part <b>of</b> the <b>emancipation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>colonies.</b> In general, his political orientation was controversial and he seems to have been guided solely by personal interests.|$|R

Spain's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas.|$|R

The same year, Spain was invaded by the French, and Acevedo participated in the oath of allegiance to King Ferdinand VII, but also stated the need to form a Governing Board. During 1809, he engaged in conspiracies seeking to depose the Viceroy Antonio José Amar y Borbón, to form an independent government. He {{became interested in the}} emerging proposals for the <b>emancipation</b> <b>of</b> the American <b>colonies</b> and decided to begin organizing meetings with other intellectuals and leaders of the city which culminated with the Cry of Independence of Colombia of July 20, 1810, when street riots began, turning chaotic and ineffective. Popular leaders proclaimed their tribute to Acevedo, trying to harness his excellent oratory skills, and he addressed the crowd at the central square of the city with a speech that fueled the need to seize the moment to organize as an autonomous government. He stated: ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 19th century, composers began to move away from the tonal system. This is typified in Richard Wagner's music, {{especially}} Tristan und Isolde (the Tristan chord, for example). Arnold Schoenberg and his pupil Anton Webern proposed a theory on the <b>emancipation</b> <b>of</b> the dissonance to help analyse the general trend and, in particular, their own atonal music. Composers such as Charles Ives, Dane Rudhyar, and even Duke Ellington and Lou Harrison, connected the <b>emancipation</b> <b>of</b> the dissonance with the <b>emancipation</b> <b>of</b> society and humanity.|$|R

50|$|Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was an {{organization}} of emigrant Russian socialists, set up in Geneva in 1894 on the initiative <b>of</b> the <b>Emancipation</b> <b>of</b> Labour group. It had its own printing press for issuing revolutionary literature, and published the journal Rabotnik (Worker). Initially, the <b>Emancipation</b> <b>of</b> Labour group directed the Union and edited its publications. But afterwards opportunist elements ('the young' or Economists) gained the upper hand within the Union. At the first congress of the Union in November 1898, the <b>Emancipation</b> <b>of</b> Labour group {{announced that it would}} no longer edit the publications of the Union. The final break and the withdrawal of the group from the Union took place at the second congress of the Union in April 1900; the <b>Emancipation</b> <b>of</b> Labour group and its followers walked out of the congress and set up an independent organisation, Sotsial-Demokrat.|$|R
