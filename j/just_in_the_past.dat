40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) was {{originally}} considered toxic at elevated levels; however <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade H 2 S {{has been proposed}} {{to be an important}} gasotransmitter with various physiological and pathophysiological roles in the body. H 2 S can be generated endogenously from L-cysteine by multiple enzymes, including cystathionine gamma-lyase, cystathionine beta-synthase, and 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in combination with cysteine aminotransferase. Prostate cancer is a major health concern and no effective treatment for prostate cancers is available. H 2 S has been shown to inhibit cell survival of androgen-independent, androgen-dependent, and antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer cells through different mechanisms. Various H 2 S-releasing compounds, including sulfide salts, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, sulforaphane, and other polysulfides, also have been shown to inhibit prostate cancer growth and metastasis. The expression of H 2 S-producing enzyme was reduced in both human prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cells. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is indispensable for the development of castration resistant prostate cancer, and H 2 S was shown to inhibit AR transactivation and contributes to antiandrogen-resistant status. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge of H 2 S signaling in prostate cancer and described the molecular alterations, which may bring this gasotransmitter into the clinic in the near future for developing novel pharmacological and therapeutic interventions for prostate cancer...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA major {{question}} in linguistics is whether theoretical {{accounts of the}} general language work for specific domains. Similarly, in natural language processing, {{it is clear that}} general-domain solutions often fail when applied to specialized domains. One such specialized domain, which is increasingly seen as crucial to understanding human biology and disease, is the biomedical domain. For this reason, biomedical corpus construction has been an area of considerable activity in recent years—for example, <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> five years: (ordered by year of publication and then by first author's last name). Historically, the great majority of work in biomedical natural language processing has been done using abstracts of journal articles. In contrast, the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) corpus consists entirely of full-text journal articles. The primary motivation for the annotation project was the accumulating body of evidence indicating that the bodies of journal articles contain much information that is not present in the abstracts, and that the textual and structural characteristics of article bodies are different from those of abstracts [8, 26, 90, 84, 18, 2, 48, 51, 13]. When we began the project, there was no large resource of full-text journal articles for system building or evaluation; other than the CRAFT corpus, this continues to be the case. Earlier projects on full-text biomedical journal articles are typically not manually annotated, and none of them that we are aware of have annotation of linguistic structure...|$|E

Methods: In this experimental study 18 New Zealander rabbits weighing 2. 5 - 3 kg were categorized randomly in 3 groups (control, oral calcium powder and oral coral powder group) of 6 rabbits. For inducing the defect, the first 3 rd part of tibial bone was blunt dissected. A whole with the depth of 0. 6 - 0. 8 mm and diameter of 4 mm was produced in all 3 groups in the same style. The Calcium group was treated daily with 1150 mg calcium powder, coral group received 1220 mg of coral powder and control group were kept under standard condition.

They are embracing the notion {{that in addition to}} making grants, they can employ investment and shareowner strategies across their assets to help achieve positive societal outcomes and targeted financial returns. This report is designed for foundation staff and trustees who are interested in encouraging their institutions to align a broader portion of their assets under management with their programmatic goals or to factor environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues into their investment decisions to help fulfill fiduciary duties. Practitioners in the sustainable and responsible investment industry who serve foundations, including consultants, research providers, financial advisors, and investment managers, can also benefit from the information and resources in this paper. Using extensive data from primary and secondary resources, this paper presents the current range and state of involvement by foundations in sustainable and responsible investing (SRI) and profiles a number of foundations whose approaches to SRI have resulted in meaningful environmental, social or corporate governance outcomes.

Of course, all of the auctions that we’ve studied to generate revenue, but only as {{a side effect of}} the quest for incentive-compatible welfare-maximization. In effect, are we switching perspectives from that of a non-profit-maximizing entity (like a government) to that of a monopolist. Alternatively, we’re moving from a competitive market, where competition might prevent monopoly pricing, to a non-competitive market. This change in objective leads to a quite different theory. One thing in common between this part and previous ones is that major progress has been made <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> few years, in particular in the theoretical computer science literature. 1. 1 The Challenges of Revenue-Maximization The first reason that we’ve be so obsessed with welfare-maximization {{is that it is a}} funda-mental objective. Many real-world combinatorial auction designs, for example for wireless spectrum licenses, are guided explicitly by welfare-maximization concerns. The second reason is pedagogical. Welfare-maximization is special and, the difficulties of the last 17 lectures notwithstanding, offers fewer conceptual challenges than revenue-maximization. For example, if complexity is not a concern, then the VCG mechanism offers an astonishing guarantee: the mechanism is dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and maximizes the welfare for every valuation profile (assuming truthful reporting). In this sense, the VCG mechanism reduces welfare maximization with privately held valuations to ∗ c© 2014, Tim Roughgarden...|$|E
