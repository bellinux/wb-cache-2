5|$|The lagoons {{behind the}} shingle beach at Salthouse and Cley are salty {{due to the}} {{percolation}} of seawater through the bank.

The young bird took {{only two or three}} weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E
5|$|The primary tax of {{this period}} was named bojakapati (grain tax) and charged for land used for cultivation. A water tax, named dakapati was also charged <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> used from reservoirs. Customs duties were also imposed in ports. Those unable to pay these taxes in cash were {{expected}} {{to take part in}} services such as repairing reservoirs. The administration of taxes was the duty of Badagarika, the king's treasurer.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

5|$|The bulk of {{the route}} runs through forested areas, {{especially}} near the Učka range and near Pazin, with agricultural land in between those areas– most of it located between the Ivoli and Lupoglav interchanges. The final section of the route, near Opatija and the A7 motorway, runs through coastal areas affected by urbanization. The route crosses no major watercourses, although creeks adjacent to or spanned by the route drain into the Pazinčica and Boljunčica rivers, or directly into the Adriatic Sea {{in the case of}} watercourses flowing down Učka's eastern slopes. The Učka Tunnel contains a spring discovered during its construction and used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> supply of Opatija ever since.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{construction}} used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> channels. Clay channels {{date from the}} Middle Preclassic while stone-lined channels date from the Late Preclassic through to the Classic, with stone-lined channels from the Late Classic being the largest channels built at the site. It is presumed that the clay channels were not sufficiently effective, thus leading to the switch in construction materials and the implementation of stone-lined channels. In the Late Classic pieces of broken stone monuments were reused {{in the construction of}} the water channels.|$|E
5|$|Establishment of the C made Everglades National Park {{completely}} {{dependent upon}} another political entity for its survival. One of the C's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail {{on the northern}} border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C for assistance, the C offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay. Though the C refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering {{the east side of}} the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.|$|E

30|$|Alkalinity {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>water’s</b> ability to {{neutralize}} acids. Highly alkaline water is usually unpalatable. Mean alkalinity values are 138.60  ±  4.26 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> raw <b>water,</b> 121.80  ±  5.39  mg/L <b>for</b> <b>the</b> settled <b>water,</b> 106.80  ±  6.56  mg/L <b>for</b> <b>the</b> filtered <b>water,</b> 105.60  ±  6.97  mg/L <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chlorinated <b>water</b> and 103.40  ±  5.52  mg/L <b>for</b> <b>the</b> distributed <b>water.</b> There {{is a significant}} change in alkalinity from <b>the</b> raw <b>water</b> to <b>the</b> filtered <b>water</b> and chlorinated water as well as distributed water (p <  0.05) and were all at acceptable levels. The treatment processes impacted significantly on alkalinity.

30|$|There was no {{significant}} difference in the chloride content of all the samples (p >  0.05). This shows the treatment processes had {{no significant}} impact on the chloride content of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> samples. <b>The</b> chloride content changed from 28.20  ±  1.46  mg/L <b>for</b> <b>the</b> raw <b>water,</b> 27.80  ±  2.29  mg/L <b>for</b> <b>the</b> settled <b>water,</b> 26.20  ±  2.18  mg/L <b>for</b> <b>the</b> filtered <b>water,</b> 26.20  ±  2.27  mg/L <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chlorinated <b>water</b> to 27.50  ±  1.68  mg/L <b>for</b> <b>the</b> distributed <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> chloride content in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> samples was lower than the acceptable level (250  mg/L). High content of chloride gives a salty taste to <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> limits of chloride have set down primarily from taste considerations (BIS 1991; WHO 1996). No adverse health effects on humans have been reported from intake of water containing high concentrations of chloride (Alexander 2008).
