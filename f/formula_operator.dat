40|$|A general {{formulation}} of noncommutative or quantum derivatives for operators in a Banach space is given {{on the basis}} of the Leibniz rule, irrespective of their explicit representations such as the Gâteaux derivative or commutators. This yields a unified {{formulation of}} quantum analysis, namely the invariance of quantum derivatives, which are expressed by multiple integrals of ordinary higher derivatives with hyperoperator variables. Multivariate quantum analysis is also formulated in the present unified scheme by introducing a partial inner derivation and a rearrangement <b>formula.</b> <b>Operator</b> Taylor expansion formulas are also given by introducing the two hyperoperators δ_A → B≡ A with the inner derivation δ_A : Q [A,Q] ≡ AQ-QA.

40|$|Model {{formulas}} are {{the standard}} approach for specifying the variables in statistical {{models in the}} S language. Although being eminently useful in an extremely wide class of applications, they have certain limitations including being confined to single responses and not providing convenient support for processing formulas with multiple parts. The latter is relevant for models with two or more sets of variable, e. g., regressors/instruments in instrumental variable regressions, two-part models such as hurdle models, or alternative-specific and individual-specific variables in choice models among many others. The R package Formula addresses these two problems by providing a new class "Formula" (inheriting from "formula") that accepts an additional <b>formula</b> <b>operator</b> | separating multiple parts and by allowing all formula operators (including the new |) on the left-hand side to support multiple responses.

40|$|This {{introduction}} to the R package Formula is a (slightly) modified version of Zeileis and Croissant (2010), published in the Journal of Statistical Software. Model formulas are the standard approach for specifying the variables in statistical models in the S language. Although being eminently useful in an extremely wide class of applications, they have certain limitations including being confined to single responses and not providing convenient support for processing formulas with multiple parts. The latter is relevant for models with two or more sets of variables, e. g., different equations for different model parameters (such as mean and dispersion), regressors and instruments in instrumental variable regressions, two-part models such as hurdle models, or alternative-specific and individual-specific variables in choice models among many others. The R package Formula addresses these two problems by providing a new class “Formula ” (inheriting from “formula”) that accepts an additional <b>formula</b> <b>operator</b> | separating multiple parts and by allowing all formula operators (including the new |) on the left-hand side to support multiple responses...|$|E
