Fearing a communist takeover of Vietnam, Gracey decided to rearm French citizens who had remained in Saigon. He allowed them to seize control of public buildings from the Viet Minh. In October 1945, as fighting spread throughout the city, Gracey issued guns to the Japanese troops who had surrendered. He used them to help restore order in the city. According to some socialist and communist commentaries, this controversial decision furthered <b>Ho</b> <b>Ch</b> Minh's cause of liberating Vietnam from foreigners' rule and precipitated the First Indochina War.

The results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a locally dense basis set approach with the B 3 LYP functional and 6 - 311 +G(2 d, 2 p) as the primary basis set on 4 - YC 6 H 4 CH 2 -X, for X = H, Br, Cl, and F with Y = NH 2, <b>HO,</b> <b>CH</b> 3 O, CH 3, H, CF 3, CN, NO 2 and BH 2, show that the effects of Y on CH 2 -X BDEs are small (2 ̆ 2642. 0 kcal/mol) for all four classes of compounds and are roughly equal for each Y for the three halides.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of Holstein genetic material in the dairy herd has consequences for beef production. A total of 24 spring-born calves comprising 8 Holsteins (HO), 8 Friesians (FR) and 8 Charolais × Holstein-Friesians (CH) were reared from calfhood to slaughter. At {{the end of the}} second grazing season they were assigned to a 3 (breeds; HO, FR and CH) × 2 (slaughter weights; 620 and 730 kg) factorial experiment and fin¬ished indoors. After slaughter carcasses were classified for conformation and fatness, all organs and non-carcass parts were weighed, and the right side of each carcass was dissected into fat, bone and muscle. Non-carcass parts, carcass weight, kill-out propor¬tion, carcass conformation score and m. longissimus area were 405, 398 and 368 (s. e. 8. 31) g/kg empty body weight, 355, 344 and 383 (s. e. 9. 4) kg, 509, 520 and 545 (s. e. 8. 99) g/kg, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 3. 1 (s. e. 0. 16), 7616, 7096 and 9286 (s. e. 223. 4) mm 2 for HO, FR and CH, respectively. Corresponding proportions of carcass muscle and fat were 631, 614 and 656 (s. e. 8. 4), and 165, 200 and 165 (s. e. 10. 5) g/kg. Increasing slaughter weight increased the proportion of total non-carcass parts, carcass weight, carcass fat score and fat proportion, and reduced carcass muscle and bone proportions. It is concluded that differences in kill-out proportion between the two dairy breeds was primarily due to the lower proportion of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in FR, and the higher kill-out proportion of CH was mainly due to lower proportions of GIT, internal organs and internal fat. In terms of beef production, HO and FR were broadly comparable for most traits except carcass conformation score and carcass fat proportion, which were lower for <b>HO.</b> <b>CH</b> was superior to the dairy breeds in all important production traits. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{synthesized}} dimethyl derivatives of the GFP chromophore (p-HOBDI) {{and several}} of its derivatives, and their photochemistry and photophysics were investigated using various steady-state and time-resolved techniques as follows. We first consider {{the effect of the}} £]-barrel on the optical properties of the GFP chromophore (p-HOBDI) experimentally by selective variation of the protonation state of chromophores and different solvents. Each of these forms shows a complex solvatochromic behavior and is governed by both polar and acid/base properties of the solvents. In contrast to their solution behavior, some O-alkyl GFP chromophore (alkoxy-BDI) derivatives exhibit large fluorescent enhancement in the solid state. The color of the crystalline BDI is tuned by substituent-mediated crystal packing, showing the potential applications in optoelectronic devices. Using femtosecond polarization-sensitive infrared (IR) spectrosceopy of the C=O stretching mode of the HOBDI, we have then discovered a near complete twisting around the ethylenic bridge between the phenolate and imidazolidinone groups upon electronic excitation. Cis/trans isomerization induced by the rotation around the bridge is thought to be responsible for the behavior of blinking in fluorescent protein; however, the mechanism of the thermal reverse isomerization is more problematic. Thus we synthesized BDI derivatives with decreasing para-donating ability, <b>HO,</b> <b>CH</b> 3 O, CH 3, H, and Cl, and used a Hammett plot for the rate study. With a positive â value, we conceived, for the first time, a novel nucleophilic addition/elimination mechanism. Finally, the GFP chromophore falls into the general category of hydroxyarene photoacids, which exhibit high excited-state acidities but neutral ground states. A hydroxyl substituent at the meta position shows enhanced charge transfer and greater acidity in the excited state. As a result, we have demonstrated that the fast quenching of the excited state by internal conversion to the ground state is much slower in meta- than in para-HOBDI derivatives. This allows studies of this ultrafast intermolecular ESPT that competes with isomerization. The photoinduced dynamics of the meta isomer of GFP chromophore was further investigated using femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence upconversion spectroscopies. Ph. D.

We thank Prof. Eric Reyssat (Laboratoire de Mathematiques N. Oresmes, Universite de Caen, France) for his assistance with the mathematics used in the model. Oxford univ pressOxfordAn updated version of a mechanistic structural-functional model was developed to predict nitrogen (N) uptake throughout the growth cycle by a crop of winter oilseed rape, Brassica napus, grown under field conditions. The functional component of the model derives from a revisited conceptual framework that combines the thermodynamic Flow-Force interpretation of nitrate uptake isotherms and environmental and in planta effects on nitrate influx. Estimation of the root biomass (structural component) is based upon a combination of root mapping along the soil depth profile in the field and a relationship between the specific root length and external nitrate concentration. The root biomass contributing actively to N uptake was determined by introduction of an integrated root system age that allows assignment of a root absorption capacity at a specific age of the root. Simulations were well matched to measured data of N taken up under field conditions for three levels of N fertilization. The model outputs indicated that the two topsoil layers (0 - 30 and 30 - 60 cm) contained 75 - 88 % of the total root length and biomass, and accounted for 90 - 95 % of N taken up at harvest. This conceptual framework provides a model of nitrate uptake that is able to respond to external nitrate fluctuations at both functional and structural levels...|$|E

This is due mainly to the difficulty in linking the various regulations of nitrate transport that act at different levels of time and on different spatial scales. A cross-combination of a Flow-Force approach applied to nitrate influx isotherms and experimentally determined environmental and in planta regulation is used to model nitrate in oilseed rape, Brassica napus. In contrast to 'Enzyme-Substrate' interpretations, a Flow-Force modelling approach considers the root as a single catalytic structure and does not infer hypothetical cellular processes among nitrate transporter activities across cellular layers in the mature roots. In addition, this approach accounts for the driving force on ion transport based on the gradient of electrochemical potential, which is more appropriate from a thermodynamic viewpoint. Use of a Flow-Force formalism on nitrate influx isotherms leads {{to the development of a}} new conceptual mechanistic basis to model more accurately N uptake by a winter oilseed rape crop under field conditions during the whole growth cycle. This forms the functional component of a proposed new structure-function mechanistic model of N uptake...|$|E

Indeed, {{at least four}} families of nitrate transporters operating at both high and/or low external nitrate concentrations, and which are located in series and/or parallel in the different cellular layers of the mature root, are involved in nitrate uptake. Accordingly, the top-down analysis of the root catalytic structure for ion transport from the Enzyme-Substrate interpretation of nitrate influx isotherms is inadequate. Moreover, {{the use of the}} Enzyme-Substrate velocity equation as a single reference in agronomic models is not suitable in its formalism to account for variations in N uptake under fluctuating environmental conditions. Therefore, a conceptual paradigm shift is required to improve the mechanistic modelling of N uptake in agronomic models. Scope An alternative formalism, the Flow-Force theory, was proposed in the 1970 s to describe ion isotherms based upon biophysical 'flows and forces' relationships of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. This interpretation describes, with macroscopic parameters, the patterns of N uptake provided by a biological system such as roots. In contrast to the Enzyme-Substrate interpretation, this approach does not claim to represent molecular characteristics. Here it is shown {{that it is possible to}} combine the Flow-Force formalism with polynomial responses of nitrate influx rate induced by climatic and in planta factors in relation to nitrate availability. Conclusions Application of the Flow-Force formalism allows nitrate uptake to be modelled in a more realistic manner, and allows scaling-up in time and space of the regulation of nitrate uptake across the plant growth cycle...|$|E
