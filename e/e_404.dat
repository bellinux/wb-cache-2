Although suited for driving 300 km/h, they were limited to 250 km/h on the Direttissima as the current drawn from the catenary at 300 km/h would be too high.

40|$|Microsomal epoxide {{hydrolase}} (mEH) is a {{detoxifying enzyme}} for xenobiotic compounds. Enzymatic activity of mEH can be greatly increased by a point mutation, {{leading to an}} <b>E</b> <b>404</b> D amino acid exchange in its catalytic triad. Surprisingly, this variant is not found in any vertebrate species, despite the obvious advantage of accelerated detoxification. We hypothesized that this evolutionary avoidance {{is due to the}} fact that the mEH plays a dualistic role in detoxification and control of endogenous vascular signaling molecules. To test this, we generated mEH <b>E</b> <b>404</b> D mice and assessed them for detoxification capacity and vascular dynamics. In liver microsomes from these mice, turnover of the xenobiotic compound phenanthrene- 9, 10 -oxide was four times faster compared to WT liver microsomes, confirming accelerated detoxification. mEH <b>E</b> <b>404</b> D animals also showed faster metabolization of a specific class of endogenous eicosanoids, arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). Significantly higher DHETs/EETs ratios were found in mEH <b>E</b> <b>404</b> D liver, urine, plasma, brain and cerebral endothelial cells compared to WT controls, suggesting a broad impact of the mEH mutant on endogenous EETs metabolism. Because EETs are strong vasodilators in cerebral vasculature, hemodynamics were assessed in mEH <b>E</b> <b>404</b> D and WT cerebral cortex and hippocampus using cerebral blood volume (CBV) -based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Basal CBV 0 levels were similar between mEH <b>E</b> <b>404</b> D and control mice in both brain areas. But vascular reactivity and vasodilation in response to the vasodilatory drug acetazolamide were reduced in mEH <b>E</b> <b>404</b> D forebrain compared to WT controls by factor 3 and 2. 6, respectively. These results demonstrate a critical role for mEH <b>E</b> <b>404</b> D in vasodynamics and suggest that deregulation of endogenous signaling pathways is the undesirable gain of function associated with the <b>E</b> <b>404</b> D variant...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe reduced folate carrier (RFC), a facilitative transporter, plays a {{major role}} in the {{delivery}} of reduced folates and antifolates into cells. Previous studies indicated that mutations of E 45 K in the first transmembrane domain (TMD), and K 404 L in the 11 th TMD, produce selective and opposite alterations in binding of natural folate substrates to murine RFC. The former mutation is frequently associated with antifolate resistance. The current study was designed to determine whether there might be an interaction between these sites by comparing the transport properties of RFC-null cell lines stably transfected with K <b>404</b> <b>E,</b> E 45 K, or <b>E</b> 45 K/K <b>404</b> <b>E</b> carriers. These studies demonstrated that: (1) All mutant carriers were inserted into the plasma membrane. (2) In the K <b>404</b> <b>E</b> mutant, the influx Kt's for 5 -formyltetrahydrofolate and 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate were markedly increased, and to a much smaller extent folic acid, as compared to L 1210 cells. However, with introduction of a second E 45 K mutation the influx Kt for these folates reverted to those of the E 45 K cells which retained wild-type binding for 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate and enhanced binding of 5 -formyltetrahydrofolate and folic acid. (3) The influx Vmax of the E 45 K mutant was markedly reduced. Introduction of the second K <b>404</b> <b>E</b> mutation doubled this parameter and the ratio of Vmax to Kt for 5 -formytetrahydrofolate was restored to ∼ 50 % that of the wild-type carrier consistent with a substantial increase in function. (4) Chloride inhibits wild-type RFC but the E 45 K mutant requires chloride for activity. The K <b>404</b> <b>E</b> mutant is also suppressed by chloride but introduction of the K <b>404</b> <b>E</b> mutation decreased the chloride-dependence of E 45 K. The results suggest that there is an interaction between the E 45 and K 404 residues in the first and 11 th TMDs, respectively, but that the E 45 residue appears to be the more dominant determinant of binding and anion sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|The MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) MMP- 9 and - 2 each {{possess a}} unique CBD (collagen-binding domain) {{containing}} three fibronectin type II-like modules. The present experiments investigated whether the contributions to ligand interactions and enzymatic activities by the CBD of MMP- 9 (CBD- 9) corresponded {{to those of}} CBD in MMP- 2 (CBD- 2). The interactions of recombinant CBD- 9 {{with a series of}} collagen types and extracellular matrix molecules were characterized by protein–protein binding assays. CBD- 9 bound native and denatured type I, II, III, IV and V collagen, as well as Matrigel and laminin, with apparent Kd values of (0. 1 – 6. 8) × 10 − 7 M, which were similar to the Kd values for CBD- 2 [(0. 2 – 3. 7) × 10 − 7 M]. However, CBD- 9 bound neither native nor denatured type VI collagen. We also generated two modified MMPs, MMP- 9 E 402 A and MMP- 2 <b>E</b> <b>404</b> A, by site-specific mutations in the active sites to obtain enzymes with intact ligand binding, but abrogated catalytic properties. In subsequent competitive binding assays, CBD- 9 and MMP- 9 E 402 A inhibited the interactions of MMP- 2 <b>E</b> <b>404</b> A and, conversely, CBD- 2 and MMP- 2 <b>E</b> <b>404</b> A competed with MMP- 9 E 402 A binding to native and denatured type I collagens, pointing to shared binding sites. Importantly, the capacity of CBD- 9 to disrupt the MMP- 9 and MMP- 2 binding of collagen translated to inhibition of the gelatinolytic activity of the enzymes. Collectively, these results emphasize the essential contribution of CBD- 9 to MMP- 9 substrate binding and gelatinolysis, and demonstrate that the CBDs of MMP- 9 and MMP- 2 bind the same or closely positioned sites on type I collagen...|$|E

40|$|MMP- 2 (matrix {{metalloproteinase}} 2) {{contains a}} CBD (collagen-binding domain), which {{is essential for}} positioning gelatin substrate molecules relative to the catalytic site for cleavage. Deletion of the CBD or disruption of CBD-mediated gelatin binding inhibits gelatinolysis by MMP- 2. To identify CBD-binding sites on type I collagen and collagen peptides with the capacity to compete CBD binding of gelatin and thereby inhibit gelatinolysis by MMP- 2, we screened a one-bead one-peptide combinatorial peptide library with recombinant CBD as bait. Analyses of sequences from the CBD-binding peptides pointed to residues 715 – 721 in human α 1 (I) collagen chain as a binding site for CBD. A peptide (P 713) including this collagen segment was synthesized for analyses. In SPR (surface plasmon resonance) assays, the CBD and MMP- 2 <b>E</b> <b>404</b> A, a catalytically inactive MMP- 2 mutant, both bound immobilized P 713 in a concentration-dependent manner, but not a scrambled control peptide. Furthermore, P 713 competed gelatin binding by the CBD and MMP- 2 <b>E</b> <b>404</b> A. In control assays, neither of the non-collagen binding alkylated CBD or MMP- 2 with deletion of CBD (MMP- 2 ΔCBD) bound P 713. Consistent with the exodomain functions of the CBD, P 713 inhibited ∼ 90 % of the MMP- 2 gelatin cleavage, but less than 20 % of the MMP- 2 activity on a peptide substrate (NFF- 1) which {{does not require the}} CBD for cleavage. Confirming the specificity of the inhibition, P 713 did not alter MMP- 2 ΔCBD or MMP- 8 activities.

40|$|Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is {{the least}} common of the {{autosomal}} dominant acute hepatic porphyrias. It results from mutations in the CPO gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme, coproporphyrinogen oxidase. A few patients have also been reported who are homoallellic or heteroallelic for CPO mutations and are clinically distinct from those with HCP. In such patients {{the presence of a}} specific mutation (K <b>404</b> <b>E)</b> on one or both alleles produces a neonatal hemolytic anemia that is known as “harderoporphyria”; mutations on both alleles elsewhere in the gene give rise to the “homozygous” variant of HCP. The molecular relationship between these disorders and HCP has not been defined. We describe the molecular investigation and clinical features of 17 unrelated British patients with HCP. Ten novel and four previously reported CPO mutations, together with three previously unrecognized single-nucleotide polymorphisms, were identified in 15 of the 17 patients. HCP is more heterogeneous than other acute porphyrias, with all but one mutation being restricted to a single family, with a predominance of missense mutations (10 missense, 2 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 1 splice site). Of the four known mutations, one (R 331 W) has previously been reported to cause disease only in homozygotes. Heterologous expression of another mutation (R 401 W) demonstrated functional properties {{similar to those of the}} K <b>404</b> <b>E</b> harderoporphyria mutation. In all patients, clinical presentation was uniform, in spite of the wide range (1 %– 64 %) of residual coproporphyrinogen oxidase activity, as determined by heterologous expression. Our findings add substantially to knowledge of the molecular epidemiology of HCP, show that single copies of CPO mutations that are known or predicted to cause “homozygous” HCP or harderoporphyria can produce typical HCP in adults, and demonstrate that the severity of the phenotype does not correlate with the degree of inactivation by mutation of coproporphyrinogen oxidase...|$|R

Outdoor air pollution paper estimates health impact of exposure to outdoor air pollution. All the papers use primary data from a household survey conducted in 2012. Chapter 2 estimates the Kathmandu Valley residents’ preferred changes to the existing household solid waste management using a choice experiment survey. Included waste management attributes are waste collection time, community waste management program, waste segregation types, frequency of waste collection and the monthly user fee. According to the results, sub-urban and core-urban residents have distinctively different preference for their most preferred attribute and willingness to segregate waste. For example, people in the core urban area {{are willing to pay}} the most (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>404</b> Rupees per month per household) for having a community waste management program and people in the sub-urban area are willing to pay the most for (480 Rupees per month per household) for scheduled waste collection. Sub-urban area residents are willing to segregate two type of waste, but core urban residents are not willing to segregate any. An average Kathmandu Valley resident prefers having a waste management program and scheduled and frequent waste collection service in his/her community [...] Kathmandu Valley residents, however, are willing to accept less frequent collection given the waste is collected in a scheduled time frame, which is an important policy implication for municipalities to optimally allocate their resources. People value walking shorter distances to dispose of their household waste. Based on the findings of this chapter, each municipality should create a unique set of waste management services that address the preferences of that municipality’s residents, which will help municipalities to optimally allocate resources. Improvement in existing household solid waste management is important to protect the environment, the quality of the groundwater (source of the valley’s drinking water), and reduce public health problems. Improved waste management also helps to maintain the aesthetic beauty of the city and overall, contributes to securing sustainable urban development. Previous studies on solid waste management in the Kathmandu Valley focus at solid waste management at the aggregate level by analyzing Kathmandu valley’s municipal waste management. About 70 percent of the total municipal waste, however, comes from household. In such scenario, this chapter contributes to provide important policy recommendations to improve vii Kathmandu Valley’s solid waste management service from the perspective of household’s preference towards it. Chapter 3 analyzes the impact of exposure to outdoor air pollution on Kathmandu valley residents’ health, more specifically on the probability of experiencing nausea, dust allergies, and respiratory illness. This chapter focuses on outdoor air pollution resulting from anthropogenic activities such as vehicle and industrial emissions, biomass and fossil fuel combustion, and biogas emissions from waste dumping sites. In comparison to all other source of pollutants, traffic emission has the strongest effect on these three measures of health as roads are the closest source of pollution. An average Kathmandu valley resident lives 28 meters away from the road. Our results show that people who live between 10 to 30 meters from the road are significantly more likely to experience nausea, dust allergies, and respiratory diseases. Adults less than 36 years old are less susceptible to such pollution exposure in comparison to older adults. People with higher education are more mobile, which keeps them more exposed to outdoor air pollution {{and are more likely to}} experience such health problems. Based on time activity pattern (measured through occupation) unskilled day laborers, who spend majority of their working hours in close proximity to road, are the most susceptible population to outdoor air pollution in comparison to housewives and people with indoor working environments. An average Kathmandu Valley resident is 16 percent less likely to experience nausea, dust allergies, and respiratory illness if he/she lives 100 meter further from a road from his/her current location. Based on the accumulated opportunity cost and medical cost, an average Kathmandu valley resident saves total of 389. 17 Nepalese Rupees by living 100 meter farther from road. This chapter approaches to analyze impact of air pollution in a different way. Usually previous studies collect data on air pollutant level and related its effect on public health. This study, however, measures exposure to public health based on proximity to the sources of pollution. This study also extends on existing work by identifying the variation (heterogeneity) in exposure to outdoor pollution among communities using the multi-level modeling technique. Chapter 4 identifies the factors determining household’s informal recycling behavior in the Kathmandu valley in Nepal. The informal recycling, the only recycling viii method practiced in the Kathmandu Valley, is represented by households selling the recyclable waste to the scrapdealers. According to the results, people who generate more waste are also more likely to recycle. People who use vegetable garden and practice composting are significantly more likely to recycle. For example, people who compost are 11. 8 to 12. 8 percent more likely to recycle in comparison to those who do not. Based on this finding, municipalities can promote household recycling as a complementary offer with the existing offer of the subsidized composting bins. Also, urban gardening can be an important policy implication to promote recycling. Due to having a flat fee for waste collection in the Kathmandu Valley, increase or decrease in fee does not have any impact on recycling. The existing institutional regulation to avoid haphazard waste disposal not only helps to avoid haphazard waste disposal but also increases recycling by 7. 8 to 9. 5 percent. This study provides important findings that helps to increase recycling and achieve sustainable waste management. Overall, the policy recommendations from three papers compliment to improve solid waste management, reduce air pollution and promote recycling together. EconomicsDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

The primase catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides for the initiation of lagging strand synthesis. The two activities reside in a single polypeptide encoded by gene 4 of bacteriophage T 7. Their coexistence within the same polypeptide facilitates their coordination during DNA replication. One surface of helix E within the helicase domain is positioned {{to interact with the}} primase domain and the linker connecting the two domains within the functional hexamer. The interaction occurs in trans such that helix E interacts with the primase domain and the linker of the adjacent subunit. Most alterations of residues on the surface of helix <b>E</b> (Arg <b>404,</b> Lys 408, Tyr 411, and Gly 415) eliminate the ability of the altered proteins to complement growth of T 7 phage lacking gene 4. Both Tyr 411 and Gly 415 are important in oligomerization of the protein. Alterations G 415 V and K 408 A simultaneously influence helicase and primase activities in opposite manners that mimic events observed during coordinated DNA synthesis. The results suggest that Asp 263 located in the linker of one subunit can interact with Tyr 411, Lys 408, or Arg <b>404</b> in helix <b>E</b> of the adjacent subunit depending on the oligomerization state. Thus the switch in contacts between Asp 263 and its three interacting residues in helix E of the adjacent subunit results in conformational changes that modulate helicase and primase activity...|$|R

Using {{a sample of}} initial public offering (IPO) registrants from 2005 - 2013, I find that increasing management’s disclosure credibility, by hiring a new CEO in the IPO, is an incentive to include ICWs in IPO registration statements. I find that management does build credibility with underwriters evidenced by IPO registrants that disclose ICWs voluntarily are associated with higher IPO offer prices. The results suggest that registrants including voluntary ICW disclosures {{are more likely to}} receive an adverse SOX 404 auditor opinion. I find that registrants 2 ̆ 7 voluntary ICW disclosures are informative and are associated with negative cumulative abnormal returns only when an auditor issues an adverse SOX 404 auditor opinion after the disclosure. IPO registrants that voluntarily disclose ICWs and receive unqualified SOX 404 auditor opinions appear to be successful in mitigating negative cumulative abnormal returns. My findings provide evidence that misstatements appear to outpace material weakness disclosures for the sample of IPO registrants. Overall, the findings suggest that managers seek to build credibility through voluntary disclosure of ICWs at the IPO, allowing managers to maximize the rewards at the IPO date (i. e., IPO offer price). However, managers suffer punishment from investors if subsequent events (i. <b>e.,</b> SOX <b>404</b> material weaknesses) call into question the credibility of the disclosure. The post-IPO financial reporting quality results are timely and relevant to regulators because the relationship between misstatements and unqualified audit opinions is puzzling. Additionally, the JOBS Act allows IPO registrants to delay SOX 404 compliance for up to five years. Finally, this study’s results are important to investors because the purpose of SOX 404 is to provide an advanced warning of financial reporting weaknesses. ...|$|R
40|$|The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 {{aimed to}} improve listed companies' {{financial}} reporting standards and protect shareholders' interests. However, {{most of the}} provisions {{are perceived to be}} costly to U. S. issuers and benefits of the Act have continued to be the subject of much debate. This thesis utilises a unique corporate governance dataset that covers both the pre- and post-SOX periods and attempts to first, investigate what changes have there been in corporate governance practices since SOX was implemented, and second, to analyse the consequences of any changes in corporate governance practices post-SOX, and whether these changes are beneficial to shareholders. To achieve these two objectives, the thesis investigates the impact of SOX in four empirical chapters. The main findings of this thesis suggest that companies opted to follow a box-ticking procedure in selecting their corporate governance structures post-SOX. SOX did not achieve its objectives of improving financial reporting quality,but it had, albeit unintentionally, enhanced corporate value for some firms. Overall audit conu-nittee effectiveness decreased during the SOX period, but it increased in the post-SOX period, which indicates, in terms of corporate governance, SOX was beneficial to shareholders because it improved the overall audit committee effectiveness. Finally, earnings informativeness improved after SOX was enacted. However, this improvement may not be attributable to the changes in audit committee effectiveness. The thesis concludes that SOX improved U. S. companies' financial reporting quality, financial account usefulness and audit committee effectiveness. However, the improvements of financial reporting quality and financial account usefulness seemed not to be attributable to the changes in corporate governance practices, but it was more likely to be attributable to other internal control requirements, i. <b>e.</b> Section <b>404</b> "Assessment of internal control", Section 302 "Internal control certifications" and Section 201 "Services outside the scope of practice of auditor". ...|$|R
40|$|Between 1962 and 1969, to {{increase}} {{the total amount of}} its cash reserves, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) required insured institutions to make annual prepayments of their regular future insurance premiums. The prepayment constituted a secondary reserve of the FSLIC for possible industry-wide losses of the FSLIC. The FSLIC also maintained a primary reserve, which was to be depleted before the secondary reserve would be charged with such losses. In recent years, the FSLIC fund has encountered financial difficulty. The audit of the FSLIC as of December 31, 1986 reported a deficit of more than $ 6 billion. Because of the financial condition of the FSLIC, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, pursuant to Section <b>404</b> (<b>e)</b> of the National Housing Act, eliminated the secondary reserve of the FSLIC as of December 31, 1986. Notification to member institutions was made in May 1987. The issues are (1) what is the appropriate period in which the loss should be recognized by member institutions and (2) how the charge should be classified in the financial statements of the member institutions.

40|$|Defective interfering (DI) viruses {{are thought}} to cause {{oscillations}} in virus levels, known as 3 the “Von Magnus effect”. Interference by DI viruses has been proposed to underlie these 4 dynamics, although experimental tests of this idea have not been forthcoming. For the 5 baculoviruses, insect viruses commonly used {{for the expression of}} heterologous proteins in 6 insect cells, the molecular mechanisms underlying DI generation have been investigated. 7 However, the dynamics of baculovirus populations harboring DIs have not been studied in 8 detail. In order to address this issue, we used quantitative real-time PCR to determine the 9 levels of helper and DI viruses during 50 serial passages of Autographa californica multiple 10 nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) in Sf 21 cells. Unexpectedly, the helper and DI viruses 11 changed levels largely in phase, and oscillations were highly irregular, suggesting the 12 presence of chaos. We therefore developed a simple mathematical model of baculovirus-DI 13 dynamics. This theoretical model reproduced patterns qualitatively similar to the 14 experimental data. Although we cannot exclude that experimental variation (noise) plays an 15 important role in generating the observed patterns, the presence of chaos in the model 16 dynamics was confirmed with the computation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent, and a 17 Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse route to chaos was identified at decreasing production of DI 18 viruses, using mutation as a control parameter. Our results contribute to a better 19 understanding of the dynamics of DI baculoviruses, and suggest that changes in virus levels 20 over passages may exhibit chaos.

40|$|Today, {{landowners and}} {{cooperating}} governments – federal, state, and local – increasingly {{rely on a}} unique conservation planning tool, habitat conservation plans (HCPs), to accommodate land development and the strict species and habitat protection requirements of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This, however, is a relatively recent phenomenon. This chapter outlines the history and development of HCPs, analyzes how HCPs incorporate current principles of adaptive management, discusses HCP compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and describes the emerging trend of Multiple-Species HCPs (MSHCPs) using the Western Riverside County MSCHP as a case study. We suggest that the statutory authority for HCPs be augmented in five ways: (1) Development of a reliable federal financing mechanism that would enable sponsors of “mature” HCPs to complete land acquisition while land prices are low; (2) Integration of ESA permitting requirements with other federal environmental mandates (<b>e.</b> g. section <b>404</b> permits, air quality permits); (3) Integration of ESA permitting requirements with state environmental requirements and consolidation of overlapping state and federal requirements; (4) Inclusion of provisions dealing with adaptive management that allow for unforeseen consequences of global phenomena like climate change; (5) Codification of the “No Surprises” Rule and the Incidental Take Permit Revocation Rule...|$|R
40|$|Influenza pandemics with human-to-human {{transmission}} of the virus are of great public concern. It is now recognized {{that a number of}} factors are necessary for human transmission and virulence, including several key mutations within the PB 2 subunit of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The structure of the middle domain in PB 2 has been revealed with or without m 7 GTP, thus the middle domain is considered to be novel target for structure-based drug design. Here we report the crystal structure of the middle domain of H 1 N 1 PB 2 with or without m 7 GTP at 1. 9 Å and 2. 0 Å resolution, respectively, which has two mutations (P 453 H, I 471 T) to increase electrostatic potential and solubility.
