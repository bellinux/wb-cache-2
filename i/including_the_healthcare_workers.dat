40|$|Measles {{is caused}} by measles virus {{belonging}} to genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. Vaccination has {{played a critical role}} in controlling measles infection worldwide. However, in the recent years, outbreaks of measles infection still occur in many developing countries. Here, we report an outbreak of measles among healthcare workers and among the 60 measles infected patients 50 were healthcare workers including doctors, nurses, staff, and medics. Fifty-one patients (85 %) tested positive for IgM antibodies against the measles virus and 50 patients (83. 3 %) tested positive for measles virus RNA. Surprisingly, 73. 3 % of the infected individuals had been previously immunized against measles. Since there is no infection division in our hospital, the fever clinics are located in the Emergency Division. In addition, the fever and rash were not recognized as measles symptoms at the beginning of the outbreak. These factors result in delay in isolation and early confirmation of the suspected patients and eventually a measles outbreak in the hospital. Our report highlights the importance of following a two-dose measles vaccine program in people <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> In addition, vigilant attention should be paid to medical staff with clinical fever and rash symptoms to avoid a possible nosocomial transmission of measles infection...|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} factors {{affect the quality of}} {{services}} in Uganda, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> shortage of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> and lack of trust in them, a lack of needed treatments, high costs, and long distances to facilities. In 2009, a survey conducted of Ugandan patients indicated a decline in the performance of the public sector health services. These were indicated through comments about poor sanitation, a lack of professionals and drugs and equipment, long wait times, inadequate preventative care, a poor referral system, rude health workers, and lack of services for vulnerable populations like the poor and elderly. The quality of services affects utilization in different ways, including preventing patients from seeking out delivery services or leading them to see traditional providers, self medicate, and decide not to seek formal care or seeing private providers.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{present the}} results of a {{literature}} review on factors related to vaccine uptake by elderly persons. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using Medline, Embase, and SciSearch to collect all publications available on factors related to vaccine uptake from 1966 until October 2012 for West European and North American societies. In total, 1001 articles were identified and 60 were <b>included</b> in <b>the</b> review. Results: We identified six main themes that influence the willingness to be vaccinated: 1) attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccination in general including positive and negative attitudes and beliefs; 2) perceived risk and severity including knowledge, perceived susceptibility and severity and personal experience; 3) vaccine characteristics including side-effects, effectiveness, content of the vaccine and knowledge; 4) advice and information <b>including</b> influence of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>worker</b> and relatives and the information source and format; 5) general health-related behavior including previous vaccinations, visiting GP or senior center and other preventive behaviors; and 6) accessibility and affordability including logistics, combinations of vaccines and costs. Conclusion: The most important factors related to vaccine uptake are people's attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccination (especially their negative attitudes), recommendations of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers,</b> side effects and effectiveness of the vaccine, and perceived susceptibility.

40|$|Healthcare {{systems in}} many low income {{countries}} {{have evolved to}} provide services for acute, infections and are poorly structured {{for the provision of}} chronic, non-communicable diseases which are increasingly common. Epilepsy is a common chronic neurologic condition and antiepileptic drugs are affordable, but the epilepsy treatment gap remains > 90 % in most African countries. The World Health Organization has recently released evidence-based guidelines for epilepsy care provision at the primary care level. Based upon these guidelines, we estimated all direct costs associated with epilepsy care provision as well as <b>the</b> cost of <b>healthcare</b> <b>worker</b> training and social marketing. We developed a model for epilepsy care delivery primarily by primary <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> We then used a variety of sources to develop cost estimates for the actual implementation and maintenance of this program being as comprehensive as possible to include all costs incurred within the health sector. Key sensitivity analyses were completed to better understand how changes in costs for individual aspects of care impact the overall cost of care delivery. Even after <b>including</b> <b>the</b> costs of <b>healthcare</b> <b>worker</b> retraining, social marketing and capital expenditures, epilepsy care can be provided at less than $ 25. 00 per person with epilepsy per year.

40|$|NHS staff {{frequently}} experience {{violence and}} aggression, and {{post-traumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) is amongst the potential psychological consequences. Using a prospective design, the present study sought to establish whether cognitive factors, specified in Ehlers and Clark's (2000) model, could predict symptom severity over and above other established risk factors. The aim was to develop and refine a predictive tool, {{which could be used}} to identify individuals who may benefit from early, targeted interventions. Forty-eight <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> completed questionnaires assessing a range of cognitive factors, immediately following an incident of violence or aggression. Of these participants, twenty provided data concerning PTSD symptoms at three-month follow-up, despite implementing strategies to maximise response rates. It was therefore not possible to address the original research question owing to the small sample size. However, several participants reported experiencing symptoms, and for some these were moderate to severe. Several potential reasons for non-response were identified, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> possibility that <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> appraise workplace incidents {{in such a way that}} subsequent effects are minimised. An experimental analogue study examined this hypothesis. Student nurses (N = 190) read a vignette as an analogue for a violent incident, in which the context was manipulated. Results indicated that neither organisational setting (work / non-work), nor cause of the perpetrator's behaviour (illness / non-illness) influenced the type of appraisals endorsed, or ratings of perceived distress. It therefore seems likely that other factors contributed to the low response rate observed in Study 1. However, in line with Ehlers and Clark's (2000) cognitive model, appraisals explained a significant amount variance in dysfunctional behaviours after controlling for perceived distress. Study 1 indicated that a proportion of staff were adversely affected by incidents of violence and aggression. Replication of this research is warranted in light of the current literature, and recommendations are made for modification. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Because {{of their}} {{peculiar}} sociocultural background, <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in sub-Saharan African subcultures may have various conceptions on {{different aspects of}} autism spectrum disorders (ASD), such as etiology, treatment and issues of prognosis. These various conceptions, if different from current knowledge in literature about ASD, may negatively influence help-seeking behavior of {{parents of children with}} ASD who seek advice and information from <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> This study assessed <b>the</b> opinions of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in Nigeria on aspects of etiology, treatability and preventability of childhood autism, and relates their opinions to the sociodemographic variables. Methods <b>Healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> working in four tertiary healthcare facilities located in the south-east and south-south regions of Nigeria were interviewed with a sociodemographic questionnaire, personal opinion on etiology, treatability and preventability of childhood autism (POETPCA) questionnaire and knowledge about childhood autism among health workers (KCAHW) questionnaire to assess their knowledge and opinions on various aspects of childhood autism. Results A total of 134 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> participated in <b>the</b> study. In all, 78 (58. 2 %), 19 (14. 2 %) and 36 (26. 9 %) of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> were of <b>the</b> opinion that the etiology of childhood autism can be explained by natural, preternatural and supernatural causes, respectively. One (0. 7 %) of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> was unsure of the explanation of the etiology. Knowledge about childhood autism as measured by scores on the KCAHW questionnaire was the only factor significantly associated with the opinions of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> on etiology of childhood autism. In all, 73 (54. 5 %) and 43 (32. 1 %), of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> subscribed to <b>the</b> opinion that childhood autism is treatable and preventable respectively. Previous involvement with managing children with ASD significantly influenced the opinion of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in subscribing to treatability of childhood autism, while working experience of less than 6 years among <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> significantly influenced <b>the</b> opinion of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in admitting to believing in the preventability of childhood autism. Conclusion In designing policies and programs to change negative opinions or beliefs of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> about childhood autism, {{there is a need for}} baseline information such as this survey. Changing the negative opinions or beliefs of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> about childhood autism should encourage appropriate help-seeking behavior among parents of children with ASD who may be seeking advice or information from <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> This would encourage early interventions, which are essential to prognosis of childhood autism. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{designing}} {{programs to}} raise the community level of awareness about childhood autism in sub-Saharan Africa, it is logical to use <b>the</b> primary <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> as contact point for education of the general public. Tertiary <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> could play <b>the</b> role of trainers on childhood autism at primary healthcare level. Assessing their baseline knowledge about childhood autism to detect areas of knowledge gap is an essential ingredient in starting off such programs that would be aimed at early diagnosis and interventions. Knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> on availability of facilities and law that would promote the required interventions is also important. This study assessed the baseline knowledge about childhood autism and opinion among Nigerian <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> on availability of facilities and law caring for the needs and rights of children with childhood autism and other developmental disorders. Method A total of one hundred and thirty four (134) consented <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> working in tertiary healthcare facilities located in south east and south-south regions of Nigeria were interviewed with Socio-demographic, Knowledge about Childhood Autism among Health Workers (KCAHW) and Opinion on availability of Facilities and Law caring for the needs and rights of children with Childhood Autism and other developmental disorders (OFLCA) questionnaires. Results The total mean score of participated <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> on KCAHW questionnaire was 12. 35 ± 4. 40 {{out of a total}} score of 19 possible. Knowledge gap was found to be higher in domain 3 (symptoms of obsessive and repetitive pattern of behavior), followed by domains 1 (symptoms of impairments in social interaction), 4 (type of disorder autism is and associated co-morbidity) and 2 (symptoms of communication impairments) of KCAHW respectively among <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> Knowledge about childhood autism (KCA) as measured by scores on KCAHW questionnaire was significantly associated with age group distribution of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers,</b> with those age group of fourth decades and above more likely to have higher mean score (p = 0. 004) and previous experience of managing children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (p = 0. 000). KCA showed near significant association with area of specialty, with those <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in psychiatry compared to pediatrics having higher mean score (p = 0. 071) and also with years of working experience of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> (p = 0. 056). More than half of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> subscribed to <b>the</b> opinion that facilities and law caring for the needs and rights of children with childhood autism and other developmental disorders are lacking in Nigeria. Conclusion The correlates of KCA may help in selection of those tertiary <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> that would best fit the role of trainers. It is important to update the knowledge gaps of those <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> who scored low in different domains of KCAHW questionnaire.

Eclampsia {{is associated with}} very high case fatality rate and {{a major contributor to}} maternal deaths. Early screening using simple tools and proper treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are important in reducing the maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Objective: To assess the availability of supplies and knowledge of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in managing patients with preeclampsia/eclampsia in Dar-es-salaam public health facilities. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving 30 public health facilities in Dar es Salaam that offer reproductive and child services. Checklist was used to assess availability of instruments and drugs in the health facilities and, a structured questionnaire was used to assess knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> To assess knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers,</b> a score in the questionnaire of 8 - 17 marks was for adequate knowledge and a score less than 8 were for inadequate knowledge. Results: All the public health facilities had working blood pressure machines and stethoscopes for blood pressure screening, less than half had dipsticks for detection of protein in urine. Availability of drugs for treating preeclampsia and eclampsia in the health facilities was low, less than half of had magnesium sulphate for controlling and prevention of seizures.

Results The survey was completed by 791 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> On average, women reported a higher ERI than men. High ERI was associated with younger age, higher psychological morbidity, and poor physical and psychological QOL domains in this population. High ER ratio and high overcommitment were associated with psychological morbidity and poor QOL in both sexes. However, high ER ratio was not significantly associated with the social QOL domain in either sexes or the physical QOL domain in males.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> attitude of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> towards HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria. In recent times, HIV/AIDS epidemic is now one of the major issues in public health, and the sub-Saharan part of Africa has been significantly affected by the disease. Worldwide, Nigeria has the second highest number of infections reported each year, and approximately 3. 7 percent of the population live with HIV. As problems related to HIV/AIDS most times cause emotional problems like anxiety, fear, depression and withdrawal from society, the workers’ behaviour to these issues could point out their level of readiness in caring for people living with the disease. Our research was carried out on 102 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in Lagos state Nigeria in July 2015. Questionnaires were handed out to them with their permission for collection of data to analyse how Age, Location, job description, sex, department and duration of work in a health facility influence their attitude towards HIV/AIDS patients. <b>The</b> questionnaire also <b>included</b> ideas of what should be done to prevent discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients by health care workers. Considering <b>the</b> fact that <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> are expected to give care and appropriate information on health related issues to patients, their family members, and also to the general public, it is imperative that they have a reliable and detailed understanding of the disease in question and proper management of patients. The results were analysed using logistic regression methods. We found out that <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> willingness to give confidential information to family members significantly depended on their age. <b>The</b> older <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> were more likely to give out `such information than the rest. (Variables: Have given confidential information-Age, OR= 1. 0939 and P value of 0. 0182) There was no significant connection between the other variables. In conclusion, there was only one variable that influenced the health care workers attitude towards HIV positive patients.

40|$|Aims: This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the knowledge and use of disinfection policy in government hospitals in south-east geopolitical zone of Nigeria and to compare the three categories of government hospitals. Study Design: This was a descriptive, cross sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Intensive Care Units and Special Care baby Units (SCBU), Departments of Pharmacy (Compounding/Storage Unit), Medical Laboratory Services, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, between February and May 2012. Methodology: A structured self administered and pre-tested questionnaires were administered to 200 randomly selected <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> which included 40 Pharmacists, 59 Nurses, 55 Resident/General Practice Medical doctors and 46 Medical laboratory scientists, employed full-time in selected government hospitals in southeast geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Results: The sample size and the response rate were 200 and 100 % respectively. About 53. 3 % of the respondents {{have heard of the}} policy, but only 24. 5 % of them actually know what it means. Only about 22 % of all the respondents have applied the policy. The study also reveals that the level of knowledge of disinfection policy is not significantly related to the level of its application by <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in <b>the</b> southeast (P-value 0. 143, for chi-square and 0. 49, for Pearson Correlation). Up to 78 % of <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> have an idea about the different levels of disinfection. The University Teaching Hospitals seem to have better knowledge and use of the policy than the Federal Medical Centres and the General Hospitals. Conclusion: The knowledge of disinfection policy among <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> and its application is poor. This is worst in General Hospitals. There is therefore urgent need for a national policy on disinfection and health workers’ education or training on the policy and its application in all hospitals in the nation...|$|R

40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa is most {{affected}} by the AIDS pandemic and Lesotho is no exception. In many countries, <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> are at <b>the</b> forefront of the fight against AIDS. This study explores <b>the</b> difficulties facing <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in Lesotho {{using a combination of}} qualitative methods – focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The findings suggest that <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> are afraid of contracting HIV from their patients and this affects their delivery of services. In addition, the results revealed that poor infrastructure and shortage of supplies at <b>the</b> facilities hinder <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> from performing their duties effectively. The other concern was the heavy workload and severe time constraints which puts enormous stress on <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> Stigma and discrimination emerged as major problems for <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> Addressing <b>the</b> challenges facing <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> is essential in effectively managing the AIDS pandemic facing the continent...|$|R
3000|$|The {{occurrence}} of errors {{is caused by}} a combination of human factors and system factors [46]. People often make errors, and rates of human error have ranged from 30 % to 80 % [13, 47, 48]. What humans do results from interactions between people and the system in which they work. Interventions designed to increase concentration and diligence among <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> are not effective: human errors are unavoidable. Instead, the work conditions should be designed in a way that minimises errors: as stated by Reason, [...] "We cannot change the human condition, but we can change conditions under which humans work" [...] [46]. For example, when two drugs that are very similar in their presentation are stored in the same area, the human-based approach would consist of educating <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> to pay attention to this similarity to avoid errors. The system-based approach would lead to storage of the two drugs in different places. In the system approach, the key question is not identification of the person responsible for the error but determination of how the error occurred. The mechanism underlying the error is thus identified, without placing blame on <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> Then, <b>the</b> organizational flaw can be corrected with the goal of preventing further occurrences of the error.|$|R
