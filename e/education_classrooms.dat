2500|$|The late 19th century {{marked the}} era of social reforms {{directed}} at children. It was due to these social reforms {{that the need for}} school psychologists emerged. These social reforms included compulsory schooling, juvenile courts, child labor laws as well as a growth of institutions serving children. Society was starting to [...] "change the 'meaning of children' from an economic source of labor to a psychological source of love and affection". Historian Thomas Fagan argues that the preeminent force behind the need for school psychology was compulsory schooling laws. Prior to the compulsory schooling law, only 20% of school aged children completed elementary school and only 8% completed high school. Due to the compulsory schooling laws, there was an influx of students with mental and physical defects who were required by law to be in school. There needed to be an alternative method of teaching for these different children. Between 1910 and 1914, schools in both rural and urban areas created small special <b>education</b> <b>classrooms</b> for these children. From the emergence of special <b>education</b> <b>classrooms</b> came the need for [...] "experts" [...] to help assist in the process of child selection for special education. Thus, school psychology was founded.|$|E

The use of inclusion to provide gifted education within the general <b>education</b> <b>classroom</b> is one option that is more cost-effective than the traditional resource, or pullout, programs that have been used in the state of Georgia. This phenomenological study investigated the perceived experiences of general elementary educators who were new to teaching gifted students and were required to use an inclusion model in the general <b>education</b> <b>classroom.</b> Participants included 13 teachers from 4 school districts in Northern Georgia. The number of teachers interviewed was determined once data saturation had been reached. Through interviews, focus groups and journaling the researcher explored the perceived experiences and analyzed data on the use of inclusion with gifted students. The central research question was: What are the perceived experiences of general <b>education</b> <b>classroom</b> teachers during {{the first three years of}} using inclusion to instruct gifted students? Sub-questions included (a) How do the perceived experiences of general <b>education</b> <b>classroom</b> teachers using an inclusion model with gifted students affect teacher self-efficacy?

(c) What do general <b>education</b> <b>classroom</b> teachers perceive to be strengths and challenges of using inclusion models of instruction with gifted students?
