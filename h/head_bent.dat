25|$|The femur is {{the third}} segment of the insect leg, is usually the longest and strongest part of the limb, but it varies in size from the huge hind femur of leaping Orthoptera to a very small segment such as is present in many larval forms. The volume of the femur is {{generally}} correlated {{with the size of}} the tibial muscles contained within it, but it is sometimes enlarged and modified in shape for other purposes than that of accommodating the tibial muscles. The tibia is characteristically a slender segment in adult insects, only a little shorter than the femur or the combined femur and trochanter. Its proximal end forms a more or less distinct <b>head</b> <b>bent</b> toward the femur, a device allowing the tibia to be flexed close against the under surface of the femur.|$|E
500|$|For punishment, {{the chief}} of the gods struck down each of the lovers and {{transformed}} them into great mountains where they fell. Wy'east, with his head lifted in pride, became the volcano known today as Mount Hood. Pahto, with his <b>head</b> <b>bent</b> toward his fallen love, was turned into Mount Adams. The fair Loowit became Mount St. Helens, known to the Klickitats as Louwala-Clough, which means [...] "smoking or fire mountain" [...] in their language (the Sahaptin called the mountain Loowit).|$|E
500|$|Scribner's {{published}} the novel on 22October 1926. [...] Its first edition consisted of 5090 copies, selling at $2.00 per copy. Cleonike Damianakes illustrated the dust jacket with a Hellenistic {{design of a}} seated, robed woman, her <b>head</b> <b>bent</b> to her shoulder, eyes closed, one hand holding an apple, her shoulders and a thigh exposed. Editor Maxwell Perkins intended [...] "Cleon's respectably sexy" [...] design to attract [...] "the feminine readers who control the destinies of so many novels". Two months later the book was in a second printing with 7000 copies sold. Subsequent printings were ordered; by 1928, {{after the publication of}} Hemingway's short story collection Men Without Women, the novel was in its eighth printing. In 1927 the novel was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape, titled Fiesta, without the two epigraphs. Two decades later, in 1947, Scribner's released three of Hemingway's works as a boxed set, including The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls.|$|E

500|$|A young four-armed Shiva and a {{beautiful}} two-armed Parvati should be the central figures, performing the panigrahana ("accepting the hand") ritual of a Hindu wedding, where the groom accepts the bride by taking her right hand in his. Shiva stands in tribhanga posture, {{with one of his}} legs straight and firmly on the ground and the other one slightly [...] bent. Shiva wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, adorned with a crescent moon. He wears serpents as earrings, as a waist band and as a necklace. Various gold ornaments adorn his body. His back hands carry a parashu (axe) and a mriga (deer). His front left hand makes the varada mudra ("blessing-giving gesture") and his front right hand is stretched ahead to receive the hand of the bride. A dark-complexioned Parvati, adorned in silk and gold finery, stands to the left of Shiva, blushing with her <b>head</b> <b>bent</b> slightly as she extends her right arm to hold Shiva's right hand. She holds a nilotpala (blue lotus) in her left arm.|$|E
500|$|Maxentius {{organized}} his forces—still {{twice the}} size of Constantine's—in long lines facing the battle plain, with their backs to the river. Constantine's army arrived at the field bearing unfamiliar symbols on either its standards or its soldiers' shields. According to Lactantius, Constantine was visited by a dream the night before the battle, wherein he was advised [...] "to mark the heavenly sign of God on the shields of his soldiers... by means of a slanted letter X with the top of its <b>head</b> <b>bent</b> round, he marked Christ on their shields." [...] Eusebius describes another version, where, while marching at midday, [...] "he saw with his own eyes in the heavens a trophy of the cross arising from the light of the sun, carrying the message, In Hoc Signo Vinces or [...] "with this sign, you shall win"; in Eusebius's account, Constantine had a dream the following night, in which Christ appeared with the same heavenly sign, and told him to make a standard, the labarum, for his army in that form. Eusebius is vague about when and where these events took place, but it enters his narrative before the war against Maxentius begins. Eusebius describes the sign as Chi (Χ) traversed by Rho (Ρ): ☧, a symbol representing the first two letters of the Greek spelling of the word Christos or Christ. In 315AD a medallion was issued at Ticinum showing Constantine wearing a helmet emblazoned with the Chi Rho, and coins issued at Siscia in 317/318AD repeat the image. The figure was otherwise rare, however, and is uncommon in imperial iconography and propaganda before the 320s.|$|E

2500|$|Seven years later, Steven I. Engel, a Jew, {{was upset}} {{to see his}} son’s hands clasped and his <b>head</b> <b>bent</b> in prayer. He told his son that this was “not the way we say prayers.” Engel, a {{founding}} member of the New York Civil Liberties Union, would bring action along with Daniel Lichtenstein, Monroe Lerner, Lenore Lyons, and Lawrence Roth, all parents of children in the Long Island, New York public school system, against Union Free School District No. 9 for its adoption and subsequent prescription of the so-called [...] "Regent's prayer", arguing that it constituted the state-sponsored establishment of religion in violation of citizens’ First Amendment rights via the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|The pensive pose {{involves}} {{a figure that}} has one leg [...] crossed over a pendant leg, the ankle of the crossed leg rests on the [...] knee of the pendant leg. [...] The elbow of the figure's raised arm rests on [...] the crossed leg's knee while the fingers rest or almost rest on the [...] cheek of the <b>head</b> <b>bent</b> in introspection. [...] As shown above, Prince [...] Siddhārtha was typically depicted in a seated position in the dhyāna mudra when depicted as meditating in [...] early Indian sculpture. [...] A statue that can be dated to the 2nd or 3rd century in the pensive pose from Mathura, [...] it is believed, is the prototypical example of the pensive pose. [...] In [...] China, bodhisattvas in the pensive pose are typically described via [...] inscription to be the pensive prince, i.e. Prince Siddhārtha [...] meditating. [...] Pensive bodhisattvas in Chinese sculpture {{can also be seen}} [...] as attendants to images in the cross-ankle seated position, a pose associated [...] with Maitreya in China. [...] This fact indicates that the pensive pose was [...] not the iconography associated with Maitreya Bodhisattva.|$|E
