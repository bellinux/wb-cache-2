The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear.

Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds {{he or she is}} producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.|$|E

Throughout the tour various setlists were used. [...] "The Lazy Song" [...] {{was one of the}} highlights of the tour as the crowd sung. It also contained a comedic interlude when Mars’ backup singer and songwriting partner, Phillip Lawrence, shouted the verse of the track [...] "OMG this is great!". At this moment, the music stopped, Mars introduced Lawrence to the fans and asked if they wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> line again.

When he finished writing and recording the demos, Hunt began the album's primary recording sessions at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles. With What Were You Hoping For?, Hunt pursued a [...] "harder edge" [...] and rawer aesthetic than featured on his previous work. He {{also wanted to}} explore a self-described [...] "gnarly" [...] guitar sound inspired {{by the work of}} Muddy Waters and The Stooges' 1973 album Raw Power. Hunt attempted the sound in the past, but encountered discouragement from management. He discussed his direction for the album in an interview for The Boombox, stating [...] "t wasn't necessarily punk music. It was more about trying to capture the growl of a cello. That to me is as nasty as it can get. That's a beautiful sound to me. When people talk about the distortion on the guitar, I <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing with that growl of a cello." [...] Hunt wanted to take advantage of his newfound feeling of artistic freedom and lack of concern over marketability.|$|E
500|$|Ofcom {{estimates}} {{that even after}} extra spectrum has been allocated to DAB, around 90local radio stations {{will be unable to}} transmit on DAB, either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex, or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging. Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB. The success of the small scale DAB multiplexes may alleviate this issue to some degree. One of the drawbacks of DAB and DAB+ has not been addressed. In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency (i.e. a sine wave). In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated. The signal at the receiver (radio) is then demodulated and the information is retrieved. The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously. In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal, so that if you move between different radios that are spatially apart you are likely to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios. The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing. If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal, whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly.|$|E

In some cases, clubs are housed in multi-story venues with balconies or in [...] "L"-shaped rooms, which makes it hard to get a consistent sound for all audience members.

2500|$|On October 9, 2002, Zittrain and Lawrence Lessig argued a {{landmark}} case, known as Eldred v. Ashcroft, before the United States Supreme Court.

The court ruled 7–2 on January 15, 2003 to uphold the CTEA which extended existing copyrights 20 years, {{from the life of}} the author plus 50 years, to plus 70 years. In the words of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the petitioners did [...] "not challenge the CTEA's 'life-plus-70-years' time span itself.
