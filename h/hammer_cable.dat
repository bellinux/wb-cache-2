50|$|Bonnie Hammer is an American businesswoman {{and network}} executive. As Chairman of NBCUniversal <b>Cable,</b> <b>Hammer</b> oversees the leading cable brands USA, The Sci-Fi Channel, E!, Bravo, Oxygen, Esquire Network, Sprout, TV One, Chiller, Cloo, and Universal HD, {{as well as}} {{production}} entities Universal Cable Productions and Wilshire Studios.|$|R
50|$|Hammer was an ally to the mutant Cable and {{a member}} of the Six Pack. <b>Hammer</b> {{appeared}} in <b>Cable</b> & Deadpool as part of a new 'Six-Pack'. They are hired by the U.S. government as part of a public relations mission against Cable, who by that point was ruling two separate countries. Hammer assists in a raid against the fictional Rumekistan; the intent is to disrupt its recently modified electrical grid and discredit Cable.|$|R
50|$|Kane {{is granted}} robotic arms by the Weapon X program. G.W. Bridge, {{an agent of}} S.H.I.E.L.D. now, acts as liaison to Weapon X. Kane {{undertakes}} a mission to destroy <b>Cable.</b> <b>Hammer</b> provides him with vital information and Kane and Cable battle until circumstances bring them together to battle Stryfe once again. Kanes arms are destroyed and Cable uses his time-travel capabilities {{to take him to}} the far future. His arms are replaced with liquid metal versions.|$|R
25|$|A {{bell tower}} {{may have a}} single bell, or a {{collection}} of bells which are tuned to a common scale. They may be stationary and chimed, rung randomly by swinging through a small arc, or swung through a full circle to enable {{the high degree of}} control of English change ringing. They may house a carillon or chimes, in which the bells are sounded by <b>hammers</b> connected via <b>cables</b> to a keyboard. These can be found in many churches and secular buildings in Europe and America including college and university campuses.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} Great Bell, the belfry houses four quarter bells which play the Westminster Quarters on the quarter hours. The four quarter bells sound G, F, E, and B. They were cast by John Warner & Sons at their Crescent Foundry in 1857 (G, F and B) and 1858 (E). The Foundry was in Jewin Crescent, {{in what is}} now known as The Barbican, in the City of London. The bells are sounded by <b>hammers</b> pulled by <b>cables</b> coming from the link room—a low-ceiling space between the clock room and the belfry—where {{mechanisms}} translate the movement of the quarter train into the sounding of the individual bells.|$|R
40|$|Abstracts: Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are carcinogenic and persistent will be restricted in consumer products from December 27, 2015 by EU REACH regulation. Pretreatment using Soxhlet extraction and quantitative analysis by GC-MS were studied {{to develop the}} method for analyzing 18 PAHs in consumer products {{as well as to}} detect the amounts and the kinds of PAHs in consumer products such as grips of a bag and a <b>hammer,</b> a <b>cable</b> and a plastic sandal. Linearity and precisions were evaluated by analyses of the standard PAH solutions ranging from 0. 3125 mg/L to 5. 00 mg of each of 18 PAHs. Linearity of resulting standard curves for all 18 PAHs were obtained with R 2 above 0. 999. Precisions of the retention times and the peak areas were found to be 0. 00 %~ 0. 05 % and 1. 16 %~ 3. 69 % of relative standard deviations, respectively. The recoveries for spiked samples were all around 95 %~ 105 % after Soxhlet extration using three different solvents such as dichloromethane, hexane and toluene. The limits of quantitation for 18 PAHs in solutions and polymer samples by GC-MS were evaluated to be 0. 327 mg/L (Benzo[ghi]perylene) ~ 0. 464 mg/L (Acenaphthylene) and 1. 635 mg/kg (Benzo[ghi]perylene) ~ 2. 32 mg/kg (Acenaphthylene) based upon dilution factor of 5, respectively. Under the developed analytical method, only trace amounts of phenanthrene were detected in three samples while 15 kinds of PAHs including phenanthrene were detected in a grip of hammer with concentrations of maximum 83. 4 mg/kg of Phenanthrene and minimum 8. 5 mg/kg of Acenaphthylene.

5000|$|Alongside Wade Wilson, the Weapon X program [...] "fixed" [...] Kane by {{transforming}} {{him into}} a cyborg, by grafting cybernetic arms in place of his real ones. He was loaned to the Canadian government's Department K {{to work as a}} covert operative. Kane battled Deadpool, and was asked by former Six Pack colleague and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent G. W. Bridge to help capture Cable; he refused at that time to join the strike team named Weapon P.R.I.M.E. Kane confronted the Mutant Liberation Front, and then Kane assembled and led Weapon P.R.I.M.E in an attack on Cable and X-Force. The goal of Weapon P.R.I.M.E was to apprehend Cable and X-Force for multiple reasons, including Kane's belief that Cable and Stryfe were one and the same. Kane visited <b>Hammer</b> and battled <b>Cable</b> in Switzerland. Kane learned the truth about Stryfe, and with Cable, he fought the Silver Samurai's ninjas in Japan and battled Stryfe and the Mutant Liberation Front in Mexico. Kane was brought by Cable to the 40th Century A.D. to save Kane's life and give him new bionic arms. While in Cable's future, Kane's artificial limbs were reconstructed in liquid metal and upgraded with new weaponry and tools by Cable's freedom fighter group, Clan Chosen. Alongside the Clan Chosen rebels, Kane battled the Flatliners, and learned about Cable's past. He was then reunited with Cable.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Due to the {{projectile}} {{nature of}} the hammer after release the most important release parameter with respect to distance thrown is the release speed. As result {{it is vital that}} athletes ensure the acceleration to the release speed is optimal. Currently the most accurate way to determine speed data is via hammer head positional data and the fastest way to determine positional data is via automatic tracking. This will usually require post-processing and as such does not allow immediate feedback in the training environment. For athletes to improve technique it is important to provide accurate information about their performance as soon as possible after the event; delays in providing such information reduce the effectiveness of feedback[1]. This study's purpose was to determine and validate a model that predicts <b>hammer</b> speed from <b>cable</b> force in order to provide feedback on speed development in the training environment. Methodology: Five males and five females participated in this study and each was required to perform 10 throws with a hammer that had a strain gauge mounted on its wire. Retro-reflective markers were also positioned on each wire at known distances from the hammer's head. Each strain gauge was calibrated by applying forces to the wire that were measured by a force link (Kistler, Amherst USA). These data were later used to determine the relationship between strain gauge A-D units and force by performing a linear regression. The resultant regression was then used to convert the strain gauge throw A-D data into force. Positions of the markers were tracked with an infra-red camera system (Oxford Metrics, Oxford UK) and these positional data were used in conjunction with direction cosines to determine the hammer head's position. From this, linear <b>hammer</b> speed and <b>cable</b> force were calculated[2]. This speed and force data were used to determine two linear regression models that predict speed from force data: one where the data sets were shifted so that the peaks in force and speed lined up and one where neither data set was altered. These two models were used to predict speed from cable force data that were measured using the strain gauge device. Results: Using the models and strain gauge data allowed prediction of speeds that were nearly identical to the speeds calculated from positional data (R = 0. 98 for both). The average difference between the calculated speeds and speeds predicted via the non-shifted model was 0. 89 ± 0. 68 m. s- 1. The difference when using the shifted model was 0. 46 ± 0. 70 m. s- 1. Conclusion: The results {{of this study indicate that}} use of the models and the measured cable force data allowed prediction of highly accurate speed data however; the shifted regression model predicted data that were slightly more accurate.
