Coonan said of his casting, [...] "EastEnders {{has been a part of}} my life since I was 12 years old. I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life." [...] Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "It's wonderful to have Daniel Coonan <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> Walford to play Carl White. Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge, will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long, or can [...] Max [...] save her from the lure of the dark side?" [...] This is Coonan's second role in EastEnders, as he played David Priors in 2011. Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme, though describing his first day on set as Carl, he said, [...] "it still hits you when you walk on to the Square for the very first time. It's like walking into your TV." [...] Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set. Heat reported that Carl's introduction was part of a [...] "rescue plan" [...] to increase ratings for EastEnders, especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), saying [...] "with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet, producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters, returning familiar faces and exciting storylines." [...] Coonan later said of being cast, [...] "When they offered the part of Carl to me, I thought about it as long as it takes to blink your eyelids. I knew it would be a great character and fun to play. Something like this can massively raise your profile. I'm beaming into thousands of people's homes four times a week." [...] Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period, but instead filmed over 60 episodes. After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show, he revealed that he was approached to play Carl.|$|E

What have we to offer Australia in return for <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> a share of such obligations as all these entail? Are her taxpayers anxious to contribute to their cost? Have her politicians either leisure or special competency for aiding in their administration? India, we must assume, would come within the province and jurisdiction of the Federation. It would hardly be either an advantage or a pleasure to the people of a young country, with all their busy tasks hot on their hands, to be interrupted by the duty of helping by men or cash to put down an Indian Mutiny, and even in quiet times to see their politicians attending to India instead of minding their own very sufficiently exacting business.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present Clara, a novel static-analysis {{framework}} {{for the implementation of}} hybrid static/dynamic typestate analyses. Clara uses static typestate analyses to automatically convert any AspectJ monitoring aspect into a residual runtime monitor that only monitors events triggered by program locations that the analyses failed to prove safe. If the static analysis succeeds on all locations, this gives strong static guarantees. If not, the efficient residual runtime monitor is guaranteed to capture property violations at runtime. Researchers can easily integrate their own static typestate analyses into Clara. We instantiated Clara with three static typestate analyses and applied these analyses to monitoring aspects generated from tracematches and by the JavaMOP runtime-monitoring tool. Clara is available as open source. We hope that other researchers will soon be <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> using Clara, and that this will foster progress in the field of typestate analysis. ...|$|E

I {{want to thank all}} of our AAEA members and guests for <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> this beautiful city. Likewise, it is a special pleasure to partner with the Western Association. We have a very ex-citing meeting organized and I am confident that we will find intellectual stimulation, exciting professional interactions, fun, and an opportunity to meet old and new friends alike. The future of any organization lies in its young members. With that in mind, I am especially excited to welcome our newest generations of agricultural, applied, and environmental economists to what I am sure will be a very fulfilling meeting. These meetings play an important role in our professional lives, but no role is as important as that of presenting our association and all that it has to offer to our younger members. I recall the excitement that I experienced in attending my first meeting and I encourage all of our more senior members (that’s anyone who is beyond their first year of membership) to make a special effort to welcome our newest and youngest members who may be attending for the first time. At the same time, I encourage our younger members, especially students, to introduce yourselves to these more senior members. It’s a big meeting but we are really a small and very friendly community. The meetings have something to offer for everyone. My biggest frustration with our meetings is that I cannot be in several places at once to enjoy so many of the outstanding presentations and activities. There are two pre-conference workshops.

40|$|EDITORIAL Walailak Journal of Science and Technology I {{am pleased}} to launch the Walailak Journal of Science and Technology. Science and {{technological}} changes are occurring at a very rapid rate and present a potential crisis of information and decision making. It is critically important that we not only learn to manage this swiftly advancing flood of new knowledge, but that we examine its implications for our everyday lives. Taking biomedical science as an example, the time between important results in basic science research and clinical applications has gone from years to months as research technology and testing becomes faster and more efficient. Scientists and clinicians are working together to bring advances from the laboratory to the lifestyle of an informed public. In such an arena, academic research is an indispensable catalyst to all aspects of societal advancement. Walailak University realizes the vital bond between research and its educational mission. It encourages a wide collaboration among academics in the interdisplinary fields of science, technology, engineering and agricultural technology. It funds research and encourages its own academic staff to engage in research efforts. It welcomes the contributions of academics from both Thai and foreign universities. The unique contributions that research can make {{in the coming decades}} depends on our vision of how we will work together to bring about improvements to Thai society. The Walailak Journal of Science and Technology serves as an opportunity to show we value innovation, dialogue, and engagement and that we will not shrink from presenting our vision and our actions to those who are open to <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> our partnership for progress in Thai society. I look forward to the publication of a continuing stream of dynamic research results and reflective reader feedback, insuring that the Walailak Journal of Science and Technology will be a research vanguard in Thailand.

Coenen is our Associate Dean for Faculty Development and will work with our faculty, especially our junior professors, to expand and promote scholarly activities at UGA. Walter Hellerstein now has the title of Distinguished Research Professor, which is a university-wide designation recognizing original and influential scholarship. Peter A. Appel and Randy Beck have been appointed to newly established endowed positions – the Smith Professorship and the Marshall Chair of Constitutional Law, respectively. Lori A. Ringhand and Peter B. “Bo” Rutledge have been elevated to the rank of full professor. And, Fazal Khan and Sonja R. West have been named associate professors with tenure, while Harlan G. Cohen was promoted to associate professor. Georgia Law also began renovating its buildings to provide a more modern and dynamic complex designed to enhance the academic atmosphere for both the learning and the study of law.
