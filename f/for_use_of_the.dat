5|$|Eugene Harold Krabs is {{commonly}} known as the greedy founder and owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant, where SpongeBob works as a fry cook and Squidward works as a cashier. The restaurant's success is built on little competition and the popularity of the Krusty Krab's signature sandwich, the Krabby Patty, the formula to which is a closely guarded trade secret. Mr. Krabs frequently exploits his restaurant's popularity, engaging in price gouging and charging his own employees <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building's services.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, an {{animated}} television series called Lupin VIII was planned as a French-Japanese co-production, featuring {{the descendants of}} Lupin, Goemon, Jigen, and Zenigata, but was never completed. Created by DiC Animation, with Rintaro directing, and character designs by Shingo Araki; two scripts were written, and one episode was fully animated with a music and sound effects track, but the voice-overs were never recorded. It {{has been suggested that}} the project was stopped due to Leblanc's estate wanting a large amount of money <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lupin name. The single episode was later included in the 2012 Lupin III Master File box set.|$|E

5|$|Many of Sorabji's {{works are}} {{written for the}} piano or have an {{important}} piano part. His writing for the instrument was influenced by that of composers such as Liszt, Alkan and Godowsky, {{and he has been}} described as a composer-pianist in their tradition, partly because he was one of the 20th century's most prolific piano composers. It exhibits particularly the influence of Godowsky, specifically in its polyphony and its use of polyrhythms and polydynamics. This necessitated the regular use of systems of more than two staves in Sorabji's keyboard parts, reaching its peak on page 124 of the manuscript of his Third Organ Symphony (1949–53), which uses 11 staves, as well as frequent calls <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sostenuto pedal.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{have had}} seven stadiums {{throughout}} their history; {{the first was}} at Blue House Field in Hendon in 1879. The ground {{was close to the}} place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground was £10 (£ today). The club relocated briefly to Groves Field in Ashbrooke in 1882, before moving again the following season. The club's third stadium was Horatio Street in Roker, the first Sunderland stadium north of the River Wear; the club played a single season there before another move, this time to Abbs Field in Fulwell for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of there being no tolls <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river {{was established by}} the 1664 act of parliament. This was reversed by the 1794 act, which imposed high tolls, until they were reduced by the provisions of an act of Parliament obtained in 1824. The river is now managed by the Environment Agency between Stamford and just below Fosdyke bridge, and a licence is required to use it. From there to the Wash, it was managed by the Port of Fosdyke Authority, but since they went into administration, the Environment Agency have also managed the section from Fosdyke Bridge to below the Holbeach River.|$|E

5|$|The {{speedway}} stadium {{became the}} home of rugby league club, Broughton Rangers, who recruited international players including Frank Whitcombe (who also worked in the zoo as a zookeeper), Billy Stott, and James Cumberbatch. When the club {{was taken over by}} Belle Vue in 1933 Broughton were given a 21-year lease <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium, at a rent to be based on attendances. The first Anglo-Australian Test match of the 1933–34 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain was played at Belle Vue, with the home side's victory attracting approximately 34,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|The toll {{collected}} by Autocesta RijekaZagreb <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A6 motorway is not reported separately. Autocesta RijekaZagreb only reports it total toll revenue, including toll revenue {{collected on the}} A7 motorway (RupaJurdani section) and the A1 motorway (LučkoBosiljevo2 section) {{as well as on}} the Krk Bridge. In the first half of the 2010 their toll revenue was 188.2 million Croatian kuna (25.3 million euros).|$|E
5|$|The two 37mm (1.46in) Bordkanone BK 3,7 cannons were {{mounted in}} {{under-wing}} gun pods, each loaded with two six-round magazines of armour-piercing tungsten carbide-cored ammunition. With these weapons, the Kanonenvogel ("cannon-bird"), {{as it was}} nicknamed, proved very successful {{in the hands of}} Stuka aces such as Rudel. The G-1 was converted from older D-series airframes, retaining the smaller wing, but without the dive brakes. The G-2 was similar to the G-1 except <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extended wing of the D-5. 208 G-2s were built and at least a further 22 more were converted from D-3 airframes.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{negotiations}} {{continued with}} the Americans. Oliver Franks, the British Ambassador to the United States, lodged a formal request on 2 August 1951 <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nevada Test Site. This was looked upon favourably by the United States Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, {{and the chairman}} of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, but opposed by the Robert A. Lovett, the Deputy Secretary of Defense and Robert LeBaron, the Deputy Secretary of Defence for Atomic Energy Affairs. The British government had announced on 7 June 1951 that Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, had been a Soviet spy. In view of security concerns, Lovett and LeBaron wanted the tests to be conducted by Americans, with British participation limited to Penney and a few selected British scientists. Truman endorsed this counterproposal on 24 September 1951.|$|E
5|$|The A2 is a tolled motorway, {{based on}} the vehicle {{classification}} in Croatia, using a closed toll system. As of July 2011, the toll charged along the A2 route between the Zaprešić and Trakošćan mainline toll plazas varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled, ranging from 1.00 kuna (0.13 euros) to 42.00 kuna (5.48 euros) for passenger cars and 47.00 kuna (6.13 euro) to 187.00 kuna (24.40 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit and debit cards. A prepaid toll collection system is also used. The A2 is the only motorway in Croatia which does not provide <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ENC—an electronic toll collection (ETC) system shared by most motorways in Croatia that provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. In addition to the vehicle classification in Croatia, the motorway operator maintains an additional vehicle category for motorbikes, which are charged from 7.00 kuna (0.91 euros) to 25.00 kuna (3.26 euros) toll. The southernmost Jankomir–Zaprešić section of the motorway is not tolled, as {{it is part of the}} Zagreb bypass.|$|E
5|$|The WHT is {{operated}} by the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING), together with the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope and 1.0m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope. Offices and administration are located an hour's drive away in Santa Cruz de La Palma, the island's capital. Funding {{is provided by the}} UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC, 65%), the Netherlands' Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO, 25%) and Spain's Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC, 10%) (2008 values). Telescope time is distributed in proportion to this funding, although Spain receives an additional 20% allocation in return <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observatory site. Five percent of observing time is further reserved for astronomers of other nationalities. As a competitive research telescope, the WHT is heavily oversubscribed, typically receiving applications for three to four times as much observing time as is actually available.|$|E
