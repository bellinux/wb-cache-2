5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor. After Andrew pledged that {{neither he nor}} his brother would take vengeance on those who had voted against them in 1594, the Diet elected him prince on 28 March. However, as Alfonso Carillo noted, the most influential noblemen remained opposed to Andrew, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not dare to raise an objection openly.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin and the {{legislature}} continued to clash throughout {{the remainder of}} 1861 and into 1862. They found agreement only on the most menial of legislation, such as a bill to allow the common schools to continue the sessions that had been interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. He found particularly onerous a bill forfeiting the citizenship of anyone who fought for or aided the Confederacy, but in March 1862, his veto of the bill was overridden. Magoffin also opposed the military rule of Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle, who he believed was violating {{the civil rights of}} states' rights advocates, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not advocate secession.|$|E

5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision. They argued that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not change existing plans, were real and harmful; that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; {{that the costs of}} reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans; and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools. The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E
5|$|On another {{occasion}} during the war, when {{the lady in}} waiting who usually picked them up from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, Tatiana and her sister Olga decided to go shopping for the first time. They ordered the carriage to stop near a group of shops and went {{into one of the}} stores, where they were unrecognized because of their nurses' uniforms. They came back out without buying anything when they realized they did not have money with them and wouldn't have known how to use it <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> The next day they asked Chebotareva how to use money.|$|E
5|$|Ceasefire {{negotiations}} {{began in}} 1285, {{and ended with}} Narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in June 1286. The Burmese embassy, received by the emperor in Beijing in January 1287, agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty or the Mongol Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the Yunnan government {{in exchange for the}} evacuation of Mongol troops from northern Burma. But the treaty never really took effect as Narathihapate was assassinated in July 1287, and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged. The Mongol command at Yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma. They may not have reached Pagan, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to Tagaung.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|As a captain, Jardine {{inspired}} great loyalty in his players, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not approve}} of his tactics. Christopher Douglas judges that Jardine did very well to keep the team united and loyal on the Bodyline tour. He points out that team spirit was always excellent and the players showed great determination and resolve. Jardine particularly impressed Yorkshiremen who played under him, as they believed he thought about cricket {{in a similar way}} to their county colleagues. He became close to Herbert Sutcliffe during the Bodyline tour, even though Sutcliffe was sceptical about Jardine on the previous Australian tour in 1928–29. Hedley Verity was impressed by Jardine's tactical understanding and named his younger son Douglas after the captain. Bill Bowes expressed approval of his leadership after initial misgivings, and went on to call him England's greatest captain. Nevertheless, some players such as Arthur Mitchell who played under Jardine believed he was intolerant and unsupportive of players of lesser talent, expecting everyone to perform at world-class standards.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the move}} to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, the menu and wine list were {{expanded}} once more. White sought to have a far wider range of wine than at other three Michelin star restaurants; one example given was that while a different restaurant might have four or five bottles of Pétrus, the Oak Room list had more than 70 different vintages. There was a collection of Château d'Yquem listed over five pages going back to 1850. By November 1997, the wine cellar was valued at £1.5 million, with an average weekly taking on wine alone between £25,000 and £30,000. The menu was changed to include more table service, such as meat carvings. The other courses and side dishes were carried from the kitchen on silver platters.

5|$|The Ottoman-Albanian war {{continued}} through 1465 with Ballaban Badera meeting Skanderbeg at Vaikal, Meçad, Vaikal again, and Kashari. In the meantime, Mehmed continued to negotiate peace with Hungary and Venice. Skanderbeg found himself isolated during these negotiations, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not succeed, as the conflicting powers temporarily ceased conflict. Furthermore, Ferdinand I of Naples did not send his promised {{forces and the}} Venetian forces under Cimarosto left Albania. During the autumn of 1465, Ottoman forces moved from the Morea and Bosnia in order {{to speed up the}} peace negotiations. Venice, however, refused peace and Skanderbeg believed that a new Albanian-Venetian campaign would begin. He kept Pal Engjëlli, his ambassador, in constant correspondence with the Signoria (Venetian Senate), which sent him to Albania to inform Skanderbeg that troops were being raised, although only 300 had been recruited at the time, with Cimarosto as the commander. Venice was also in the process of sending its provveditores in Albania Veneta 3,000 ducats to recruit men. They would also send four cannons, ten springalds, and ten barrels of gunpowder. Throughout April, rumors spread that the Ottomans were preparing to march into Albania. By 18 April 1466, Venice received knowledge that the Ottomans were heading towards Albania.|$|E
5|$|Tickets to {{the game}} sold quickly at first, but trailed off as the game approached. Virginia Tech sold 5,000 tickets {{in the first three}} days after the Hokies were selected, but one week later, Tech managed to {{increase}} that total to just 8,300. In an effort to spur sales at the school, Virginia Tech athletic director Jim Weaver asked fans to buy tickets <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not plan on attending the game. The tickets could then be donated to charity. As an incentive for Gator Bowl officials to select Virginia Tech, the school agreed to sell 18,000 tickets—more than the minimum 11,500 North Carolina agreed to sell. When a shortfall resulted in Tech selling just 11,000 tickets, the school was forced to purchase the remaining 7,000, costing Virginia Tech $245,000. At North Carolina, tickets sales were even slower, with about 6,000 having been sold through the school two weeks after the matchup was announced. The Gator Bowl ticket office sold approximately 22,000 tickets directly to fans in the same timeframe, and Gator Bowl officials predicted a crowd of between 50,000 and 55,000 people at the game.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} of black-figure pottery painting is traditionally {{described in terms}} of various regional styles and schools. Using Corinth as the hub, there were basic differences in the productions of the individual regions, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> influence each other. Especially in Attica, although not exclusively there, the best and most influential artists of their time characterized classical Greek pottery painting.

25|$|The Pagan Empire {{collapsed}} in 1287 due to repeated Mongol invasions (1277–1301). Recent {{research shows that}} Mongol armies may not have reached Bagan itself, and that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. However, the damage had already been done. The city, once home to some 50,000 to 200,000 people, {{had been reduced to}} a small town, never to regain its preeminence. The city formally ceased to be the capital of Burma in December 1297 when the Myinsaing Kingdom became the new power in Upper Burma.|$|E
25|$|No {{evidence}} of divine right: Even if the Christian God exists, {{there is no}} evidence that the Orange-Nassaus have been given a divine right, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> any God could also one day withdraw his or her grace from them (as he did with several Old Testament kings, or, according to the 1581 Act of Abjuration on which Dutch independence was based, with Philip II of Spain).

25|$|In {{his most}} famous exploit, Nicholas aided a poor man who had three daughters, but could not afford a proper dowry for them. This meant that they would remain {{unmarried}} and probably, in absence of any other possible employment, would have to become prostitutes. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not, unmarried maidens in those days would have been assumed as being a prostitute. Hearing of the girls' plight, Nicholas decided to help them, but being too modest to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of accepting charity), {{he went to the}} house under the cover of night and threw three purses (one for each daughter) filled with gold coins through the window opening into the house.|$|E
25|$|The New Voice group, however, {{understood}} that their {{only hope for}} success was to move the debate out of the executive council. In the executive council, each union—no matter how small—had an equal vote. A group of 20 small unions could make binding decisions even though their membership might be far {{less than that of}} their opponents. But at the AFL-CIO convention, each union was allotted delegates proportional to the size of its membership. At the convention, a coalition of large unions could triumph <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not represent a majority of unions. It would have been foolish for the New Voice slate, whose base was in some of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO, to pursue their goals in the executive council where their votes counted for less.|$|E
25|$|Information on the Assyrian army {{during this}} time is {{difficult}} to make out. The Assyrians were able to establish their independence on two occasions, during the Old Assyrian Kingdom and the Middle Assyrian Kingdom, with the latter reaching as far as Babylon {{in their pursuit of}} conquest. However, military tactics mainly involved using troops raised from farmers who had finished planting their fields and so could campaign for the king until harvest time called for their attention again. The result was that military campaigning was limited to a few months of the year. As a result, armies could not conquer vast amounts of land without having to rest (and hence allow their enemy to recover) and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> they {{would not be able to}} garrison conquered lands with troops for long.|$|E
