50|$|Clix is a miniatures wargaming system {{developed}} by WizKids. It {{is characterized by}} the use of a <b>dial</b> <b>wheel</b> in the base of miniature figurines. The dial can be turned to reveal hidden information, representing the changing statistics of the figurine as the game progresses. This has been rebranded into the Combat Dial System by WizKids.|$|E
5000|$|The Ottoman {{engineer}} Taqi al-Din {{invented a}} mechanical astronomical clock, capable of striking an alarm {{at any time}} specified by the user. He described the clock in his book, The Brightest Stars for the Construction of Mechanical Clocks (Al-Kawākib al-durriyya fī wadh' al-bankāmat al-dawriyya), published in 1559. Similarly to earlier 15th-century European alarm clocks, his clock was capable of sounding at a specified time, achieved by placing a peg on the <b>dial</b> <b>wheel.</b> At the requested time, the peg activated a ringing device. [...] This clock had three dials which showed the hours, degrees and minutes.|$|E
60|$|Its cadenced Greek delights me not, I feel With such a goodly {{time too}} {{out of tune}} To love it much: for like the <b>Dial's</b> <b>wheel</b> That from its blinded {{darkness}} strikes the noon Yet never sees the sun, so do my eyes Restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies.|$|R
50|$|ROW M-755 Paint {{finishes}} and interiors {{were also}} only offered in two colour choices - Alpine White with Ochre/Grey detailing and upholstery - or Black with Turquoise detailing and grey/turquoise upholstery. On ROW cars {{there was no}} Le Mans logo, nor striping and the phone <b>dial</b> <b>wheels</b> in white or black matching color had outer rims of respectively ochre or turquoise. ROW Upholstery was the grey/ochre striped flannel cloth with ochre piping for Alpine White cars, or grey/turquoise flannel with turquoise piping for Black cars.|$|R
5000|$|A jog <b>dial,</b> jog <b>wheel,</b> shuttle <b>dial,</b> or shuttle <b>wheel</b> {{is a type}} of knob, ring, <b>wheel,</b> or <b>dial</b> {{which allows}} the user to shuttle or jog through audio or video media. It is {{commonly}} found on models of CD players which are made for disc jockeys, and on professional video equipment such as video tape recorders. More recently, they are found on handheld PDAs, and as the scroll wheel on computer mice. [...] "Jog" [...] refers to going at a very slow speed, whereas [...] "shuttle" [...] refers to a very fast speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{most complex}} {{internal}} part was the rotary dial mechanism, an assembly of gears, cams, springs, and electrical contacts which mechanically generated a timed train of line loop-break pulses when the <b>dial</b> finger <b>wheel</b> was released after rotation. During {{the period of}} dial rotation, the receiver was shunted to avoid hearing the dialing pulses.|$|R
50|$|Like many {{of these}} more {{practical}} devices, its main purpose was to strike a bell at precise times. It probably {{did not have a}} <b>dial.</b> The <b>wheels</b> and gears are mounted in a four-post wrought iron frame. The framework was not held together with nuts and bolts (which had not been invented), but rather with metal wedged tenons.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical safe locks are {{manipulated}} {{primarily by}} feel, and vision. Sound also aids the process occasionally. To find the combination the operator uses the lock against itself by measuring internal movements with the dial numbers. More sophisticated locks use advanced mechanics to eliminate any feedback a technician {{could use to}} identify a combination. These group 1 locks were developed in response to group 2 lock manipulation and can be identified {{by the lack of}} feeling in the dial or by a push/turn <b>dial</b> <b>Wheels</b> made from lightweight materials will reduce valuable sensory feedback, but are mainly manufactured as X-ray resistant locks [...] Manipulation is the often the preferred choice in lost-combination lockouts, since it requires no repairs or damage, but can be time consuming for a operator,the specific difficulty depends on the unique wheel shapes and where the gates rest in relation to them. A novice's opening time will be governed by these random inconsistencies, while some leading champions of this art show admirable consistency. There are also a number of tools on the market to assist safe engineers in manipulating a combination lock open in the field.|$|R
50|$|Qwt or Qt Widgets for Technical Applications {{is a set}} {{of custom}} Qt widgets, GUI Components and utility classes which are {{primarily}} useful for programs with a technical background. Beside a 2D plot widget it provides scales, sliders, <b>dials,</b> compasses, thermometers, <b>wheels</b> and knobs to control or display values, arrays, or ranges of type double.|$|R
50|$|The handle {{was fitted}} in size {{according}} to the dimensions of an average face, which had been taken {{as the starting point}} of the design process. In the completed product, the distance between the transmitter (mouth piece) and the receiver (ear phone) was noticeably shorter than earlier models. The handle was made as light as possible to minimize the stress inflicted upon the wrist and blood veins of the speaker during long calls. The weight of the base unit was also minimized especially due to logistic and packaging reasons. The <b>dial</b> finger <b>wheel</b> and face plate consisted of several parts and was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} replace with a set of buttons in a later version of the phone.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, 2003 {{models were}} {{introduced}} with new tail lights which created a circle when illuminated and also gained revised <b>dials</b> and new <b>wheel</b> designs. In September 2003, 2004 model year Civics received a facelifted front end (designed in 2002) with new headlights, bumper, and grille; it also received side skirts. In September 2004, the Special Edition trim level was introduced for the 2005 model year, available as the LX or EX Special Edition.|$|R
5000|$|The new XC6 {{carburetor}} engine {{fitted with}} increased power of [...] SAE, [...] net. The engine bearings benefitted from improved shells. Rear anti roll bar fitted. New dashboard with three round <b>dials,</b> steering <b>wheel</b> {{is no longer}} adjustable. The spare wheel is relocated from inside the boot to under rear of the car. The rear valance is amended (Saloon only) and {{the capacity of the}} petrol tank is increased from 50 to 55 litres (saloon). Cigarette lighter fitted on all models, Super Luxe has automatic light on lockable glovebox. The front of coupés and convertibles is redesigned, incorporating a new grille with integral driving lamps and rectangular indicator clusters. The convertible hood now has a [...] "Panoramic" [...] rear window and the seat mechanism is improved for better accessibility.|$|R
50|$|All early {{telephone}} sets had dials {{with metal}} finger wheels, while starting in 1941 the colored thermoplastic units featured clear plastic finger <b>wheels.</b> <b>Dial</b> number plates {{were made from}} steel with a white vitreous enamel face. Black 302 telephone sets were equipped from the factory with straight brown textile-covered cords until 1952, when synthetic rubber (Neoprene) jacketed cords became standard equipment. Optional retractile coiled cords were available both in textile and rubber jackets since the early 1940s.|$|R
50|$|The {{calculator}} had spoked metal <b>wheel</b> <b>dials,</b> {{with the}} digit 0 through 9 displayed around {{the circumference of}} each wheel. To input a digit, the user placed a stylus in the corresponding space between the spokes and turned the dial until a metal stop at the bottom was reached, {{similar to the way}} the rotary dial of a telephone is used. This displayed the number in the windows {{at the top of the}} calculator. Then, one simply redialed the second number to be added, causing the sum of both numbers to appear in the accumulator.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000 it was {{announced}} the final Reliant Robin would be built after 65 limited editions were made, it was named the [...] "Reliant Robin 65" [...] and has a very high specification. All 65s have gold metallic paint, red and grey leather seats, red carpets, walnut dashboards, white <b>dials,</b> minilite alloy <b>wheels,</b> premium stereo systems, electronic ignitions and gold plaques on the dashboards which are numbered to each individual car and have the original owners name engraved onto it, the selling price was £10,000. The last Reliant Robin produced was given away by The Sun newspaper in a Valentine's Day competition in 2001.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to realise an {{interface}} between a digital music source such as a CD player or a computer and a turntable. The overall work during this research was signal processing. One of the main parts {{of the project was}} a discovery of the CD players' signals and characteristics and a discovery of the characteristics of the vinyl disc and the turntable {{in order to determine the}} project specifications. To realise the project, many compromises had to be made in order to solve every problem as well as possible. The first part of the project was the realisation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the vinyl saw tooth signal in order to determine the bandwidth of four saw tooth signals with different frequencies given that a saw tooth is composed of a fundamental and several harmonics. The {{aim of the}}se measurements is to determine which signal is the most suitable for the realisation of the project. Then the work is focused on the vinyl disc signal in order to determine precisely the speed of rotation and the direction of rotation of the vinyl disc. And the final part is the generation of the signal which simulates the CD player jog <b>dial</b> (or <b>wheel)</b> signal. The detection of the direction of rotation is now working correctly and the generation of the CD player jog dial signals is possible. The last part which has not been completely achieved during the project is the accurate detection of the speed of rotation of the vinyl disc. This project is an on-going personal investigation into DJs system that is why this work will continue after the Master's projectSchool of Computing, Communications and Electronic...|$|R
