The review and assessment was hierarchically conducted, in the sequence of the foundational C 0 eC 4 species; the reference fuels of alkanes (n-heptane, iso-octane, ndecane, n-dodecane), cyclo-alkanes (cyclohexane and methyl-cyclo-hexane) and the aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene); and the oxygenated fuels of alcohols, C 3 H 6 O isomers, ethers (dimethyl ether and <b>ethyl</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ether),</b> and methyl esters up to ethyl decanoate.

40|$|The {{liquid phase}} {{synthesis}} of octane-enhancing thers is increasingly realized as a reactive distillation process, catalysed by ion exchange resins. To study {{the physical and}} chemical phenomena occurring in these systems, the present paper considers a reactive batch distillation process in a heated still. Because of its increasing technical importance, the synthesis of ETBE (<b>ethyl</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ether)</b> from ethanol and isobutene is investigated as an example. The developed model {{is based on the}} phase equilibrium between the liquid and vapour phases and an adequate kinetic formulation of the heterogeneously catalysed etherification by application of generalized Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate expressions. To describe the non-ideal mixture behavior, the liquid phase activities are introduced. Simulation results show that the shape of the residue curve depends on two essential parameters: the Damkohler number, Da, and the operating pressure, p. The values of these parameters influence the existence and the position of fixed points in the residue curve map. Therefore an analysis is carried out to calculate the steady state solutions in the reactive mixture and to forecast the number of stable nodes with given Da and p...|$|E

The overview focuses on neurotoxic effects related to chronic low-level exposures. A few general conclusions and recommendations can be made {{based on the results of}} the studies to date. a) All the compounds reviewed are neuroactive and, as such, should be examined for their neurotoxicity. b) For most of the compounds, there is a substantial margin of safety between the current permissible exposure levels and levels that would be expected to cause overt signs of neurotoxicity in humans. This is not the case for xylene, toluene, and methanol, however, where neurologic effects are observed at or below the current Threshold Limit Value. c) For most of the compounds, the relationship between chronic low-level exposure and subtle neurotoxic effects has not been studied.

The oxygenate concentrations were determined by headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses. The experimental data were used with four two-parameter isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich) and two kinetic models (pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order) to determine equilibrium and kinetic parameters. Considering the correlation coefficient and root mean square error, Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm showed better fit with the equilibrium data for MTBE. However, the performances of Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich models were comparable for ETBE. The adsorption capacities were calculated as 5. 50 and 6. 92 mg/g for MTBE and ETBE, respectively, at an equilibrium solution concentration of 1 mg/L using Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm. The differences between the model predictions and experimental data were similar for the pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order kinetic models.

40|$|A {{widely used}} {{gasoline}} additive, methyl <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ether</b> (MTBE), has been controversial, {{in part because}} of concerns about potential inhalation health effects and more recently because of added concerns about water contamination.

These consortia were {{tested for the}} ability to degrade <b>Ethyl</b> <b>Tertiary</b> <b>Butyl</b> <b>Ether</b> (ETBE) at the concentration of 100 mg/L and to degrade a mixture of MTBE and ETBE in the Nutrient Broth (NB) media at the concentration of 50 mg/L each. The results showed that mKGS 1 was the best degraders in which 74 % of MTBE, 25 % of ETBE and 16 % of MTBE and 23 % of ETBE in the mixture were degraded, within 30 days. mKGS 1 was then further used in the bioaugmentation and biostimulation experiments. Degradation of MTBE increased from 34 % to 61 % after 70 days when mKGS 1 was amended in soil mixed with the combination of MTBE and ETBE (at 50 mg/L each). However, mKGS 1 did not significantly help the ETBE degradation when it was amended in soil (biostimulation technique). One percent glucose significantly stimulated the degradation of MTBE by the indigenous microorganisms. The presence of mKGS 1 and an addition of 1 % glucose as extra carbon source improved the degradation of MTBE, from 42 to 51 %, suggesting mKGS 1 {{played an important role in}} the degradation of MTBE...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the results of a}} statistical analysis on MTBE relative to other gasoline oxygenates based on groundwater monitoring data collected in Los Angeles County, CA. The other gasoline oxygenates in this study include di-isopropyl ether (DIPE), <b>ethyl</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ether</b> (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA). Corre-lation coefficients were calculated between MTBE and other ox-ygenates, and between the gasoline oxygenates and depth to groundwater and geological material type of aquifer. The corre-lation coefficients indicated poor correlation among all compo-nents mentioned. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare MTBE concentrations detected in aquifers comprised chiefly of coarse-grained material with those comprised of fine-grained material. The ANOVA results indicated that the differ-ence is not statistically significant between MTBE detected in the two types of aquifer materials. Similar results were also reached for TBA. The oxygenate concentration distributions were further studied by grouping the data according to different gasoline brands. There is not an overall statistically clear trend on whether certain brands of gasoline contain MTBE and TBA consistently higher than other brands, or whether TBA is consis-tently higher than MTBE among all brands of gasoline. How-ever, TBA shows statistically higher than MTBE in the mean, the median, and the 95 th percentile in the overall groundwater data studied. Therefore, further studies on the relationship be-tween MTBE and TBA are warranted...|$|E
3000|$|Alcohols and ethers {{are used}} as oxygenated {{additives}} to motor fuels and as antiknock components in gasoline. They increase the octane number and reduce the emissions of gases to greenhouse effect (CO x [...] and NO x [...]). These oxygenated compounds have partially replaced the lead-based salts that are toxic and pollutant. Among the tertiary ethers, such as <b>ethyl</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ether,</b> tertiary amyl ethyl ether and tertiary amyl methyl ether, MTBE is the oxygenated additive currently, {{the most widely used}} in the reformulated gasoline and also one of organic chemicals the most produced industrially [1]. However, the major drawback of this ether is its easy diffusion in the ground water, its slow biological breakdown and its unpleasant odour. The diisopropyl ether (DIPE) can be a potential candidate to substitute the MTBE. It has the advantage to increase the octane number and to have a lower vapour pressure. Various works proposed the synthesis of the DIPE from propene and water in a two-stage process [2], from a feed of acetone and hydrogen in a two-stage process [3] or one-step process [4] and from acetone feedstock [5]. The DIPE can be also synthesised either from a feed of propylene and water [6] or from a feed of propene and isopropanol over an acidic ion exchange resin like Amberlyst 15 [7]. The synthesis of the DIPE from the isopropanol decomposition was examined over aluminosilicates supported sulfopolyphenylketone (or polyphenylketone) [8] and over sulphated titania [9].|$|E

DNA damage in leukocytes {{was measured by the}} alkaline comet assay and expressed quantitatively as Tail Intensity (TI). For male mice, TI was significantly higher in all three groups exposed to ETBE than in those without exposure within Aldh 2 –/ – mice, whereas within Aldh 2 +/+ mice, TI increased only in those exposed to 5, 000 ppm of ETBE as compared with mice without exposure. For female mice, a significant increase in TI values was observed in the group exposed to 5, 000 ppm of ETBE as compared with those without exposure within Aldh 2 –/ – mice; TI in Aldh 2 –/ – mice exposed to 1, 750 and 5, 000 ppm was significantly higher than in Aldh 2 +/+ mice without exposure. TI did not significantly increase in any of the groups exposed to ETBE within female Aldh 2 +/+ mice.

The {{aim was to}} improve air quality in urban areas by setting new emissions standards based on improved vehicle and fuel technology. The program {{was carried out by}} the auto and oil industry under leadership of the European Commission. It did not include alternative fuels. In 1997 the initiative was taken for the Auto Oil 2 program, including alternative fuels. The following alternative fuels were investigated: CNG, LPG, DME (di-methyl-ether) FAME 30 % (fatty acid methyl ester), E 85 G (85 % ethanol for Otto engines), E 15 D (15 % ethanol for diesel engines), ETBE (15 % <b>ethyl</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ether)</b> and diesel/water emulsion. Investigations, mainly done by Prof. Acroumanis of Bechtel Ltd. Consultants, resulted in the development of emission and cost factors.

In the Port of Rotterdam there is a clear short-term (0 - 10 year) substitution potential of 10 - 15 % of fossil oil-based bulk chemicals by bio-based bulk chemicals, especially for oxygenated bulk chemicals, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, iso-propanol and acetone, butylene and methylethylketone and for the replacement of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) by <b>ethyl</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ether</b> (ETBE). Glycerin, as a byproduct of biodiesel production, is a very favorable short-term option for the production of ethylene and propy-lene glycols in the Port of Rotterdam. In the mid-term (10 - 20 years) there is clear potential for a bio-based production of ethylene, acrylic acid and N-containing bulk chemicals such as acrylonitrile, acrylamide and -caprolactam. Technologies involving direct isolation of aromatic building blocks from biomass, or the conversion of sugars or lignin to aromatics are still in their infancy.

Also in 2010 Mexican government has programmed to start the substitution of Tier 1 - the adopted US emission standards - by Tier 2, which are more stringent emission standards for motor vehicles and gasoline sulfur control requirements. How will the air emissions in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) be modified by using this blending? Four scenarios up to year 2030 were constructed and simulated using the Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning model. Beginning with a BAU or reference scenario, in this scenario the current available fuel is a blending composed by 5 % methyl tertiary butyl ether and 95 % gasoline (MTBE 5). Then, three alternative scenarios that use ethanol as an oxygenate are considered, one with the already programmed E 6 blending (6 % anhydride ethanol, 94 % gasoline), {{for the sake of}} comparison the E 10 blending (10 % anhydride ethanol, 90 % gasoline), and the other alternative to compare, ETBE 13. 7 (13. 7 % <b>ethyl</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ether,</b> 86. 3 % gasoline; where ETBE is an ether composed by 48 % anhydride ethanol and 52 % isobutene).

Results show that Tier 1 and Tier 2 standards effectively lowers all emissions in all studied scenarios with the exception of PM 10 and CO 2 emissions.

The premise of the initial proposal was to use a test stand owned by Engine Components Inc. (ECI) based in San Antonio, Texas. After the grant was awarded, ECI decided to close down its test stand facility. Since there were no other test stands available at that time, RAFDC was forced to find additional support to build its own test stand. Baylor University provided initial funds for the test stand building. Other obstacles had to be overcome in order to initiate the program. The price of the emission testing equipment had increased substantially beyond the initial quote. Rosemount Analytical Inc. gave RAFDC an estimate of $ 120, 000. 00 for a basic emission testing package. RAFDC had to find additional funding to purchase this equipment. The electronic ignition unit also presented a series of time consuming problems. Since at that time there were no off-the-shelf units of this type available, one had to be specially ordered and developed. FAA funds were used to purchase a Super Flow dynamometer. Due to the many unforeseen obstacles, much more time and effort than originally anticipated had to be dedicated to the project, with much of the work done on a volunteer basis. Many people contributed their time to the program. One person, mainly responsible for the initial design of the test stand, was a retired engineer from Allison with extensive aircraft engine test stand experience. Also, many Baylor students volunteered to assemble the. test stand and continue {{to be involved in the}} current test program.

Among the various gasoline additives, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>tertiary</b> <b>butyl</b> <b>ether</b> (ETBE) are {{the most frequently used}} fuel oxygenates worldwide. Due to the physical and chemical properties of fuel oxygenates, the conventional treatment technologies are generally ineffective for their removal from contaminated water. Adsorption is a common process frequently used to remove fuel oxygenates from water. The use of natural zeolites as adsorbent have increased significantly because of their availability and low cost. Clinoptilolite {{is one of the most}} abundant zeolites in nature, and Turkey has very large clinoptilolite reserves. In this project the adsorption properties of clinoptilolite rich natural zeolites for use in the removal of MTBE and ETBE from water have been investigated using batch equilibrium and fixed-bed column experiments. The adsorption properties have been compared with those of two activated carbons (i. e., Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) and Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC)). In addition, bisolute (i. e., benzene and oxygenate) adsorption experiments were also carried out to determine the effectiveness of these adsorbents in the presence of other gasoline hydrocarbons. All the experiments were performed at 25 °C with initial oxygenate and benzene concentrations of 2000 ppb and 400 ppb, respectively. In batch equilibrium experiments, it has been found that the powdered and granulated activated carbons had higher adsorption capacities for MTBE and ETBE than clinoptilolite. The highest capacity for the amount of MTBE adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent was achieved using GAC while that of ETBE was obtained using PAC. The presence of benzene decreased the adsorption capacities of GAC and PAC. However, the effect of benzene was not clear and was dependent on the adsorbent loading for clinoptilolite. In fixed-bed column experiments, GAC and clinoptilolite were tested as adsorbents. The column breakthrough curves for clinoptilolite were steep indicating fast adsorption and narrow mass transfer region. For GAC, mass transfer regions were wider due to the relatively flat breakthrough curves. There was no significant effect of benzene on the breakthrough curves for GAC and clinoptilolite...|$|E
