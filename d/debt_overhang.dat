Bankruptcy which takes the form of Chapter 11 reorganization or receivership, for banks, can cure the problems of <b>debt</b> <b>overhang</b> for insolvent institutions. Successful bankruptcy reorganizations allow organizations to reduce their debt levels and allow new private shareholders to bear enough of the gains from new investments that they will pursue new projects that have positive expected net present value.|$|E

Thus, the firm refuses to fund projects with a positive NPV. This problem was first discussed by Myers (1977).|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem of}} <b>debt</b> <b>overhang</b> {{was used as}} a {{justification}} by governments to inject capital into banks around the world after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and the subsequent falls in stock markets worldwide. Nevertheless, many governments in the financial crisis of 2008, including the United States, primarily bought newly issued preferred stock. Preferred stock is similar to debt in that it gets paid before common stock; it also pays regular dividends that are similar to interest. Thus, the capital infusions of Troubled Assets Relief Program's Capital Purchase Program (TARP CPP) in the United States may have done little to cure <b>debt</b> <b>overhang</b> problems in the United States largest banks. Academic research suggests that if the government bought common stock or toxic assets in troubled banks that the <b>debt</b> <b>overhang</b> problem would be better corrected. [...] Nevertheless, if a bank is very insolvent, subsidies will have to be extremely large to correct the problems of <b>debt</b> <b>overhang</b> and unsecured debt and preferred stock holders may have to bear some losses.

In our view, a sensible political economy. whose objectives are the rapid mobilization of underemployed Asian labor and the accumulation of an efficient capital stock, is the source of current imba!ances. The mechanism that regulates the mobilization is a cross-border transfer, through excess returns to foreign direct investment, to countries like the United States that are willing to restructure their labor markets to accommodate the restructuring of labor markets in Asia.

Typically private lenders (banks) boldly venture forth: whether they lend to developing countries like in the 1970s, covered by the expected stream of high future coupons, or excessive consumption of their own folk covered by higher paper valuations of assets, it is the same basic story. In the eventual shakeout (due yet again, in the last instance, to latent underemployment), the <b>debt</b> <b>overhang</b> is preserved by substituting public debt for private debt (bailouts), and—keeps growing.|$|E
40|$|Public debt in the OECD area passed annual GDP in 2011 and {{is still}} rising. For many countries, just {{stabilising}} debt - let alone bringing {{it down to a}} more sustainable level - is a major challenge. The <b>debt</b> <b>overhangs</b> can affect growth through channels such as raising the cost of capital. The main focus of this paper however is the implications for growth both in the short term and in the long term of reducing debt levels. Consolidation needs are large and most of the reduction in debt will need to come from improvements in the primary balance. In the short term, the pace of consolidation needs to balance consolidation requirements with the effects of fiscal retrenchment on aggregate demand. The trade-off will depend on the choice of fiscal instrument and on the ability of monetary policy to accommodate consolidation. However, other things being equal, a slow consolidation will ultimately require more effort to meet a fixed debt target. In this context, consolidation should aim to use instruments that are friendly to long-term growth. There is scope to improve budgetary positions by reforming transfer systems, raising the efficiency of public services, eliminating certain tax expenditures and collecting additional revenues from less distortionary tax bases. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between capital flows –and, more particularly, the net resource transfer— and economic activity {{has been a}} strong feature of Latin America {{over the past decade}} (and, for that matter, the past quarter century), as Figure 1 indicates. This fact highlights the central role played by the mechanisms by which externally-generated boom-bust cycles are transmitted in the developing world. These mechanisms are well known. The boom encourages an increase in public and private spending, which will inevitably lead to an adjustment whose severity will bear a direct relationship to how excessive spending levels were, as reflected in accumulated liabilities, and to the degree of mistrust generated among market agents. Thus, temporary public sector revenues and readily accessible external credit during booms generate an expansion of public sector spending, which will be followed by a severe adjustment later on, when those conditions are no longer present. A private lending cycle is generated by shifts in the availability of external financing and the cyclical patterns of international interest rates and spreads; availability and spreads are associated, in turn, to significant asymmetries in risk evaluation during booms and crises. Private-sector <b>debt</b> <b>overhangs</b> accumulated during the boom will subsequently trigger a sharp contraction in lending, usually accompanied by deterioration in bank portfolios...|$|R

40|$|Farms in Tajikistan {{currently}} face {{a severe}} debt crisis {{that has been}} caused {{by a combination of}} two factors typical of such situations in many countries: (a) the inability of the farms to make a profit under current conditions and (b) continued lending by the banks to cotton producers regardless of reduced payment capacity and lack of credit-worthiness. The paper traces the accumulation of farm debt in Tajikistan to pervasive government intervention in both financing and production decisions, which has led to soft budget constraints and moral hazard behavior. The purpose of the paper is to inform the debate around the issue of cotton farm debt in Tajikistan by studying the experience of other countries that had to contend with farm <b>debt</b> <b>overhangs</b> in the 1980 s and the 1990 s. Five CIS transition countries (Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine) and one market economy (Israel) are studied using time series of aggregate financial reports of the farm sectors. The comparative analysis shows that the farm debt issue is not strictly a transition economy phenomenon. The problem can occur in market economies (e. g., Israel) if the state pursues policies directed toward the expansion of farm production without heed to creditworthiness of the farms and if the farm structure is incompatible with profitability and efficiency criteria. The basic reasons that led to debt accumulation in CIS and in Israel remain valid to this day, and the policy solutions implemented in these countries are relevant for Tajikistan.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the link between fiscal policy and debt {{sustainability}} {{in a number of}} African countries participating in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The paper finds that, on the basis of current fiscal policies, debt levels will remain unsustainable even after these countries graduate from the HIPC Initiative. This finding has important policy implications. By the very requirements of the HIPC Initiative, these countries are expected to increase significantly their poverty-reducing expenditure-possibly resulting in weaker fiscal primary balances and worsening debt sustainability outlook. As offsetting fiscal tightening may not be viable, ensuring debt sustainability may thus require increased availability of (nondebt-creating) grants. Otherwise, debt sustainability in HIPC countries may prove elusive in the long term.

The integration of these high-savings, lower wage economies into the global economy, combined with dramatic productivity gains made possible by new information technologies and the globalization of corporate supply chains, decisively shifted the balance of global supply and demand. By 2000, the world economy was beset by excess supplies of labor, capital, and productive capacity relative to global demand.

The paper {{examined the}} consequences of a policy of permanent deficit spending and the related debt accumulation. Gorini presented a graphical long-run dynamic analysis showing that a permanent deficit spending always entails an income redistribution from future generations to the present one. He finally pointed out that, due to the devastating impact of austerity under recession, the only way to achieve debt stabilization and recovery is to gradually monetize it. Andrea Rieck (Federal Ministry of Finance, Germany) discussed the paper. The second afternoon session was chaired by Bruno S. Frey (University of Basel and CREMA). Andrea Rieck (Federal Ministry of Finance, Germany) presented a paper written jointly with Ludger Schuknecht (Chief Economist and Director-General, Federal Ministry of Finance, Germany) entitled “Preserving Government Solvency: a Global Policy Perspective”. She led off by arguing that unhealthy debt dynamics have potentially developed to a systemic dimension in both advanced and developing countries. She presented the different approaches to <b>debt</b> <b>overhangs</b> that have accumulated over time and concluded that strong rules and institutions, clear accountability and credible enforcement procedures are the necessary ingredients for market discipline. In her discussion, Rieck clinched that debt default is unethical and pointed to the role played by a contractual approach in dealing with country insolvency. Jan Schnellenbach (Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus–Senftenberg) discussed the paper. The last paper “Governing the Market for Sovereign Bailouts” was delivered by Karsten Mause (University of Münster). He discussed the relatively neglected issue of how to regulate the “supply side” of the market for sovereign bailouts and wondered whether it should be left to the discretion of potential rescuers such as the governments of jurisdictions or the governing boards of central banks, or should there be constitutional rules that regulate the supply of sovereign bailouts by defining specific conditions under which a potential rescuer is allowed to offer a bailout. Andrea Rieck (Federal Ministry of Finance, Germany) discussed the paper. On Wednesday June 1 st, there were only morning sessions. The first session was chaired by Friedrich Schneider (University of Linz). Fabrizio Balassone (Bank of Italy, Directorate General for Economics, Statistics and Research) opened the session with a paper entitled “Economic Governance in the Euro Area: Balancing Risk Reduction and Risk Sharing” written jointly with Sara Cecchetti, Martina Cecioni, Marika Cioffi, Wanda Cornacchia, Flavia Corneli and Gabriele Semeraro (Bank of Italy, Directorate General for Economics, Statistics and Research). After illustrating the different postures to the sovereign debt crisis, Balassone discussed {{the pros and cons of}} introducing cooperative mechanisms for debt reduction in the euro area and the related issue of a common fiscal capacity. His presentation provided a wealth of empirical evidence of how the EU is pressured by exceptional economic and geopolitical circumstances. He concluded that unless deeper reforms are introduced, the EU risks pro-cyclical excesses. Florin Dragu (Financial Stability Department, National Bank of Romania) discussed the paper. It followed a paper by Liviu Voinea, Florin Dragu, Alexie Alupoaiei, Florian Neagu (Financial Stability Department, National Bank of Romania) entitled “Adjustments in the Balance Sheets – Is it Normal This “New Normal”?” The paper was presented by Florin Dragu. He argued that the adjustments in the balance sheets are the “new normal” after the burst of the financial crisis. He emphasized that a high level of indebtedness among companies and households calls for a debt re-adjustment towards more sustainable levels. He presented data on six distinct debt categories and on gross domestic product dynamics by using a series of panel regressions in order to assess the effect of debt on economic growth. He concluded that a too restrictive threshold in a country which can support higher debt values can lead to opportunity costs through missed investment possibilities. Conversely, setting a threshold above the one which can be afforded may also have negative effects on economic growth. Ernesto Longobardi (Aldo Moro University of Bari) discussed the paper. The conference closed with a session chaired by Giuseppe Eusepi (Sapienza University of Rome). Ernesto Longobardi (Aldo Moro University of Bari) presented a paper written jointly with Antonio Pedone (Sapienza University of Rome) entitled “On Some Recent Proposals of Public Debt Restructuring in the Eurozone”. After an examination of key issues surrounding sovereign debts in the Eurozone, Longobardi focused on the different possible strategies to be enacted to reduce the public debt-GDP ratio without resorting to debt restructuring. He provided a survey of the various postures to debt restructuring and scrutinized the implications of debt renegotiation. Friedrich Schneider (University of Linz) discussed the paper. Professor Giuseppe Eusepi closed the conference with a note of appreciation for the high quality of the papers and the lively and informed comments that contributed to provide valuable insights into the ongoing debate surrounding the ethics of default on debt.
