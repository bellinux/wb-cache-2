At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions, so that even if he is incorrect it is the right course of action.|$|E

While Spock's bodily resurrection was complete, his mind was a blank slate—The Search for Spock, Michele and Duncan Barrett argue, says that the important question is whether an individual's mind functions, as {{this is the key}} to a meaningful existence.|$|E

Six months after meeting Wilson, she had reported Landy to the state's attorney general, who informed her that nothing could be done without the cooperation of Wilson's family. Ledbetter felt that the family had been at their [...] "rope's end" [...] with Wilson, and {{that they did not}} know what to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him. Three years into their relationship, Landy ordered Wilson to sever ties with Ledbetter.|$|E

Instead of accepting the award herself, she had a twenty-two-year-old homeless {{man by the name of}} Jesse collect it for her. She had met him at My Friend’s Place, an organization that helps homeless youth find shelter, work, health care and education. His acceptance speech encouraged musicians to learn more about homeless youth in Los Angeles and what they can <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> at Cyrus's Facebook page. Cyrus then launched a Prizeo campaign to raise funds for the charity. Those who made donations were automatically entered into a sweepstake for a chance to meet Cyrus on her Bangerz Tour in Rio de Janeiro that September.|$|E

This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

With three million ethnic Germans, the Sudetenland represented the largest German population outside the [...] "Reich". Hitler {{began to call}} for the union of the region with Germany. Britain had no military obligations toward Czechoslovakia, but France and Czechoslovakia had a mutual assistance pact. France and Czechoslovakia had also an alliance with Soviet Union. After the fall of Austria, the Cabinet's Foreign Policy Committee considered seeking a [...] "grand alliance" [...] to thwart Germany, or alternatively, an assurance to France of assistance if the French went to war. Instead, the committee chose to advocate that Czechoslovakia be urged {{to make the best}} terms it could with Germany. The full Cabinet agreed with the committee's recommendation, influenced by a report from the chiefs of staff stating that there was little that Britain could <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the Czechs {{in the event of a}} German invasion. Chamberlain reported to an amenable House that he was unwilling to limit his government's discretion by giving commitments.|$|E
500|$|In March 1996, Sega of Japan representatives, {{including}} CEO Hayao Nakayama, visited STI {{headquarters to}} evaluate the game's progress. They were unimpressed by the main game engine's performance on the Saturn, although Senn and Alon {{did not have an}} opportunity to demonstrate the PC version. Therefore, Nakayama requested the entire game be reworked around the boss engine. To achieve this in time for the strict December 1996 deadline, Coffin's team was moved into a place of isolation from further company politics and worked between sixteen and twenty hours a day. [...] Then, in April, Bernie Stolar approached the STI team and inquired of Wallis what he could <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the game meet its deadline. [...] Wallis suggested that the game engine from Sonic Team's Nights into Dreams would be helpful. [...] Stolar agreed and acquired the engine. [...] However, the engine's creator and lead programmer of the original Mega Drive Sonic games, Yuji Naka, reportedly threatened to leave the company if it was used. [...] STI lost two weeks of development time from the loss of the Nights engine. A playable demo of the game was displayed at the May 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo.|$|E

[...] She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and asked her what she knew [...] "about life". [...] On her {{response}} that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. [...] Instead, he drove her [...] west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. [...] He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, {{that he and his wife}} had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. [...] He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E
