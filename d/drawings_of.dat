5|$|Aristotle's {{writings}} on biology, {{the first in}} the history of science, are scattered across several books, forming about a quarter of his writings that have survived.

5|$|Dexter's Laboratory was {{inspired}} by one of Genndy Tartakovsky's <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> a ballerina. After drawing Dee Dee's tall, thin shape, he decided to pair her with a short and blocky opposite, Dexter, inspired by Tartakovsky's older brother Alex. After enrolling at the California Institute of the Arts in 1990 to study animation, Tartakovsky wrote, directed, animated, and produced four short films that would become {{the basis for the}} series.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, Karanj {{was badly}} damaged after a {{collision}} with the destroyer Ranjit when she surfaced directly below the ship.

5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. <b>Drawings</b> <b>of</b> the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E
5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> Borobudur, the Batavia Society {{still felt}} that it was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen set off to the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E
