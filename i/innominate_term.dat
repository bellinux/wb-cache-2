Whether or not it repudiates the contract depends upon whether legal benefit of the contract has been removed from the innocent party. Megaw LJ, in 1970, preferred the use of the classic categorising into condition or warranty due to legal certainty. This was interpreted by the House of Lords as merely restricting its application in Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen.|$|E

5000|$|Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd 1961 EWCA Civ 7 is a {{landmark}} English contract law case. It introduced {{the concept of}} <b>innominate</b> <b>terms,</b> a category between [...] "warranties" [...] and [...] "conditions".|$|R
5000|$|Intermediate or innominate term: the aggrieved party's {{right to}} {{terminate}} {{will depend on}} the severity of the breach and its consequence. The seriousness of the breach will determine whether termination is allowed or the party can sue for damages. If the breach is likely to have serious consequences for further performance then they will be entitled to terminate. The test for serious <b>innominate</b> <b>terms</b> is whether the breach would deprive the aggrieved party of substantially the whole benefit intended under the contract.|$|R

40|$|The {{right of}} owners to claim damages {{in the event}} of charterers failing to pay hire and the vessel being {{withdrawn}} is complicated. The complication has been reflected in the commentary in Time Charters and is generated from conflicting authorities as to whether the contractual obligation of charterers to pay hire punctually and regularly is a condition or an <b>innominate</b> <b>term.</b> It is not controversial that breach of such obligation by charterers gives owners the right to withdraw the vessel, albeit they sometimes require the service of an anti-technicality notice (eg clause 11 of the NYPE 93 form and clause 9 of the Shelltime 4 form). In the recent case of Kuwait Rocks Co v AMN Bulkcarriers Inc [2013] EWHC 865 (Comm), Flaux J had the opportunity to discuss this issue. This article reviews the law followed by a discussion of Kuwait Rock...|$|E
40|$|A party might {{repudiate}} {{its obligations}} under a contract by breaching it in various ways. The {{distinction between a}} fundamental breach, and a breach of an <b>innominate</b> <b>term</b> which yet also justiﬁes ’rescission’ for breach of the contract, is difficult to draw in practice, as recent cases reveal. Superadded to the complexities {{is the possibility of}} an anticipatory breach of a term which the ’innocent’ party may accept, or not as it wishes and which justiﬁes it in a ’rescission’ of the contract. In the latter case, it is a question whether or not that party still needs to manifest an intention, and ability, to perform its own obligations, and on this question the High Court authority is not clear. Recent authority discussed in the article demonstrates that these are difficult topics upon which minds may properly differ, and that the theoretical underpinning of the law could stand further elucidation by the High Court...|$|E
40|$|The {{terms of}} the {{contract}} are its heart and life-blood in that they define both the content and scope of the parties’ mutual rights and obligations. Classification of terms has brought about several unresolved problems. Classically, {{terms of the}} contract have been divided into either conditions or warranties. The development of the <b>innominate</b> <b>term</b> introduces a more logical flexibility. A balance has to be struck between the two approaches; certainty brought about by the classical approach and flexibility as potrayed by the modern approach. Combining both approaches allows the court to tread a middle-path between rigid and unjust rule an one side, and indeterminate flexibility on the other. Terms have also been classified as express or implied. A court may be required to imply a term if the parties have specified only the rudimentary obligations. The duty of a court to find the existence of an implied term in a contract nevertheless is a matter to be exercised with care. In implying terms into contracts, what criterion would be a more appropriate rubric to adopt? Implied terms also raises questions of its status vis-à-vis the express terms of a contract. This article is thus devoted to analyzing some problems brought about by the classification of contractual terms and looks at some thoughts surrounding these problems...|$|E
