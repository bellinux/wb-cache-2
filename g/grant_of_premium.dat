40|$|AbstractAt {{the dawn}} of the twenty-first century, one of the major {{problems}} of mankind is to combine the energy, the respect for environment. A problem of sustainable development has been clearly demonstrated in the Earth Summit in Johannesburg 2002. Among the major battles to be fought in this century for the survival of the planet is to include energy efficiency as an international political priority, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Renewable energy, inexhaustible, clean, are needed in these conditions as a priority. Algeria has entered its energy strategy in the context of sustainable development by integrating the promotion of renewable energy. The legislative and regulatory framework adopted in recent years testifies to this irreversible commitment. Three major laws govern the field of renewable energy and state incentives enjoyed by this sector. The law on energy management enacted in 1999 provides {{for the creation of a}} National Fund for Energy Management (NFEM) which helps to finance renewable energy projects. As part of the implementation of the law on electricity and public distribution of gas by pipeline passed in 2002, executive decree on the costs of diversification of electricity production promulgated in 2004 provides for the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> for green electricity up to 300 % of normal rate.

The law on the promotion of renewable energy in the context of sustainable development provides a national program to promote renewable energy and incentives for developing renewable energy. The implementing regulations are still pending. Some projects for electrification of rural villages in the sun have been made in Great South of Algeria. Currently, Algeria is engaged in two major projects that provide a place for solar and wind energy, hybrid gas-solar plant of Hassi R’Mel a capacity of 150 MW and wind farm in Tindouf. Other future projects are planned. In Algeria, despite a considerable potential, the share of renewable energies in the energy balance is still low especially in electricity generation. The rise of renewable energies in Algeria can not be conceived without the realization of a phased program of projects to produce electricity more important and connected to national grid electricity...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} results {{of studies on}} motivation (unction of wages, which were carried out in six industrial and trade enterprises in the administrative province of Katowice over the period 1981 — 1982. The studies revealed numerous dysfunctions in wages. There is no positive correlation between growth of wages and labour productivity (effect) growth. Necessity of rational application of wage techniques is not felt strongly in enterprises and knowledge o! such techniques is, anyway, rather poor. On the other hand, the main interest is focused on determination of possibilities of wage increase. Neither do wages promote a rational employment policy. The number of bonuses supplementing wages, which are poorly linked with work effects or even not linked at all, is growing. Application of work norms has lost its sense as {{these are not the}} norms which determine wage rates but the other way round i. e. wage rates assumed in advance determine the level of norms. Against this background, the author formulates main directions of solutions, which should be employed in the wage policy. It becomes necessary to elaborate an effective wage policy and the national wage structure. Deep changes must be effected in the wage organization within enterprises. It also becomes necessary to disseminate modern methods of performance appraisal. A new trend in improvement of wage forms should be a shift towards introduction of comprehensive norms for quantitative-qualitative tasks and <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> for entire teams of employees.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} factors {{driving the}} design of stock option plans for Finnish firms. We examine determinants {{of the scope of}} plans, exercise price, target group, and dividend protection. The scope is found to be negatively related to Tobin’s Q and positively related to proxies for monitoring costs. The scope is also greater in broad-based plans, and in plans with dividend protection. Prior stock return is found to be negatively related to the size <b>of</b> the <b>premium</b> (out-of-the-moneyness), whereas dividend protection increases the premium. The results also suggest that investment intensity, cash flow, and monitoring costs are associated with the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>granting</b> <b>premium</b> (out-of-the-money) stock options. Furthermore, the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>granting</b> broad-based plans is increasing in institutional ownership and cash flow constraints, and decreasing in firm size. Broad-based plans are also more likely among firms in growth industries. We find support that the likelihood of dividend protection is decreasing in foreign ownership. In addition, firms paying zero-dividends are less likely to include dividend protection, whereas higher unsystematic risk is associated with a greater likelihood of including dividend protection.

40|$|In this paper, it {{is shown}} {{that with a}} certain {{definition}} of risk-based discounted loss reserves and a certain method of surplus allocation, there is an amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> for a contract which has the following properties: (1.) It is the amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> required for the contract to neither help nor hurt the insurer's risk-return relation. (2.) It produces an {{internal rate of return}} equal to the insurer's target return. If the insurer gets more than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> then the insurer can get more return with the same risk by increasing the percentage <b>of</b> the <b>premium</b> for the overall book which is in the segment. Conversely, if the insurer gets less than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer can increase its return by decreasing the percentage <b>of</b> the overall <b>premium</b> which is in the segment. The amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> is equal to the risk-based premium in "Pricing to Optimize an Insurer's Risk-Return Relation, " (PCAS 1996).

50|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} by the CBO in 2008, administrative costs for private insurance represent approximately 12% <b>of</b> <b>premiums.</b> Variations in administrative costs between private plans are largely attributable to economies of scale.

The percentage <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> attributable to administration increases for smaller firms, and is highest for individually purchased coverage. A 2009 study published by BCBSA found that the average administrative expense cost for all commercial health insurance products was represented 9.2% <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> in 2008.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present the {{redistribution}} importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> and service in the health insurance. In the paper, the particular relationship between the health insurance and the public finance was shown. The redistribution importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> and service in the obligatory public health insurance and in the voluntary private health insurance was discussed separately. The structure and importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> in the obligatory public health insurance was presented in the connection with the structure and importance of personal income lax. The structure and importance of service in the obligatory public health insurance was shown in the connection with methods of health care rationing (ensured services). The redistribution importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> and service in the voluntary private health insurance was presented as the consequence of inefficiency of obligatory public health insurance.
