40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide several {{examples}} of convex risk measures necessary for the application of the general framework for portfolio theory of Maier-Paape and Zhu, presented in Part I of this series (arXiv: 1710. 04579 [q-fin. PM]). As alternative to classical portfolio risk measures such as the standard deviation we in particular construct risk measures related to the current <b>drawdown</b> <b>of</b> the portfolio <b>equity.</b> Combined with the results of Part I (arXiv: 1710. 04579 [q-fin. PM]), this allows us to calculate efficient portfolios based on a drawdown risk measure constraint...|$|R
