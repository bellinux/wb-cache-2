And he will feel bound to consider their opinion; as far as it is, like his own, drawn from facts, but no further.|$|R

6000|$|I {{arrived on}} time, {{and we began}} the game--with a large and eager free-list to superintend it. These superintendents were outside, with their noses pressed against the window-pane. The bankers {{described}} the game to me. So far as I recollect, the pattern of it was this: they had a pile of Mexican dollars on the table; twelve of them were of even date, fifty of them were of odd dates. The bankers were to separate a coin from the pile and hide it under a hand, and I must guess [...] "odd" [...] or [...] "even." [...] If I guessed correctly, the coin would be mine; if incorrectly, I lost a dollar. The <b>first</b> <b>guess</b> I made was [...] "even," [...] and was right. I guessed again, [...] "even," [...] and took the money. They fed me another one and I guessed [...] "even" [...] again, and took the money. I guessed [...] "even" [...] the fourth time, and took the money. It {{seemed to me that}} [...] "even" [...] was a good guess, and I might as well stay by it, which I did. I guessed [...] "even" [...] twelve times, and took the twelve dollars. I was doing as they secretly desired. Their experience of human nature had convinced them that any human being as innocent as my face proclaimed me to be, would repeat his <b>first</b> <b>guess</b> if it won, and would go on repeating it if it should continue to win. It was their belief that an innocent would be almost sure at the beginning to guess [...] "even," [...] and not [...] "odd," [...] and that if an innocent should guess [...] "even" [...] twelve times in succession and win every time, he would go on guessing [...] "even" [...] to the end--so it was their purpose to let me win those twelve even dates and then advance the odd dates, one by one, until I should lose fifty dollars, and furnish those superintendents something to laugh about for a week to come.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Sandys had started, {{and then}} turned piteously from them; but {{when they were done}} she tried to smile, and said, with forced gayety, that she saw they were guisers, and it was a fine night, and would they take a chair.

[...] Their hostess shook her head, and then he of the poker offered her three guesses, a daring thing to do, but all went well, for her <b>first</b> <b>guess</b> was Shovel and his old girl; second guess, Before and After; third guess, Napoleon Buonaparte and the Auld Licht minister. At each guess the smaller of the intruders clapped her hands gleefully, but when, with the third, she was unmuzzled, she putted with her head at Mrs. Sandys and hugged her, screaming, [...] "It ain't none on them; it's jest me, mother, it's Elspeth!"

6000|$|Many {{years ago}} I saw, between {{sleeping}} and waking, {{a woman of}} incredible beauty shooting an arrow into the sky, and from the moment when I made my <b>first</b> <b>guess</b> at her meaning I have thought much {{of the difference between}} the winding movement of nature and the straight line, which is called in Balzac's Seraphita the [...] "Mark of Man," [...] but comes closer to my meaning as the mark of saint or sage. I think that we who are poets and artists, not being permitted to shoot beyond the tangible, must go from desire to weariness and so to desire again, and live but for the moment when vision comes to our weariness like terrible lightning, in the humility of the brutes. I do not doubt those heaving circles, those winding arcs, whether in one man's life or in that of an age, are mathematical, and that some in the world, or beyond the world, have foreknown the event and pricked upon the calendar the life-span of a Christ, a Buddha, a Napoleon: that every movement, in feeling or in thought, prepares in the dark by its own increasing clarity and confidence its own executioner. We seek reality with the slow toil of our weakness and are smitten from the boundless and the unforeseen. Only when we are saint or sage, and renounce Experience itself, can we, {{in the language of the}} Christian Caballa, leave the sudden lightning and the path of the serpent and become the bowman who aims his arrow at the centre of the sun.|$|E
