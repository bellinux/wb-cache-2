2500|$|The {{use of the}} ADE 651 has {{prompted}} strong criticism and eventually led to {{a ban on the}} device's export from the UK to Iraq and Afghanistan and a criminal investigation of its manufacturer. The Iraqi security forces' reliance on the device was highlighted by The New York Times investigation in November 2009, which reported that United States military and technical experts believed the device was useless. U.S. Army Major-General Richard Rowe told the newspaper that [...] "there's [...] magic wand that can detect explosives. If there was, we would all be using it. I have no confidence that these work." [...] Sandia National Laboratories had carried out testing of several similar devices but found that [...] "none have ever performed better than random chance." [...] Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Hal Bidlack, a former national security aide in the Clinton and Bush administrations, condemned the device as [...] "laughable, except someone down the street from you <b>is</b> <b>counting</b> <b>on</b> this to keep bombs off the streets." [...] An Iraqi guard and driver for The New York Times, both of whom were licensed to carry firearms, were able to drive two AK-47 rifles and ammunition through nine police checkpoints that were using the device without any of them detecting the weapons.|$|E
2500|$|Princess Marie Therese von Werdenberg (the Marschallin, {{the title}} {{given to a}} Field Marshal's wife) and her much younger lover, Count Octavian Rofrano, muse on their love {{together}} in the Marschallin's bedroom ("Wie du warst! Wie du bist"). To avoid scandal, Octavian hides when a small black boy, Mohammed, brings the Marschallin's breakfast. During breakfast loud voices are heard in the garderobe and not the main door. The Marschallin believes that it is her husband who has returned unexpectedly from a hunting trip and has Octavian hide behind the bed. He reappears disguised as a chambermaid, [...] "Mariandel" [...] ("Befehl'n fürstli' Gnad'n, i bin halt noch nit recht..."), and tries to sneak away through the garderobe. But the Marschallin's country cousin Baron Ochs auf Lerchenau has unexpectedly entered through that same door. [...] He tells the Marschallin about his engagement to Sophie ("Selbstverständlich empfängt mich Ihro Gnaden"), {{the daughter of a}} wealthy merchant. [...] The Baron <b>is</b> <b>counting</b> <b>on</b> Sophie's fortune to alleviate his own financial distress. [...] After boorishly describing his personal pastime of seducing peasant girls on his estate, he asks the Marschallin to recommend a young man to serve as his Rosenkavalier ("Knight of the Rose"), who will deliver the traditional silver engagement rose to Sophie. She suggests Octavian. When Ochs sees the young count's picture, he notices the count's resemblance to the chambermaid [...] "Mariandel", and infers that she must be Octavian's illegitimate sister. Ochs boasts that nobility should be served by nobility, which leads to a confession that he has an illegitimate son working for him. The coarse Ochs propositions the [...] "chambermaid". Octavian plays coy and leaves at the first chance.|$|E
