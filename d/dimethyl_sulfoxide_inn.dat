The effects of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> stimulation are inhibited by BrdU. To determine the effect of BrdU on the amount of globin mRNA present in cells treated and not treated with <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide,</b> molecular hybridization between total cell RNA and [3 H]DNA complementary to mouse globin mRNA was used. Cells treated with BrdU and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> had 70 % less globin mRNA than cells treated with <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> alone. The size and base sequence of the residual globin mRNA in the cultures treated with BrdU and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> were unaltered. Cells treated with BrdU alone contained slightly more globin mRNA than did the untreated controls, suggesting that BrdU may have a dual effect in transcription of messenger RNA...|$|R

40|$|Background: {{in plastic}} surgery, a causal {{relationship}} between heavy smoking and flap necrosis has been shown. the deleterious effect of nicotine in random skin flaps in rats {{has also been}} proven, being related to vasoconstriction and possibly reactive oxygen species. This study aimed to verify the capacity of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide,</b> an antioxidant, to block the deleterious effect of nicotine in a random skin flap. Methods: Fourteen adult male Wistar-EPM rats were distributed at random into two groups of seven animals. the nicotine group received this drug subcutaneously (1. 2 mg/kg/day), for I week before flap elevation. the nicotine plus <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> group followed the same routine. Five minutes before the surgical procedure, rats in the nicotine group received distilled water orally and rats in the nicotine plus <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> group received <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> orally (2 ml/kg). Blood and skin tissue samples were collected to allow determination of malondialdehyde levels. Results: the nicotine group had a mean value of 40. 2 percent and the nicotine plus <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> group had a mean value of 20. 6 percent necrosis (p = 0. 009). Malondialdehyde levels in both serum and skin samples were lower in the animals that received <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide.</b> Conclusion: the deleterious effect of nicotine was effectively blocked by <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide.</b> Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Dept Ophthalmol, Div Plast Surg, BR- 04023062 São Paulo, BrazilUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, Dept Ophthalmol, Div Plast Surg, BR- 04023062 São Paulo, BrazilWeb of Scienc...|$|R

We propose that <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulfoxide</b> may act as a "scavenger" of cytotoxic free radicals, many of which are known to be generated by mitochondria during reoxygenation.
