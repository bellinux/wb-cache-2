5|$|The Rockefeller Center had {{originally}} been intended by John D.

Rockefeller decided to develop a large office center instead, taking advantage of the low construction costs <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession.</b> At the center of the development was the RCA Building, heavily influenced by architect Raymond Hood. The long, slab-like RCA had two distinct axes – from one side, it appeared to be a narrow tower, from the other it rose like a sheer wall. Not only was the structure highly distinctive, but it was also economically very effective. The design maximized the available light to the offices and eliminated any darker internal rooms, as the core of the building was entirely taken up with elevators and other engineering services. It took until 1940 before all of the building had been filled by tenants.|$|E

Though there was some variation, overall growth was 2. 9 % higher than {{the world as a}} whole over the period 2018 [...] 13. A number of factors are examined. First, a number of African countries have built up significant reserves and tapped new sources of finance which allowed them greater policy space to avoid IMF loans and associated conditionality while maintaining anti-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy. New financing sources permitted historically larger levels of infrastructural spending <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> effectively acting as anti-recessionary public work projects. Second, SSA countries were able to reorient their economies away from traditional export markets and sources of FDI toward Asian and other emerging countries. This allowed them to diminish their ties with Europe and other developed countries which were hit much harder <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession.</b> Third, SSA countries continued to rely heavily on commodity production before and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession.</b> Prior to <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> there was a commodity boom led by the high level of commodity prices which held up remarkably well <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession.</b> There is little doubt that this helped build stimulate economic growth and build up reserves.
