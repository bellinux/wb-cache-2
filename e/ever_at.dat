It became the highest opening {{day for a}} Harry Potter film in the series, a record {{previously}} held by Half-Blood Prince with $58.2million, until it was broken by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 with $92.1 million.

5|$|Production of {{the film}} began in January 2006. Several visual effect {{companies}} were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark.

In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.|$|E
5|$|Albion {{had spent}} the {{majority}} of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered the playoffs for the first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years – and their last <b>ever</b> <b>at</b> the original stadium – saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.|$|E

5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game {{up to this}} point in the season: he threw three interceptions and was held to only 84 yards rushing. This marked the first time that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd <b>ever</b> <b>at</b> Michigan Stadium. As a testament to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Favre led the Packers {{to their}} best season in 30 {{years in the}} 1996 season, winning his second {{consecutive}} MVP award in the process. The Packers led the NFL in points scored (456) as well as fewest points allowed (210), joining only the 1972 Dolphins as the only two teams to ever accomplish this. The defense also set a then NFL record for least amount of touchdowns allowed in a 16-game season with 19. Favre threw for 3,899 yards, a career-high 39 touchdown passes (third highest <b>ever</b> <b>at</b> the time), only 13 interceptions, and passer rating of 95.8 (the third highest of his career). Green Bay tied the Denver Broncos for the NFL's best regular season record, 13–3, defeated the San Francisco 49ers (35–14) and Carolina Panthers (30–13) at Lambeau Field in the playoffs. The Packers advanced to Super Bowl XXXI at the Louisiana Superdome, a short drive from Favre's hometown.|$|E
5|$|In the World Championships 200 m, Bolt cruised {{through to}} the final which he won {{in a time of}} 19.40. Though this was short of his world record times of the two {{previous}} major tournaments, it was the fourth fastest run <b>ever</b> <b>at</b> that point, after his own records and Michael Johnson's former record, and left him three tenths of a second ahead of runner-up Walter Dix. This achievement made Bolt one of only two men to win consecutive 200m world titles, alongside Calvin Smith. Bolt closed the championships with another gold with Jamaica in the 4 × 100 metres relay. Nesta Carter and Michael Frater joined world champions Bolt and Blake to set a world record time of 37.04.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} ODI <b>ever</b> <b>at</b> Bellerive Oval, West Indian Desmond Haynes scored {{the first century}} at the venue with a score of 101 runs from 112 balls against Pakistan in 1988. In 34 ODIs, a total of 22 centuries have been scored. As of October 2014, the highest ODI score at the ground is 172, scored by Adam Gilchrist, an Australian wicket-keeper. The top scoring non-Australian is Sri Lankan Tillakaratne Dilshan, who scored 160 runs. Dilshan and fellow Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara are the only players to have scored two ODI centuries at Bellerive Oval. In the two T20I games at Bellerive Oval, as of October 2014, no centuries have been scored. The top T20I score at the ground is 75 by Australian Cameron White in 2014.|$|E

Still, it managed to become the fastest-grossing film in the franchise and also achieved the second-largest ten-day gross <b>ever</b> <b>at</b> the time (now eighth).

Sohn Kee-chung, competing as Kitei Son, won gold in the marathon, which made him Japan's first gold medalist at these Games and the first Korean ever to win a medal. His fellow countryman Nam Sung-yong won the bronze medal in the same event. For {{the first time since the}} 1908 Games, the United States failed to lead the medal table.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, a new fastest lap of the track <b>ever</b> <b>at</b> 1:36.006. However, he also came under investigation of the stewards as he failed to obliged the rules set for turn 2, rejoining the track earlier than allowed after running wide. After being summoned to the stewards at the end of qualifying, he walked away with a reprimand, but was not penalised. Behind Rosberg in second place, the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen were third and fourth respectively. At {{the tail end of the}} field, three pairs of cars were eliminated: both Sauber, Manor and Renault drivers missed Q2.|$|E
5|$|Tour dates {{were limited}} to cities in Europe and North America. This {{decision}} caused some resentment among fans {{in other parts of}} the world. Drowned World became the first (and only) Madonna tour to skip over Canada completely. For many weeks prior to the launch of the tour dates, Arthur Fogel from Live Nation himself attempted to book dates in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre between the Sunrise, Atlanta, and Detroit dates, though no free bookings were available. In the end no dates were scheduled in Toronto, to the disappointment of many Canadian fans. Ticket sales were swift in London on April 25, as Madonna sold out her dates at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in record time– six shows in six hours. Madonna made history with the fastest-selling show <b>ever</b> <b>at</b> Earl's Court, as 97,000 tickets were sold.|$|E
5|$|Two {{vacancies}} {{occurred on}} the Supreme Court during Tyler's presidency, as Justices Smith Thompson and Henry Baldwin died in 1843 and 1844, respectively. Tyler, <b>ever</b> <b>at</b> odds with Congress—including the Whig-controlled Senate—nominated several men to the Supreme Court to fill these seats. However, the Senate successively voted against confirming John C. Spencer, Reuben Walworth, Edward King and John M. Read (Walworth was rejected three times, King rejected twice). One reason cited for the Senate's actions was the hope that Clay would fill the vacancies after winning the 1844 presidential election. Tyler's four unsuccessful nominees are the most by a president.|$|E
