To our knowledge, there is no report of {{hepatitis}} involving this drug {{as well as other}} beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (1). Metoprolol is metabolized by three ma-jor oxidation pathways (2); two of them, O-dealkylation and alpha-hydroxylation, undergo genetically controlled polymorphisms correlated with that of debrisoquine oxi-dation (2 - 4). This finding strongly suggests that meto-prolol oxidation depends at least partly on the same iso-zyme of cytochrome P- 450 involved in the genetic polymorphism of oxidation of debrisoquine and many other drugs such as sparteine, perhexiline, and several other beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (5). Poor metabo-lizers of debrisoquine and metoprolol exhibit abnormal pharmacokinetics of metoprolol, which can result in an overdose after the administration of a standard dose (3, 4). There is a clear association between impairment of debrisoquine oxidation and susceptibility to develop liver injury with perhexiline (6). It would be interesting to determine whether such an association exists for meto-prolol. We report the first case of hepatitis induced by metoprolol and the result of drug oxidation phenotyping.

40|$|Binding of {{dextromethorphan}} (DM) to {{guinea pig}} brain is stereoselective, since levome-thorphan is 20 times weaker than DM in competing for DM sites. In general, opiate agonists and antagonists {{as well as}} their corresponding dextrorotatory isomers are weak competitors for tritiated dextromethorphan ([3 H]DM) binding sites and display ICo values in the micromolar range. In contrast, several non-narcotic, centrally acting anti-tussives are inhibitory in the nanomolar range (ICw values for caramiphen, carbetapen-tane, <b>dimethoxanate,</b> and pipazethate are 25 nM, 9 nii, 41 imi, and 190 n. si, respectively). Other antitussives, such as levopropoxyphene, chiophedianol, and fominoben, have poor affinity for DM sites whereas the antitussive noscapine enhances DM binding by increas-ing the affinity of DM for its central binding sites. Additional competition studies indicate that there is no correlation of DM binding with any of the known or putative neurotrans-mitters in the central nervous system. DM binding is also not related to tricycic antidepressant binding sites or biogenic amine uptake sites. However, certain phenothi-azine neuroleptics and typical and atypical antidepressants inhibit binding with ICo values in the nanomolar range. Moreover, the anticonvulsant drug diphenythydantoin enhances DM binding {{in a manner similar to}} that of noscapine. Preliminary experiments utilizing acid extracts of brain have not demonstrated the presence of an endogenous ligand for DM sites. The binding characteristics of DM sites studied in rat and mouse brain indicate that the relative potencies of several antitussives to inhibit specific DM binding vary according to species. High-affinity, saturable, and stereoselective [3 H]DM binding sites are present in liver homogenates, but several differences have been found for these peripheral binding sites and those described for brain. Although the nature of central DM binding sites is not known, the potent interaction of several classes of centrally acting antitussives with DM sites suggests that they may be related to the mechanism of action of this drug...|$|E
