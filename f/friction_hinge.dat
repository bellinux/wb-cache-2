40|$|Base {{isolation}} {{techniques have}} been extensively {{used to improve}} the seismic performance of the bridge structures. The decoupling of the bridge decks from the piers and abutments using rubber isolator could result in significant reduction in seismic forces transmitted to the bridge substructures. However, the isolation devices could also increase the deck displacement and thus enhance the possibility of pounding and unseating damage of bridge decks. Moreover, previous investigations have shown that pounding and unseating damages on isolated bridges exacerbate due to the spatial variation in earthquake ground motions. Recent earthquakes revealed that isolation bearing could also be damaged due to the excessive movements of decks during large earthquake events. This study proposes the use of rotational <b>friction</b> <b>hinge</b> dampers to mitigate the damages that could be induced by large displacement of bridge decks, particularly focusing on pounding and unseating damages and bearing damages. The device is capable of providing large hysteretic damping {{and the cost of}} installing the devices is relatively economical. This article presents numerical investigations on the effectiveness of these devices on a typical Nepalese simply supported bridge subjected to spatially varying ground motions. The results indicate that rotational <b>friction</b> <b>hinge</b> dampers are very effective in mitigating the relative displacement and pounding force, as well as controlling the bearing deformation and pier drift. It is also revealed that the effectiveness of the device is not significantly affected by small changes in the slip forces; thus, small variations in the optimum slip forces during the lifetime of the bridge do not warrant any adjustment or replacement of the device...|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically investigates and {{theoretically}} derives {{the implications}} of two frictions, market friction and nominal rigidity, on the dynamic properties of intra-national relative prices, {{with an emphasis on}} the interaction of the two frictions. By analyzing a panel of retail prices of 45 products for 48 cities in the U. S., we make two major arguments. First, the effect of each type of friction on the dynamics of intercity price gaps is quite different. While market frictions arising from physical distance and transportation costs contribute significantly to volatile and persistent movements of intercity price disparities, nominal rigidity is associated with higher persistence, but not with a greater volatility of the intercity price disparity. This empirical evidence is different from what is predicted by standard theoretical models based on price stickiness. Second, the strength of the marginal effect of a market <b>friction</b> <b>hinges</b> on the extent of nominal rigidity, in a counteracting manner. The marginal effect of a market friction dwindles as the extent of price stickiness increases. We provide an alternative theoretical explanation for this finding by extending the state-dependent pricing (SDP) model of Dotsey et al. (1999) and show that our two-city mode...|$|R

In the existent scientific labours is devoted the alike problems, influencing of <b>friction</b> in the <b>hinges</b> of bar fastening on the size of critical force was not taken into account. At determination of bars stability with no ideality of <b>hinges</b> <b>friction</b> in them it is possible to take into account by the eccentric appendix of loading or appendix of moment.

To set influencing of <b>friction</b> in the <b>hinge</b> of bar fastening on of his critical force size in sense of Euler, and also build dependences for determination of bar critical force taking into account mechanical descriptions of hinges materials. Conclusion. For the task of determination the size of bar critical force with the joint fastening on ends are got the dependences which take into account mechanical descriptions of material hinge. The received dependences allow to define more exact meaning of critical force for bars.

40|$|Abstract: Dynamics of a {{gravitational}} system satellite-stabilizer is studied. It {{is assumed}} that there exists viscous <b>friction</b> in the <b>hinge</b> connecting the system components {{but there is no}} spring resistance. The plane motion in a circular orbit is analyzed; the parameters that provide the most rapid damping of the natural oscillations {{in the vicinity of the}} equilibrium are determined. To estimate the duration of the transitional processes, the degree of stability of the linearized equations of motion is used. As a result of optimization with respect to dimensionless damping coefficient, the space of the system’s parameters is divided into several domains. In each of these domains, the maximum degree of stability takes place on a specific configuration of characteristic equation roots. It is shown that the global optimum is achieved in the two points of the parameter space. Here one of the system’s bodies degenerates into a plate, and the characteristic equation has four equal real roots. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R
40|$|The study {{reported}} in this paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a semi-definite nonlinear mechanical structure. It consists of a cantilever beam subjected to a harmonic excitation at the base; two hinged rigid plates are attached at the other end. The plates can execute oscillations in the horizontal plane without restoring moments. The <b>friction</b> at the <b>hinges</b> is modeled as a Coulomb type with a nonlinear friction coefficient. The excitation parameters at which chaotic motion of the hinged plates is initiated are investigated experimentally and numerically. It is shown that the prediction of the dynamic response of this semi-definite system is not accurate in the resonance region. The prediction fails due {{to the existence of}} chaotic behavior in that region. The measurement of the dynamic response of the system is conducted using a He-Ne laser system. The numerical results are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental findings. King Saud Universit...|$|R

Experience gained {{in the course of}} more than 2000 operations has shown that along with the advantageous properties of modern endoprosthetic constructions made of metal, ceramics and polymers, they have certain drawbacks. Among them are insufficient biological inertness and susceptibility to excessive wear of the friction pair components. In addition, as a result of wear of the <b>hinge</b> <b>friction</b> pair, toxic and oncologically dangerous products of degradation accumulate in the different organs and tissues. This in turn results in severe complications and demands correspondingly complicated corrective intervention, often leading to worse disability than that which the original operation was designed to cure.

Restriction set on 16. 03. 2017 by SC, Graduate schoolThe original aim of {{the research}} project was to investigate the mechanism of power capture from sea waves and to optimise the performance of a vee-shaped floating Wave Energy Converter, the Floating Clam, patented by Francis Farley. His patent was based on the use of a pressurised bag (or ‘reservoir’) to hold the hinged Clam sides apart, so that, as they moved under the action of sea waves, air would be pumped into and out of a further air reservoir via a turbine/generator set, in order to extract power from the system. Such “Clam Action” would result in the lengthening of the resonant period in heave. The flexibility of the air bag supporting the Clam sides was an important design parameter. This was expected to lead to a reduction in the mass (and hence cost) of the Clam as compared with a rigid body. However, the present research has led {{to the conclusion that the}} Clam is most effective when constrained in heave and an alternative power take-off is proposed. The theoretical investigations made use of WAMIT, an industry-standard software tool that provides an analysis based on potential flow theory where fluid viscosity is ignored. The WAMIT option of Generalised Modes has been used to model the Clam action. The hydrodynamic coefficients, calculated by WAMIT, have been curve-fitted so that the correct values are available for any chosen wave period. Two bespoke mathematical models have been developed in this work: a frequency domain model, that uses the hydrodynamic coefficients calculated by WAMIT, and a time domain model, linked to the frequency domain model in such a way as to automatically use the same hydrodynamic and hydrostatic data. In addition to modelling regular waves, the time domain model contains an approximate, but most effective method to simulate the behaviour of the Clam in irregular waves, which could be of use in future control system studies. A comprehensive series of wave tank trials has been completed, and vital to their success has been the modification of the wave tank model to achieve very low values of power take-off stiffness through the use of constant force springs, with negligible mechanical <b>friction</b> in the <b>hinge</b> mechanism. Furthermore, the wave tank model has demonstrated its robustness and thus its suitability for use in further test programmes. The thesis concludes with design suggestions for a full-scale device that employs a pulley/counterbalance arrangement to provide a direct connection to turbine/generator sets, giving an efficient drive with low stiffness and inherently very low friction losses. At the current stage of research, the mean annual power capture is estimated as 157. 5 kW, wave to wire in a far from energetic 18 kw/m mean annual wave climate, but with scope for improvement, including through control system development...|$|R
40|$|Experiments on the Vlugter gate are {{executed}} {{to clarify}} uncertainties {{that resulted from}} the mathematical modeling of the gate, for mathematical model validation purposes and to investigate {{the influence of the}} downstream water level. A Vlugter gate structure was designed for the experiments. The structure had a variable angle from 35 up to 55 degrees. Since it was expected that the mass moment of inertia of the gate is important in resonance phenomenon, the structure was designed so that its mass moment of inertia could be changed without changing the upstream set point or the angle. The hinge design prevented rotation friction to avoid damping of gate oscillations and to simplify the mathematical modeling of the gate (damping caused by rotation <b>friction</b> in the <b>hinge</b> is difficult to quantify). Experiments on the Vlugter gate acting as a Begemann gate (downstream water level well below weir crest) gave results similar to experiments executed by Vlugter on the Begemann gate. But for a angle of 55 degrees and small flow rates the channel-gate system could become unstable. The characteristic resonance frequencies of this behavior are found using a Fourier analysis on the measured data. Using a simple analytical formula for resonance in channel pools, {{it was found that the}} frequencies encountered during the experiments could very well represent resonance frequencies of the upstream channel pool. Experiments on the Vlugter gate under submerged flow conditions showed that an increase of the downstream energy head up to a certain limit decreased the upstream energy head. For small flow rates and high downstream energy heads, the upstream energy headcould be decreased below the design water level. This decrease was larger for larger angles. Experiments also showed that the channel-gate system could become unstable for angles of 45 and 55 degrees. These findings are in accordance with those of van Asperen and Riekerk. They concluded that the channel-gate system could become unstable for angles exceeding 35 degrees. A Fourier analysis on the measured data resulted in one dominant frequency that could not be explained by resonance in the upstream or downstream channel pools separately. An explanation of this behavior was in the interaction between the upstream and downstream channel pools when these act as communicating vessels. To gain insight in the unstable channel-gate behavior, steady state and dynamic mathematical models were developed for the Vlugter gate. M. Sc. researcher Hof developed a dynamic mathematical model for the channel system. A frequency analysis of the coupled channel-gate system was executed by linking these dynamic gate- and channel models. The steady state mathematical model of the Vlugter gate acting as a Begemann gate (downstream water level well below the weir crest) was tested for angles of 35, 45 and 55 degrees. The model gave quite accurate results for flow rates up to 60 % of the maximum discharge. The steady state mathematical model of the Vlugter gate operating under high downstream water levels was tested for a angle of 35 degrees. The model gave quite accurate results for flow rates up to 54 % of the maximum discharge. An explicit conclusion on the state (stable/unstable) of the coupled channel-gate system could not be drawn from the dynamic mathematical models, because the channel resonance peaks are overestimated. The coupled channel-gate system could be unstable according to these dynamical models, where it was stable during the experiments. A simplified stability criterium was derived for the channel-gate system. This criterium is used to gain insight in the stability issue. Situations where oscillations were encountered during the experiments were compared to stable ones. Using the criterium and the developed mathematical models it could be seen why the channel-gateWatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
