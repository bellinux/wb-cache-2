50|$|In 1934, BFGoodrich {{produced}} a prototype for a pressure suit {{to be worn}} by airplane pilot, Wiley Post, at high altitudes. This first prototype was made mostly of rubber, with the exception being the metal helmet and waist strap. The prototype suit was pressurized in an initial test, {{but it did not}} hold pressure as it was expected to. With improvements to the concept, a second prototype was made, using the same helmet, which successfully maintained pressurization. The second suit was successful, at least in holding pressure. The suit had shrunk around Post's body and was removed by cutting the suit apart. One year later, in 1935, another prototype was {{produced a}}nd {{is said to be the}} first practical pressure suit in the United States. Piloting his plane, the “Winnie Mae”, Post was able to fly to an altitude of approximately 50,000 feet, where he discovered the jet stream, paving the way for modern <b>flight</b> <b>procedure.</b> From this point forward, the suit created by BFGoodrich served as pattern for mostly modern pressurized space suits.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} regarding aircraft noise has encouraged {{the push to}} reduce noise via operational adjustments. The objective here is thus to expand analysis capabilities to enable modeling of the impact on aircraft noise due to advanced operational approach procedures, such as delayed deceleration approaches and thrust cutback scheduling on takeoff, for both current and future aircraft designs. Current industry standard noise models rely on flight test data interpolation and do not fully capture noise impacts from airframe configuration or advanced operational techniques. This is critical for noise assessment because airframe noise becomes a significant factor relative to the low thrust levels characteristic of advanced operational approaches. This method also limits the ability to assess new aircraft designs. Therefore, a new method combining aircraft sizing and performance tools with NASA’s Aircraft NOise Prediction Program (ANOPP) has been developed to capture those noise impacts. ANOPP is used because of its capability of computing noise received at ground observers due to both engines and airframe of aircraft flying any <b>flight</b> <b>procedure.</b> Inputs into ANOPP are the aircraft geometry, the <b>flight</b> <b>procedure,</b> and the engine performance during the <b>flight</b> <b>procedure.</b> The Transport Aircraft System OPTimization (TASOPT) model is used to compute the engine performance inputs into ANOPP via first principles, physics-based methods. A separate tool was developed to compute {{the specifics of the}} <b>flight</b> <b>procedure</b> (max glide slope obtainable for a particular velocity and configuration, required thrust levels, etc.) based on drag polar supplied either by the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA 4) for current aircraft or by TASOPT for new aircraft. Benefits of this modeling framework include the flexibility in the aircraft and procedure analyzed and the ability to predict the noise of future aircraft configurations without relying on existing data. Both the noise impacts of a sample advanced operational <b>flight</b> <b>procedure</b> and in a future aircraft fleet have been assessed with this model. Next steps include further use of this model to evaluate the noise benefits or detriments of advanced operational approaches.

The statistical values obtained in these ﬂight tests are used in this paper to investigate the inﬂuence of uncertainty in the position, velocity and wind. The results indicate that the velocity along the ﬂight path plays a dominant role in the resulting statistical properties of the noise metric on the ground. Furthermore it is shown that uncertainty in the velocity has a signiﬁcant impact on beneﬁt obtained by noise abatement <b>ﬂight</b> <b>procedures.</b> This indicates the need to include uncertainty into the optimisation process.
