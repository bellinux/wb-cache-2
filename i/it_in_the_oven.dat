60|$|When {{they were}} busy making Italy, and {{were just going}} to put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> to bake: that is, when Garibaldi and Vittorio Emmanuele had won their {{victories}} at Caserta, Naples prepared to give them a triumphant entry. So there sat the little king in his carriage: he had short legs and huge swagger mustaches and a very big bump of philoprogeniture. The town was all done up, in spite of the rain. And down either side of the wide street were hasty statues of large, well-fleshed ladies, each one holding up a fore-finger. We don't know what the king thought. But the staff held their breath. The king's appetite for strapping ladies was more than notorious, and naturally it looked as if Naples had done it on purpose.|$|E

I was firmly resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to imagine anything, but keep my thoughts on facts. I did pretty well until I put the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that is how I came to forget the pie. I didn't know I starched the handkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a name for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook. It's the most ravishing spot, Marilla. There are two maple trees on it and the brook flows right around it. At last it struck me that it would be splendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the Queen's birthday. Both Diana and I are very loyal. But I'm sorry about that pie and the handkerchiefs. I wanted to be extra good today because it's an anniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Hawawshi (sometimes spelled Hawwaoshi; حواوشى; [...] ) is a {{traditional}} Egyptian dish {{very similar to the}} Middle Eastern pizza-like Lahmacun. It is a meat minced and spiced with onions, pepper, parsley and sometimes hot peppers or chillies. In the city of Alexandria, the ingredients are placed between two circular layers of dough, then baked in an oven. Most of other Egyptian cities fill the flat Egyptian bread with the meat mix and then bake <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b>|$|E

5|$|Stuffed {{chicken in}} Israel is usually stuffed with rice, meat (lamb or beef), parsley, dried fruits like dates, {{apricots}} or raisins, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg or allspice; sometimes herbs like thyme and oregano (not the dried ones) are added {{on the top}} of the chicken to give it a flavor and than <b>it</b> is baked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b>|$|R
50|$|A 0.5-inch-diameter {{cylinder}} {{made from}} pipe clay was dried at {{the temperature of}} boiling water. This would prepare <b>it</b> for heating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> temperature was to be measured. During the annealing, sintering (merging) of fine particles resulted in contraction of clay. After cooling, the temperature was evaluated from the diameter difference before and after heating assuming that the contraction is linear with temperature.|$|R
50|$|Main {{ingredients}} are meat (usually chicken, beef or goat, on Tobago crab meat is common as well), rice, pigeon peas or cowpeas, coconut milk and sugar; various vegetables and spices are optional ingredients. Spices {{used in the}} dish include cardamom, cloves, cumin and coriander. The meat is caramelised and the other {{ingredients are}} then added one by one, resulting in a dark brown stew. An alternative preparation method is to sauté the meat, precook the rice, prepare the dish and bake <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> Side dishes are optional; kuchela is a typical one.|$|E
50|$|Searing (or pan searing) is a {{technique}} used in grilling, baking, braising, roasting, sautéing, etc., in which {{the surface of the}} food (usually meat, poultry or fish) is cooked at high temperature until a caramelized crust forms. Similar techniques, browning and blackening, are typically used to sear all sides of a particular piece of meat, fish, poultry, etc. before finishing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> To obtain the desired brown or black crust, the meat surface must exceed 150 °C (300 °F), so searing requires the meat surface be free of water, which boils at around 100 °C (212 °F).|$|E

Tom turns around early and shoots Butch, but finds out he has a novelty gun, allowing Butch to chase Tom into the wall. Tom sees the same brand name on it and assumes it is another novelty gun, but Butch shoots, with Tom barely dodging the bullet. Jerry then enters an oven. Tom and Butch slam the door {{and turn on the}} gas, but Jerry sneaks out, lights a match and drops <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> leaving Tom and Butch in blackface.|$|E
500|$|German Biblical scholar Constantin von Tischendorf {{wrote about}} {{his visit to}} <b>the</b> monastery <b>in</b> Reise in den Orient in 1846 (translated as Travels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East <b>in</b> 1847), without {{mentioning}} the manuscript. [...] Later, in 1860, in his writings about the Sinaiticus discovery, Tischendorf wrote a narrative about the monastery and the manuscript that spanned from 1844 to 1859. He wrote that in 1844, during {{his first visit to}} the Saint Catherine's Monastery, he saw some leaves of parchment in a waste-basket. They were [...] "rubbish which was to be destroyed by burning <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> of <b>the</b> monastery", although this is firmly denied by the Monastery. After examination he realized that they were part of <b>the</b> Septuagint, written <b>in</b> an early Greek uncial script. He retrieved from the basket 129 leaves in Greek which he identified as coming from a manuscript of the Septuagint. He asked if he might keep them, but at this point the attitude of the monks changed. They realized how valuable these old leaves were, and Tischendorf was permitted to take only one-third of the whole, i.e. 43 leaves. These leaves contained portions of 1 Chronicles, Jeremiah, Nehemiah, and Esther. After his return they were deposited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Leipzig University Library, where they remain. In 1846 Tischendorf published their contents, naming them <b>the</b> 'Codex Friderico-Augustanus' (<b>in</b> honor of Frederick Augustus and keeping secret the source of the leaves).

Some people may even bake <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> for health reasons. Usually the paratha is eaten with dollops of white butter on top of it. Side dishes which go very well with paratha are curd, fried egg, omelette, egg dosa (ground mutton cooked with vegetables and spices), nihari (a lamb dish), jeera aloo (potatoes lightly fried with cumin seeds), daal, and raita as part of a breakfast meal. It may be stuffed with potatoes, paneer, onions, qeema or chili peppers.|$|E

25|$|The pavlova has a {{crisp and}} crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in {{contrast}} to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour {{is responsible for the}} marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another egg white stabiliser <b>in</b> addition to <b>the</b> acid. The consistency also makes the pavlova significantly more fragile than meringue.

50|$|A peel is a shovel-like tool used by bakers {{to slide}} loaves of bread, pizzas, pastries, and other baked goods {{into and out}} of an oven. It is usually made of wood, with a flat {{carrying}} surface (like a shovel's blade) for holding the baked good and a handle extending from one side of that surface. Alternatively, the carrying surface may be made of sheet metal, which is attached to a wooden handle. Wood has the advantage that it does not become hot enough to burn the user's hands the way metal can, even if <b>it</b> is frequently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> <b>The</b> word presumably derives from the French pelle, which describes both a peel and a shovel.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} {{television}} {{had an effect}} on eating habits. In 1953, C.A. Swanson & Sons introduced the TV dinner to the US market. The pre-cooked food items, including, meat, potatoes and a vegetable were placed in the segments of an aluminum tray and frozen. The consumer purchased the frozen product and heated <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> for about 25 minutes. It could be eaten out of the tray. In 1960, Swanson, a subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company, built a factory in Listowel, Ontario to manufacture TV dinners and other Campbell frozen products for the Canadian market. The electric toothbrush introduced in 1959 has become very popular in Canada since the 1990s.|$|E

3000|$|To {{determine}} {{the amount of}} rock (carbonate) solubilized by each emulsified acid, the API RP- 40 acid solubility tests were conducted at ambient temperature and 70  °C (American Petroleum Institute 1998).
