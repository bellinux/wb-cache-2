5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they <b>flip</b> <b>it</b> and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles {{continued}} to evolve {{to suit the}} varied needs of riders. The derailleur developed in France between 1900 and 1910 among cyclotourists, and was improved over time. Only in the 1930s did European racing organizations allow racers to use gearing; until then {{they were forced to}} use a two-speed bicycle. The rear wheel had a sprocket {{on either side of the}} hub. To change gears, the rider had to stop, remove the wheel, <b>flip</b> <b>it</b> around, and remount the wheel. When racers were allowed to use derailleurs, racing times immediately dropped.|$|E

They have no velocity on their own. To illustrate, imagine that one were to take a magnet and <b>flip</b> <b>it</b> 180 degrees. The result of assuming that these field lines actually have velocity of their own would be that magnetic field lines far away would swing to the other side, potentially faster {{than the speed of}} light, however, that is not what happens.|$|E

And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and <b>flip</b> <b>it</b> onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Hanneman later {{admitted}} {{that while the}} band was listening to Metallica and Megadeth at the time, they were finding the repetition of guitar riffs tiring. He said, [...] "If we do a verse two or three times, we're already bored with it. So we weren't {{trying to make the}} songs shorter—that's just what we were into," [...] which resulted in the album's short duration of 29 minutes. King had stated that while hour-long records seem to be the trend, [...] "ou could lose this part; you could cut this song completely, and make a much more intense record, which is what we're all about." [...] When the record was completed, the band met with Rubin, who asked: [...] "Do you realize how short this is?" [...] Slayer members looked at each other, and replied: [...] "So what?" [...] The entire album was on one side of a cassette; King stated it was [...] "neat," [...] as [...] "You could listen to it, <b>flip</b> <b>it</b> over, and play it again." [...] The music is abrasive and faster than previous releases, helping to narrow the gap between thrash metal and its predecessor hardcore punk, and is played at an average of 220 beats per minute.|$|E

5000|$|On Stalnaker's analysis, {{there is}} a closest world where the coin {{mentioned}} in (1) and (2) is flipped and at that world either it lands heads or it lands tails.

For Lewis, 'If the coin had been <b>flipped,</b> <b>it</b> would have landed heads or tails' is true, {{but this does not}} entail that 'If the coin had been <b>flipped,</b> <b>it</b> would have landed heads, or: If the coin had been <b>flipped</b> <b>it</b> would have landed tails.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Dykstra then {{purchased}} NHL superstar Wayne Gretzky's $17 million estate (built {{at a cost}} of $14,999,999) {{hoping to}} <b>flip</b> <b>it,</b> but was unsuccessful. At one point he owed more than $13 million on the house, and Lake Sherwood security guards were eventually told to keep him away from the property because he had stripped the house of over $51,000 worth of items (countertops, an oven and hardwood flooring) and allowed the homeowners' insurance policy on the property to lapse. The house was eventually sold in January 2011 for [...] "an undisclosed amount". Jeff Smith, the second lien holder on the former Gretzky mansion, said the property was listed on the market for $10.5 million, and sources interviewed by CNBC said that Smith [...] "did very well" [...] with the sale.|$|E
2500|$|Proof. An {{isometry}} {{is completely}} determined by {{its effect on}} three independent (not collinear) points. So suppose p1, p2, p3 map to q1, q2, q3; we can generate a sequence of mirrors to achieve this as follows. If p1 and q1 are distinct, choose their perpendicular bisector as mirror. Now p1 maps to q1; and we will pass all further mirrors through q1, leaving it fixed. Call the images of p2 and p3 under this reflection p2 and p3. If q2 is distinct from p2, bisect the angle at q1 with a new mirror. With p1 and p2 now in place, p3 is at p3; {{and if it is}} not in place, a final mirror through q1 and q2 will <b>flip</b> <b>it</b> to q3. Thus at most three reflections suffice to reproduce any plane isometry. ∎ ...|$|E

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced {{on location}} in Paris and depicted Victor Manzon's backstory. The sequence filmed in Jerusalem was realized with cooperation of Israeli security forces who portrayed themselves in the pursuit scenes. The mock explosion {{that occurred during the}} Jerusalem scenes had such power that it broke a window of the city's mayor's house, which was located [...] away. The detonation was controlled by Nick Dimitri, a stuntman portraying an Israeli soldier, who positioned himself too close to explosives which resulted in injuries. However, after an hour the director ordered a second take, being adamant about the previous accident. Dimitri praised Friedkin's craftmanship by saying that [...] "when you watch the movie and everything gets obliterated, you can't even tell if it's the first or second take". Moreover, during the realization of the sequence, an actual bombing took place in the vicinity, which prompted Friedkin to capture additional footage which in his opinion added [...] "a documentary reality". The fourth prologue vignette, taking place in Elizabeth, New Jersey, contains a scene involving a car crash. It took twelve takes and approximately ten days to achieve what Friedkin intended. The director recalls the sequence as seemingly [...] "impossible to shoot", having involved several stuntmen from New York, the crew wrecked seven vehicles {{over the course of a}} week, without satisfying the director's intents. Friedkin then put himself in the passenger seat to evaluate the negative aspects of the scene's execution. [...] The director became fed up with the situation and decided to listen to David Salven, the line producer, who suggested that they employ a well-known specialist, Joie Chitwood Jr., whom Friedkin described as [...] "short, stocky, part Indian, self-assured, and fearless". After Friedkin supplied him with all the necessary information about the set's infrastracture, Chitwood meticulously analyzed the surroundings himself, and ordered the special effects technicians to construct a forty-feet long slanted ramp which would allow him to [...] "drive the car at top speed on two wheels, <b>flip</b> <b>it</b> in midair, and crash into a fire hydrant". The construction took three days, and the stunt was successful during its very first take.|$|E
60|$|The Postmaster at Fisher's Crossing {{had just}} {{received}} the weekly mail and express from San Francisco, and {{was engaged in}} examining it. It consisted of five letters and two parcels. Of these, three of the letters and the two parcels were directed to <b>Flip.</b> <b>It</b> {{was not the first}} time during the last six months that this extraordinary event had occurred, and the curiosity of the Crossing was duly excited. As Flip had never called personally for the letters or parcels, but had sent one of her wild, irregular scouts or henchmen to bring them, and as she was seldom seen at the Crossing or on the stage road, that curiosity was never satisfied. The disappointment to the Postmaster--a man past the middle age--partook of a sentimental nature. He looked at the letters and parcels; he looked at his watch; it was yet early, he could return by noon. He again examined the addresses; they were in the same handwriting as the previous letters. His mind was made up, he would deliver them himself. The poetic, soulful side of his mission was delicately indicated by a pale blue necktie, a clean shirt, and a small package of ginger-nuts, of which Flip was extravagantly fond.|$|E
