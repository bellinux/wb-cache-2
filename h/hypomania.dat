25|$|<b>Hypomania</b> is the milder form of mania, {{defined as}} at least four days of the same {{criteria}} as mania, but does not cause {{a significant decrease in}} the individual's ability to socialize or work, lacks psychotic features such as delusions or hallucinations, and does not require psychiatric hospitalization. Overall functioning may actually increase during episodes of <b>hypomania</b> and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression by some. Hypomanic episodes rarely progress to full blown manic episodes. Some people who experience <b>hypomania</b> show increased creativity while others are irritable or demonstrate poor judgment.|$|E
25|$|Affective {{disorders}} {{have long}} been recognised as a complication of AAS use. Case reports describe both <b>hypomania</b> and mania, along with irritability, elation, recklessness, racing thoughts and feelings of power and invincibility that {{did not meet the}} criteria for mania/hypomania. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance.|$|E
25|$|Mania or <b>hypomania</b> {{may occur}} in 1% of {{patients}} with depression and up to 12% {{of patients with}} bipolar disorder. This side effect can occur in individuals with no history of mania {{but it may be}} more likely to occur in those with bipolar or with a family history of mania.|$|E
25|$|Mania may also, as earlier mentioned, {{be divided}} into three “stages.” Stage I {{corresponds}} with <b>hypomania</b> and may feature typical hypomanic characteristics, such as gregariousness and euphoria. In stages II and III mania, however, the patient may be extraordinarily irritable, psychotic or even delirious. These latter two stages {{are referred to as}} acute and delirious (or Bell’s), respectively.|$|E
25|$|Mirtazapine {{and other}} {{antidepressants}} may cause a discontinuation syndrome upon cessation. A gradual and slow reduction in dose is recommended to minimize discontinuation symptoms. Effects of sudden cessation of treatment with mirtazapine may include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, vertigo, restlessness, irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flu-like {{symptoms such as}} allergies and pruritus, headaches and sometimes <b>hypomania</b> or mania.|$|E
25|$|During {{marketing}} of other SSRIs and SNRIs, {{there have been}} spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as brain zap electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, <b>hypomania,</b> tinnitus, and seizures. The withdrawal syndrome from duloxetine resembles the SSRI discontinuation syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{problem with}} antidepressants {{is the chance}} of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with bipolar disorder. Many cases of bipolar depression {{are very similar to}} those of unipolar depression. Therefore, the patient can be misdiagnosed with unipolar depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20–40% of bipolar patients. For bipolar depression, antidepressants (most frequently SSRIs) can exacerbate or trigger symptoms of <b>hypomania</b> and mania.|$|E
25|$|Methylphenidate can worsen {{psychosis}} in psychotic patients, and in {{very rare}} cases {{it has been}} associated with the emergence of new psychotic symptoms. It should be used with extreme caution in patients with bipolar disorder due to the potential induction of mania or <b>hypomania.</b> There have been very rare reports of suicidal ideation, but evidence does not support a link. The long-term effects on mental health disorders in later life of chronic use of methylphenidate is unknown.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{signature}} symptoms of mania (and to a lesser extent, <b>hypomania)</b> is what many have described as racing thoughts. These are usually instances in which the manic person is excessively distracted by objectively unimportant stimuli. This experience creates an absent-mindedness where the manic individual's thoughts totally preoccupy him or her, making him or her unable {{to keep track of}} time, or be aware of anything besides the flow of thoughts. Racing thoughts also interfere with the ability to fall asleep.|$|E
25|$|Peter B. Bennett is {{credited}} with the invention of trimix breathing gas as a method to eliminate high pressure nervous syndrome. In 1981, at the Duke University Medical Center, Bennett conducted an experiment called Atlantis III, which involved subjecting volunteers to a pressure of 2250fsw (equivalent {{to a depth of}} 686m in seawater), and slowly decompressing them to atmospheric pressure over a period of 31-plus days, setting an early world record for depth-equivalent in the process. A later experiment, Atlantis IV, encountered problems as one of the volunteers experienced euphoric hallucinations and <b>hypomania.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine is {{approved}} in the US for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly antimanics, lamotrigine {{is most effective}} for preventing the recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The drug seems ineffective {{in the treatment of}} current rapid-cycling, acute mania, or acute depression in bipolar disorder; however, it is effective at prevention of or delaying of manic, depressive, or rapid cycling episodes. According to studies in 2007, lamotrigine may treat bipolar depression without triggering mania, <b>hypomania,</b> mixed states, or rapid-cycling.|$|E
25|$|Bipolar disorder, {{previously}} {{known as}} manic depression, is a mental disorder that causes periods {{of depression and}} periods of elevated mood. The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or <b>hypomania,</b> depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 3040 percent. Other mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are commonly associated.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine shares many of {{the common}} adverse effects of SSRIs, {{including}} (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%), diarrhea 12% (8%), constipation 14% (9%), dry mouth 18% (12%), somnolence 23% (9%), insomnia 13% (6%), headache 18% (17%), <b>hypomania</b> 1% (0.3%), blurred vision 4%(1%), loss of appetite 6% (2%), nervousness 5% (3%), paraesthesia 4% (2%), dizziness 13% (6%), asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)), tremor 8% (2%), sweating 11% (2%), and sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, {{a higher incidence of}} anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, <b>hypomania,</b> and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the symptom is severe; and scores of 6 suggest the symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|E
25|$|Going {{in another}} direction, {{numerous}} links and overlaps {{have been found}} between major depressive disorder and bipolar syndromes, including mixed states (simultaneous depression and mania or <b>hypomania).</b> Hypomanic ('below manic') and more rarely manic signs and symptoms {{have been found in}} a significant number of cases of major depressive disorder, suggesting not a categorical distinction but a dimension of frequency which is higher in bipolar II and higher again in bipolar I. In addition, numerous subtypes of bipolar have been proposed beyond the types already in the DSM (which includes a milder form called cyclothymia). These extra subgroups have been defined in terms of more detailed gradations of mood severity, or the rapidity of cycling, or the extent or nature of psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, due to shared characteristics between some types of Bipolar disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, some researchers have suggested they may both lie on a spectrum of affective disorders, although others see more links to post-trauma syndromes.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 review {{determined}} that some, but not all, randomized controlled {{studies have found}} that AAS use correlates with <b>hypomania</b> and increased aggressiveness, but pointed out that attempts to determine whether AAS use triggers violent behavior have failed, primarily because of high rates of non-participation. A 2008 study on a nationally representative sample of young adult males in the United States found an association between lifetime and past-year self-reported AAS use and involvement in violent acts. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports.|$|E
25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that major depression is associated with fibromyalgia (1999), although {{the nature of the}} association is debated. A comprehensive review into the relationship between fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD) found substantial similarities in neuroendocrine abnormalities, psychological characteristics, physical symptoms and treatments between fibromyalgia and MDD, but currently available findings do not support the assumption that MDD and fibromyalgia refer to the same underlying construct or can be seen as subsidiaries of one disease concept. Indeed, the sensation of pain has at least two dimensions: a sensory dimension which processes the magnitude and location of the pain, and an affective-motivational dimension which processes the unpleasantness. Accordingly, a study that employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate brain responses to experimental pain among people with fibromyalgia found that depressive symptoms were associated with the magnitude of clinically induced pain response specifically in areas of the brain that participate in affective pain processing, but not in areas involved in sensory processing which indicates that the amplification of the sensory dimension of pain in fibromyalgia occurs independently of mood or emotional processes. Fibromyalgia has also been linked with bipolar disorder, particularly the <b>hypomania</b> component.|$|E

A long-term case series study by Kelly and Lieberman of 17 patients with major refractory unipolar depression found that 14 patients showed sustained improvement of symptoms over an average timespan of two years, in some cases with higher doses of T3 than the traditional 50µg required to achieve therapeutic effect, with an average of 80µg and a dosage span of 24 months; dose range: 25-150µg. The same authors published a retrospective study of 125 patients with the two most common categories of bipolar disorders II and NOS whose treatment had previously been resistant to an average of 14 other medications. They found that 84% experienced improvement and 33% experienced full remission over a period of an average of 20.3 (standard deviation of 9.7). None of the patients experienced <b>hypomania</b> while on T3.|$|E

500|$|TBI {{may cause}} emotional, social, or {{behavioral}} problems {{and changes in}} personality. [...] These may include emotional instability, depression, anxiety, <b>hypomania,</b> mania, apathy, irritability, problems with social judgment, and impaired conversational skills. [...] TBI appears to predispose survivors to psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder, substance abuse, dysthymia, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. In patients who have depression after TBI, suicidal ideation is not uncommon; the suicide rate among these persons is increased 2- to 3-fold. Social and behavioral symptoms that can follow TBI include disinhibition, inability to control anger, impulsiveness, lack of initiative, inappropriate sexual activity, asociality and social withdrawal, and changes in personality.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hypomania</b> is a lowered {{state of}} mania that {{does little to}} impair {{function}} or decrease quality of life. It may, in fact, increase productivity and creativity. [...] In <b>hypomania,</b> there is less need for sleep and both goal-motivated behaviour and metabolism increase. [...] Though the elevated mood and energy level typical of <b>hypomania</b> {{could be seen as}} a benefit, mania itself generally has many undesirable consequences including suicidal tendencies, and <b>hypomania</b> can, if the prominent mood is irritable rather than euphoric, be a rather unpleasant experience. By definition, <b>hypomania</b> cannot feature psychosis, nor can it require psychiatric hospitalisation (voluntary or involuntary).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hypomania</b> {{may feel}} good to some persons who {{experience}} it, though most people who experience <b>hypomania</b> state that {{the stress of the}} experience is very painful. Bipolar people who experience <b>hypomania,</b> however, tend to forget the effects of their actions on those around them. Even when family and friends recognize mood swings, the individual will often deny that anything is wrong. What might be called a [...] "hypomanic event", if not accompanied by depressive episodes, is often not deemed problematic, unless the mood changes are uncontrollable, volatile, or mercurial.

2500|$|Mania is the {{defining}} feature of bipolar disorder and can occur with {{different levels of}} severity. With milder levels of mania, known as <b>hypomania,</b> individuals are energetic, excitable, and may be highly productive. As <b>hypomania</b> worsens, individuals begin to exhibit erratic and impulsive behavior, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future, and sleep less. At the extreme, manic individuals can experience distorted or delusional beliefs about the universe, hallucinate, hear voices, {{to the point of}} [...] psychosis. A depressive episode commonly follows an episode of mania. The biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode, or vice versa, remain poorly understood.|$|E
2500|$|Mania {{varies in}} intensity, from mild mania (<b>hypomania)</b> to delirious mania, marked by such {{symptoms}} as disorientation, florid psychosis, incoherence, and catatonia. Standardized {{tools such as}} Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale {{can be used to}} measure severity of manic episodes. Because mania and <b>hypomania</b> have also long been associated with creativity and artistic talent, it is not always the case that the clearly manic bipolar person needs or wants medical help; such persons often either retain sufficient self-control to function normally or are unaware that they have [...] "gone manic" [...] severely enough to be committed or to commit themselves.

2500|$|Some {{people also}} have {{physical}} symptoms, such as sweating, pacing, and weight loss. In full-blown mania, often the manic person will {{feel as though}} his or her goal(s) trump all else, {{that there are no}} consequences or that negative consequences would be minimal, and that they need not exercise restraint in the pursuit of what they are after. <b>Hypomania</b> is different, as it may cause little or no impairment in function. [...] The hypomanic person's connection with the external world, and its standards of interaction, remain intact, although intensity of moods is heightened. But those who suffer from prolonged unresolved <b>hypomania</b> do run the risk of developing full mania, and indeed may cross that [...] "line" [...] without even realizing they have done so.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hypomania,</b> manifesting with {{feelings}} of euphoria, omnipotence, or grandiosity, are prone to appear in those moments when medication effects are maximum; [...] dysphoria, characterized by sadness, psychomotor slowing, fatigue or apathy are typical with DRT withdrawal.

Behavioral disturbances, most commonly aggressive tendencies, are the norm. Psychosis is also common.|$|E
2500|$|Half of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist {{consists}} of symptoms of mania, <b>hypomania,</b> and frontal-lobe dysfunction, which frequently results in underlying disorders being dismissed. [...] Hare's conception of psychopathy {{has also been}} criticized for being reductionist, dismissive, tautological, and ignorant of context {{as well as the}} dynamic nature of human behavior. Some have called for rejection of the concept altogether, due to its vague, subjective and judgmental nature that makes it prone to misuse.|$|E
2500|$|A single manic episode, in {{the absence}} of {{secondary}} causes, (i.e., substance use disorder, pharmacologic, general medical condition) is sufficient to diagnose bipolar I disorder. <b>Hypomania</b> may be indicative of bipolar II disorder. [...] Manic episodes are often complicated by delusions and/or hallucinations; should the psychotic features persist for a duration significantly longer than the episode of mania (two weeks or more), a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is more appropriate. Certain of [...] "obsessive-compulsive spectrum" [...] disorders as well as impulse control disorders share the name [...] "mania," [...] namely, kleptomania, pyromania, and trichotillomania. Despite the unfortunate association implied by the name, however, no connection exists between mania or bipolar disorder and these disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Mania is a {{syndrome}} {{of multiple}} causes. Although {{the vast majority}} of cases occur in the context of bipolar disorder, it is a key component of other psychiatric disorders (as schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type) and may also occur secondary to various general medical conditions, as multiple sclerosis; certain medications, as prednisone; or certain substances of abuse, as cocaine or anabolic steroids. In current DSM-5 nomenclature, hypomanic episodes are separated from the more severe full manic episodes, which, in turn, are characterized as either mild, moderate, or severe, with specifiers with regard to certain symptomatic features (e.g. catatonia, psychosis). Mania, however, may be divided into three stages: <b>hypomania,</b> or stage I; acute mania, or stage II; and delirious mania, or stage III. This [...] "staging" [...] of a manic episode is, in particular, very useful from a descriptive and differential diagnostic point of view.|$|E
2500|$|People with <b>hypomania</b> or mania may {{experience}} a decreased need of sleep, impaired judgment, and speak excessively and very rapidly. [...] Manic individuals {{often have a}} history of substance abuse developed over years as a form of [...] "self-medication". At the more extreme, a person in a full blown manic state can experience psychosis; a break with reality, a state in which thinking is affected along with mood. They may feel unstoppable, or as if they have been [...] "chosen" [...] and are on a [...] "special mission", or have other grandiose or delusional ideas. This may lead to violent behavior and, sometimes, hospitalization in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the Young Mania Rating Scale, though questions remain about the reliability of these scales.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{imipramine}} {{was the first}} TCA to be developed (by Ciba). At the first international congress of neuro-pharmacology in Rome, September 1958 Dr Freyhan from the University of Pennsylvania discussed {{as one of the}} first clinicians the effects of imipramine in a group of 46 patients, most of them diagnosed as [...] "depressive psychosis". The patients were selected for this study based on symptoms such as depressive apathy, kinetic retardation and feelings of hopelessness and despair. In 30% of all patients, he reported optimal results, and in around 20%, failure. The side effects noted were atropine-like, and most patients suffered from dizziness. Imipramine was first tried against psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, but proved ineffective. As an antidepressant, it did well in clinical studies and it is known to work well in even the most severe cases of depression. It is not surprising, therefore, that imipramine may cause a high rate of manic and hypomanic reactions in hospitalized patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, with one study showing that up to 25% of such patients maintained on Imipramine switched into mania or <b>hypomania.</b> Such powerful antidepressant properties have made it favorable in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression.|$|E
