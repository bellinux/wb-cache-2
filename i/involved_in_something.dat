40|$|What {{makes it}} the case that in (say) moving his finger, an agent acts, as opposed to merely being <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>something’s</b> happening? Equivalently, when an agent moves his finger, what {{makes it the}} case {{that he is an}} agent, as opposed to being a patient?

The standard story’s answer is that the difference lies in the causal etiology of what happens when a body moves. We begin by identifying some putative action that an agent performs by tracing its effects back to some bodily movement. If the bodily movement is an action, then it must be one that the agent knows how to perform, and his knowledge how to perform it mustn’t be explained by his knowledge how to do <b>something</b> else. <b>In</b> Arthur Danto’s terms, the movement thus has to be one that could be a basic action for the agent in question, somethin...|$|R

To help overcome this problem a special fund {{was set up in}} 1928. The main income of the university was from the sale of its produce, while the buildings of the Triantafillideios School of Agriculture were inadequate for the needs of a college.

He summarised: [...] "although I missed the black, it wasn't that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame." [...] In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able to pot a pink which he snookered himself on that changed the course of the match. David Vine closes the programme by asking both players their opinion regarding some voices claiming the match must have been fixed. This preposterous notion gives a fascinating insight into the prevailing naivety in some quarters with regard to Snooker in 1985, when it was still a comparatively young TV sport and reaching its zenith in popularity. Davis replies [...] "Well, its simple. They don't understand. If anyone ever {{came up to me and}} asked if the match was fixed, I would just say yeah it was, yeah.

Innovation and risk-taking go hand in hand as novice designers have to deal with the uncertainty <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> creating <b>something</b> new.

The pilot stage (2007 - 8) involved trialling activities and teaching strategies with 506 children aged 8 - 11 and 18 teachers based in 18 different schools. Data was gathered from teachers and children through questionnaires at the outset of the project and towards the end of the trial period. Follow up interviews with children and teachers were carried out in a sample of 4 schools. This paper discusses the findings from the evaluation of this project and identifies issues that need to be considered when incorporating specific activities and strategies into curriculum planning to support the development of innovation and risktaking...|$|R
