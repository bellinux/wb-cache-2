5|$|Birmingham is chiefly {{a product}} of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; its growth began during the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, {{relatively}} few buildings survive from its earlier history and those that do are protected. There are 1,946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments. Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.|$|E
5|$|Flint {{and brown}} or yellow brick is used extensively, both <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> within the {{conservation}} area and in associated {{structures such as}} boundary walls and pavements. Some kerbs are of granite, limestone and flint, while some high-quality Yorkstone paving slabs survive, along with some red-brick pavements.|$|E

5|$|Iron is {{the most}} widely used of all the metals, {{accounting}} for over 90% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and structural components <b>for</b> <b>buildings.</b> Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel.|$|E

5|$|Dolomite, {{sandstone}} and quartzite rock {{have been}} extensively mined in the park. Though traces of silver, copper and gold are present, {{there have been}} no economic finds. The park is scattered with many quarries; the largest within the park is an open-cut in the northwest corner. It was in operation until 1982 supplying stone <b>for</b> <b>buildings,</b> including Adelaide's war memorial and St Peter's Cathedral. Tea Tree Gully Freestone from some quarries has been used for the facades and ornamental dressing of many of Adelaide’s Victorian public buildings. Adelaide Town Hall, the General Post Office and Supreme Court Buildings in Adelaide were all built entirely of this stone. The quarries supplied dressing stock for ornamentation on buildings, including St Peter's Cathedral, St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Flinders Street Baptist Church and the University of Adelaide's Mitchell Building.|$|E
5|$|In Nier and Drakengard 3, {{the player}} {{controls}} the main protagonist {{with two other}} characters acting as AI-controlled supports. Drakengard 3 {{was designed to be}} a faster experience than the previous games, with the protagonist being given a special hyper-mode and the ability to freely switch between weapons without pausing the action. Aerial gameplay was also changed, with the dragon now capable of ground combat. Nier, while featuring similar hack-and-slash combat, also includes other gameplay types such as a top-down view for puzzle areas, 2D style areas <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> or similar structures. Side-quests were also added, which often involved fetch quests, fishing and farming.|$|E

5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. <b>For</b> <b>buildings,</b> the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E
5|$|No.11 Elementary Flying Training School (No.11 EFTS) {{was formed}} at Benalla, Victoria, on 26June 1941, and {{came under the}} control of Southern Area Command. Its inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Squadron Leader I.C.C. Thomson. Before being taken over by the RAAF, Benalla was an emergency runway for civil aircraft on the journey between Sydney and Melbourne. No.11 EFTS's infrastructure, which included medical facilities and two satellite airstrips, had been budgeted at some £85,000, primarily <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> and engineering works. When the school opened, however, only stores depots and living quarters for the 100-odd staff were completed; instructional courses, which commenced on 24July, were initially held in tents near the main airstrip. No hangars were constructed for the deHavilland Tiger Moth training aircraft until {{towards the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cleaner energy {{facilities}} in Boston include the Allston green district, with three ecologically compatible housing facilities. Boston is also breaking ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities {{to help reduce}} the carbon footprint of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially available to a greater population. Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> to be more environmentally conscious.|$|E

5|$|The first European American {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} Chingleclamouche Township in about 1793, {{and the first}} sawmill in Clearfield County began operating in 1805. Settlers initially occupied land along the river and creeks, as these provided a means of transportation. Some settlers would harvest timber and float it downstream once a year to make money for items they could not produce themselves, but by 1820 the first full-time lumbering operations began in the region. The white pine was the most sought after tree, yielding spars for ships and timber <b>for</b> <b>buildings.</b> Hardwoods were also harvested, and eventually hemlocks were cut for their wood and their bark, which contained tannins used in tanning leather.|$|E
5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} {{incentives}} were virtually non-existent <b>for</b> <b>buildings</b> on the National Register. Before 1976 {{the federal tax}} code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.|$|E
5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants <b>for</b> <b>buildings,</b> an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic hierarchy and more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E
