40|$|AbstractIn recent days, {{automobile}} and construction industries are {{focus on the}} light weight, environmental friendly materials with good mechanical properties. Glass <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> have excellent specific properties and are widely used because of reduced mass. However the manufacturing of glass fibers and end of life disposal are the major problem to the environment. To overcome these problems, natural fibers are used to manufacture composites. Flax is {{the one of the}} naturally available fiber having good mechanical properties than other natural fibers. It needs to be pointed out that most of research effort about the flax <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> focuses on the manufacturing techniques and primary mechanical properties and not on the secondary properties like sound absorption and vibration damping. In this paper, sound absorption and vibration damping properties of flax <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> were characterized and compared with the glass <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites.</b> It was experimentally observed that the sound absorption coefficient of flax <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> has 21. 42 % & 25 % higher than that of glass <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> at higher frequency level (2000 Hz) and lower frequency level (100 Hz).

40|$|Abstract—The {{effect of}} {{orientation}} distribution parameters on elastic moduli of hybrid composites Glass/Epoxy-MWNT has been observed. Hybrid composites {{were treated as}} polymer/continuous fiber/short fiber composites. Some researchers stated that short fiber orientation cannot be neglected due to important role to mechanical properties of composites. In this research elastic moduli of hybrid composites were calculated by using Rule of Hybrid Mixtures (RoHM). In RoHM, hybrid composites are made of two types of composites: continuous <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> and short <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites.</b> The elastic moduli of <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> were calculated by using laminate analogy approach (LAA) and by applying various combinations of fiber orientation distribution parameters, while elastic moduli of continuous <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> were calculated by using Rule of Mixtures.

50|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of short <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> depend critically on the fiber length distribution (FLD) and the fiber orientation distribution (FOD). In particular, {{the strength of}} short <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> increases {{with the increase of}} the mean fiber length and with the decrease of the mean fiber orientation angle (angle between the fiber axis and the loading direction).The elastic modulus (E) of misaligned short <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer <b>composites</b> depends on the distributions of fiber lengths and orientations within the composite structure. In general, the composite elastic modulus increases with the decrease of the mean fiber orientation angle and with the increase of the fiber orientation coefficient; and the elastic modulus increases with the increase of mean fiber length when the mean fiber length is small. When the mean fiber length is large, it has nearly no influence on the elastic modulus of short <b>fiber</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites.</b>|$|R
