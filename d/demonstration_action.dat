The general {{objective}} of this project was to develop, implement and test specific technologies aimed at exploring, describing and quantifying biodiversity in deep-sea fragmented habitats as well as at identifying links between community structure and environmental dynamics. The MoMARETO cruise, held during the summer 2006, was the main <b>demonstration</b> <b>action</b> of EXOCET/D. After nearly 3 years of development, the project was a real success with the at sea trial and validation of 13 instrument prototypes developed for the study of deep-sea extreme habitats. These instruments were dedicated to quantitative imaging, in situ measurements, faunal sampling and in vivo experiments...|$|E

The situation that supported by Armenia caused a huge conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Turkey has sought to play a constructive interference to solve the emergent hitches which is impossible to avoid from this problem. “The Turkish National Assembly recording journal” and “Hürriyet newspaper” are the main sources in this study. Subject headings are like this: 1. Introduction: Karabakh, 2. Karabakh-Ralated Caos while Soviet Union Separating: <b>Demonstration,</b> <b>Action,</b> Cconflict Process, 3. Karabakh’s Bonding to Moscow and Unavoidable Caos, 4. The New Way of Seeking of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia, 5. The Failure of the Union: Liberation Movements in Caucasians, 6.

40|$|Assistive robotic {{systems in}} {{household}} or industrial production environments {{get more and}} more capable of performing also complex tasks which previously only humans were able to do. As robots are often equipped with two arms and hands, similar manipulations can be executed. The robust programming of such devices with {{a very large number of}} degrees of freedom (DOFs) compared with single industrial robot arms however is laborious if done joint-wise. Two major directions to overcome this problem have been previously proposed. The programming by demonstration (PbD) approach, where human arm and recently also hand motions are tracked, segmented and re-executed in an adaptive way on the robotic system and the high-level planning approach which tries to generate a task sequence on a logical level and attributes geometric information as necessary to generate artificial trajectories to solve the task. Here we propose to combine the best of both worlds. For the very complex motion generation for a robotic hand, a rather direct approach to assign manipulation actions from human demonstration to a human hand is taken. For the combination of different basic manipulation actions the task constraints are segmented from the <b>demonstration</b> <b>action</b> and used to generate a task oriented plan. This plan is validated against the robot kinematic and geometric constraints and then a geometric motion planner can generate the necessary robot motions to fulfill the task execution on the system. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{soil and}} water control curse in Baiquan County could {{be divided into two}} stages. Before 1986, the {{soil and water}} control actions are {{scattered}} in small scales. The analysis of the historical data implies the failure of the scattered control actions during this period. For example, in the end of 1970 s, the forest coverage was even under 3.7 % with various natural disasters [16]. Poverty was exacerbated with the deterioration of the ecological system in that period in Baiquan County. The Baiquan county government has changed soil and water loss control polices since 1986. Comprehensive <b>demonstration</b> <b>actions</b> are taken in large scales. The area proportion of soil and water control is increased with the year. Based on the theory of ecology, comprehensive countermeasures not only bring ecological benefits but also bring economic benefits to the local areas. Thus the comprehensive soil and water loss control <b>demonstration</b> <b>actions</b> have made great contribution to improvement of the ecological status.|$|R

30|$|Based on the pressure-state-response (P-S-R) {{framework}} model, {{the comprehensive}} evaluation method was proposed to investigate on the temporal variations of ecological security with Soil and Water Loss Stress in Baiquan County. The calculated {{values of the}} 'Ecological Unsafety Index' decreased from 0.701 to 0.435 {{during the period of}} 1979 to 2005. In general, the ecological security situations of Baiquan County are improving during these years. However, several problems are recognized to be the potential threats to the ecological security in the local areas. The reduction of the effective thickness of the black soil is found {{to be one of the}} potential risks to the food security of Baiquan County. The excessive application of the fertilizer has resulted in the aggravation of the soil and water environmental pollution, and how to adjust the fertilizer structure to reduce the application amount of the fertilizer is important to improve the environmental quality. The low efficiency of the agricultural irrigation system has increased the vulnerability of Baiquan County to the draught disasters, and efficient countermeasures are suggested to be taken. Through the investigation on the ecological security and its relationship with soil and water control curse, it is found that comprehensive soil and water loss control <b>demonstration</b> <b>actions</b> have made great contribution to the improvement of the ecological security.|$|R

5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of <b>demonstrations</b> and <b>actions</b> took place before that date.

The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|R
