25|$|Self-important, romantic, {{and nearly}} always wrong, Barney dreamed {{of the day}} he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>pocket.</b> In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever {{frustrated}} that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.|$|E
500|$|He was {{featured}} in the syndicated comic strip The Far Side, which showed him as a clumsy person who spilled {{in various stages of}} his life; as a baby (his cup), teenager (pen ink in <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>pocket),</b> and ultimately as an adult, driving into a water tower.|$|E
500|$|During his arraignment, Modell {{uses his}} ability to make the judge let him go. The agents look into Modell's past and find that he failed to enter the FBI after a {{psychological}} examination deemed him to be grossly egocentric and sociopathic. Meanwhile, after writing the word [...] "pass" [...] {{on a piece of}} paper and putting it in <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>pocket,</b> Modell is able to pass security and enter FBI headquarters. He [...] "pushes" [...] an agent, Holly (Julia Arkos), into pulling up Mulder's file for him. When Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) intervenes, Modell convinces Holly that he was a man who mugged her, causing her to spray Skinner with mace and beat him. Scully is unable to explain how Modell has his power, but now agrees with Mulder's theory that he can push people into doing whatever he wants.|$|E

While tradition calls for the drill instructor to place the coin in <b>his</b> left <b>shirt</b> <b>pocket,</b> Foley places the coin in his right pocket, acknowledging that Zack was a special candidate. Zack thanks him for not giving up on him and tells him he never would have made it without him. While leaving the base, he sees Foley initiating a set of new candidates for AOCS who are in the same position he was 13 weeks prior.|$|R

500|$|Out of {{gratitude}} to God for giving him salvation, Jenner committed to consistently engaging in personal evangelism, and aimed {{to talk with}} ten different people every day thenceforward. For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson's disease, Jenner engaged in this form of evangelism. He probably spoke with more than 100,000 people in total, hundreds of whom made initial professions of commitment to Christianity. He kept religious tracts in <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>pocket</b> where he had previously kept his rabbit's foot, and he often gave these tracts to people he met. He also kept a card in his pocket with Philippians 4:13 on {{it in order to}} give himself courage in evangelising. This verse reads, [...] "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." [...] While engaging in these activities, Jenner would normally wear a white shirt, black shoes, and trousers, and sometimes a navy greatcoat. Usually evangelising on George Street, Sydney, Jenner asked many people the same question: [...] "If you died within 24 hours, where would you be in eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] If they were willing to engage in conversation with him, he would invite them either to his home or to a local church. The question became known as [...] "the Frank Jenner question". Jenner was most active in evangelism during World War II. On Saturday nights during the war, Jenner would invite groups of sailors to his home for a service consisting of some hymns and a short sermon.|$|E
2500|$|Zero's {{character}} {{design was}} changed to suit the story's focus on a virus; the character wears a plague doctor mask {{as opposed to the}} gas mask worn in the previous games. Carlos was designed to clearly communicate his occupation as a firefighter: he was given scars on his arms, a tight t-shirt and shirt to help show off his muscular build and silhouette, and an axe embroidery on <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> <b>pocket.</b> Because Akane is Japanese, her design incorporated Japanese elements {{such as the use of}} straight lines on her top and a belt to emulate the look of a kimono and a kimono sash. The black color of the belt was meant to represent her hidden dark side, while the belt chains represented things that constrict her. The top halves of her sleeves were initially going to be pastel purple to make sure that the design was not too dark and that it contrasted against Junpei's more monochromatic design; this was changed for the final model, however, with Tomono noting that the use of purple might be better for a mentally unstable character. Similarly, Akane was given blue accents to contrast against Junpei's reds. Junpei had to be redesigned from his appearance in Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, due to him being more jaded, and how his previous design felt [...] "childish" [...] and not fitting well in Zero Time Dilemma. His design process was difficult, with the development team going through many design proposals.|$|E
