40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method of {{microwave}} nondestructive testing based on <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>guided</b> <b>waves</b> {{is applied to}} detect circumferential crack in the piping system of nuclear power plants. Microwaves as continues wave are generated by a network analyzer and amplitude of the reflection coefficient is measured by this network.

40|$|International audience—In {{the present}} paper, {{we show that}} it is {{possible}} to use a periodic structure of disconnected elements (e. g. a line of rods) to <b>guide</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves,</b> in the direction of the periodicity.

40|$|Almost {{a decade}} ago, {{transformation}} optics established a geometrical perspective {{to describe the}} interaction of light with structured matter, enhancing our understanding and control of light.
