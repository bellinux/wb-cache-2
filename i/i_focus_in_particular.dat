As a radiological assistant, <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> on the Department of Radiodiagnostics, Centre of Skiagraphics. I searched for differences {{of the work}} of a radiological assistant compared to a civil medical facility.

The results will show clearly whether the numbers of skiagraphic examinations were increasing or decreasing {{in the course of the}} years. In conclusion, the numbers will be compared to those of a civil medical facility. Comparison of data from skiagraphic examinations and their subsequent analysis will be used to verify the efficiency of the existing penitentiary system concept. Self-inflicted traumas represent the last-resort form of protest that provides evidence either of a high degree of desperation or low self-respect to social values. High responsive value of the compared data is expected in the hardest prison. The aim of this work is to acquaint the broad public with the specific features {{of the work of}} a radiological assistant, with the structure and characteristics of his or her occupational environment. Numerous principal changes have occurred in the field of the penitentiary system since 1989. These changes have not been widely welcome by the public. The process of humanization is not perceived as an effort of the government to change the attitudes of sentenced persons toward social values. It is seen predominantly as an incomprehensible display of weakness and excessive tolerance. Based on objective data, I would like to provide evidence of the efficiency and purpose of the humanization process in the penitentiary system and to help change the view of the public regarding its efficiency...|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} I {{have worked with}} high spatial and {{spectral}} resolution data on the protostellar binary system IRAS 16293 - 2422 obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA). <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> {{on one of the}} two sources, IRAS 16293 A, which is a Class 0 protostar. IRAS 16293 A has a much more complicated structure than its companion, it has indeed two outflows, along NE-SW and E-W directions, and the continuum emission appears to be one at sub-mm wavelengths but split into two at mm and cm wavelengths. Line emission toward this source is also characterized by FWHMs much higher than those observed toward IRAS 16293 B, causing some lines to blend. Thus, in order to give a contribution toward the clarification of how these dynamics work, I investigated how different species are affected through studying their distribution and velocity. To do this I mapped integrated emission (Moment 0 maps) and velocity distribution (Moment 1 maps) for 33 different transitions from various species. It turned out that all species peak close to the continuum source (which represents the accretion disk) but most of the peaks present an offset towards South West, probably because of the influence of NE-SW outflow. Moreover, using rotational diagrams, I have been able to estimate methanol temperature and column density in every pixel around Source A. The temperature map doesn’t show increasing temperatures towards the center, as one would expect getting closer to the protostar, but warmer zones in the eastern and {{in the western part of}} methanol emitting region, where all methanol lines show kinetic deformation. Furthermore, methanol transitions Moment 0 maps are characterized by the presence of a horizontally elongated structure, in the lower part of methanol emitting region. I discuss how both these methanol emission features are compatible with the action of shocks generated by E-W outflow...|$|R

I'll then discuss coannihilation in general and show how it dramatically relaxes the cosmological upper bound on the mSUGRA masses. Finally, I'll give an example of constraints (on CP violating phases in mSUGRA) which are not relaxed by the weakened mass limits. 2.
