2500|$|In {{the case}} of the {{original}} Grätzel and O'Regan design, the cell has 3 primary parts. On top is a transparent anode made of fluoride-doped tin dioxide (SnO2:F) deposited {{on the back of a}} (typically glass) plate. On the back of this conductive plate is a thin layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2), which forms into a highly porous structure with an extremely high surface area. The (TiO2) is chemically bound by a process called sintering. TiO2 only absorbs a small fraction of the solar photons (those in the UV). [...] The plate is then immersed in a mixture of a photosensitive ruthenium-polypyridine dye (also called molecular sensitizers) and a solvent. After [...] the film in the <b>dye</b> <b>solution,</b> a thin layer of the dye is left covalently bonded to the surface of the TiO2. The bond is either an ester, chelating, or bidentate bridging linkage.|$|E
40|$|Decolorization of 10 {{types of}} <b>dye</b> <b>solutions</b> by {{potassium}} permanganate was studied. Effects of reaction {{conditions on the}} decolorization efficiency were examined in batch experiments. The pH value {{had a significant effect}} on the decolorization efficiency. When pH value 4. 0, the <b>dye</b> <b>solutions</b> were almost not decolorized. Concentration of potassium permanganate and temperature also showed significant effects on the decolorization efficiency. The decolorization rate of <b>dye</b> <b>solutions</b> by potassium permanganate was rapid, and most of <b>dye</b> <b>solutions</b> can be decolorized effectively. The results of total organic carbon indicated that <b>dye</b> <b>solutions</b> were degraded incompletely by potassium permanganate.

The investigated photocatalyst was Millennium PC- 500 TiO(2) (crystallites mean size 5 - 10 nm) immobilised on non-woven paper. All the experiments were performed in a circulation photochemical reactor equipped with a 15 W UV lamp emitting around 365 nm.

50|$|A {{dye laser}} uses a gain medium {{consisting}} of an organic dye, {{which is a}} carbon-based, soluble stain that is often fluorescent, such as the dye in a highlighter pen. The dye is mixed with a compatible solvent, allowing the molecules to diffuse evenly throughout the liquid. The <b>dye</b> <b>solution</b> may be circulated through a dye cell, or streamed through open air using a dye jet. A high energy source of light is needed to 'pump' the liquid beyond its lasing threshold. A fast discharge flashtube or an external laser is usually used for this purpose. Mirrors are also needed to oscillate the light produced by the dye’s fluorescence, which is amplified with each pass through the liquid. The output mirror is normally around 80% reflective, while all other mirrors are usually more than 99.9% reflective. The <b>dye</b> <b>solution</b> is usually circulated at high speeds, to help avoid triplet absorption and to decrease degradation of the dye. A prism or diffraction grating is usually mounted in the beam path, to allow tuning of the beam.|$|E

5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{solvents}} can be used, although most dyes will dissolve better in some solvents than in others. Some of the solvents used are water, glycol, ethanol, methanol, hexane, cyclohexane, cyclodextrin, and many others. Solvents are often highly toxic, and can sometimes be absorbed directly through the skin, or through inhaled vapors. Many solvents are also extremely flammable. The various solvents can also {{have an effect on}} the specific color of the <b>dye</b> <b>solution,</b> the lifetime of the singlet state, either enhancing or quenching the triplet state, and, thus, on the lasing bandwidth and power obtainable with a particular laser-pumping source.|$|E
50|$|Sulfur dyes are water-insoluble. In the {{presence}} of a reducing agent and at alkali pH's at elevated temperature of around 80 °C, the dye particles disintegrate, which then becomes water-soluble and hence can be absorbed by the fabric. Sodium sulfide or sodium hydrosulfide are suitable reducing agents. Common salt facilitates the absorption. After the fabric is removed from the <b>dye</b> <b>solution,</b> it is allowed to stand in air whereupon the dye is regenerated by oxidation. The regenerated parent dye is insoluble in water.
