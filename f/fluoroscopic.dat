5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} <b>fluoroscopic</b> probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E
25|$|Liver biopsy is {{performed}} under <b>fluoroscopic</b> guidance at many centers.|$|E
25|$|Barium <b>fluoroscopic</b> {{examinations}} {{have some}} advantages over computed tomography and magnetic resonance techniques, such as higher spatial resolution {{and the ability}} to examine bowel peristalsis and distension in real time.|$|E
25|$|Early radiologists would adapt {{their eyes}} to view the dim <b>fluoroscopic</b> images by sitting in darkened rooms, or by wearing red {{adaptation}} goggles. After the development of X-ray image intensifiers, the images were bright enough to see without goggles under normal ambient light.|$|E
25|$|The transvenous, or pervenous, {{procedure}} involved incision of a vein {{into which}} was inserted the catheter electrode lead under <b>fluoroscopic</b> guidance, {{until it was}} lodged within the trabeculae of the right ventricle. This method was to become the method of choice by the mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|The 3D image {{itself can}} be {{overlaid}} colour-coded {{on top of the}} <b>fluoroscopic</b> image. Any change of the angulations of the C-arm will cause the workstation to re-calculate in real-time the view on the 3D image to match exactly the view of the live 2D fluoroscopy image. Without additional contrast agent injection the surgeon can observe device movements simultaneously with the 3D overlay of the vessel contours in the fluoroscopy image.|$|E
25|$|Cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) based image guided {{systems have been}} integrated with medical linear accelerators to great success. With improvements in flat-panel technology, CBCT {{has been able to}} provide volumetric imaging, and allows for radiographic or <b>fluoroscopic</b> monitoring throughout the treatment process. Cone beam CT acquires many projections over the entire volume of interest in each projection. Using reconstruction strategies pioneered by Feldkamp, the 2D projections are reconstructed into a 3D volume analogous to the CT planning dataset.|$|E
25|$|An {{advanced}} {{application of}} DSA is road mapping. From the acquired DSA sequence, the image frame with maximum vessel opification is identified and assigned {{to be the}} so-called road-map mask. This mask is continuously subtracted from live fluoroscopy images to produce real-time subtracted <b>fluoroscopic</b> images overlaid on a static image of the vasculature. The clinical benefit is better visualization of small and complex vascular structures without distracting underlying tissue to support the placement of catheters and wires.|$|E
25|$|Little or no {{preparations}} {{are required}} {{for the study of}} the larynx, pharynx, and esophagus when studied alone. A thick barium mixture is swallowed in supine position and <b>fluoroscopic</b> images of the swallowing process are made. Then several swallows of a thin barium mixture are taken and the passage is recorded by fluoroscopy and standard radiographs. The procedure is repeated several times with the examination table tilted at various angles. A total of 350-450mL of barium is swallowed during the process.|$|E
25|$|Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation {{requires}} exact {{positioning of}} the valve in the aortic root to prevent complications. A good <b>fluoroscopic</b> view is essential, whereby an exact perpendicular angle to the aortic root {{is considered to be}} optimal for the implantation. Recently, applications have been released which support the surgeon in selecting this optimal fluoroscopy angulation or even drive the C-arm automatically into the perpendicular view to the aortic root. Some approaches are based on pre-operative CT images, which are used to segment the aorta and calculate optimal viewing angles for valve implantations. CT images must be registered with C-arm CT or <b>fluoroscopic</b> images to transfer the 3D volume to the actual angiographic system. Errors during the registration process might result in diversification from the optimal angulations of the C-arm and must be manually corrected. Additionally, anatomical variations between the acquisition of the pre-operatively CT image and surgery are not accounted for. Patients are generally imaged with hands-up in a CT scanner while surgery is performed with arms aside the patient, which leads to substantial errors. Algorithms purely based on C-arm CT images acquired in the OR by the angiographic system are inherently registered to the patient and show the present anatomy structures. With such an approach, the surgeon does not rely on pre-operative CT images acquired by the radiological department which simplifies the workflow in the OR and reduces errors in the process.|$|E
25|$|Catheter-directed {{thrombolysis}} (CDT) is a {{new technique}} found to be relatively safe and effective for massive PEs. This involves accessing the venous system by placing a catheter into a vein in the groin and guiding it through the veins by using <b>fluoroscopic</b> imaging until it is located next to the PE in the lung circulation. Medication that breaks up blood clots is released through the catheter so that its highest concentration is directly next to the pulmonary embolus. CDT is performed by interventional radiologists, and in medical centers that offer CDT, it may be offered as a first-line treatment. Catheter-based ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis is being investigated.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal SEMS {{are placed}} after a {{gastroscopy}} is performed {{to identify the}} area of narrowing. The area {{may need to be}} dilated in order to allow the gastroscope to pass. The tumour is usually better seen with the direct vision of endoscopy than on a <b>fluoroscopic</b> image. As a result, radio-opaque markers are usually placed {{on the surface of the}} patient in order to mark the area of narrowing on fluoroscopy. The SEMS is placed through the channel of the endoscope into the esophagus over a guidewire, marked on fluoroscopy, and mechanically deployed (using a device that sits outside of the endoscope) such that it expands when in position. Hypaque or other water-soluble dye may be placed through the passage to ensure patency of the stent on fluoroscopy. Enteric and colonic SEMS are inserted in a similar fashion, but in the duodenum and colon respectively.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{over time}} the cameras and {{recording}} media for <b>fluoroscopic</b> imaging have progressed as follows. The original kind of fluoroscopy, and the common kind for its first half century of existence, simply used none, because for most diagnosis and treatment, they weren't essential. For those investigations {{that needed to be}} transmitted or recorded (such as for training or research), movie cameras using film (such as 16 mm film) were the medium. In the 1950s, analog electronic video cameras (at first only producing live output but later using video tape recorders) appeared. Since the 1990s, there have been digital video cameras, flat panel detectors, and storage of data to local servers or (more recently) secure cloud servers. Late-model fluoroscopes all use digital image processing and image analysis software, which not only helps to produce optimal image clarity and contrast but also allows that result with a minimal radiation dose (because signal processing can take tiny inputs from low radiation doses and amplify them while to some extent also differentiating signal from noise).|$|E
25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in <b>fluoroscopic</b> mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Racz {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} <b>fluoroscopic</b> probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, a minimally invasive, percutaneous procedure {{also known as the}} [...] "Racz procedure", which is somewhat similar to an epidural. It is used to treat patients with chronic low back pain due to post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, which involves scar tissue that has formed around the nerve root. It is also used to treat protruding or herniated disks, fractures, degeneration, or radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{way to add}} {{information from}} the workstation to the <b>fluoroscopic</b> image is to overlay, after either manual or automatic segmentation of the anatomical structures {{of interest in the}} 3D image, the outline as a contour onto the <b>fluoroscopic</b> image. This provides ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to spatial blurring factors that plague all X-ray imaging devices, caused by {{such things as}} Lubberts effect, K-fluorescence reabsorption and electron range, <b>fluoroscopic</b> systems also experience temporal blurring due to system lag. [...] This temporal blurring {{has the effect of}} averaging frames together. [...] While this helps reduce noise in images with stationary objects, it creates motion blurring for moving objects. [...] Temporal blurring also complicates measurements of system performance for <b>fluoroscopic</b> systems.|$|E
2500|$|While {{deterministic}} {{radiation effects}} are a possibility, radiation burns are not typical of standard <b>fluoroscopic</b> procedures. [...] Most procedures sufficiently long in duration to produce radiation burns {{are part of}} necessary life-saving operations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a typical}} Nigerian Teaching Hospital, radiographers {{are not allowed}} to handle the {{ultrasound}} unit, this is left for the radiologists, who, in some areas, have gradually improved their relationship with the radiographers in providing services in other radiographic units. The radiologist is also in charge of specific <b>Fluoroscopic</b> cases where the radiographer assists only with positioning and image acquisition.|$|E
2500|$|... {{additional}} information {{which is not}} visible in the <b>fluoroscopic</b> image. Some software available provides landmarks automatically, more can be added manually be the surgeon or a qualified technician. One example is the placement of a fenestrated stentgraft to treat an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The ostia of the renal arteries can be circled on the 3D image and then overlaid on the live fluorscopy. As the marking {{has been done in}} 3D, it will update with any change of the fluoroscopy angulation to match the current view.|$|E
2500|$|But {{the quest}} for {{recorded}} moving images was a more complex challenge. In the 1890s, moving pictures of any kind (whether taken with visible light or with invisible radiation) were emerging technologies. Because the word photography (literally [...] "recording/engraving with light") was long since established as connoting a still-image medium, the word cinematography (literally [...] "recording/engraving movement") was coined for the new medium of visible-light moving pictures. Soon several new words were coined for achieving moving radiographic pictures. This was often done either by filming a simple <b>fluoroscopic</b> screen with a movie camera (variously called fluorography, cinefluorography, photofluorography, or fluororadiography) or by taking serial radiographs rapidly {{to serve as the}} frames in a movie (cineradiography). Either way, the resulting film reel could be displayed by a movie projector. Another group of techniques were various kinds of kymography, whose common theme was capturing recordings in a series of moments, with a concept similar to movie film although not necessarily with movie-type playback; rather, the sequential images would be compared frame by frame (a distinction comparable to tile mode versus cine mode in today's CT terminology). Thus electrokymography and roentgenkymography were among the early ways to record images from a simple <b>fluoroscopic</b> screen.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{fluoroscopy}} {{involves the}} use of X-rays, a form of ionizing radiation, <b>fluoroscopic</b> procedures pose a potential for increasing the patient's risk of radiation-induced cancer. Radiation doses to the patient depend greatly {{on the size of the}} patient as well as length of the procedure, with typical skin dose rates quoted as 20–50 mGy/min. [...] Exposure times vary depending on the procedure being performed, but procedure times up to 75 minutes have been documented. [...] Because of the long length of procedures, in addition to the cancer risk and other stochastic radiation effects, deterministic radiation effects have also been observed ranging from mild erythema, equivalent of a sun burn, to more serious burns.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas {{the word}} cine (...) in general usage refers to cinema (that is, a movie) or to certain film formats (cine film) for {{recording}} such a movie, in medical usage {{it refers to}} cineradiography or, in recent decades, to any digital imaging mode that produces cine-like moving images (for example, newer CT and MRI systems can output to either cine mode or tile mode). Cineradiography records 30-frame-per-second <b>fluoroscopic</b> images of internal organs such as the heart taken during injection of contrast dye to better visualize regions of stenosis, or to record motility in the body's gastrointestinal tract. The predigital technology is being replaced with digital imaging systems. Some of these decrease the frame rate but also decrease the absorbed dose of radiation to the patient. As they improve, frame rates will likely increase.|$|E
2500|$|... 3D {{images are}} {{calculated}} from {{a set of}} projections acquired during a rotation of the C-Arm around the patient. The volume reconstruction is performed on a separate workstation. The C-Arm and the workstation are connected a communicate continuously. For example, when the user virtually rotates the volume on the workstation to view the anatomy from a certain perspective, the parameter of this view can be transmitted to the angio system, which then drives the C-arm to exactly the same perspective for fluoroscopy. In the same way, if the C-arm angulation is changed, this angulation can be transmitted to the workstation which updates the volume to the same perspective as the <b>fluoroscopic</b> view. The software algorithm that stands behind this process is called registration and can also be done with other DICOM images, such as CT or MRT data acquired preoperatively.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnostic {{modalities}} such as CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, and EMG {{are mostly}} useful in excluding other conditions. However, magnetic resonance neurography {{is a medical}} imaging technique that can show the presence of irritation of the sciatic nerve {{at the level of}} the sciatic notch where the nerve passes under the piriformis muscle. Magnetic resonance neurography is considered [...] "investigational/not medically necessary" [...] by some insurance companies. Neurography can determine whether or not a patient has a split sciatic nerve or a split piriformis muscle – this may be important in getting a good result from injections or surgery. Image guided injections carried out in an open MRI scanner, or other 3D image guidance can accurately relax the piriformis muscle to test the diagnosis. Other injection methods such as blind injection, <b>fluoroscopic</b> guided injection, ultrasound, or EMG guidance can work but are not as reliable and have other drawbacks.|$|E
2500|$|Fluoroscopy's {{origins and}} radiography's origins can both {{be traced back}} to 8 November 1895, when Wilhelm Röntgen, or in English script Roentgen, noticed a barium {{platinocyanide}} screen fluorescing as a result of being exposed to what he would later call X-rays (algebraic x variable signifying [...] "unknown"). [...] Within months of this discovery, the first crude fluoroscopes were created. [...] These experimental fluoroscopes were simply thin cardboard screens that had been coated on the inside with a layer of fluorescent metal salt, attached to a funnel-shaped cardboard eyeshade which excluded room light with a viewing eyepiece which the user held up to his eye. The <b>fluoroscopic</b> image obtained in this way was quite faint. Even when finally improved and commercially introduced for diagnostic imaging, the limited light produced from the fluorescent screens of the earliest commercial scopes necessitated that a radiologist sit for a period in the darkened room where the imaging procedure was to be performed, to first accustom his eyes to increase their sensitivity to perceive the faint image. [...] The placement of the radiologist behind the screen also resulted in significant dosing of the radiologist.|$|E
