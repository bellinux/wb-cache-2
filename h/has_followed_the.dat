He defeats Shawlong Qufang, and Luppi Antenor, and upon learning that Orihime Inoue <b>has</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> Arrancars back to their home world, Hitsugaya returns to Soul Society {{to help in the}} preparation for the war against Aizen. At Karakura Town, he engages the Espada Tier Halibel before she is mortally wounded by Aizen.
