500|$|The centre {{foreground}} shows a {{group of}} five mourners, with three other figures set {{to the right and}} left. In the center group, John the Evangelist supports the Virgin Mary, surrounded by three women. Mary's dramatic swoon in grief pushes her forward in the pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her [...] "closest to the viewer's presumed position". Dressed in an enveloping blue robe that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who supports her by her arms. Mary Magdalene kneels to the right, dressed in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft, she clenches <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> a distraught, agonised manner. She is the only figure from this group shown to look directly at Christ and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's gaze upwards towards the crosses. The fourth and fifth mourners have been identified as prophesying sibyls, and stand to the far left and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross {{with her back to the}} viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right faces the group and is either the Erythraean or the Cumaean sibyl, both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around Christ's death and resurrection. She has an almost indifferent expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing her prophesies realised, and as compassionate contemplation of the other women's grief.|$|E
60|$|Rachel {{flushed and}} fumbled <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> her lap. She stood up awkwardly.|$|E
60|$|THE NYMPH: (<b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> her ears) And words. They {{are not in}} my dictionary.|$|E
60|$|Emlyn {{thought for}} a moment, then drew a ring off <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> which was set a {{cornelian}} heart.|$|R
60|$|But {{still she}} did not answer him at once. She essayed to stick her needle into her work, and pricked <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> lieu of it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take off {{the ring}} and try,' said the King, and resolutely drew the ring off <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b> <b>In</b> HIS eyes she looked just as {{handsome}} as before! ...|$|R
60|$|He took <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his, fingers which {{promptly}} {{returned his}} pressure. His right arm stole around her.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} sweet to feel <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his hair, {{as his mother}} would have caressed him.|$|E
60|$|The {{chestnut}} {{head was}} bent a little lower, {{as the young}} girl nervously twisted <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> her lap.|$|E
60|$|Una {{washed the}} dishes, doing them quite nicely, {{for so much}} had she learned from Mary Vance. Faith swept the floor after a fashion and peeled the {{potatoes}} for dinner, cutting <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> the process.|$|R
60|$|Lucy put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mouth; she did {{not like}} to be scolded, as she called it, gentle as her mother was, and she would not open her mind to take in the kind reproof.|$|R
6000|$|Greta, {{with feet}} crossed, {{sat on a}} {{coloured}} blanket, dabbling <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> a little pool of coffee, and gazing up at Harz. And he thought: 'I should like to paint her like that. [...] "A forget-me-not."' ...|$|R
60|$|Shady {{underwent}} a remarkable change, and stumbled in his backward retreat. Then she snapped <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> Moze's face.|$|E
60|$|Helen locked <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> {{the fringe}} of his jacket--leaned closer to him, all her being {{responsive}} to a bursting gust of blood over her.|$|E
60|$|MRS. HIGGINS [putting <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> her ears, as {{they are}} by this time {{shouting}} one another down with an intolerable noise] Sh--sh--sh--sh! [They stop].|$|E
60|$|Now {{when the}} nine years were out, it fell dusk in the autumn, and {{there came a}} sound in the wind like a sound of piping. At that the nurse lifted up <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> the vaulted house.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{close by}} the door with <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mouth, staring at the boy where he lay upon his couch, and Otto upon his part lay, full of wonder, gazing back upon the little elfin creature.|$|R
6000|$|... "Que vous êtes pâle! Vous êtes donc bien malade, Mademoiselle!" [...] said she, putting <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mouth, {{and staring}} with a wistful stupidity {{which at the}} moment seemed to me more {{beautiful}} than the keenest intelligence.|$|R
60|$|As {{they drew}} near home {{she walked in}} silence, and seemed to hang back. He pressed <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his own. She flushed, but gave no response.|$|E
60|$|He kneeled at her feet, worked {{away with}} a stick and tufts of grass. She put <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his hair, drew his head to her, and kissed it.|$|E
60|$|She let {{him take}} <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his and raise them to his lips, and then they stood looking into each other's eyes {{in silence for a}} long moment.|$|E
6000|$|ZOE: (Stiffly, <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> neckfillet) Honest? Till {{the next}} time. (She sneers) Suppose you got up {{the wrong side}} of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{said the}} little girl; {{but she did}} not seem quite to like, for she put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mouth, and looked at Tom under her brows; and Tom put his <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> his mouth, and looked at her under his brows, for he was horribly ashamed of himself.|$|R
50|$|In November 2010, Castile {{was cast}} on ABC's Skating with the Stars, partnered with Jonny Moseley. Moseley sliced <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> a {{practice}} accident. In January 2012, {{it was announced}} that she would take part in the U.K.'s Dancing on Ice, partnered with Corey Feldman.|$|R
60|$|Then she wriggled <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> the {{air like}} white butterflies, shrugged her {{shoulders}} elaborately, rose from the rail, and sat down {{beside him on the}} steps, quite matter-of-factly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There! Don't {{call her}} that. I can't bear {{you to call}} her that,' {{returned}} Miss Wren, snapping <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> a volley of impatient snaps, 'for I don't like Hexam.' ...|$|E
60|$|He strolled slowly out, while Betty, {{mounting}} a chair, proceeded to chirrup and snap <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> {{the effort to}} establish the foundations of an entente cordiale with the cat.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{a quarter}} of an hour late, sir," [...] Mary said, holding up <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> reproof as he entered. [...] "The idea of keeping me waiting, the very first time after our engagement. I tremble when I look forward to the future." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Harry," [...] {{said his}} mother, holding up <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> a menacing attitude, {{as soon as}} her husband had left the room (for he had last spoken with the door in his hand), [...] "if you do beg his pardon, you are no son of mine." ...|$|R
60|$|She bent her fresh young {{face down}} to mine, <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> were <b>in</b> my hair.|$|R
60|$|She {{frowned at}} him, and then laughed; {{and then her}} laugh {{prolonged}} itself into a shivering sigh, as she dropped her head again, and hid <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> her hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come out," [...] said Mrs. Gibbs, in a raspy voice. She {{knelt on}} the deck and twined <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his hair. The mate {{addressed}} her in terms rendered brotherly by pain.|$|E
60|$|When {{the meal}} was over, she wiped her mouth on her {{handkerchief}} quickly, satisfied and happy, and settled down on the pillow again, with <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his close, strange, fur-like hair.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} himself, the Manager looked round again, and stopped. The old woman, {{who had not}} removed her pipe, and was munching and mumbling while she smoked, as if in {{conversation}} with an invisible familiar, pointed with <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> the direction he was going, and laughed.|$|R
60|$|He stooped over her, {{and held}} <b>her</b> thin <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> his strong man's hand.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} his eyes {{adjusted}} {{themselves to a}} lower elevation. In front of him were standing, hand in hand, a pair of small children, a boy of nine in sailor costume, but with bare knees not usually affected by naval officers, and a girl of seven with <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
