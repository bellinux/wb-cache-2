30|$|The thermoacoustic {{refrigerator}} analyzed <b>here</b> resulted <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> concept device {{used for}} demonstrating {{the interaction between}} sound and heat, but it performed the duties of a real stand-alone thermoacoustic refrigerator. From a practical point of view, during the very first startup, {{it is necessary to}} tune the oscillator at the appropriate frequency; then, the volume can be increased until the maximum power is reached (see previous section), then the device can start working as standing-alone. This thermoacoustic refrigerator complexity, despite the addition of the circuits, is still less than that of a common refrigerator; moreover, it is important to highlight that the circuit complexity will not increase in the event that the resonant stack part is improved using different materials, geometries, or gases.|$|R

It just doesn’t seem possible that Christmas is almost <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> fact, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> short time ago I was a civilian, but look at me now. Supposing that your records {{are up to date}} would appreciate it if you world send me Al Weisner’s address? Things are pretty much the same here and have been for seventeen months. The news sounds quite good lately, that we will soon be able to return to our homes with the shadow of war cleared for a while at least. Must close and hope to hear from you again in regards to what some of my former classmates are doing or have done. Thanking you once more for the Christmas box and hoping that next year it won’t be necessary to send them. Sincerely, Bill [Transcription ends...|$|R
2500|$|The {{project is}} the largest and costliest {{transport}} infrastructure project ever proposed by the provincial government but was never discussed in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature or submitted to any significant public debate before it was approved and put out to tender. [...] Initial cost estimates came in at some R3.5 - 4 billion in 2000 when the project was announced by Premier Shilowa. This figure was revised upwards to R 7 billion {{for the purposes of}} the EIA process in 2003 and was finally revealed as being R20 billion (US$3.7 billion) in 2005, after the successful bidder for the project was announced and a contract came into existence. National and provincial government will contribute R20 billion in equal proportions and Bombela will contribute the balance of direct project costs. Loan funding will constitute a large part of these amounts but the financing costs involved have not been stated. [...] The sunk costs for the project will be more than R20 billion. In March 2008, Jeremy Cronin, chairman of the National Assembly's transport portfolio committee and deputy secretary-general of the SACP, complained that the cost had apparently quietly crept up to R35 billion. Cronin has long opposed the project and told the SA Parliament's lower house during a budget debate that his information was that the project's cost was escalating “quietly and below the radar screen”, though MPs “were told, hand on heart, <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Parliament <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few years ago, what the written-in-stone absolute upper limit was [...] ".|$|R
