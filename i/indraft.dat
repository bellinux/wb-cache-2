40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of wind speed and {{critical}} level height on dry convection above a prescribed heat source. This is done using the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) model in its two-dimensional form with an imposed 400 -K soil potential temperature perturbation. The result of these experiments is the identification of three modes of convective plumes. The first, termed multicell convective plumes, is analogous to multicell convection generated from squall-line cold pools in the moist atmosphere. The second mode, a deep wave mode, consists of disturbances with wavelengths of 7 – 10 km and results from the multicell plumes perturbing the dynamically unstable shear flow centered at the critical level. The third mode, termed the intense fire plume, has stronger updrafts than the multicell mode and is marked by quasi-stationary movement and substantial low-level inflow and upper-level outflow. The presence of a critical level is shown to be crucial {{to the development of}} both the deep wave and intense plume modes. The intense fire plume mode is most consistent with the so-called fire storm, or conflagration phenomenon, in which strong updrafts and low-level <b>indrafts</b> can produce mesocyclones and tornadic fire whirls capable of sig-nificant damage. This study marks an important step in understanding the dynamics behind the fire storm phenomenon, as well as other types of convection (multicell and deep wave) that may be generated by a fire. 1...|$|R
40|$|Idealized FIRETEC grassfire {{simulations}} {{were used}} to study some of the roles that three-dimensional aspects of coupled atmosphere/fire interactions play on fire behavior. Domains of various widths that were periodic in the cross-stream direction, simulating an infinite-length fireline, {{were used to}} isolate local fireline-scale threedimensional effects. Two-dimensional vertical plane (zero width) simulations were performed for comparison. Idealized finite-length fire simulations were used to study the larger fire-scale three-dimensional effects. In the infinitely long simulations the fireline remains fairly straight on a macroscale while significant heterogeneities develop along the fireline at fireline-scales. These simulations suggest {{that the nature of}} atmosphere–fire coupling and these heterogeneities are influenced by wind speed. At low wind speed, the spread rate is not significantly affected by the width of the domain (for domains greater than 10 m wide). For higher wind speeds, the flank of the simulated firelines is fingered and the front of the fireline exhibits lobes. The average spread rates vary by approximately 20 % for the different domain widths. In the finite-length fireline simulations, the fireline shape was fairly parabolic and the headfire rate of spread (ROS) increased with wind speed and length of ignition line. The curvature of the fire was also influenced by the length of the ignition line. The <b>indrafts</b> of the headfire and flanking fire lines compete for upstream wind. For wider fires, the separation between the flanking fire lines is larger and more of the upstream wind is able to reach the headfire. These finite-length simulations also suggest that there might be an overall negative pressure gradient from upwind of the fireline to downwind of the fireline near the ground. This pressure gradient is believed to be tied to the penetration of wind through the fireline and the convective heating of unburned fuel. Streamwise-vorticity pairs contribute to the heterogeneous appearance of the fire front by feeding upward momentum in the location where towers are seen on the fireline and thrusting hot gases through the fireline and down to the unburned fuel in the troughs between the firelines. These streamwise vorticies have also been recognized in the periodic infinite length and finite-length simulated firelines as well as laboratory tests. In the two-dimensional simulations with wind speeds above 3 m/s, one major effect of the two-dimensional restrictions is to preclude the nominally streamwise-vorticity structures from forming upstream of the fireline. This thus diminishes the ability of the wind to mix through the heated plume and entrain hot gases down into the fuels ahead of the fire. These simulations suggest that caution should be used when attempting to use one or two-dimensional models to simulate wildland fires. These simulations also suggest the significant value of experiments in which details of both flow and fire dynamics can be studied at scales ranging from fireline scale to overall fire geometry scales in order to better understand fire behavior. The hypothesis generated here can help provide insight in support of experimental design and analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} closed circuit wind tunnels has {{historically}} been performed using rule of thumb which have evolved over the years into a body of useful guidelines. The development of <b>indraft</b> wind tunnels, however, {{has not been as}} well documented. The design of <b>indraft</b> wind tunnels is therefore generally performed using a more intuitive approach, often resulting in a facility with disappointing flow quality. The primary problem is a lack of understanding of the flow in the inlet as it passes through the required antiturbulence treatment. For wind tunnels which employ large contraction ratio inlets, this lack of understanding is not serious since the relatively low velocity of the flow through the inlet treatment reduces the sensitivity to improper inlet design. When designing a small contraction ratio inlet, much more careful design is needed {{in order to reduce the}} flow distortions generated by the inlet treatment.

40|$|The {{character}} of a wildland fire can change dramatically {{in the presence of}} another nearby fire. Understanding and predicting the changes in behavior due to fire-fire interactions cannot only be life-saving to those on the ground, but also be used to better control a prescribed fire to meet objectives.

Fire-fire interactions occur naturally when spot fires start ahead of the main fire and when separate fire events converge in one location. Interactions can be created intentionally during prescribed fires by using spatial ignition patterns. Mass fires are among the most extreme examples of interactive behavior.

These experiments are designed to evalu-ate magnetically driven surface plasma actuators for effective shockwave induced bound-ary layer separation control within supersonic inlets. Static pressure measurements and Schlieren images of the shockwave boundary layer interaction region were reported ear-lier and it was shown that when a weak shock generator (100) is used to generate the impinging shockwave, while no separation occurs without plasma control, a small current plasma column (< 100 mA) at 1 - 3 Tesla is enough to induce separation by flow retardation in the interaction region. Strong shockwave from a (140) generator was shown to induce separation and experiments are done at high currents 100 - 250 mA; for flow acceleration in the interaction region.

In case of the downstream j x B body force, a very small coupling was observed and the separation point appeared largely unaffected.
