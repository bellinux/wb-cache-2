The various textile preforming methods are suited to different applications; their capabilities and end performance characteristics are analysed. Findings: Such preforms are used in composites {{in a wide range of}} industries, from aerospace to medical and automotive to civil engineering. The paper highlights how the use of knitting technology for preform manufacture has gained wider acceptance due to its flexibility in design and shaping capabilities. The tensile properties of glass fibre knit structures containing inlay yarns interlocked between knitted loops are given, highlighting the importance of reinforcement yarns.

KMnO 4 probing experiments indicated the existence of intra and <b>interloop</b> interactions in the Na+ induced structure.

However, the possibility of the presence of two SLS isomers in equilibrium was not excluded in the experiments.

To minimize the possibility of alternative structure formation and stabilize the conformation under investigation, the oligonucleotide sequences were designed {{in such a way that}} the bimolecular structure SLS 31 would have two binding sites for antibiotic distamycin A. The sample was exposed to chemical probing both in the presence of distamycin A and without the ligand and the accessible nucleotides were mapped. The results do not suggest the presence in the solution of two isomers with different types of loop slippage without <b>interloop</b> interactions and strongly support the formation of a unique slipped loop conformation stabilized by an additional <b>interloop</b> helix, or slipped loop structure...|$|R

HEK 293 cells in which the AMIHL splice variants were functionally expressed generated currents that were activated by hyperpolarizing voltage steps. Compared to AMIH, AMIHL cells showed pronounced differences in the voltage dependency of activation: the incorporation of 32 extra amino acids between S 4 and S 5 shifts the activation curve by + 25 mV. Intracellular cAMP made the current-activation potential still less negative and accelerated the activation more effectively than it does in AMIH cells.

METHODS: The adhesion of rat aortic VSMCs to collagen fiber bundles (CFBs), nitinol coils, and collagen-impregnated nitinol coils (CINCs) was examined by using an assay consisting of mono-pulse exposure to increasing concentrations of rat aortic VSMCs. Exposed devices were washed and examined by using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Adhesion coefficients, which quantitatively express the cell-binding quality of a surface, were determined by using a mathematical model for cell-device interactions.

To proof this claim the classical Asian disease dilemma (ADP), used by Kahneman and Tversky in 1981 to show the framing effect, was varied by degrees of personal proximity. The ADP was understood as a dilemma with a moral context. The variation of personal proximity influenced the answer behavior and led to a disappearance of the framing effect at interindividual proximity.

40|$|Abstract Background Idiopathic sclerosing {{encapsulating}} peritonitis (or abdominal cocoon) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} small bowel obstruction, especially in adult population. Diagnosis is usually incidental at laparotomy. We discuss one such rare case, outlining {{the fact that an}} intra-operative surprise diagnosis could have been facilitated by previous investigations. Case presentation A 56 year-old man presented in A&E department with small bowel ileus. He had a history of 6 similar episodes of small bowel obstruction in the past 4 years, which resolved with conservative treatment. Pre-operative work-up did not reveal any specific etiology. At laparotomy, a fibrous capsule was revealed, in which small bowel loops were encased, with the presence of <b>interloop</b> adhesions. A diagnosis of abdominal cocoon was established and extensive adhesiolysis was performed. The patient had an uneventful recovery and follow-up. Conclusion Idiopathic sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis, although rare, may be the cause of a common surgical emergency such as small bowel ileus, especially in cases with attacks of non-strangulating obstruction in the same individual. A high index of clinical suspicion may be generated by the recurrent character of small bowel ileus combined with relevant imaging findings and lack of other plausible etiologies. Clinicians must rigorously pursue a preoperative diagnosis, as it may prevent a "surprise" upon laparotomy and result in proper management. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Iron-responsive {{elements}} (IREs), {{a natural}} group of mRNA-specific sequences, bind iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) differentially and fold into hairpins [with a hexaloop (HL) CAGUGX] with helical distortions: an internal loop/bulge (IL/B) (UGC/C) or C-bulge. C-bulge iso-IREs bind IRP 2 more poorly, as oligomers (n) 28 - 30), {{and have a}} weaker signal response in vivo. Two trans-loop GC base pairs occur in the ferritin IRE (IL/B and HL) but only one in C-bulge iso-IREs (HL); metal ions and protons perturb the IL/B [Gdaniec et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 1505 - 1512]. IRE function (translation) and physical properties (Tm and accessibility to nucleases) are now compared for IL/B and C-bulge IREs and for HL mutants. Conversion of the IL/B into a C-bulge by a single deletion in the IL/B or by substituting the HL CG base pair with UA both derepressed ferritin synthesis 4 -fold in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (IRP 1 + IRP 2), confirming differences in IRP 2 binding observed for the oligomers. Since the engineered C-bulge IRE was more helical near the IL/B [Cu(phen) 2 resistant] and more stable (Tm increased) and the HL mutant was less helical near the IL/B (ribonuclease T 1 sensitive) and less stable (Tm decreased), both CG trans-loop base pairs contribute to maximum IRP 2 binding and translational regulation.

Despite the highly evolved structural loops of the IGF 2 :domain 11 binding site, affinity-enhancing AB loop mutations suggest that binding is modifiable. Here {{we examine the}} extent to which IGF 2 :domain 11 affinity, and its specificity over IGF 1, can be enhanced, and we examine the structural basis of the mechanistic and functional consequences. Domain 11 binding loop mutants were selected by yeast surface display combined with high-resolution structure-based predictions, and validated by surface plasmon resonance. We discovered previously unidentified mutations in the ligand-interacting surface binding loops (AB, CD, FG, and HI). Five combined mutations increased rigidity of the AB loop, as confirmed by NMR. When added to three independently identified CD and FG loop mutations that reduced the koff value by twofold, these mutations resulted in an overall selective 100 -fold improvement in affinity. The structural basis of the evolved affinity was improved shape complementarity established by <b>interloop</b> (AB-CD) and intraloop (FG-FG) side chain interactions. The high affinity of the combinatorial domain 11 Fc fusion proteins functioned as ligand-soluble antagonists or traps that depleted pathological IGF 2 isoforms from serum and abrogated IGF 2 -dependent signaling in vivo.

The variable domain {{of such a}} heavy-chain Ab (VHH) is fully capable of antigen (Ag) binding. Earlier analysis of 47 VHHs showed sequence features unique to VHH domains. These include the presence of characteristic amino acid substitutions in positions which, in conventional VH domains are involved in interdomain interactions, {{and the presence of}} a long third complementarity-determining region (CDR 3) which is frequently constrained by an <b>interloop</b> disulphide bond. Here, we describe a large (152) set of Lama glama VHH cDNAs. Based on amino acid sequence similarity, these and other published camelid VHHs were classified into four subfamilies. Three subfamilies are absent in dromedaries, which have been the primary source of VHHs thus far. Comparison of these subfamilies to conventional VH regions reveals new features characteristic of VHHs and shows that many features earlier regarded as characteristic of VHHs in general are actually subfamily specific. A long CDR 3 with a concomitant putative additional disulphide bond is only observed in two VHH subfamilies. Furthermore, we identified new VHH-characteristic residues at positions forming interdomain sites in conventional VH domains. The VHH subfamilies also differ from each other and conventional VH domains in the canonical structure of CDR 1 and CDR 2, mean CDR 3 length, and amino acid residue variability. Since different VHH-characteristic residues are observed in all four subfamilies, these subfamilies must have evolved independently from classical VH domains. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We have investigated the structural properties of the human telomeric repeat oligonucleotide models d(T(2) AG(3)) (4), d(G(3) T(2) A) (3) G(3), and d(G(3) T(2) AG(3)) using CD, gel electrophoresis, and chemical probing techniques. The sequences d(G(3) T(2) A) (3) G(3) and d(T(2) AG(3)) (4) assume an antiparallel G quartet structure by intramolecular folding, while the sequence d(G(3) T(2) AG(3)) also adopts an antiparallel G quartet structure but by dimerization of hairpins. In all the above cases, adenines are in the loop. The TTA loops are oriented at the same end of the G tetrad stem in the case of hairpin dimer. Further, the oligonucleotide D(G(3) T(2) AG(3)) forms a higher order structure by the association of two hairpin dimers via stacking of G tetrad planes. Here we show that N- 7 of adenine in the hairpin dimer is Hoogsteen hydrogen-bonded. The partial reactivity of loop adenines with DEPC in d(T(2) AG(3)) (4) suggests that the intramolecular G quartet structure is highly polymorphic and structures with different loop orientations and topologies are formed in solution. Intra- and <b>interloop</b> hydrogen bonding schemes for the TTA loops are proposed to account for the observed diethyl pyrocarbonate reactivities of adenines. Sodium-induced G quartet structures differ from their potassium-induced counterparts not only in stability but also in loop conformation and interactions. Thus, the overall structure and stability of telomeric sequences are modulated by the cation present, loop sequence, and the number of G tracts, which might be important for the telomere function...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Solar radio type II bursts {{are rarely}} seen at {{frequencies}} {{higher than a}} few hundred MHz. Since metric type II bursts {{are thought to be}} signatures of propagating shock waves, it is of interest to know how these shocks, and the type II bursts, are formed. In particular, how are high-frequency, fragmented type II bursts created? Are there differences in shock acceleration or in the surrounding medium that could explain the differences to the "typical" metric type IIs? Methods: We analyse one unusual metric type II event in detail, with comparison to white-light, EUV, and X-ray observations. As the radio event was associated with a flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME), we investigate their connection. We then utilize numerical MHD simulations to study the shock structure induced by an erupting CME in a model corona including dense loops. Results: Our simulations show that the fragmented part of the type II burst can be formed when a coronal shock driven by a mass ejection passes through a system of dense loops overlying the active region. To produce fragmented emission, the conditions for plasma emission have to be more favourable inside the loop than in the <b>interloop</b> area. The obvious hypothesis, consistent with our simulation model, is that the shock strength decreases significantly in the space between the denser loops. The later, more typical type II burst appears when the shock exits the dense loop system and finally, outside the active region, the type II burst dies out when the changing geometry no longer favours the electron shock-acceleration.

40|$|Sequence repeats constituting the {{telomeric}} {{regions of}} chromosomes {{are known to}} adopt a variety of unusual structures, consisting of a G tetraplex stem and short stretches of thymines or thymines and adenines forming loops over the stem. Detailed model building and molecular mechanics studies {{have been carried out}} for these telomeric sequences to elucidate different types of loop orientations and possible conformations of thymines in the loop. The model building studies indicate that a minimum of two thymines have to be interspersed between guanine stretches to form folded-back structures with loops across adjacent strands in a G tetraplex (both over the small as well as large groove), while the minimum number of thymines required to build a loop across the diagonal strands in a G tetraplex is three. For two repeat sequences, these hairpins, resulting from different types of folding, can dimerize in three distinct ways i. e., with loops across adjacent strands and on same side, with loops across adjacent strands and on opposite sides, and with loops across diagonal strands and on opposite sides to form hairpin dimer structures. Energy minimization studies indicate that all possible hairpin dimers have very similar total energy values, though different structures are stabilized by different types of interactions. When the two loops are on the same side, in the hairpin dimer structures of $d(G_ 4 T_nG_ 4) $, the thymines form favorably stacked tetrads in the loop region and there is <b>interloop</b> hydrogen bonding involving two hydrogen bonds for each thymine-thymine pair. Our molecular mechanics calculations on various folded-back as well as parallel tetraplex structures of these telomeric sequences provide a theoretical rationale for the experimentally observed feature that the presence of intervening thymine stretches stabilizes folded-back structures, while isolated stretches of guanines adopt a parallel tetraplex structure. 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

Five selected salt bridges, hallmarks of the N' subfamily (E 3 /R 54, E 12 /R 37, E 66 /R 140, D 124 /K 178 and D 205 /R 220) were disrupted in EstGtA 2 using a combinatorial alanine-scanning approach. A set of 14 (R/K→A) mutants was produced, including five single, three double, three triple and three quadruple mutants. Despite a high tolerance to non-conservative mutations for folding, all the alanine substitutions were destabilizing (decreasing T m by 5 to 14 °C). A particular combination of four substitutions exceeded this tolerance and prevents the correct folding of EstGtA 2, leading to enzyme inactivation. Although other mutants remain active at low temperatures, the accumulation {{of more than two}} mutations had a dramatic impact on EstGtA 2 activity at high temperatures suggesting an important role of these conserved salt bridge-forming residues in thermostability of lipolytic enzymes from the N' subfamily. We also identified a particular <b>interloop</b> salt bridge in EstGtA 2 (D 194 /H 222), located at position i - 2 and i - 4 residues from the catalytic Asp and His respectively which is conserved in other related bacterial lipolytic enzymes (families IV and XIII) with high tolerance to mutations and charge reversal. We investigated the role of residue identity at position 222 in controlling stability-pH dependence in EstGtA 2. The introduction of a His to Arg mutation led to increase thermostability under alkaline pH. Our results suggest primary targets for optimization of EstGtA 2 for specific biotechnological purposes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: TAARs (trace amine-associated receptors) {{are among}} the {{principal}} receptors expressed by the olfactory epithelium. We used the recent BROAD Institute release of the genome sequences of five representative fishes of the cichlid family to establish the complete TAAR repertoires of these species and to compare them with five other fish TAAR repertoires. RESULTS: The genome sequences of O. niloticus, P. nyererei, H. burtoni, N. brichardi and M. zebra were analyzed by exhaustive TBLASTN searches {{with a set of}} published TAAR gene sequences used as positive bait. A second TBLASTN analysis was then performed on the candidate genes, with a set of non-TAAR class A GPCR (G protein-coupled receptors) used as negative bait. The resulting cichlid repertoire contained 44 complete TAAR genes from O. niloticus, 18 from P. nyererei, 23 from H. burtoni, 12 from N. brichardi and 20 from M. zebra, plus a number of pseudogenes, edge genes and fragments. A large proportion of these sequences (80 %) consisted of two coding exons, separated in all but two cases by an intron in the <b>interloop</b> 1 coding sequence. We constructed phylogenetic trees. These trees indicated that TAARs constitute a distinct clade, well separated from ORs (olfactory receptors) and other class A GPCRs. Also these repertoires consist of several families and subfamilies, a number of which are common to fugu, tetraodon, stickleback and medaka. Like all other TAARs identified to date, cichlid TAARs have a characteristic two-dimensional structure and contain a number of amino-acid motifs or amino acids, such cysteine, in particular conserved positions. CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about the functions of TAARs: in most cases their ligands have yet to be identified, partly because appropriate methods for such investigations have not been developed. Sequences analyses and comparisons of TAARs in several animal species, here fishes living in the same environment, should help reveal their roles and whether they are complementary to that of OR...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe syntheses, crystal structures, and {{magnetic}} properties {{of a new}} family of heterometallic Mn 40 Na 4 and homometallic Mn- 44 loop-of-loops aggregates are reported. The reactions of [Mn 3 O(O 2 CMe) (6) (py) (3) ]center dot py with 1, 3 -propanediol (pdH(2)) and 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -propanediol (mpdH(2)) {{in the presence of}} NaN 3 afforded [Mn 10 Na(mu(3) -O) (2) (O 2 CMe) (13) (pd) (6) (py) (2) ](4) (1) (4) and [Mn 10 Na(mu(3) -O) (2) (O 2 CMe) (13) (mpd) (6) (py) (H 2 O) ](4) (2) (4), respectively. Mn 40 Na 4 complexes (1) (4) and (2) (4) consist of four Mn- 10 loops linked through Na+ ions to give a supramolecular aggregate with a saddle-like topology. Magnetic characterization of compound (1) (4) showed that each Mn- 10 loop has an S = 4 ground-state spin and displays frequency-dependent in-phase and out-of-phase ac susceptibility signals. It also exhibits hysteresis loops that, however, are not typical of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) due to the existence of <b>interloop</b> interactions between the neighboring Mn- 10 units of (1) (4) through the diamagnetic Na+ ions, and also intermolecular interactions between different Mn 40 Na 4 aggregates. The magnetically discrete Mn- 44 analogue was targeted with high priority and finally prepared from the reaction of [Mn 3 O(O 2 CMe) (6) (py) (3) ]center dot py with pdH(2) in the presence of Mn(ClO 4) (2) center dot 6 H(2) O. The loop-of-loops structure of [Mn- 44 (mu(3) -O) (8) (O 2 CMe) (52) (pd) (24) (py) (8) ](ClO 4) (OH) (3) (3) is essentially identical to those of (1) (4) and (2) (4), with the most significant difference being that the four Na+ ions of (1) (4) and (2) (4) have been replaced with Mn 2 + ions. Compound 3 is thus best described magnetically as a Mn- 44 cluster. In accord with this description and the stronger exchange coupling between the four Mn- 10 loops expected through the connecting Mn 2 + ions, magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that 3 has an S = 6 ground-state spin and displays frequency-dependent in-phase and out-of-phase ac signals. Magnetization vs dc field sweeps on single-crystals of 3 displayed scan rate- and temperature-dependent hysteresis loops confirming that complex 3 is a new SMM, and is thus the second largest Mn cluster and SMM reported to date...|$|R

Area of Dijkot consists of above than 700 kanal. It is situated on Sumandri road, 26 km from Faisalabad GPS coordinates (latitude31.216700 and longitude 72.992000). Distance of MAKKAH from Dijkot is 3460.44 km. Qibla is located on the degree of 259.924023 from North clockwise.In the early ages it was called (STATE OF DITCHKOT) and where the town was situated, now there is a graveyard consisting 95 kanal and 13 marla. The word Dijkot belongs to local language word ?Ditch? which means fort or a city inside the fort.Ditch was a famous warrior tribe of the area. 1st time the city was destroyed, as the history shows, in 326 BC when Deputy Commander of the great Alexander attacked this state. As a result, few people were remained lived. They rehabilitated the city again. Then the CHUNDAR GUPT MORIA (322 BC -316BC) gave the importance to this town. In 712 AD Muhammad bin Qasim attacked the Sindh and reached to the Chiniot and probably he was arrested from this area. In 1460 the tribes of surrounding of Ditchkot attacked the state and once again the state was completely destroyed. For long time the area could not be rehabilitated. Then a saint Baba Sher Shah lived on the south of this old state. Then a new city began to develop during the Sher Shah Soori time. In the beginning of twentieth century Government High School and in 1908 Police station was established in Dijkot. city.Famous personalities of Dijkot Ch.Umar Hayat Gill was the founder of Grain Market(Trader & Donator)He was a great lover and follower of Islam,Malik Ashgar (Nazim of Dijkot),Doctor Ihsan Ul Haq (World Bank Member), Prof.Dr.S.M.Saeed Shah,first PhD Civil Engg.(UK) of Dijkot, Professor CEWRE UET Lahore.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The hairpin ribozyme is a small catalytic RNA originally found in the negative strand of the tobacco ringspot virus. It possesses a unique four-arm RNA structure containing four helices (helices 1 - 4) and five loops (loops 1 - 5), which form two independently folding domains, labeled loop A and loop B. Divalent metal ions are thought to bind in specific sites within the structure and promote ribozyme folding, substrate binding, and cleavage. The goals of the present studies are to further clarify the metal ion interactions that are required by the hairpin ribozyme for both structural and catalytic purposes. Thermal denaturation studies were carried out in an effort to elucidate unfolding pathways and study the Mg?? dependence of these unfolding events. Examination of the melting profile indicates that the hairpin ribozyme unfolds in three major transitions. In the full hairpin the two loops unfold independently with loop A unfolding before loop B. No transitions have been correlated to unfolding of tertiary interactions between the loops. Results were confirmed with a hairpin construct known to lack <b>interloop</b> contacts. Hairpin activity has been characterized by measuring the cleavage rates and dependence on both Mg?? and Mn?? under several different buffer conditions. Apparent affinities for sites relevant to catalysis are ~ 4 mM for Mn?? and ~ 10 mM for Mg?? in 0. 1 M NaCl. Biphasic rate behavior was observed, suggesting multiple conformations of hairpin ribozyme. Rates were performed in the presence of urea in an attempt to stabilize the correctly folded hairpin RNA. Rates of cleavage showed a maximum 1 M urea. Mg?? dependence was not affected by addition of urea. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to obtain a direct measurement of the numbers and affinities of Mn?? ions that bind to the hairpin ribozyme and the separated loop A and loop B constructs. These affinities (K[] = 50 []M in 0. 1 M NaCl) all appear to be higher than predicted for purely nonspecific interactions (K[] ~ 147 []M) (Vogt, unpublished). The number of Mn?? bound in both loop A-d 14 and loop B are each approximately half those found for the complete hairpin ribozyme, suggesting few new sites are created by hairpin folding...|$|R
