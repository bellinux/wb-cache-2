5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is a much}} more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> a fairly short distance, close to the ground, before it alights, whereas its {{relative}} is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.|$|E

5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E
5|$|BA CityFlyer, {{a wholly}} owned subsidiary, offers flights from its base at London City Airport to 23 {{destinations}} throughout Europe. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> 17 Embraer E-170/E-190 aircraft and two leased Saab 2000. The airline focuses on serving the financial market, {{though it has}} recently expanded into the leisure market, offering routes to Ibiza, Palma and Venice.

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed {{dead trees}} to observe {{surrounding}} terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, {{in what is}} called the dihedral position. The flight of the greater yellow-headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.|$|E
5|$|Though Q goads Picard into {{punishing}} the Bandi, Picard refuses, instead ordering the Enterprise {{to fire a}} vivifying energy beam onto Farpoint after the station is evacuated. The beam allows the land-bound creature to transform back into its jellyfish-like form, and <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> into orbit to join its fellow being. As the crew watches the reunion of the alien creatures, Q reluctantly tells Picard that they have succeeded in their test, but hints that they will meet again.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
5|$|During migration, {{the song}} thrush travels mainly {{at night with}} a strong and direct flight action. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short {{crossings}} (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, {{but the majority of}} birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as <b>it</b> <b>flies.</b> Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E

50|$|It was {{reformed}} at Duxford on 1 September 1946, by renumbering No. 165 Squadron RAF, initially with Spitfires. The following northern spring, {{the squadron}} converted to Meteors, which <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> {{for six years}} before reequipping with Sabres. At RAF Linton-on-Ouse in March 1956 it acquired Hawker Hunters, which <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> before being disbanded again on 30 September 1960 at RAF Acklington.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) discovers a bat in the ceiling. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> {{through the}} office, sending the {{employees}} scurrying for cover. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Karen Filippelli exploit Dwight's paranoia, and pretend that Jim was bitten by the bat and {{is turning into}} a vampire. Jim calls animal control, but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5:00 passes and the other employees go home, save Meredith who continues {{to hide in the}} breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after it lands on Meredith's head.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse {{rolls over}} the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind takes hold of the comic so that <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The next morning, the three boys reflect on how their inability to share led to the destruction of the comic, although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for the predator to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E

5|$|The family finds {{work in a}} fish-gutting {{factory in}} Osaka, where they notice a TV game show called The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show. They go on it, telling the host Wink that they wish for plane tickets to Springfield. In order to get them, they go through {{physical}} torture (particularly Homer), then must pick them up from a rickety bridge over an active volcano. Lisa is {{able to get the}} tickets, but Wink breaks the bridge and the whole family falls into the volcano, which is actually orangeade with lots of wasabi added. As the Simpsons leave Japan, their plane is briefly confronted by four giant monsters – Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and Rodan before <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> off on the journey to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|This {{cockatoo}} usually lays {{a clutch}} of one to two eggs. It generally takes 28 to 29 days for the female to incubate the eggs, and the young fledge ten to eleven weeks after hatching. The young will stay with the family until the next breeding season, and sometimes even longer. The family leaves the nesting site after the young fledge until the following year. Carnaby's black cockatoo forms flocks when not breeding, with birds in drier habitats usually being more migratory than those in wetter ones. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> with deep and slow wingbeats, generally high above trees. Seeds of plants of the families Proteaceae and, to a lesser extent, Myrtaceae form {{a large part of}} its diet.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually found in small groups, {{although}} substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks well, without waddling, {{and although it}} normally feeds by upending, it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other whistling ducks. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds {{during the day and}} at night in fairly large flocks, often with other whistling duck species, but rests or sleeps in smaller groups {{in the middle of the}} day. They are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off in alarm, they often shake their head sideways.|$|E
