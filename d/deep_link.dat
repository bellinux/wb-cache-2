5|$|Political {{activism}} in the Rhondda has a <b>deep</b> <b>link</b> with trade unions and the socialist movement but was initially slow to develop. In the 1870s the Amalgamated Association of Miners won support, but {{was destroyed by}} employer hostility. The Cambrian Miners’ Association was more successful {{and the creation of}} the South Wales Miners' Federation after the 1898 coal strike, gave the South Wales miners a reputation for militancy, in which the Rhondda Valley played its part. As part of the Redistribution Act of 1885 the Rhondda was granted its first seat in Parliament which was won by the moderate trade union leader William Abraham, who was notably the only working-class member elected in Wales. Socialism and syndicalism ideals grew throughout the 20th century and industrial struggle reached a crescendo in the 1910-11 Tonypandy Riots. A year later Tonypandy saw the publication of Noah Ablett’s pamphlet The Miners' Next Step. Tonypandy was at the centre of further public disorder when, on 11 June 1936 at Dewinton Field, a large group of people gathered to confront the open-air address by Tommy Moran, propaganda officer of the British Union of Fascists. The crowd, recorded as between 2,000 and 6,000 strong, turned violent and police were forced to protect Moran's Blackshirt bodyguard. Seven local people were arrested.|$|E

40|$|Unlike the Web {{where each}} web page has a global URL to reach, a {{specific}} "content page" inside a mobile app cannot be opened unless the user explores the app with several operations from the landing page. Recently, <b>deep</b> <b>links</b> have been advocated by major companies to enable targeting and opening a specific page of an app externally with an accessible {{uniform resource identifier}} (URI). To empirically investigate {{the state of the}} practice on adopting <b>deep</b> <b>links,</b> in this article, we present the largest empirical study of <b>deep</b> <b>links</b> over 20, 000 Android apps, and find that <b>deep</b> <b>links</b> do not get wide adoption among current Android apps, and non-trivial manual efforts are required for app developers to support <b>deep</b> <b>links.</b> To address such an issue, we propose the Aladdin approach and supporting tool to release <b>deep</b> <b>links</b> to access arbitrary location of existing apps. Aladdin instantiates our novel cooperative framework to synergically combine static analysis and dynamic analysis while minimally engaging developers to provide inputs to the framework for automation, without requiring any coding efforts or additional deployment efforts.

50|$|Web site {{owners who}} don't want search engines to <b>deep</b> <b>link,</b> or want them only to index {{specific}} pages can request so using the Robots Exclusion Standard (robots.txt file). People who favor deep linking often feel that content owners who don't provide a robots.txt file are implying by default {{that they do}} not object to deep linking either by search engines or others. People against deep linking often claim that content owners may be unaware of the Robots Exclusion Standard or may not use robots.txt for other reasons. Sites other than search engines can also <b>deep</b> <b>link</b> to content on other sites, so some question the relevance of the Robots Exclusion Standard to controversies about Deep Linking. The Robots Exclusion Standard does not programmatically enforce its directives so it does not prevent search engines and others who do not follow polite conventions from deep linking.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Links {{are found}} {{everywhere}} {{and they are}} these what creates the World Wide Web. Possibility to use the whole network {{is the essence of}} polycentric decentralized structure of the Internet. The user may quickly and easily surf web sites. The search engines reach editorial texts and photos presented in the news through <b>deep</b> <b>links.</b> Skipping the home page of a given web site normally means noting lower amount of visits. The amount of visits has an impact on the income from adverts. Problem of an effective defense against unwanted <b>deep</b> <b>links</b> occurs especially in the media where generally contents are protected by copyright. Many e-commerce enterprises {{want to be on the}} highest position in the results of searching. Search engines copy up-to-date press news or directly refers to them.
