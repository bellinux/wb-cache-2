40|$|This paper {{examines}} the credit market {{to determine whether}} slow growth was caused by problems in credit markets as many scholars have suggested. In particular, {{the question of how}} a rise in interest rates affects behaviors of the banks and the firms, and how and to what extent credit restriction affects sales and growth were investigated. The model developed in the paper suggests that when loan terms are not restricted, lenders will statistically discriminate against small firms. In other words lenders will charge small firms higher interest rates. When loan contract terms are restricted, lenders might ration credit buy not lending to small firms that have higher risks. However, when interest rates are high, large firms might self-select out of the loan markets because they have other alternatives to cope with credit problem. The analysis from Thai data <b>during</b> <b>the</b> financial <b>crisis</b> reveals that Thailand faced mild credit rationing problems before <b>the</b> <b>crises.</b> <b>The</b> problem became stronger, but not severe, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>crises.</b> Trade credit-borrowing ratio and the results from our regression equation suggest that the self-selection problem was more pronounced <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>crises.</b> However, even though problems of credit rationing and adverse selection did occur, the importance of trade credits and borrowing on sales declined <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>crises...</b>|$|R

(b) Germany’s progressive role <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Ukraine <b>Crisis</b> is due to its strong economic position in the EU.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} aggregate labour dynamics <b>during</b> <b>the</b> {{global financial}} <b>crisis</b> in Japan {{and the role}} of nonstandard work using micro data. The analysis proceeds in two steps. First, using comprehensive establishment-level datasets for the period 1991 - 2009, it provides a detailed portrait of the adjustment behaviour of establishments at the micro level. Second, it compares aggregate labour market dynamics <b>during</b> <b>the</b> global financial <b>crisis</b> with that observed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1997 <b>crisis</b> and decomposes <b>the</b> observed differences into components that can be attributed to changes in the micro-adjustment behaviour of Japanese establishments, changes in the incidence of non-standard work and changes in the distribution of shocks across establishments. It finds that the incidence of non-standard work has increased considerably, worker turnover is much higher among non-standard than standard workers and adjustments in working-time are less important for non-standard workers. Counterfactual simulations suggest that <b>the</b> employment response <b>during</b> <b>the</b> global <b>crisis</b> would have been smaller if the incidence of non-standard work remained at <b>the</b> level observed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1997 <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> relatively small employment response observed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> global financial <b>crisis</b> is therefore driven by factors others than the increase in the incidence of non-standard work...|$|R
