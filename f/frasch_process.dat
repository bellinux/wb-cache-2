2500|$|From 1960 to 2000, sulfur was mined by the <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> {{from the}} caprock of a salt dome at the Main Pass 299 mine, {{offshore}} Louisiana. [...] A total of 34 million short tons of sulfur were recovered before the mine was closed; salt was also recovered.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>Frasch</b> <b>process,</b> {{superheated}} {{water is}} {{pumped into the}} sulfur deposit; the sulfur melts and is extracted. The <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> is able to produce high purity sulfur.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> can be {{used for}} {{deposits}} 50-800 meters deep. 3-38 cubic meters of superheated water are required to produce every tonne of sulfur, and the associated energy cost is significant. A working demonstration model of the <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> suitable for the classroom has been described.|$|E
50|$|Brimstone Museum: A former Southern Pacific Railway depot {{built in}} 1915 to {{facilitate}} the moving of passengers and freight for the Sulfur mines. The depot was discontinued in the early 1970's and in 1975 was sold to the Sulphur Association of Commerce, on condition that it be moved for safety reasons, and was moved to a location near Frasch Park and renovated. Building restoration was completed and the dedication ceremony {{took place on the}} nation's 200th birthday, July 4, 1976. The museum highlights includes a permanent exhibit on the history of Sulphur, and is also the only museum in the United States to exhibit historical information on the <b>Frasch</b> mining <b>process.</b> The building was moved a second time, to 900 S. Huntington street, providing more visibility resulting in an increase in visitors, and on December 5th of 2005 was transferred to the Brimstone Historical Society. Aside from the permanent exhibits the museum provides exhibits of local interest including art and and other historical artifacts from the history of the city.|$|R

50|$|The caprock {{above the}} salt domes is {{sometimes}} {{the site of}} deposits of native sulfur, which is recovered by the <b>Frasch</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1867, {{elemental}} sulfur {{was discovered}} in underground deposits in Louisiana and Texas. The highly successful <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> was developed to extract this resource.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately for Frasch, {{he was too}} {{far ahead}} of his time. He had filed his {{original}} three patents for the <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process</b> back in 1891. At the time, patents lasted 17 years. His original patents thus expired in 1908. Competitors such as the Freeport Sulphur Company quickly emerged and began to use the <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process</b> to extract sulfur from other nearby salt dome sites. The Union Sulphur Company {{tried to stop the}} Freeport Sulphur Company by suing on the basis of later patents that improved upon the original patents. The Delaware District Court largely sided with the Union Sulphur Co. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed the district court, concluding that the new patents were not really new inventions, but merely extensions of the original expired patents. Union Sulphur appealed to the Supreme Court, which declined to review the Third Circuit opinion. The competitors were free to use the <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process.</b>|$|E
50|$|By 1876 Rockefeller's Standard Oil had a near {{industry}} monopoly and Severance joined as the Ohio company's treasurer. While at Standard, {{he founded}} another company, mining sulfur, {{and because it}} held the patent on the <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> it too monopolized a profitable industry.|$|E
5000|$|From 1960 to 2000, sulfur was mined by the <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> {{from the}} caprock of a salt dome at the Main Pass 299 mine, {{offshore}} Louisiana. [...] A total of 34 million short tons of sulfur were recovered before the mine was closed; salt was also recovered.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> is {{a method}} to extract sulfur from {{underground}} deposits. It is the only economic method of recovering sulfur from elemental deposits. Most of the world's sulfur was obtained this way until the late 20th century, when sulfur recovered from petroleum and gas sources (recovered sulfur) became more commonplace (see Claus process).|$|E
50|$|During {{the search}} for oil in Louisiana, near the present-day city of Sulphur, sulfur was found under a layer of 200-300 m of quicksand. All {{attempts}} {{to get to the}} sulfur with conventional mining shafts ended in disaster. Herman Frasch bought the surrounding area, but the sulfur containing area was not on his property. On October 20, 1890, he took out three patents for the <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process.</b> He then made a contract with the owners of the sulfur deposit.|$|E
50|$|The Mishraq sulphur mine {{contains}} the world's largest reserves (600 million tons). Mishraq Sulphur State Company {{was established in}} 1969, and sulphur production started late in 1971. The <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> is the method used to exploit sulphur from underground deposits at depths of 120 m-200 m. This process depends upon melting underground sulphur by injecting hot water into rock sulphur containing layers using special wells. Then melted sulphur is expelled from those wells {{with the assistance of}} compressed air.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>Frasch</b> <b>process,</b> three {{concentric}} {{tubes are}} {{introduced into the}} sulfur deposit. Superheated water (443k,165 °C, 2.5-3 MPa) is injected into the deposit via the outermost tube. Sulfur (m.p. 115 °C) melts and flows into the middle tube. Water pressure alone is unable to force the sulfur into the surface due to the molten sulfur's greater density, so hot air is introduced via the innermost tube to froth the sulfur, making it less dense, and pushing it to the surface.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> {{was first}} used in 1894 in Louisiana, {{and in the early}} 1900s came into wide use in mining native sulfur deposits, {{especially}} deposits in the caprock of salt domes along the Gulf Coast of the United States. Frasch mining dominated sulfur mining in the U.S. for most of the 20th century, for many years providing more than 80 percent of the sulfur production. The last U.S. Frasch mine shut down in 2000, although the process is still used in other countries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{city was}} a major center for the mining and {{processing}} of sulphur and sulphuric acid. However, due to declining profitability, its mines have closed. The mine in Piaseczno was closed first, followed by the Machów mine (after 40 years of working [...] - [...] {{it had been the}} biggest open-cast sulphur mine in Europe), and finally the Jeziórko mine in the 1990s. The Jeziórko mine stayed open as long as it did because of the introduction of the modern <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> of sulphur extraction.|$|E
50|$|The Union Sulphur Company was an American sulfur mining {{corporation}} {{founded in}} 1896 by the famous inventor Herman Frasch. It utilized the <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process</b> to extract previously inaccessible sulfur deposits located beneath swampland in Louisiana. The Union Sulphur Company dominated the world sulfur market until its patents expired in 1908. Its success {{led to the}} development of the present-day city of Sulphur, Louisiana. After its sulfur patents expired, the company transitioned into oil and natural gas production and was renamed the Union Sulphur & Oil Company and later the Union Oil & Gas Corporation.|$|E
50|$|The Sulphur {{institute}} {{was founded}} in 1960, initially working with companies involved in the mining of sulfur using the <b>Frasch</b> <b>process.</b> With the increase of the Claus process for extracting sulfur from natural gas and oil, TSI's members now include multinational energy companies. The Sulphur Institute connects these sulfur producers with sulfur's largest consumer markets (fertilzers and construction materials), transporters, traders, and service providers. Today, The Sulphur Institute's member companies include a host of companies from five continents involved with producing, consuming, trading, adding value, or supplying services to the sulfur industry.|$|E
5000|$|In 1867, miners {{discovered}} sulfur in the caprock of a {{salt dome}} in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, {{but it was}} beneath quicksand, which prevented mining. In 1894 the German-born American chemist, Herman Frasch (1852-1914), devised his Frasch method of sulfur removal using pipes to bypass the quicksand. [...] The process proved successful, on December 24, 1894, when the first molten sulfur {{was brought to the}} surface. However, the high cost of fuel needed to heat the water made the process uneconomic until the 1901 discovery of the Spindletop oil field in Texas provided cheap fuel oil to the region. [...] The <b>Frasch</b> <b>process</b> began economic production at Sulphur Mines, Louisiana in 1903.|$|E
5000|$|The name Port Sulphur {{derives from}} the Freeport Sulphur Company in the early 1930s, when it set up logistics, refining, storage and {{shipping}} operations to support its <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process</b> sulphur mine at Lake Grande Ecaille, located 10 {{miles west of the}} town in the nearby marsh. The Grande Ecaille mine was the largest sulphur deposit in the world when it began operation in 1933, and remained in production until 1978. Over time, as other discoveries were made, The Freeport Sulphur Company also used the Port Sulphur facility to support their other <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process</b> sulphur mines located at Garden Island Bay, LA; Lake Pelto, LA; Caillou Island, LA; a land based mine at Chacahoula, LA; The first offshore sulphur mines at Grand Isle, LA and Caminada Pass, LA; and a large operation 50 miles offshore from the Mississippi River Delta in 300 feet of water, at Main Pass Block 299 in the Gulf of Mexico. The facility was also used to process and ship recovered sulphur obtained by oil and gas refining. The terminal was able to filter and store liquid hot molten sulphur in large insulated heated tanks, and [...] "vat" [...] liquid sulphur into acres of long term dry storage by forming blocks of bright yellow sulphur by spraying molten sulphur into metal forms on the ground and allowing to cool. The site is valuable because of its proximity to sulphur producing areas near the Gulf of Mexico, its docking sites along the Mississippi River and back bay marsh.|$|E
5000|$|The American Sulfur Company {{was not a}} fly-by-night venture, but a {{credible}} corporation backed by Abram Hewitt, Edward Cooper and Hamilton McKown Twombly. It had spent $300,000 to $350,000 to buy the land and attempt to extract the sulfur. [...] Frasch met with Hewitt and proposed a simple 50/50 deal combining their property with his process. Hewitt wanted greater assurances about the unproven extraction process, and Frasch went to work with engineers such as Jacques Toniette and Jacob Hoffman. On a day in late December 1894, the <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process</b> succeeded. Compressed air forced pure molten sulfur up from beneath the bayou, and within 15 minutes the 40 barrels on hand to collect it were full.|$|E
50|$|In 1890, the German {{immigrant}} Herman Frasch invented and patented the <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process</b> {{of mining}} sulfur, using concentric pipes to pump superheated {{water into the}} ground, liquefy the mineral, and force the liquid to the surface with compressed air. The first molten sulfur {{was brought to the}} surface on Christmas Eve of 1894. Sulfur soon began to be mined on an industrial scale, with the molten mineral allowed to solidify and dry in enormous vats 100 by 400 feet, then blasted and hauled by rail to the Sabine River for shipment. Frasch's invention greatly facilitated sulfur mining, and the Union Sulphur Company, a joint venture of Dr. Frasch and the American Sulphur Company that owned the land, sparked a period of booming growth in the decades that followed.|$|E
50|$|Elemental sulfur {{was once}} {{extracted}} from salt domes where it sometimes occurs in nearly pure form, but this method has been obsolete {{since the late}} 20th century. Today's sulfur production is as a side product of other industrial processes such as oil refining; in these processes, sulfur often occurs as undesired or detrimental compounds that are extracted and converted to elemental sulfur. As a mineral, native sulfur under salt domes {{is thought to be}} a fossil mineral resource, produced by the action of ancient bacteria on sulfate deposits. It was removed from such salt-dome mines mainly by the <b>Frasch</b> <b>process.</b> In this method, superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur, and then compressed air returned the 99.5% pure melted product to the surface. Throughout the 20th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur that required no further purification. Due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working them, this process for mining sulfur has not been employed in a major way anywhere in the world since 2002.|$|E
50|$|As Squire's wealth grew, {{and he made}} {{business}} connections {{through his}} Standard Oil work, he began to develop {{a wide range of}} other business interests. Chemical engineer Herman Frasch was hard at work on a process to remove sulfur from sour crude oil. Solar Refining Co. was founded to utilize the process Frasch developed, which led to Squire's directorship with Solar. Frasch become Standard Oil's first director of research and development in 1888. Frasch next began work on a process to cheaply manufacture soda ash. The petroleum industry consumed large amounts of soda ash, which was used to decalcify drilling fluids. In 1892, Frasch established the <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process</b> Soda Company, with Squire as vice president. Salt was a major component of soda ash production, and in 1882 and 1883 Frash had secured patents on new methods to crystallize and grain salt from a brine solution. Frasch, Frank Rockefeller, and Squire formed the United Salt Company in 1892 as well, but a bad fire in 1894 and financial losses led to the sale of the firm to the National Salt Company in 1899. He became a director of National Salt in 1900.|$|E
50|$|Port Sulphur was {{originally}} a typical company town, with its residents and civic life {{closely tied to}} the Freeport Sulphur Company. As time went by,the company divested itself of much of the town property and governance, it became more of a regular town with private individual land ownership. As the number of employees at the site dwindled, the Freeport Company became less important in everyday life and economic activity. At some point in time, most of the company-owned land not necessary for the sulphur operation was transferred to Plaquemines Parish or sold to private owners. The economic fortunes of the Freeport Sulphur Company declined during the 1980s and 1990s, resulting from its merger with McMoRan Exploration, an oil and gas company that neglected the sulphur operations. In the early 2000s Freeport Sulphur shut down operations, as the price of sulphur dropped too low because large amounts of sulphur recovered during petroleum refining and from Canadian natural gas exploration were dumped on the international sulphur market. With inexpensive recovered sulphur in large supply, the large scale and expensive <b>Frasch</b> <b>Process</b> sulphur mining and storage operations proved to be uneconomical and were discontinued. The Freeport-McMoRan Port Sulphur facility was closed and sold. Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of {{what was left of the}} sulphur facility in August 2005, with a few buildings remaining. With the closing of Freeport-McMoRan Sulphur, the town has been seeking another economic identity. The large brick Plaquemines Parish Government building located on LA.HWY 23 in town next to the former Freeport property {{was originally}} the Freeport Sulphur Company administration building. The Port Sulphur school and other buildings located around the Civic Drive area were originally located on company property and are oriented towards the former Freeport Property. Much of the original town buildings were sold or removed, and much of the original town site sits mostly vacant empty land, with a large stand of oak trees on the former Freeport Property next to the Plaquemines Government building. An historical marker about Port Sulphur is located in front of the Government Building. The golf course land located on LA.HWY 23, just south of the former Freeport property, was originally a neighborhood of the company townsite. The land was later donated to the Plaquemines Parish Government.|$|E
