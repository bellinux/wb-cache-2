40|$|Few {{will argue}} against {{the view that}} price {{stability}} {{plays an important role}} in promoting medium- to long-term economic growth. However, a consensus has yet to be gained as to how we should define price stability in the context of monetary policy operations and a desirable rate of inflation.

This paper reexamines the definition of price stability from the practical viewpoint of monetary policy implementation, and discusses the usefulness of a limited influence estimator (LIE) as an indicator to trace the underlying <b>inflation</b> <b>trend.</b> LIE is deemed useful in adjusting for the effects of various temporary shocks, and in gauging the underlying trend in price changes.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the evidence of}} “near-rationality,” as described by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (2000). Using detailed surveys of household inflation expectations for the United States and Sweden, {{we find that the}} data are generally unsupportive of the near-rationality hypothesis. However, we document that household inflation expectations tend to settle around discrete and largely fixed “focal points,” suggesting that both U. S. and Swedish households gauge inflation prospects in rather broad, qualitative terms. Moreover, the combination of a low-inflation environment and an inflation target in Sweden has been accompanied by a disproportionately high proportion of Swedish households expecting no inflation. However, a similar low <b>inflation</b> <b>trend</b> in the United States, which does not have an explicit inflation target, reveals no such rise in the proportion of households expecting no inflation. This observation suggests that the way the central bank communicates its inflation objective may influence inflation expectations independently of the <b>inflation</b> <b>trend</b> it actually pursues.

Thus, our model allows for the possibilities that long-run forecasts taken from surveys can be equated with <b>trend</b> <b>inflation,</b> that the two are completely unrelated, or anything in between.

The aim is to analyze <b>inflation</b> <b>trends</b> in the EU {{in the context of}} current economic crisis and monetary regimes. The first theoretical chapter summarizes theoretical basis, types, causes and consequences of inflation, methods of measurement and principles of the inflation targeting regime. The second chapter examines development of inflation during this period based on Eurostat's data about consumer prices measured by harmonized indices of consumer prices. This paper does not analyze each of twenty seven member countries.

40|$|The New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) {{asserts that}} {{inflation}} depends on expectations of real marginal costs, but empirical {{research has shown}} that purely forward-looking versions of the model generate too little inflation persistence. In this paper, we offer a resolution of the persistence problem. We hypothesize that inflation is highly persistent because of drift in trend inflation, a feature that many versions of the NKPC neglect. We derive a version of the NKPC as a log-linear approximation around a time-varying <b>inflation</b> <b>trend</b> and examine whether it explains deviations of inflation from that trend. We estimate the NKPC parameters jointly with those that define the <b>inflation</b> <b>trend</b> by estimating a vector autoregression with drifting coefficients and volatilities; the autoregressive parameters are constrained to satisfy the restrictions imposed by the NKPC.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the evidence of}} â€œnear-rationalityâ€ in household inflation expectations, as described by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (2000), hereafter ADP. According to ADP, the economic incentive to anticipate inflation varies from agent to agent, and as inflation falls, some agents stop trying to accurately predict inflation (â€œhyper-rationalâ€) and either underweight it or, in the extreme, ignore it altogether (â€œnearly rationalâ€). A key implication of the ADP model is that a particular rate of inflation minimizes unemployment in the long-run. In this paper, we bring the idea described by ADP to detailed survey data on household inflation expectations for the U. S. and Sweden, two countries where the existence of ADP-type near-rationality has been identified in earlier research. We find that the survey data do not, in general, support the specific form of near-rationality suggested by ADP. However, we also show that inflation expectations are not distributed across households in a smooth and continuous way. Rather, households appear to hold inflation expectations that tend to discrete, and largely fixed â€œfocal points,â€ suggesting that a substantial share of both Swedish and U. S. households do not form precise inflation predictions, but instead gauge inflation prospects in rather qualitative terms. We further document that in Sweden, {{the combination of a}} low inflation environment, coupled with an inflation target, has been accompanied by a disproportionately high proportion of households reporting the expectation of no inflation, consistent with one type of â€œnearly rationalâ€ behavior posited by ADP. However, a similarly low <b>inflation</b> <b>trend</b> in the U. S., which does not have an explicit inflation target, reveals no such rise in the proportion of households expecting no inflation.
