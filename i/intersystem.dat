25|$|The {{heavy metal}} atom at {{the centre of}} these {{complexes}} exhibits strong spin-orbit coupling, facilitating <b>intersystem</b> crossing between singlet and triplet states. By using these phosphorescent materials, both singlet and triplet excitons {{will be able to}} decay radiatively, hence improving the internal quantum efficiency of the device compared to a standard pleaded where only the singlet states will contribute to emission of light.|$|E
25|$|As {{electrons}} and holes are fermions with half integer spin, an exciton may {{either be in}} a singlet state or a triplet state {{depending on how the}} spins of the electron and hole have been combined. Statistically three triplet excitons will be formed for each singlet exciton. Decay from triplet states (phosphorescence) is spin forbidden, increasing the timescale of the transition and limiting the internal efficiency of fluorescent devices. Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes make use of spin–orbit interactions to facilitate <b>intersystem</b> crossing between singlet and triplet states, thus obtaining emission from both singlet and triplet states and improving the internal efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{absorption}} of a photon causes an electron to be excited into a singlet state of the Q band. The excited state undergoes an <b>intersystem</b> crossing from the singlet state to a triplet state {{in which there are}} two electrons with parallel spin. This species is, in effect, a free radical, and is very reactive and allows an electron to be transferred to acceptors that are adjacent to the chlorophyll in the chloroplast. In the process chlorophyll is oxidized. Later in the photosynthetic cycle, chlorophyll is reduced back again. This reduction ultimately draws electrons from water, yielding molecular oxygen as a final oxidation product.|$|E
5000|$|By 2000, the {{middleware}} vendor <b>InterSystems</b> {{had become}} the dominant player in the MUMPS market with the purchase of several other vendors. Initially they acquired DataTree Inc. in the early 1990s. And, on December 30, 1995, <b>InterSystems</b> acquired the DSM product line from DEC. <b>InterSystems</b> consolidated these products into a single product line, branding them, on several hardware platforms, as OpenM. In 1997, <b>InterSystems</b> launched a new product named Caché. This was based on their ISM product, but with influences from the other implementations. Micronetics Design Corporation assets were also acquired by <b>InterSystems</b> on June 21, 1998. <b>InterSystems</b> remains the dominant MUMPS vendor, selling Caché to MUMPS developers who write applications {{for a variety of}} operating systems.|$|R

50|$|<b>InterSystems</b> Corporation is {{a privately}} held vendor of {{software}} systems and technology for high-performance database management, rapid application development, integration, and healthcare information systems. The vendor's products are the <b>InterSystems</b> Caché DBMS and application development environment, the Ensemble integration platform, DeepSee embedded real-time business intelligence, and the HealthShare healthcare informatics platform. <b>InterSystems</b> also sells the TrakCare healthcare information system outside the United States.|$|R
25|$|One {{insight into}} the {{reaction}} mechanism for this photoreaction is given by an isotope scrambling experiment. The 6 vinylic protons in barrelene 1 are more acidic than the two bridgehead protons and therefore they can be replaced by deuterium with N-deuteriocyclohexylamide. Photolysis of 2 results in the initial formation of an biradical intermediate with a cyclopropane ring formed. This product rearranges to a second intermediate with a more favorable allylic radical as two mesomers. <b>Intersystem</b> crossing and radical recombination results in equal quantities of semibullvalenes 3 and 4. The new proton distribution with allylic, vinylic and cyclopropanyl protons determined with proton NMR confirms this model. As noted, the conversion of barrelene to semibullvalene is a di-pi-methane rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|The {{generation}} of CIDNP {{in a typical}} photochemical system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and {{approximately half of the}} molecules undergo <b>intersystem</b> crossing into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The actual kinetics are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH dependence.|$|E

Thus, if {{the rate of}} any pathway changes, both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield will be affected.|$|E

50|$|Since 2005, {{the use of}} MUMPS {{has been}} either {{in the form of}} GT.M or <b>InterSystems</b> Caché. The latter is being aggressively marketed by <b>InterSystems</b> and has had success in {{penetrating}} new markets, such as telecommunications, in addition to existing markets. The European Space Agency announced on May 13, 2010 that it will use the <b>InterSystems</b> Caché database to support the Gaia mission. This mission aims to map the Milky Way with unprecedented precision.|$|R
5000|$|On August 14, 2008, the Boston Globe {{reported}} that <b>InterSystems</b> was filing {{a lawsuit against}} Microsoft Corporation, another tenant in its Cambridge, Mass., headquarters, seeking to prevent Microsoft from expanding in the building. <b>InterSystems</b> also {{filed a lawsuit against}} building owner Equity Office Partners, a subsidiary of the Blackstone Group, [...] "contending that it conspired with Microsoft to lease space that <b>InterSystems</b> had rights to, and sought to drive up rents in the process".|$|R
2500|$|The optical {{excitations}} conserve {{the spin}} state, {{but there is}} a high probability of the states [...] decaying non-radiatively to the singlet state , a phenomenon called <b>intersystem</b> crossing (ISC). This happens at an appreciable rate because the energy curve in function of the position of the atoms for the [...] state intersects the curve for the [...] state. Therefore, for some instant during the vibrational relaxation that the ions undergo after the excitement, it is possible for the spin to flip with little or no energy required in the transition. It {{is important to note that}} this mechanism also leads to a transition from [...] to , but the rate of this ISC is much lower than the [...] states rate, therefore this transition is indicated with a thin line. The diagram also shows the non-radiative and infrared competing decay paths between the two singlet states, and the fine splitting in the triplet states, whose differences in energy correspond to microwave frequencies.|$|E
2500|$|A type of SCO is {{affected}} by Light Induced Excited Spin State Trapping (LIESST). In this approach HS and LS states can be triggered by irradiating the sample. At low temperatures {{it is possible to}} trap compounds in the HS state - a phenomenon known as the LIESST effect. The compound can be converted back to a LS state by irradiation with a photon of different energy. Irradiation of d-d transitions of the LS metal complex or MLCT absorption bands leads to population of HS states. A good example to illustrate the LIESST effect is the complex (BF4)2. The sample was irradiated with green light at temperatures below 50 K. By doing this, a spin allowed transition is promoted which is 1A1 → 1T1. [...] However, the 1T1 excited state has a very short lifetime, decreasing the probability for the excited state to relax via a double <b>intersystem</b> crossing to reach the 5T2 HS state [...] [...] Since the HS state is spin forbidden the lifetime for this state is long, therefore it can be trapped at low temperatures. [...] Figure 17 shows a simplified Jablonski diagram for these transitions. [...] To recover the LS state, irradiation with a lower energy light is done. This promotes a transition from the HS state [...] 5T2 → 5E which allows for relaxation back to the LS state.|$|E

50|$|The firm {{eventually}} started combining features {{from these}} products into one they called OpenM. <b>InterSystems</b> launched Caché in 1997. At that time they stopped new development {{for all of}} their legacy M-based products (although the company stills supports existing customers). They launched Ensemble in 2003 and HealthShare in 2006. In 2007, <b>InterSystems</b> purchased TrakHealth, an Australian vendor of TrakCare, a modular healthcare information system based on the <b>InterSystems</b> technology. DeepSee, a real-time business intelligence system implemented in Caché, was launched in 2008. In May 2011, the firm launched Globals as a free database based on the multi-dimensional array storage technology used in Caché. In September 2011, <b>InterSystems</b> purchased Siemens Health Services (SHS) France from its Siemens parent company. SHS will operate as “InterSystems SAS”.|$|R
