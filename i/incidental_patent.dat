40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{predictors}} of stroke recurrence {{in patients with}} a high vs a low likelihood of having an <b>incidental</b> <b>patent</b> foramen ovale (PFO) {{as defined by the}} Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score. METHODS: Patients in the RoPE database with cryptogenic stroke (CS) and PFO were classified as having a probable PFO-related stroke (RoPE score of > 6, n = 647) and others (RoPE score of ≤ 6 points, n = 677). We tested 15 clinical, 5 radiologic, and 3 echocardiographic variables for associations with stroke recurrence using Cox survival models with component database as a stratification factor. An interaction with RoPE score was checked for the variables that were significant. RESULTS: Follow-up was available for 92 %, 79 %, and 57 % at 1, 2, and 3 years. Overall, a higher recurrence risk was associated with an index TIA. For all other predictors, effects were significantly different in the 2 RoPE score categories. For the low RoPE score group, but not the high RoPE score group, older age and antiplatelet (vs warfarin) treatment predicted recurrence. Conversely, echocardiographic features (septal hypermobility and a small shunt) and a prior (clinical) stroke/TIA were significant predictors in the high but not low RoPE score group. CONCLUSION: Predictors of recurrence differ when PFO relatedness is classified by the RoPE score, suggesting that patients with CS and PFO form a heterogeneous group with different stroke mechanisms. Echocardiographic features were only associated with recurrence in the high RoPE score group...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The optimal {{therapy for}} {{prevention}} of recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack {{in patients with}} cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale has not been defined. Although numerous observational studies have suggested a strong association between patent foramen ovale and cryptogenic stroke, a causal relationship has not been convincingly established {{for the majority of}} affected patients. Treatment choices include medical therapy with antiplatelet agents or vitamin K antagonists, percutaneous device closure, or open surgical repair. Whereas suture closure of an <b>incidental</b> <b>patent</b> foramen ovale is performed routinely during the course of an operation undertaken for another indication, primary surgical repair is rarely advocated in the current era. The choice between medical therapy and percutaneous device closure {{has been the subject of}} intense debate over the past several years, albeit one that has not been adequately informed by randomized, prospective clinical trial data to permit an objective comparison of the relative safety and efficacy of these respective approaches. Enrollment in clinical trials has lagged considerably despite frequent calls for participation from the US Food and Drug Administration and major professional societies. Completion and peer review of ongoing trials are critical steps to establish an evidence base from which clinicians can make informed decisions regarding the best therapy for individual patients. The present advisory strongly encourages all clinicians involved in the care of appropriate patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale—cardiologists, neurologists, internists, radiologists, and surgeons—to consider referral for enrollment in these landmark trials to expedite their completion and hel...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveLaparoscopic {{examination}} of the contralateral inguinal ring has been advocated to exclude contralateral hernia in young children. We used {{the size of the}} open internal ring and the depth of the patent processus vaginalis as a parameter to decide whether laparoscopic herniotomy was indicated. MethodsRecords of all laparoscopic procedures in children performed in a large tertiary care hospital over a 2. 5 -year period were retrospectively analysed. ResultsLaparoscopy in 346 children revealed the presence of an <b>incidental</b> asymptomatic <b>patent</b> processus vaginalis in 47 cases. Of these, 38 were present as a contralateral hernia among 171 laparoscopies for inguinal hernias. ConclusionThe presence of an incidentally detected, asymptomatic but significant-sized open internal ring is not uncommon. The authors recommend that a 1 -cm diameter and a 2 -cm depth of open internal ring be taken as a significant indication for herniotomy. The authors also emphasize that a reported incidence of contralateral patent processus vaginalis of up to 56. 2 % justifies the procedure of laparoscopic herniotomy in all children...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the scientific productivity {{of a sample}} of academic scientists {{that contribute to the}} field of Materials Science in the post-patenting period, by means of several econometric techniques suitable to treat unobserved heterogeneity, excess zeros and <b>incidental</b> truncation. Although <b>patents</b> do not alter the track of publications in the overall sample, we show this effect to be generated by two opposite effects: Materials Engineers increase their publications after patenting, whereas Materials Chemists experience a decrease. Besides, Materials Engineers who were academic inventors have a higher impact factor than their non-inventors colleagues, although the positive effect tends to vanish both for very basic publications and for serial inventions. Finally, a clearly negative effect is registered when we consider only very basic publications made by Materials Chemists. We interpret our findings as depending on different epistemologies of scientific and engineering research and discuss the implications for both university managers and policy makers.
