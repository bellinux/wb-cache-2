The advocates of privilege used language about the workers, {{that in his}} generous and sympathetic mind fanned the spark into a flame. Lowe asked an unhappy question, that long stood out as a beacon mark in the controversy—whether “if you wanted venality, ignorance, drunkenness—if you wanted impulsive, unreflecting, violent people—where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> them? Do {{you go to the}} top or to the bottom?” Harsh judgments like this of the conditions of life and feeling in the mass of the nation—though Lowe was personally one of the kindest of men—made Mr. Gladstone stand all the more ardently by the objects of such sweeping reproach. In a discussion upon electoral statistics, he let fall a phrase that reverberated through the discussion inside parliament and out. Some gentlemen, he said, deal with these statistics, as if they were ascertaining the numbers of an invading army. “But the persons to whom their remarks apply are our fellow-subjects, our fellow-Christians, our own flesh and blood, who have been lauded to the skies for their good conduct.”(141) This was instantly denounced by Lord Cranborne(142) as sentimental rant, and inquiries soon followed why kinship in flesh and blood should be strictly limited by a seven pound rental. Speedily Mr. Gladstone passed from steady practical argument in the ministerial key, to all the topics of popular enthusiasm and parliamentary invective. His impulsiveness, said critical observers, “betrays him at times into exaggeration or incaution; but there is a generous quality in it.” Mr. Bright once talked of his own agitation for reform as no better than flogging a dead horse. The parliamentary struggle, led by Mr. Gladstone, brought the dead horse to life, stirred the combative instincts, and roused all the forces of reform. Lowe was glittering, energetic, direct, and swift. Mr. Disraeli, contented to watch his adversaries draw their swords on one another, did not put forth all his power. In a moment of unwisdom he taunted Mr. Gladstone with his stripling’s speech at the Oxford Union five-and-thirty years before. As Aberdeen once said, “Gladstone is terrible on the rebound,”(143) and anybody less imperturbable than Disraeli would have found his retort terrible here. His speech on the second reading (April 27), as a whole, ranks among the greatest of his performances. “Spoke,” he says, “from one to past three, following Disraeli. It was a toil much beyond my strength, but I seemed to be sustained and borne onwards I knew not how.” The party danger, the political theme, the new responsibility of command, the joy of battle, all seemed to transfigure the orator before the vision of the House, {{as if he were the}} Greek hero sent forth to combat by Pallas Athene, with, flame streaming from head and shoulders, from helmet and shield, like the star of summer rising effulgent from the sea.

40|$|Solar {{power for}} rural {{electrification}} Cue: If {{you live in}} a rural area, the chances are you are listening to this programme on a battery powered radio. In fact, across Africa, less than ten per cent of rural families have access to a national electricity grid. Yet all African countries are fantastically rich in one source of power ? solar energy. And technologies exist to turn this power into electricity. Despite this, however, the use of photo-voltaic cells to generate electricity from sunlight is almost non-existent in most African countries. Very few energy ministries have taken solar power seriously, and while in the northern hemisphere, governments offer subsidies to solar power companies and consumers, the same has rarely happened in Africa. One reason for the poor spread of solar power is that governments have typically seen it as a donor-driven technology. Recently, however, Cameroon has taken a different view, as Martha Chindong found out when she spoke to Nsangou Bouba Aliyu from the Rural Electrification Agency in Yaound‚. IN:	?Considering the high prices of fuel ? OUT:	? there to give back the energy. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Nsangou Bouba Aliyu, a technician in Cameroon?s Rural Electrification Agency. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Chindong	Considering the high prices of fuel what then prevents African countries from using renewable energy technologies in agricultural production? Take solar energy for example. That is what motivated Martha Chindong to stop by at the Rural Electrification Agency in Yaound‚, Cameroon to find out what can by done. One of the technicians working there was at the standby to answer my questions. Bouba	Solar energy, it has a big potential in the African continent because energy is everywhere in Africa, there is enough sunlight. So for the obstacles, since the material for solar systems is imported from overseas and materials are expensive so companies can come and install here in Cameroon so as to bring down the cost. Chindong	What are some of the advantages of taking electricity to the rural communities? Bouba	There are so many advantages. I will take for example the improvement of the living conditions of the rural masses. There is the fight against rural exodus. There is also the creation of income generating activities if these projects are done in the villages. Chindong	Does installing solar energy have any advantage over the national electricity? Bouba	It solves specific needs which does not entail heavy cost, for example in health centres, schools that are very far off from the network. Secondly this energy is some sort of clean energy, a silent type of energy and is not dangerous and is very practical because the costs of operating and maintenance is virtually nil. Chindong	Are there specific uses of solar energy for farmers? Bouba	Yes for farmers there are specific uses. Let me say it can be used for water supply, for drinking and even irrigation. It {{can also be used to}} transform and conserve agricultural produce. Chindong	When you say solar energy is silent energy, what do you mean? Bouba	I mean that solar energy does not make any noise like when you start generators which make a hell of a noise, it disturbs. Chindong	What factors <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> when you want to install solar energy in a rural community? Bouba	First of all and which is very much important, we have to carry out good studies. We see the options and the material that the villagers will use like radios, fridges, machines. Then we will match it up with the energy needed. The second factor is a good maintenance of the equipment. There should be somebody there to maintain this equipment. Chindong	What of the users when they use the energy for these activities, do they need to pay a price? Bouba	This depends whether it is an individual installation. If it is an individual installation they don?t need to pay a price because it is for the home and nobody else. But if it is something like a collective installation it entails an operator who manages the running of the installation and for this case people have to pay some price for him to sustain the management cost. Chindong	Let me know from you, the villagers can they keep the project running without the help of technicians? Bouba	For this case the project cannot be run like that. It needs a technician or let me say local technicians to carry out the running of the installations. Chindong	And for maintenance too? Bouba	Yes and for maintenance and that?s one mission of rural electrification agencies, to assist the rural population, train local technicians who will look after these installations. Chindong	For now the funding of solar energy is done solely by the government. Is it only the government that can fund or are there other possibilities of having funds? Bouba	Normally it is not only the government, you have individuals or communities which can regroup to acquire their own solar systems. Chindong	What is the hope for the future? Bouba	I think we should be hopeful because following what we are seeing now concerning the fuel prices, you see that the prices are going higher and higher for fuel and everything, but the prices of solar systems they are gradually coming down as the other prices are going up. So we should be hopeful that in the coming years the prices are going to fall very low. Chindong	So Mr Bouba, before we go I do not know is there any last word? Bouba	I just want to emphasise that solar energy is good because it is a clean type of energy and it is renewable. And by renewable I mean that the sun is always there. The equipment can go off, get bad or something but they will replace it. Meanwhile the sun is there to give back the energy. End of trackCameroon?s drive to spread the technolog...|$|E

They may even struggle to get private media people, whether print, radio or TV, to take an interest, and the information never reaches the majority of people, including perhaps those who need it most. At a recent conference in Belize, communication professionals from across the Caribbean were invited to discuss how information on food and nutrition could be better communicated in the region. Several of {{the participants were asked to}} comment on how the private media, government departments and others involved in development communication could work more closely to achieve better coverage for these important issues. To begin this report, Susanna Thorp spoke to Wesley Gibbings, a journalist and President of the Association of Caribbean Media Workers, and asked him if he knew of any good examples where co-operation between these different groups had taken place.

Back announcement: Merlyn Severin from St Lucia ending that report on how government information officers and private media bodies need to improve their relations, to improve the dissemination of development information in the region. Transcript Gibbings	I think that the HIV/AIDS campaign in the region is a shining example of collaboration between development communicators and journalists and media people in the region. There have been very positive effects from this. Only recently in Trinidad and Tobago researchers there were concluding that the instances in which people were actually dying as a result of the HIV virus was on the decline. And that was as a direct result of the fact that people are now more aware that the medical regimes that are available to people free of charge are being taken by people and that they are observing all the requirements of taking those anti-retrovirals. Thorp	So in the same way perhaps similar things could be achieved with messages to do with obesity and diabetes, some of the things that we were talking about this morning? Gibbings	Yes I think that what needs to happen is that these issues need to be packaged and presented in such a manner as to suggest a sense of urgency. Too often these issues are dismissed as peripheral and of only marginal value in the average daily scheme of things. I think that what needs to happen is that the development communicators need to package the information that is available and present to the media people and the community at large the fact that these are very serious and urgent issues that need attention. Thorp	But don?t you think that one of the problems too is that development people themselves don?t understand how best to communicate and to package that information? Gibbings	That is quite right and I think that a process of learning needs to take place and I think it can happen simultaneously. That the development communicators need to sit with the journalists and to learn from each other. I think that among the media environment in the region there are journalists who are genuinely concerned about development who want to see the people of their countries live better lives, live longer and healthier lives. And there are development communicators who I believe have the skills to pass on to the journalists a basic understanding of the nature of the problems that we confront. So I am very optimistic that it can happen. Thorp		So the future is to build bridges between the two? Gibbings	Certainly and I think that the first step needs to be taken by the development agencies that operate throughout the region at national, regional and international levels. I think that they need to approach the media environment with far more openness. They need to trust them more. They need to appreciate the professional values that guide the work of journalists much more. NARR	So the private media is one important way that information can be delivered. But what role should government information services have? Selwyn King, Public Relations and Communications Manager of the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) offers his view. King	The media is one channel, and when we take a closer look, each member state has a Government Information Service, GIS, and their role is essentially to bring out issues on development, issues that affect the lifestyle of the population. That includes as well food security and nutrition. So that role of the Government Information Service is to produce programmes, and those programmes can be delivered to the radio and television stations, which can then be aired. Thorp	Presumably an important part of their role is to understand the information that people want? King	They need to understand the information and who is best to understand the information than the people who are working in the Government Information Service system? Because they have access to the permanent secretaries, they have access to the ministers of government, they have access to the technicians within the government machinery. It is just a matter of taking the time out, develop programmes of what needs to be addressed in terms of education, public awareness, campaigning. Thorp	So we are not just talking about policy issues, but we are talking about?? King	We are talking in terms of food and nutrition security, we are talking in terms of breast cancer, we are talking in terms of diets, we are talking in terms of healthy lifestyle. There is a whole range of issues that have not been touched. And if the leadership of the GIS recognise what is their role and the role of the GIS system, they would be better repositioning themselves to deliver these programmes to the media who are basically limited in terms of human resources, to air the programmes. So the dynamics of the environment that we live in today we have to be realistic, we have to be on top of issues. Government policies, government projects, how do they all integrate in terms of development of the society? It is a matter of participation and the Government Information Service has a significant role to play. NARR	For Merlyn Severin, Chief Nutritionist within the Health Ministry in St Lucia, improving the amount of development information being published and broadcast by private newspapers, radio and TV stations depends on creating closer, more trusting relations between the public and private sectors. For the staff of government ministries, this may mean having a less critical attitude to the media. Severin	We always put down the media and say that media is not supportive, they like sensational stories. In my opinion one of the ways we can approach it is changing the way we deal with the media. When we as nutritionists/dieticians, nutrition people, call on the media people to give us some kind of highlight, we call on the phone, they do not even know us, then they come on. Do we ever get back to them and say ?Thank you, you did a good job?? Do we ever say to them, ?Ok, as a result of your piece, your news piece, I was able to find out five more diabetics; they heard it and they were convinced?? You must give him what he deserves, give him ?flowers?, let him feel that he made an impact. We are just going to call him one day, he does not know our office, he does not know us, and we tell him the story about what is in a mango? But if he knows that when I did that, the Ministry of Health picked up 14 more diabetics in a 3 month period I don?t see any reason why he would not want to come back a second time.
