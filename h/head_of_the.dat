Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. E. W. R.

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{present study}} was to analyze the surface {{electromyography}} (sEMG) activities generated by <b>the</b> three <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triceps brachii (TB) muscle among the different phases during fast and spin bowling. sEMG signals from the lateral, long and medial <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TB from 20 bowlers were measured individually during bowling. To analyze the sEMG activities, the root mean square (RMS) value in each bowling phase for every trial per bowler was calculated from the sEMG signals from <b>the</b> three <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TB. Higher sEMG activities at <b>the</b> three <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TB were found during the fifth phase followed by the sixth, seventh, third, fourth, second and first phases in both types of bowling. sEMG activities were significantly different among <b>the</b> three <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TB and among the seven bowling phases for both bowling types at an alpha level of p< 0. 05. These findings will be of particular importance for assessing different physical therapies for the three headed TB muscle which can improve the performance in ball delivery of cricket bowlers. ...|$|R
