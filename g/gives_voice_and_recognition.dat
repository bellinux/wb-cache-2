40|$|The {{potential}} {{for a wide variety}} of symbols, characters and font-sizes, as well as the need to support non-linear arrangements of objects make entering mathematical formulas into a computer a challenging task [2]. In a project at UC Berkeley, we are exploring how mathematical input can be improved by providing more than one mode of input. We propose that traditional mouse and keyboard input can be synchronized with <b>voice</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>and</b> handwriting <b>recognition</b> to improve accuracy and efficiency. To begin with, we need a simple open-source base program that can graphically display mathematical symbols and is easily adaptable to incorporate <b>voice</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>and</b> handwriting <b>recognition.</b> SKEME (Symbolic Keyboard and Mouse Editor) is such a sample program, initially set up to allow you to enter mathematical equations using a keyboard and mouse input. It also allows you to edit the equation using a graphical user interface. SKEME can be expanded to incorporate <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> handwriting <b>recognition.</b> Because it is written in Common Lisp, it can be debugged interactively, and (along with other applications in Common Lisp) has access to Unicode, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, memory management, and an interactive graphics environment...|$|R
