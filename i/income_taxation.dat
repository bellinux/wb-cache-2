A radical liberal in state politics, his government introduced such progressive measures as: electoral reform including the first law to give votes to women in Australia (and second in the world only to New Zealand), a legitimation Act, the first conciliation and arbitration Act in Australia, establishment of a state bank, a high protective tariff, regulation of factories, a progressive system of land and <b>income</b> <b>taxation,</b> a public works programme, and more extensive workers’ compensation.|$|E

This tax {{sheltering}} creates {{a difference between}} a household’s actual income and what it reports to the tax authorities. While tax sheltering is a central concern for designing a tax system, the private nature of this behavior complicates evaluating the magnitude and determinants of such behavior. In this paper, we combine zip-code level data on reported income from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Census Bureau to examine three types of determinants of tax sheltering: (1) tax policy variables, including tax rates and the compliance generated third-party reporting of income; (2) political attitudes towards taxation; and (3) demographics. Our estimates suggest that higher tax rates {{increase the amount of}} tax sheltering; places with more self-employed people also shelter more income. In terms of political support, our results suggest that places with voters who are either more conservative or less supportive of tax increases actually shelter less income.

25|$|Formerly, {{residents}} of Norfolk Island {{did not pay}} Australian federal taxes, which created a tax haven for locals and visitors alike. There was no income tax so the island's legislative assembly raised money through an import duty, fuel levy, medicare levy, goods and services tax of 12%, and local/international phone calls. The Chief Minister of Norfolk Island, David Buffett, announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its tax free status {{in return for a}} financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts. The introduction of <b>income</b> <b>taxation</b> came into effect on 1 July 2016.

25|$|In 2009, a {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a free market think tank, found that legalization of low-skilled illegal {{resident}} workers in the US would result in a net increase in US GDP of $180 billion over ten years. The Cato Institute study did not examine the impact on per capita income for most Americans. Jason Riley notes that because of progressive <b>income</b> <b>taxation,</b> in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of federal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage based on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in, which also reflects on immigrants. In any event, the typical immigrant and his children will pay a net $80,000 more in their lifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS. Legal immigration policy is set to maximize net taxation. Illegal immigrants even after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in taxes. In 2010, an econometrics study by a Rutgers economist found that immigration helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks to their country of origin, particularly boosting trade of final goods as opposed to intermediate goods, but that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture.|$|E

However, the overrestrictive assumption of linear tax schemes does not provide the framework to investigate important issues like the high prevalence of marginal-rate progressive taxations in democracies.

500|$|If the FairTax bill were passed, {{permanent}} {{elimination of}} <b>income</b> <b>taxation</b> {{would not be}} guaranteed; the FairTax bill would repeal much of the existing tax code, but the Sixteenth Amendment would remain in place. Preventing new legislation from reintroducing <b>income</b> <b>taxation</b> would require a repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution with a separate provision expressly prohibiting a federal income tax. This {{is referred to as}} an [...] "aggressive repeal". Separate income taxes enforced by individual states would be unaffected by the federal repeal. Passing the FairTax would require only a simple majority in each house of the United States Congress along with the signature of the President, whereas enactment of a constitutional amendment must be approved by two thirds of each house of the Congress, and three-quarters of the individual U.S. states. It is therefore possible that passage of the FairTax bill would simply add another taxation system. If a new income tax bill were passed after the FairTax passage, a hybrid system could develop; albeit, there is nothing preventing a bill for a hybrid system today. To address this issue and preclude that possibility, in the 111th Congress John Linder introduced a contingent sunset provision in H.R. 25. It would require the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment within 8 years after the implementation of the FairTax or, failing that, the FairTax would expire. Critics have also argued that a tax on state government consumption could be unconstitutional.|$|E

40|$|In the United States, some {{corporate}} {{income is}} never taxed, some is taxed once (either {{at the individual}} or the corporate level), and some is taxed twice. Many economists — ourselves included — would prefer a system that taxed all corporate income, but taxed it once and only once, at nonpreferential tax rates. Such a system would modify the tax incentives for various types of corporate behavior in important ways. In this article, we focus on two crucial dimensions of corpo-rate incentives affected by the tax system: The incentive to shelter corporate <b>income</b> from <b>taxation</b> and the in-centive to retain corporate earnings rather than pay dividends. 1 The administration’s recent proposal may not even reduce to a significant degree the incentives that exist {{under the current system}} to shelter corporate <b>income</b> from <b>taxation</b> and then to retain the earnings.

Coolidge's ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all <b>income</b> <b>taxation</b> for some two million people. They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt. By 1927, only the wealthiest 2% of taxpayers paid any federal income tax. Federal spending remained flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt to be retired in total. State and local governments saw considerable growth, however, surpassing the federal budget in 1927.|$|E

In Stratton, a mining corporation argued that the 1909 corporation tax act {{did not apply to}} that corporation. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the 1909 corporation tax act did apply to mining corporations, and that the proceeds of ores mined by the corporation from its own premises were income within the meaning of the 1909 tax act. The Court also ruled that the corporation was not entitled to deduct [...] "the value of such ore in place and before it is mined" [...] as depreciation within the meaning of the 1909 Act.

These included uncertainties as to the revenue that would be generated, and difficulties of enforcement and administration, which made this type of tax undesirable to recommend in their final report. [...] The panel did not examine the FairTax as proposed in the legislation. The FairTax received visibility in the 2008 presidential election on the issue of taxes and the IRS, with several candidates supporting the bill. A poll in 2009 by Rasmussen Reports found that 43% of Americans would support a national sales tax replacement, with 38% opposed to the idea; the sales tax was viewed as fairer by 52% of Republicans, 44% of Democrats, and 49% of unaffiliateds.
