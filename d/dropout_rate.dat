40|$|Development {{in human}} {{capital in the}} form of public {{education}} and health provision is necessary {{for the development of a}} country. Most cross-country studies on the effect of schooling on education emphasize the importance of school dropouts. This paper analyses the determinants of the <b>dropout</b> <b>rates</b> at various levels using a panel of 138 countries. We consider three definitions of school dropouts - at the primary school level, between primary and secondary school and at the secondary school level. We find that income and government spending generally has a significant effect on school <b>dropout</b> <b>rates.</b> The stock of adult education is significant in reducing the <b>dropout</b> <b>rates</b> at the primary school level whereas the impact is just the reverse for the <b>dropout</b> <b>rates</b> at the secondary school level. Political instability in the country also exerts some impact on the <b>dropout</b> <b>rates.</b> Correcting for the potential endogeneity of income we find that the reverse causation argument holds only for dropouts at the primary school level...|$|R
5|$|This simple {{philosophy}} was tested as Texas A transitioned from an all-male military college to a coeducational research university. The addition {{of women to}} the Corps presented some challenges, including one high-profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members. When women were finally admitted to the band under court order (Fall Semester, 1985); the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms. Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies. The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies (members of their freshman class in their unit) {{were included in the}} photos. With a band <b>dropout</b> <b>rate</b> of 33% the odds were against all of the female cadets succeeding, only Andrea Abat remained in the band through her senior year. Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated the dorms, grouping females {{at one end of the}} dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{may have}} become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he {{registered}} at the one-year-old University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages. The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students {{to choose their own}} studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high <b>dropout</b> <b>rate.</b> During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased. Poe gave up on the university after a year, but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer. At some point, he started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} what Washington high school principals {{perceive to be}} the most effective dropout prevention policies and programs. The population included all public high schools in the State of Washington. Five questions were posed: 1. (a) What preventative measures, intervention programs or student services designed to enhance environmental and personal factors are perceived to have reduced <b>dropout</b> <b>rates?</b> (b) Does the availability of those services and programs account for {{a significant difference in the}} actual <b>dropout</b> <b>rates?</b> 2. (a) What personal/psychological factors characterize potential dropouts? (b) Do these identifying characteristics account for a significant variance in the actual <b>dropout</b> <b>rates?</b> 3. (a) What environmental factors influence <b>dropout</b> <b>rates</b> in the schools? (b) Do these factors account for a significant variance in the actual <b>dropout</b> <b>rates?</b> 4. What intervention programs or student services are available in the sample? 5. What demographic factors in the sample schools significantly affect <b>dropout</b> <b>rates?</b> The study incorporated both quantitative and qualitative methodology. Ninety six questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 64 percent. The survey gathered information about each school 2 ̆ 7 s demographics, opinions about potential dropouts 2 ̆ 7 identifying characteristics, opinions about the school environment availability of services and programs in each building and district, and which programs they felt {{to be the most}} effective, ranking the top ten from a list of twenty possible programs, policies, or services. Six schools were visited and their principals were interviewed to get additional information about their programs and effectiveness. Data was statistically analyzed using ANOVA, multiple regression, and paired comparisons. The policies, services, and programs felt to be most effective were: In-house progressive discipline, vocational programs, a written building attendance policy, out-of-building alternative programs, cooperative work programs, freshman bonding programs, small group advisories, in-building alternative programs, a written district attendance policy, a required life skills class, honors courses, and alcohol/drug-related programs. Available programs accounting for a variance in actual <b>dropout</b> <b>rates</b> were: Monetary incentives, child care facilities, English taught as a second language, honors courses, and parent effectiveness programs. Identified personal characteristics accounting for a variance in actual <b>dropout</b> <b>rates</b> were: Working full-time, low self-esteem, parents 2 ̆ 7 background, low grades, teen pregnancy, and being of a racial minority. Environmental factors accounting for a variance in actual <b>dropout</b> <b>rates</b> were: High parent and community involvement with the school, self-esteem classes and small-group advisories, and the Excellence reform. Demographic factors accounting for a variance in actual <b>dropout</b> <b>rates</b> were: economic stability, gender of principal, and use of free school lunch. The research suggests that those programs and practices accounting for a variance in actual <b>dropout</b> <b>rates</b> should be examined for their interaction of involved factors. If the discussed personal and environmental factors are present, those effective interactive practices should be implemented in order to reduce <b>dropout</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
