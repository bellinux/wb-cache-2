5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
