25|$|Video CDs {{were unable}} to gain {{acceptance}} as a mainstream format in North America, chiefly because the established VHS format was less expensive, offered comparable video quality, and could be recorded over. The advent of recordable CDs, inexpensive recorders, and compatible DVD players spurred VCD acceptance in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, DVD burners and DVD-Video recorders were available by that time, and equipment and media costs for making DVD-Video fell rapidly. DVD-Video, with its longer run time and much higher quality, quickly overshadowed VCD in areas that could afford it. In addition many early DVD players could not read recordable (CD-R) media, and this limited the compatibility of home-made VCDs. Almost every modern stand-alone <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>player</b> can play VCDs burned on recordable media.|$|E
50|$|XvMC was {{the first}} UNIX {{equivalent}} of the Microsoft Windows DirectX Video Acceleration (DxVA) API. Mac OS X also includes MPEG-2 acceleration capabilities, but Apple has chosen not to expose that API for use outside their own <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>player</b> application.|$|E

50|$|All <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players</b> in PAL {{countries}} contain stereo MP2 decoders, making MP2 {{a possible}} competitor to Dolby Digital in these markets. <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players</b> in NTSC countries {{are not required}} to decode MP2 audio, although most do. While some DVD recorders store audio in MP2 and many consumer-authored DVDs use the format, commercial DVDs with MP2 soundtracks are rare.|$|R
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the DVD-Audio format, some kind of backward compatibility with existing <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players</b> was desired, although not required. To address this, most DVD-Audio discs also contain DVD-Video compatible data to play the standard DVD-Video Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio track on the disc (which can be downmixed to two channels for listeners with no surround sound setup). Many <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players</b> also offer the option to create a Dolby MP matrix-encoded soundtrack for older surround sound systems lacking Dolby Digital or DTS decoding. Some discs also include a native Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo, and even a DTS96/24 5.1-channel, audio track.|$|R
25|$|Video CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a {{standard}} digital format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD <b>players,</b> most modern <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players,</b> personal computers, and some video game consoles.|$|R
50|$|Jarre {{chose the}} DVD-Video format {{instead of the}} higher-quality DVD-Audio or SACD because he claimed that DVD-Video was the most {{widespread}} format, with the generalization of home cinema setups. However, DVD-Audio discs are normally authored to provide surround sound compatible with <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term {{post-processing}} (or postproc for short) {{is used in}} the video/film {{business for}} quality-improvement image processing (specifically digital image processing) methods used in video playback devices, (such as stand-alone <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players),</b> and video players software and transcoding software. It is also commonly used in real-time 3D rendering (such as in video games) to add additional effects.|$|R
5000|$|Playback of {{recordings}} on regular <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players,</b> including title {{menus and}} edits. For DVD+RW discs, playback is possible without finalization, provided the player can read DVD+RW discs. For DVD+R a finalization step {{is required in}} order to allow the media to play back on a regular DVD player, however, may be playable on another DVD recorder.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{capacity}} of memory cards grew and their price dropped, DVDs use for recordable media declined. No DVD-based AVCHD camcorders have been produced since 2008. While DVDs are no longer used for acquisition, they remain popular as distribution media. Many authoring programs offer [...] "AVCHD" [...] profile for recording high definition video on a DVD. Such AVCHD discs are incompatible with regular <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players,</b> but play in many Blu-ray Disc players. A conventional single-layer 12 cm DVD can store 35 minutes of video recorded at the maximum bitrate the AVCHD specification allows for DVD mediaâ€”18 Mbit/s.|$|R
50|$|The DVD+VR {{recording}} mode (aka +VR functionality) {{is compatible}} with <b>DVD-Video</b> (normal <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players),</b> but offers basic editing like partial overwriting, title dividing, chapter marker placement, replace the menu screens, etc. This can be accomplished easily on DVD+R media. DVD+VR can theoretically be used with DVD-RW media, but partial overwriting and replacement of menus cannot be so easily accomplished due to limitations of the media. In order to achieve this, {{it would be necessary}} for the recorder to read and store the entire contents of the disc, erase the disc and then rewrite it. For this reason alone, DVD+VR is seldom used with DVD-RW (or DVD-R) media.|$|R
50|$|The DVD-VR {{standard}} {{defines a}} logical format for video recording on DVD-R, DVD-RW, and DVD-RAM style media, including the dual layer versions of these media. As opposed to media recorded with the DVD+VR recording standard, the resulting media are not DVD-Video compliant, {{and do not}} play back in some <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players.</b> Most DVD video recorders in the market that support DVD-R, DVD-RW, or DVD-RAM media record to these media in DVD-VR mode, {{as well as in}} a DVD-Video compliant mode. It is possible to use the DVD-VR format with DVD+R and DVD+RW media, but no examples are known other than some PC based recording utilities.|$|R
500|$|The DualDisc {{edition of}} The Downward Spiral {{contains}} the same CD content on Side A as the Deluxe Edition, with a DVD-Audio layer on Side B. When played on <b>DVD-Video</b> <b>players</b> a Dolby Digital 5.1 multi-channel or Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo mix of The Downward Spiral can be selected, along with videos of [...] "March of the Pigs", [...] "Hurt" [...] and an uncensored video of [...] "Closer". There {{is also an}} interactive discography and an image gallery. High resolution 24-bit/48kHz 5.1 Surround sound and stereo versions of The Downward Spiral can be played on a DVD-Audio player, allowing the user a similar high fidelity experience as the SACD layer of the Deluxe Edition. The DualDisc release does not contain the additional B-sides and demo tracks.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} decrypt a <b>DVD-Video,</b> the <b>player</b> reads the disc-key-block and uses its player-key to decrypt the disc-key. Thereafter, the player reads the title-keys and decrypts {{them with the}} disc-key. A {{different}} title-key can be assigned for the Video Manager and for each Video Title Set. The title-keys are used to decrypt the Packs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the 4. 7 -GB Digital Versatile Disc plus ReWritable (DVD+RW) {{system as a}} future replacement for the Video Cassette Recorder (VCR). It is shown that Dig-ital Versatile Disc (DVD) discs can be recorded in a fully compatible manner with the existing <b>DVD-Video</b> standard and <b>players.</b> The compatibility issue is addressed {{from the perspective of}} the DVD-Video physical and logical formats...|$|R
40|$|DVD VR(Video Recording) is a logic format {{adopted by}} most home {{consumer}} DVD recorder machines to record real-time TV and multimedia content on DVD+R/RW or DVD-R/RW blank discs. However, DVD VR format {{can only be}} recognized and played by the DVD recorder itself. To achieve forward compatibility and playability, the recorder provides a function called disc finalizing process which closes every tracks and sessions of a DVD VR disc and changes its logic format from DVD VR to DVD-Video to make it playable on generic <b>DVD-Video</b> compatible <b>players.</b> Unfortunately, disc finalizing process provided by DVD recorder is very unstable and unreliable due to various uncertain reasons. This unreliable finalizing process often and easily produces failure discs which are neither in correct DVD VR format nor in DVD-Video format. Thus, these discs become unrecognized, and {{can no longer be}} played any more by any DVD players or recorders. This paper proposes an extension of software solution with packet reading which is capable of reading and playing non-finalized, finalizing-failure or other recording-failure DVD VR discs. 1...|$|R
