The design is aimed {{to enhance the}} detection of obstacles in the travelling path of the wheelchair user at low cost. This is facilitated by microcontroller and sensor technologies. The proposed design provides the intended user with obstacle detection, light detection, a light emitting diode (LED) <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> <b>system,</b> and an <b>emergency</b> alarm system. The microcontroller is the main controller that receives input from the sensors and produces output to the light crystal display (LCD) screen, the LED <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> <b>system,</b> and the <b>emergency</b> alarm system. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the presence of obstacles directly behind the wheelchair. If any obstacle exists behind the wheelchair within a set range, the system will alert the wheelchair user through different alarm sounds. In the case of absence of <b>light,</b> the LED <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> <b>system</b> is activated and turns on a light source, which {{is attached to the}} wheelchair to provide a bright and clear path for the user.

50|$|The first buses {{that were}} used on bus {{services}} in Southampton were petrol but in the 1930s the diesel was developed and was proving its worth. During 1934 and 1935 considerable extensions and more new routes {{were added to the}} network. There was also further trials of different sorts of buses. In 1937, the Conservative government gave approval for The Southampton Corporation Act, which gave the Corporation the powers to abandon the Tramways, although it wouldn't be until December 1944 when the trams would finally close. In 1939 with the start of World War II a number of regulations were set out by the Home Office, including total blackouts from sunset to sunrise. This meant that buses had to run without lights on, though <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> lighting was included. Some restrictions had been left by March 1940, which meant certain minor extensions and modifications could be carried out, and school bus services were introduced.

There are no general design criteria or regulatory guides that directly apply to the safety-related performance requirements for the lighting system. The PSB will use the following criteria to assess the systems design capability: (1) the normal lighting system(s) is acceptable if the integrated design of the system(s) will provide adequate station lighting in all areas, from offsite power sources, required for normal plant operation, control and maintenance of equipment and plant access routes; (2) the emergency lighting system(s) is acceptable if the integrated design of the system(s) will provide ade-quate emergency station lighting in all areas, from onsite power sources, require...|$|E

The methodology consisted of the following three elements: A building survey to establish fire safety facilities: An analysis of fire related documentation: Interviews with staff to establish existing fire safety procedures. Results None of the seventeen nursing homes showed an adequate ability to prevent fire or evacuate residents to a place of safety. None of the nursing homes carried out adequate fire risk assessments. None of the nursing homes prevented fire doors being left open. Only one nursing home fully complied with relevant codes of practice in terms of construction and required fire safety facilities.

40|$|Scope of {{this paper}} is to report results of an {{experimental}} research aiming to characterize <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> equipment behavior during switch on transients with static CSS supply. <b>Emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> equipment inrush current peak values and waveforms are typically very dispersed depending on technology and manufacturers and can create problems when sizing or operating CSS equipments. High peak values can lead to CSS electronic protection tripping. <b>Emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> centralized <b>systems</b> are nowadays becoming a growing issue due to higher safety level requirements in addition to higher lighting power needed. Considering the lack of available reliable data on lighting equipment behavior, inrush current issue is currently approached by CSS over sizing. The research aims to fill this gap providing statistical data obtained with a proper scientific approach. Given the importance of CSS cost, the availability of such data will allow system designers to optimize CSS sizing, reducing both operative (maintenance and losses) and installation costs. The key factor for an optimal CSS sizing is the knowledge of the behavior of lighting equipments during switch on phase: the cool start phase is typically considered the most critical condition. Measurements described in this paper have been carried out on different types of lamps typically used in emergency installations around Europe mains supplied. Further investigations have been done with sample lamps CSS supplied. Network supply conditions have been chosen in order to evaluate the parameters describing phenomenon in terms of duration, maximum peak value and current rms value during turn on transients.
