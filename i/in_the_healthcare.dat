5|$|CDTM is an {{expansion}} of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E

25|$|Adoption of RFID in {{the medical}} {{industry}} has been widespread and very effective. Hospitals are among the first users to combine both active and passive RFID.

For example, medical facility rooms can collect data from transmissions of RFID badges worn by patients and employees, {{as well as from}} tags assigned to facility assets, such as mobile medical devices. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently announced plans to deploy RFID in hospitals across America to improve care and reduce costs.|$|E
