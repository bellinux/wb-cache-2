50|$|At the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2010, Corcoran and Jones enjoyed further {{success with}} The College Years, and {{received}} a number of five-star reviews from various publications, including Chortle, The <b>List,</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> Spotlight and Fringe Review. The Edinburgh Festival Guide published a list of 'Top-rated shows' {{at the end of}} the 2010 festival, in which Frisky & Mannish: The College Years was placed second out of nearly 2500 productions. Corcoran and Jones were singled out by comedian Shappi Khorsandi in The Telegraph as one of her favourite acts at the festival. The show then toured the United Kingdom during the autumn, culminating in a performance at the Bloomsbury Theatre, before travelling to Perth, Western Australia, to take part in the inaugural Fringe World festival.|$|R
5000|$|The Greyfriars Bobby Fountain in Edinburgh {{includes}} a life-size statue of Greyfriars Bobby created by William Brodie in 1872. It {{was paid for}} by a local aristocrat, Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and unveiled on 15 November 1873. It stands near the south (main) entrance to Greyfriars Kirkyard. The monument is <b>Edinburgh's</b> smallest <b>listed</b> building. Originally built as a drinking fountain, it had an upper fountain for humans and a lower fountain for dogs. Its water supply was cut off (together with Edinburgh's other drinking fountains) around 1975 amidst health scares. Both basin areas were infilled with concrete soon afterwards. It was daubed with yellow paint, allegedly by students, on general election night in 1979, and {{hit by a car}} in 1984. The monument was fully restored under the supervision of Edinburgh District Council in 1985. The entire base is newly carved but emulates the original exactly. A plaque on the base reads, [...] "A tribute to the affectionate fidelity of Greyfriars Bobby. In 1858, this faithful dog followed the remains of his master to Greyfriars Churchyard and lingered near the spot until his death in 1872. With permission erected by the Baroness Burdett-Coutts". Inscribed on the statue is [...] "Greyfriars Bobby, from the life just before his death" [...] and [...] "W.H. Brodie Sc RSA 1872".|$|R
50|$|After all {{meeting at}} school in 2004, the group began {{performing}} around Scotland, {{building up a}} following. What followed was national radio plays on XFM Scotland (now rebranded as Galaxy Scotland) and BBC Radio Scotland and articles have appeared in The <b>List,</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> Festival Magazine, Edinburgh Evening News, The Scotsman and The Skinny. In 2007 and 2008, The Fabulous Hurricanes played a string of shows most notably supporting Neils Children and Bombay Bicycle Club, and they were voted number 4 {{on the list of}} 'Scotland's Best Unsigned Bands' by The Scotsman.In 2008, the band were sent a letter by Paul McCartney inviting them to his Liverpool concert after he heard their music, and in 2010 the band performed with Kitty Daisy & Lewis to a sold-out crowd in Edinburgh.|$|R
50|$|After {{a season}} of previews on the South Bank, Pop Centre Plus was {{presented}} at the Udderbelly during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2011. Amid considerable media interest, including being featured on the cover of The <b>List’s</b> <b>Edinburgh</b> Festival Guide, and a mention in The Independent as Ruby Wax’s must-see show, Corcoran and Jones again enjoyed a sell-out success, despite a somewhat mixed critical reception. They were also featured in the Edinburgh Comedy Award Panel Prize-winning The Wrestling at the Pleasance Dome. Following the Fringe, Corcoran and Jones toured to the Absolut Fringe Festival Dublin in September 2011, and across the United Kingdom once more during the autumn, culminating in their highest-profile London engagement to date, O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire, on 7 December 2011. In February 2012, they returned to perform in The Famous Spiegeltent at the Fringe World festival in Perth, receiving critical acclaim and a nomination for the Best Cabaret award.|$|R
30|$|We {{measured}} 67 {{samples from}} Cores 359 -U 1467 C- 4 H to - 6 H on both XRF instruments. These samples cover {{the full range}} of lithologies observed at Site U 1467, from almost pure carbonate to clay-rich carbonates. The pellets were first measured on the conventional XRF instrument in Edinburgh and the same pellets were sent to College Station in Texas and measured on the AvaaTech XRF core scanner. This procedure facilitates calculation of regression lines and correlation coefficients for the individual elements. Correlation coefficients range from about 0.2 to 0.9. Ti shows the lowest value of about 0.2, whereas Fe has a value of about 0.80, and Al has a value of 0.85. K and Si have the highest values of about 0.9. These results suggest that on the one hand AvaaTech XRF core scanner results for Ti are not robust, {{but on the other hand}} they seem reasonably reliable for Fe and Al, and they seem very robust for K and Si. The reason for unreliability of Ti measured by the AvaaTech core scanner is the low concentrations of Ti in the sediments. Although core scanner results seem reasonably robust for Fe, Al, K and Si, it is not clear at this point whether the core scanner reliably measures amplitude of change for individual elements. Water content, grain size, porosity and other unknown factors may influence the element intensities (Kido et al. 2006; Koshikawa et al. 2003; Tjallingii et al. 2007). All data measured by the XRF instruments at Texas A&M University and the University of <b>Edinburgh</b> are <b>listed</b> in Additional file 1 : Table S 1.|$|R
40|$|An {{existing}} {{model of}} the commercial property development process was applied to a mixed use redevelopment site. The case studied was the redevelopment of 7. 7 hectares of previously developed land in central <b>Edinburgh</b> containing nine <b>listed</b> buildings. 158, 000 square metres of accommodation are planned, 65 % {{of which will be}} residential and 25 % offices. The site was first marketed in 2000, construction began in 2005 and approximately 40 % of the project was completed by the spring of 2009. The single case study was investigated by inspection of documents and plans, site visits and semi-structured interviews with senior executives representing all the companies and organisations that were influential in decision making. It was found that the commercial model was able to represent the reality of the project environment reasonably well; however adjustments were required to cope with mixed-use redevelopment. The overall fate of the site was determined by the interplay of market forces and state policy, yet the detailed evolution of the project was dependent upon the organisations and individuals that became involved. Questions of design and the architect {{played an important role in}} decision making. ‘Place making’ was found to be fundamental in both planning and financial terms. It was confirmed that a genuine mixed-use environment that is well conceived and managed can be very attractive to the public, residents, businesses and investors. While some listed buildings were sacrificed, involving controversy and delay, conversions of others made a significant contribution both environmentally and financially. These results contribute to the literature of detailed property development cases while refining the model used...|$|R
