40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{experiments}} on electrically driven convection that occurs in a thin, freely suspended film of smectic A liquid crystal when an electric field is applied in {{the plane of the}} <b>film.</b> <b>Convection</b> in a vortex pattern is found above a well-defined critical voltage. The film behaves as a two-dimensional isotropic liquid: neither its thickness nor the director field are modified by the flow. We present measurements of the critical voltage at the onset of convection in two experimental configurations [...] one which allows the injection of charges into the film from the electrodes, and one which does not. When injection is present, the critical voltage for the onset of flow increases monotonically with increasing frequency of applied field. With no injection, there is no instability at DC and the critical voltage diverges there. The nature of the flow pattern observed at onset changes with frequency. Below a certain frequency the film flows in vortices that extend over the width of the film; above this frequency the flow is confined to two lines of smaller vortices localized along the electrodes. We present a simple discussion of the mechanisms which drive the convection. KEY WORDS: Convection; pattern formation; smectic liquid crystals; two-dimensional liquid; electroconvection...|$|E

For highly diffusive systems film drainage is observed to be, in contrast to immiscible systems, non-axisymmetric and unstable immediately after the film formation (at a few micrometers film thickness).

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been performed {{to determine the}} forced convection heat transfer due to three-dimensional air flow over a flat plate {{as a function of}} angle of attack and free stream velocity. The experimental method employed a transient thermal technique and placed the convecting surface next to the exhaust port of an open circuit wind tunnel. The ratio of convecting surface width to wind tunnel nozzle width was 0. 7, but insulating surfaces extended beyond the nozzle width. The flows evaluated ranged in Reynolds number from 32, 000 to 140, 000 and from zero to 90 -degree angles of attack. The data indicated the probable existence of a turbulent boundary layer at zero and 45 -degree angles of attack. Data collected for angles of attack of 30, 60, and 90 degrees demonstrate mostly laminar boundary layer flows and indicate a dependence of the Colburn i-factor upon angle of attack. The j-factor was determined to be proportional to the Reynolds number to the minus one-half power, as in previous work, and the multiplier varied between 0. 876, as in a Pohlhausen equation corrected for unheated starting length, to 1. 114 as predicted in wedge flow measurements performed by Eckert. The results are different from those of Sparrow and Tien, which indicate a single multiplier of 0. 931 will provide solutions for all angles of attack between 25 and 90 degrees. The flow in this investigation is largely twodimensional due to the physical arrangement of the apparatus, whereas the flow used by Sparrow and Tien was primarily three-dimensional. An analytical method was also developed which accounted for the random nature of the natural wind velocity distribution in the calculation of the time average <b>convection</b> <b>film</b> coefficient. The method uses the average velocity and the standard deviation of the velocity to provide an evaluation of the time average <b>convection</b> <b>film</b> coefficient. This was accomplished by transforming the defining convection relationship into a second order constant coefficient polynomial over a fixed range of velocities. The method was demonstrated on a statistical record of wind velocities measured on November 29 and 30, 1978 at the Oregon State University campus. The error created by using only the average velocity in calculating the time average <b>convection</b> <b>film</b> coefficient was determined to be 3. 4...|$|R

50|$|Film cooling (also called {{thin film}} cooling), a widely used type, allows for higher heat {{transfer}} rates than either convection and impingement cooling. This technique consists of pumping the cooling {{air out of}} the blade through multiple small holes in the structure. A thin layer (the film) of cooling air is then created on the external surface of the blade, reducing the heat transfer from main flow, whose temperature (1300-1800 kelvins) can exceed the melting point of the blade material (1300-1400 kelvins). The air holes can be in many different blade locations, but they are most often along the leading edge. A United States Air Force program in the early 1970s funded the development of a turbine blade that was both <b>film</b> and <b>convection</b> cooled, and that method has become common in modern turbine blades.Injecting the cooler bleed into the flow reduces turbine isentropic efficiency; the compression of the cooling air (which does not contribute power to the engine) incurs an energetic penalty; and the cooling circuit adds considerable complexity to the engine. All of these factors have to be compensated by the increase in overall performance (power and efficiency) allowed by the increase in turbine temperature.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that NLO thin film properties may be improved by low-gravity processing. Strong candidates for NLO thin film applications are the polythiophenes. Polymeric thiophenes are attractive materials due to their ease of preparation, stability, and high X(exp 3). A simple and convenient method for preparation of polythiophenes is electrochemical oxidation. We will apply some of our experience and lessons learned in low-gravity metal, metal/cermet electrode position {{to improve the quality}} of polythiophene(s) thin films. In low gravity electrode position of Ni at a high rate on an Au substrate often results in the production of an x-ray non diffracting surface. Cobalt metal deposition does not give this result nor does Ni when deposited similarly on a glassy carbon substrate. Co/Ni alloy composition produced during electrode position is strongly dependent upon the amount of convection. Code position of neutral inert cermets with metals is influenced significantly by the presence of gravity and the size of the cermets. Tracks left in the 1 -g surfaces by unsuccessful particle occlusion indicate suspension of the large particles is not the only reason for poor volume percentages of the larger particles in the deposits. All size particles are more homogeneously distributed in the deposits in low-gravity electrocodeposition than in 1 -g. Low gravity gives larger volume percentages for the larger particles in the deposits, while 1 -g gives larger volume percentages for the smaller particles. Intermediate size particles give mixed results. The experimental cells were constructed with flat electrode end plates such that 1 -g bench reference electrode positions could be carried out at various orientations with respect to gravity. A series of bench studies using similar designed cells are suggested so that convection modification can be applied to electrochemical thin <b>film</b> preparation. <b>Convection</b> effects can then be coupled with other parameter variations in current, temperature, concentration, solvent, electrolyte, and anode substrates to optimize the properties of NLO thin films before resorting to low-gravity processing...|$|R

The location {{and the shape}} of the interface was determined using melting temperatures from the HgCdTe liquidus curve. The low thermal conductivity of the solid HgCdTe causes thermal short circuit through the ampoule walls, resulting in curved isotherms {{in the vicinity of the}} interface. Double-diffusive convection in the melt is caused by radial temperature gradients and by material density inversion with temperature. Cooling from below and the rejection at the solid-melt interface of the heavier HgTe-rich solute each tend to reduce convection. Because of these complicating factors dimensional rather then non-dimensional modeling was performed. Estimates of convection contributions for various gravity conditions was performed parametrically. For gravity levels higher then 1 0 - 7 of earth's gravity it was found that the maximum convection velocity is extremely sensitive to gravity vector orientation and can be reduced at least by factor of 50 % for precise orientation of the ampoule in the microgravity environment. The predicted interface shape is in agreement with one obtained experimentally by quenching. The results of 3 -D modeling are compared with previous 2 -D finding.
