5000|$|Sodium {{dithionite}} {{can also}} be used for water treatment, gas purification, cleaning, and stripping. It {{can also be}} used in industrial processes as a sulfonating agent or a sodium ion source. In addition to the textile industry, this compound is used in industries concerned with leather, foods, polymers, photography, and many others. Its wide use is attributable to its low toxicity [...] at 5 g/kg, and hence its wide range of applications.It is also used as <b>decolourising</b> <b>agent</b> in organic reactions.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} peroxide as a <b>decolourising</b> <b>agent</b> in the refinery has been investigated. Experiments ~ere done, {{in the laboratory}} and on a pilot plant scale, to investigate the effectiveness ofthis chemical and to establish optimum conditions, particularly in terms of pH, temperature ~~d reaction time. The results indicate that there IS a pOSSIbIlIty of this chemical {{being used in the}} refinery...|$|E
40|$|Decolourisation at the Malelane {{cane sugar}} {{refinery}} {{is achieved by}} conventional carbonatation and cationic polyamine flocculant followed by light sulphitation. This technology is adequate to produce EEC 2 specification refined sugar. However, occasional high input raw sugar colour increases the blended sugar colour to above the specification limit. Under these conditions the fourth sugar is rejected and only again accepted for blending once the combined sugar colour is within the specification limit. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is an established <b>decolourising</b> <b>agent</b> for sugar application. However, its once-off use contributes to its high operating cost and therefore limits wider use. The intermittent nature of the out of specification colour problem has prompted interest in PAC as an ad hoc additive for use during problem periods. PAC application requires carbon dosage equipment, contacting tanks and dedicated filters. The main purpose of this test work has been to determine whether PAC can be applied as an additive into the existing process {{without the need for}} any new equipment. For this reason, dosage directly into carbonated liquor prior to filtration was made the main focus area. After initial laboratory screening tests, a carbonated liquor slip-stream was treated with PAC and filtered in a pilot plant plate and frame filter unit alongside the factory pressure leaf filters. The decolourisation results obtained from laboratory testing and pilot plant performance have shown that PAC activity is not inhibited in the presence of carbonatation sludge and therefore could be used on an ad hoc basis to decolourise unfiltered carbonated liquor during periods of high input sugar colour...|$|E
40|$|Sparingly soluble The use of {{cationic}} flocculants as <b>decolourising</b> <b>agents</b> in {{the refinery}} has been investigated. The results of {{experiments in the}} laboratory and from full scale plant trials are presented. The findings indicate that these chemicals {{can be used in}} the refinery to replace partially existing chemicals, thus lowering the overall chemical cost of refining, or to achieve additional decolourisation during periods of high colour loading.

5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as <b>decolourising</b> <b>agents</b> and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|R
40|$|Cuprous {{chloride}} (CuCl) is extensively used as {{a catalyst}} in organic synthesis, and as a desulfurising, <b>decolourising</b> and deodorising <b>agent</b> in the petroleum industry. The traditional synthesis of CuCl nanocrystal powders, which has already caused a big problem in the environment, was via reducing copper(II) by using different additives and a quantity of concentrated acid. In this paper, we report an ecologically and environmental friendly route to prepare nanocrystalline CuCl powders, simply by using the CuCl 2 and copper powders in a deep eutectic solvent (DES) at room temperature. The obtained CuCl nanocrystals were characterised by XRD, SEM and XPS techniques, and a possible formation mechanism was also proposed...|$|R
