40|$|At European level, Competition Law is to {{determine}} the <b>interpenetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>economies</b> of Member States, without substituting the regulations of the Member States. From {{the point of view of}} its application both the relevance to Member States and their economic operators is noticeable. Under national law, the Competition Law provides that business activity shall be conducted pursuant to the perception of good faith and fair usage. As a result, each trader is entitled to intervene legally in the business circuit, provided no infringement of the rights of other professionals occurs. Therefore a way of conducting business activity focused on compliance with the limits of legitimate competition is required. Both Community law and national law do not exclude the influence of international regulations in this field, the legal basis in this case being found in international organizations like the OECD or WTO...|$|E
40|$|Why has the {{financial}} crisis not led to more radical public contestation and political reforms? In investigating the muted response to the crisis so far, the paper highlights the significance of ideological fantasy for appreciating the <b>interpenetration</b> <b>of</b> <b>economy</b> and society. We interpret the lack of resistance to how the crisis as an exercise in ‘cooling out’ (Goffman) underpinned by a restorative fantasmatic narrative. The ‘enjoyment’ derived from scapegoating individual bankers has reinforced passivity and narrowed the debate. By investigating a range of media and policy responses to the meltdown, we conclude that the pre-credit crunch ideology of ‘no more boom and bust’ {{has been replaced by}} an equally ideological narrative that promises a re-normalization of processes of financialization. This allows for the preservation of key elements of neo-liberalist capitalism as well as the dismissal of alternative projects. The paper shows how, exemplified by the establishment and operation of United Kingdom Financial Investments Ltd (UKFI), the post-crisis ideology continues to shield financial markets from public scrutiny and interventio...|$|R

50|$|The CIFB was a {{short-lived}} {{experiment in the}} process of institutionalisation of photographic culture during Spain's democratic Transition. The current study of this experiment, little known and almost forgotten despite its nearness in time and space, should be understood from a double perspective: local and global. On the one hand, this is a local study of a process that was taking place at an international level during the seventies: the re-composition of the cultural field within the new cultural industries following a post-industrial economic model. This was a moment of great expansion for the art market, with photography becoming part of it to an unprecedented degree. The seventies marked the beginning of a great international resurgence of institutions, festivals, academic programmes, galleries and publications that laid down the conditions for the <b>interpenetration</b> <b>of</b> culture and <b>economy</b> as it is known today. On the other hand, this is a study of how such generalised historical conditions took on a specific, local and very concrete form in the field of photography in Barcelona during the Transition. In this sense, the study sheds a different light on the period, allowing us to understand how disparate photographic practices and traditions, which have since become separate, were able to coexist at the time. The multiplicity of the seventies eventually lost ground when faced with a visualist conception of creative photography, whose hegemony began to establish itself after the Jornades Catalanes de Fotografia, which took place at the Fundació Joan Miró in 1980, and which, in retrospect, are still regarded as photography's official entry into the new cultural policies. The CIFB declined {{to take part in the}} Jornades.|$|R
