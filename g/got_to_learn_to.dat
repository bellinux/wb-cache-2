500|$|In the 1964U.S. presidential election, Senator Barry Goldwater {{quickly became}} the likely Republican Party nominee. Goldwater {{represented}} {{a new wave of}} American conservatism, of which the moderate Romney was not a part. Romney also felt that Goldwater would be a drag on Republicans running in all the other races that year, including Romney's own (at the time, Michigan had two-year terms for its governor). Finally, Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater's views on civil rights; he would later say, [...] "Whites and Negroes, in my opinion, have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> know each other. Barry Goldwater didn't have any background to understand this, to fathom them, and I couldn't get through to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{carefully}} and attentively, {{it is possible}} to avoid conduit-metaphor expressions. For example, [...] "Did you get anything out of that article?" [...] might be replaced by, [...] "Were you able to construct anything of interest {{on the basis of the}} assigned text?" [...] Eschewing obvious conduit-metaphor expressions when communication is the topic is difficult. [...] "Try to communicate more effectively" [...] differs in impact from [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> put your thoughts into words." [...] Reddy proceeds to show that even if avoidance were possible, it does not necessarily free people from the framework.|$|R

It took you two weeks to think of me as Forrest Haviland. I'm ashamed of you! If you're a socialist you ought to think that anything you like belongs to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Civility is {{the action}} of working {{together}} productively to reach a common goal, and often with beneficent purposes. Some definitions conflate civility with politeness, which suggests disengaging with others {{so as not to}} offend ("roll over and play dead"...). The notion of positively constructive civility suggests robust, even passionate, engagement framed in respect of differing views. In his call for restoring civility, Pastor Rick Warren said, [...] "In America, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> disagree without demonizing each other." [...] Pastor Warren was speaking metaphorically, but the fundamental principle he is trying to restore is the idea that people can still work together even if they do not always absolutely agree with each other's point of view.|$|R

I tell ye, children's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> take the world as it is; and 'tain't no use bringin' on 'em up too tender.

So he {{kept trying}} and trying, but {{always with the}} same result--he never knew when, where, or {{how he was going}} to land. As long as he made short jumps he had no trouble, but every time he tried a long jump he lost his balance, and try as he would he couldn't {{discover}} why. So at last he gave up trying and contented himself with short jumps. Finally Old Mother Nature came that way again.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{teenager}} Pollard {{was in a}} heavy metal cover band called Anacrusis, and went to arena shows which he likens to those featured in the documentary Heavy Metal Parking Lot. Pollard has said {{that much of the}} inspiration for his songwriting has come from time spent hanging out with his high school friends from Dayton, a group he calls [...] "The Monument Club". Pollard said of his teenage years:Growing up, I didn’t really have any musical talent. I could always sing, but that’s it. So I started hanging around with all these weirdoes from Northridge who could play guitar. And I would just watch them, ‘Wow, I’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> do that.’ That song ‘Hank’s Little Fingers’ (on Devil Between My Toes) - Hank (Davidson) is the guy that inspired me to play the guitar.

40|$|Purpose: {{with this}} master thesis, Norway’s first {{learning}} factory was built. The {{purpose was to}} conduct a case study and find the learning outcomes students had by partaking on the activity. Approach: a thorough literature review was conducted where the appropriate theories to classify the needed educational processes was found, and embedded into the learning factory design. Further, with the collaboration with co-student Olga Ogorodnyk, the students <b>got</b> <b>to</b> improve the line in means of theories (kaizen, efficiency, waste reduction, pull and push). The students were also interviewed, with the intend of making them evaluate and reflect on the learning process and making it possible <b>to</b> find the <b>learning</b> outcomes. Findings: with the thesis work it was established that {{the design of the}} learning factory provided the intended <b>learning</b> outcomes <b>to</b> be fulfilled. Not only were they fulfilled, also there were found others as well. Value: in regards to research, this thesis contributes to fill the knowledge gap that exist in current learning factory literature. In relation to Norwegian education and society, this thesis helps to highlight the need of implementing learning factories in current education. Furthermore, another value {{is the fact that it}} is the first learning factory built in Norway. Conclusion: students <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> assemble roller skis, as well as <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> work in a <b>learning</b> factory. The students also <b>learned</b> how <b>to</b> improve assembly line in means of theory. From the literature review it was found that <b>learning</b> factories contributes <b>to</b> give an experiential <b>learning</b> that enable people with original thinking and perceptional skills, which can not be learned from conventional learning methods. From the case study, it is clear that the theory is true, and it was highly represented in the statements from students, who claimed that it was a method which made them remember better, and that it was a better method than lectures...|$|R
