50|$|The {{ability to}} get greater {{distance}} into their deliveries out of attack or {{from the middle of}} the field was the main difference between the teams in a low scoring final. Dublin got the inspiration of good starts to both haves but Kilkenny played as though they knew they had the measure of their opponents. The scoring started with two Dublin points (Mary Mernagh), before a pointed free from Helena O’Neill, Dublin started the second half with a goal from Maura Sutton from a Mary Mernagh cross 40 seconds into the second half but it was their last score of the match. Kilkenny equalised 17 minutes into the second half with a long range free from Helena O'Neill and Helena then shot the winning point nine minutes from time. They shot nine wides in the second half. Pádraig Puirséil wrote in the Irish Press:Not for the first time, the All-Ireland and trophy have gone to Kilkenny because of the accuracy from frees of Helena O’Neill. The final provided a sharp contrast in styles, Dublin relying almost entirely on team-work, ground-play and speed to offset the far greater individual skills of the Kilkenny girls. We rarely saw the brilliant passages of play which have characterised other finals in which Kilkenny were engaged, but the close scoring and end-to-end exchanges ensured that excitement and interest were sustained form start to stop with never more than two points between the teams. A well worked goal, finished from a seemingly impossible angle by Maura Sutton sent Dublin two points clear 40 seconds into the second half, and only a wonderful save by Teresa O’Neill prevented them from going further ahead. But Kilkenny, the breeze freshening behind them, got timely impetus when Helena O’Neill pointed a free form 60 yards out.John D Hickey wrote in the Irish Independent: It was never less than a rousing struggle which gave Kilkenny their second title. Damp conditions did not inspire a high scoring rate but there were some excellent chances missed especially by Kilkenny forwards - they had nine second half wides against one for Dublin - and the losers missed out on at least two <b>gilt</b> <b>edged</b> chances for the equalizer in the closing five minutes. Kilkenny’s power lay in a powerful midfield trio of Helen O’Neill, Peggy Carey and captain Mary Fennelly which pushed the winners into almost sustained attack. Their tally, however, was not enhanced by a series of wides often brought about when the ball was not distributed to better placed players. Then there were the saves effected by Sheila Murray in the Dublin goal, leaving Dublin with a chance right up to the final whistle. Perhaps Sheila Murray’s best save was from Carmel Doyle just after Kilkenny had drawn level 12 minutes into the second half.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Between 1996 and 1998, the Bank of England (BoE) {{undertook}} {{structural reforms}} of the UK gilt market designed to improve market liquidity and accessibility. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to ascertain, through the use of a market survey, whether the broad aims of the reforms were achieved. Design/methodology/approach – The research technique used in the paper is direct qualitative survey evidence of the market. It is considered that part of the impact of any structural reform is how the market responds to it. Hence, the actual views of the market are relevant, and this highlights the value of conducting a market survey. Findings – Survey evidence suggests that the reforms were welcomed by market practitioners, and that perceived levels of liquidity had increased in the period following the reforms. From the survey results, it cannot be concluded unequivocally that the reforms led to higher liquidity. Nevertheless, the responses to the critical questions of liquidity and price spread provided evidence that an improvement in market conditions was perceived to have occurred. Practical implications – The survey results suggest that dealing and settlement efficiency in a government bond market is of value to investors. Therefore, BoE-style reforms may be considered for implementation in other sovereign bond markets. Originality/value – The paper is the first direct survey of the UK gilt market, and the first study into the impact of the BoE reforms on market liquidity. As such, it may be of value to sterling market investors as well as the central monetary authorities. <b>Gilt</b> <b>edged</b> securities, Investors, Liquidity, Securities markets...|$|E
