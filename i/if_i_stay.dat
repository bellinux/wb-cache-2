60|$|PERCIVAL. Luggage {{was out of}} the question. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> {{to dinner}} I'm afraid I cant change unless youll lend me some clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I do gang to Broomfield Hills A maid I'll not return; But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> from Broomfield Hills, I'll be a maid mis-sworn." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> Knew <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Stayed</b> around Long Enough, Something like This Would Happen (2006) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> found <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> to {{hear much}} more, I should be {{knocking}} Ned down, so I thought {{it time to}} take leave before he suspected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In a week, at the outside, I {{should be}} {{discovered}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> here: and <b>I</b> {{think that by}} law he could compel me to return to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Course not. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> {{long enough}} to make it pay I'll look her up sure. I ain't no Vanderbilt to stop at two-dollar-a-day hotels." ...|$|E
60|$|Isa. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay,</b> 'tis {{for love}} of my cousin Constance, not of you: I should be loth to leave her in this sad condition.|$|E
6000|$|But Dschemila only replied, 'You {{had better}} go back without me, for I {{am not going}} to leave my mortar behind, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> here till midnight.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no fear," [...] he said. [...] "I shall find it {{possible}} to live there, at any rate. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> where <b>I</b> was, I must have gone mad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no desire}} to make any {{communication}} to you on anything that has occurred, Mr. Slide. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> with you all the afternoon I could tell you nothing more. Good evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will {{be better}} than going without my cup of tea, Mr. Saul, which I should have to do <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> any longer with Mrs. Tubb. And I have got an umbrella." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Course not. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> {{long enough}} to make it pay I'll look her up sure. I'm no Vanderbilt. I can't afford to stop at two-dollar-a-day hotels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we needn't {{worry about}} that; and I guess <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> here any longer, Mr. Torrance will be {{wondering}} where I have gone," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is why I {{hoped to}} get away in time; before she should {{recognise}} me. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> quiet and do all you wish, will you help me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I am. I {{think that}} it is better that I should go away now. There are reasons why I do not want to talk about Lord Arranmore, or discuss this matter with you, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>I</b> might do both. Will you dine with me somewhere on Friday night? I will come and fetch you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean this}} heah. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> around another winter near Allie Lee--with her alone, fer thet trapper never set up before thet fire--I'd--why, Neale, I'd ambush you like an Injun {{when you come}} back!" ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{it was all}} over, Adam said quietly: [...] "I am little, and you are big. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> {{among my}} horse folk I {{should not have been}} whipped. You are afraid to go there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you won't let me thank you, sir, I think I'd better go," [...] I said bluntly. [...] "I'm sure {{to forget}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> here much longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to go, please," [...] she begged. [...] "I shall say foolish things <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> here much longer, and I don't want to. Let me go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It mightn't be prudent. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> longer, I shall, no doubt, feel unequal {{to going}} back at all. My industrious fit's very recent and good resolutions fail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At last {{you have}} come back!" [...] he said; [...] "I was {{determined}} to stop till you did, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> all day. <b>Is</b> anything the matter? Have you got into some worse difficulty than ever?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help going, mother," [...] I says, after a bit. [...] "It's a fine day, and it's our boat. All {{the lads}} {{and girls in}} the village would laugh at me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Elsie {{tucked her}} little feet under the mackintosh. [...] "I know," [...] she said sadly, [...] "I should get web-footed <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> here long, Why, it's like {{coming down from}} Ararat just after the deluge cleared up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you promise}} me something?" [...] Sophy begged. [...] "Promise me that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> in here quietly {{until after he}} has gone, you will come and tell me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to come very much," [...] he said, [...] "only you must be sure to send me away <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> too long. You are tired already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In this lock-up I'm confined; [...] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> long I'll lose my mind. [...] Two {{days and}} nights I've paced the floor, [...] As many others have before." ...|$|E
60|$|Janoo {{pulled me}} over to the shadow in the recess of the carved bow-windows. The boards were up, and the rooms were only lit by one tiny lamp. There was no chance of my being seen <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> still.|$|R
60|$|I {{always loved}} her world--and yet--and yet I think that <b>I</b> would <b>stay</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could <b>stay.</b>|$|R
60|$|FAITH. I know it very well: {{it was not}} {{the first}} time that he has met with me. It was he that came to me when I dwelt {{securely}} at home, and that told me he would burn my house over my head <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I shall <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> at The Horns much longer. What would papa say if {{he heard}} that I {{was going to give}} a lecture at an Institute?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I feel a richer, better {{woman for}} it, and don't believe I shall ever see {{anything}} more satisfactory <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> in Italy ten years,' responded Lavinia, wrapping the red army-blanket ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, it isn't. I'll have it, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> {{down all}} night!' {{and with one}} long breath Josie dived again, leaving nothing but a pair of {{agitated}} feet to be seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I {{heard your}} voice just {{now in the}} other room. Anyhow, this is an awful spooky place. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> here alone half an hour, I'd fancy that the Lord Chancellor up there would step down in his robes, out of his frame, to keep me company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, dear, I {{want you}} to see it as I see it. I know that you will, that you do. I should never be able to forgive myself <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> away now, I--neither of us could ever be happy about it. You do see, don't you?" [...] she implored.|$|R
60|$|One {{solution}} there was, and an easy one--flight. But I {{had promised}} Andrea de Mancini that I would stand beside him at St. Germain; {{there was a}} slender chance of saving him <b>if</b> <b>I</b> went, whilst, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> away, {{there would be nothing}} left for his Eminence to do but to offer up prayers {{for the rest of his}} nephew's soul.|$|R
