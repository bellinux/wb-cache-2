The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris {{in which he}} had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E

5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates <b>in</b> <b>various</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E

5|$|The Triumph of Cleopatra {{illustrates}} {{a scene from}} Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, in which Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a magnificently decorated ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general Mark Antony.

Although not universally admired in the press, the painting was an immediate success, making Etty famous almost overnight.

5|$|In April 2005, New York {{reached a}} {{settlement}} with Super Steel to close the rehabilitation project for $5.5 million, requiring them to stop work on the project, cover remaining costs, and move four unfinished trains into storage at a nearby industrial park.

In 2007, Amtrak and New York settled their own lawsuit, with Amtrak paying New York $20 million. Amtrak and New York further agreed to commit $10 million each to implement track improvements in the Empire Corridor. New York, which was paying $150,000 per year to store the unused trains, auctioned off its four surplus Turboliners in 2012 for $420,000, including spare parts; scrapping began in 2013.|$|E
