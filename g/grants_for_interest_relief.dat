50|$|<b>Interest</b> <b>Relief</b> is {{designed}} to help students meet repayment obligations if they are temporarily unable to make payments on their government student loans because of unemployment or low income. <b>Interest</b> <b>Relief</b> is <b>granted</b> <b>for</b> periods of six months, up to a maximum of 30 months. Some exceptions, such as Canadian residency, may apply. Students may also be eligible for a further 24 months of Extended <b>Interest</b> <b>Relief.</b> Once approved <b>for</b> <b>Interest</b> <b>Relief,</b> students are not required to make payments on either the monthly interest or the outstanding principal of their loan(s) (the federal and/or provincial government will pay the interest on a student's behalf).|$|R

50|$|Reduced-interest {{loans that}} come from and are {{guaranteed}} by the government. Qualifying borrowers, on certain conditions, may be eligible <b>for</b> <b>interest</b> <b>relief</b> offered by the government.For undergraduate and graduate students of any grade level*, from households of any income level. Loan applicants must be enrolled for undergraduate study in a postsecondary institution in Korea. Students do not qualify for this loan program {{if they are in}} a continuing education program through an academic credit bank system or a school outside of Korea. Satisfactory academic performance is part of the eligibility criteria. Loans are subject to credit approval.Loan must be used for tuition, qualifying school fees, and other specific education-related costs, including living expenses during study. Loan payments may not exceed the student’s financial need. Depending on the type of school (i.e. undergraduate, graduate), the upper limit on the amount borrowed ranges from KRW 40 million to KRW 90 million. If applying loan towards both tuition/school fees and in-study living expenses, the lower limit is KRW 600,000 (at least KRW 100,000 for tuition/school fees plus at least KRW 500,000 for living expenses).The repayment system offers a borrower grace period of 10 years or less during which payments only need to be made towards the interest on the loan. This maximum period of time is determined by the borrower’s year in school and the remaining number of years within the standard period of the borrower’s program. After the grace period, the borrower is given up to 10 years in which to repay the loan principal amount and interest. The repayment period is dependent upon the borrower.|$|R

25|$|Missouri Senator Lewis Linn tabled {{legislation}} in 1842, inspired {{in part by}} Floyd's previous efforts. Linn's bill called {{for the government to}} create land <b>grants</b> <b>for</b> men <b>interested</b> in settling the Pacific Northwest. The arrival of Baron Ashburton in April 1842, sent to resolve several territorial disputes with the United States, delayed Linn's legislation. Initially focusing on the Pacific Northwest, Ashburton presented Secretary of State Daniel Webster the 1824 partition proposal made by Canning of a division along the Columbia River. Webster rejected the offer for the same reasons it was previously repudiated; the division would leave the United States with no suitable locations for a large Pacific port. Webster suggested that Ashburton's proposal may have been found acceptable by the Americans, if the United States could be compensated with the Mexican owned San Francisco Bay. Ashburton passed on the offer to his superiors, but no further action was taken. Both diplomats became focused on settling the Aroostook War and formulated the Webster–Ashburton Treaty.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we {{assess the impact}} of {{intergovernmental}} grants on educational spending. First we discuss the theoretical effects of different types of grants. Next we present the general features and findings of 40 published works from the past two decades within this theoretical frame-work. We highlight the studies for the specific problems they set out to analyze, the models constructed, and the statistical procedure used. Fi-nally, based on the review of these studies, we provide some approximate estimates of the impact on educational spending of categorical grants, matching grants, block grants, and general revenue sharing grants. We also discuss some of the conceptual and statistical issues involved in assessing the impact of intergovernmental grants on educational spending. Currently there is renewed interest among policy and research specialists in school finance on the use of intergovernmental <b>grants</b> <b>for</b> education. Such <b>interest</b> can be traced to two important and recent movements. First, tax limitation movements in some states restrict the amount of tax revenue from property ta...|$|R
50|$|Bavaria {{passed a}} law on 10 November 1861 that {{guaranteed}} the company a <b>grant</b> of <b>interest</b> <b>for</b> a total investment of {{one and a half}} million gulden. The concession followed on 28 June of the following year. Already the Maxau Railway had been opened on the Baden side from Karlsruhe to the right (eastern) bank of the Rhine near the hamlet of Maxau on 5 August 1862. The Winden-Maximiliansau section was approved on 14 March 1864. Although it ran through Minfeld, a district to the south-east of Winden, it did not have a station, because a cattle trough had had to be relocated for the track construction and this had led to conflicts.|$|R
