5|$|Despite this, {{or perhaps}} because of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and he received a command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E

25|$|Eilmer was a monk of Malmesbury Abbey and {{is known}} to have written on astrology. All that is known of him is told in the Gesta regum Anglorum (Deeds of the English Kings), written by the eminent medieval {{historian}} William of Malmesbury in about 1125. Being a fellow monk of the same abbey, William almost certainly obtained his account directly from people who knew Eilmer himself when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday night, April 13, Betty Jo Booker, age 15, {{was playing}} her alto {{saxophone}} in her regular weekly gig with her band, The Rythmaires, at the VFW Club at W. 4th and Oak Street. She did not finish until about 1:30a.m. Sunday. She {{waited for her}} friend since kindergarten, Paul Martin, age 16, to pick her up. Martin was in town after moving away to Kilgore two years prior. He had been with her earlier that day before the dance and was {{to take her to}} a slumber party across town. Booker's classmates said that earlier that day she told them that {{she did not want to}} go out with Martin but felt obligated since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> friend.|$|E

500|$|Health workers {{played an}} {{important}} role in documenting the injuries, which were at the time downplayed or denied by the government of Bahrain. Rheumatologist Fatima Haji, for example, appeared on Al Jazeera television news in a [...] "hysterical" [...] state, describing Isa Abdul Hasan, a man in his 60s who died in her hospital of a head wound he had received from police: [...] "I just started shouting: 'What the hell did this guy do, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man. What did he do to deserve this?'" [...] She later stated that following her arrest, her interrogations were centered on this television appearance.|$|E
2500|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, the {{conservative}} Milner came {{to the aid of}} people {{from the other end of}} the political spectrum. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> family friend of Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist Stephen Henry Hobhouse—in fact, he was Stephen's proxy godfather. [...] In 1917, when Margaret was working to get her son and other British conscientious objectors freed from prison, Milner discreetly helped, intervening with high government officials. [...] As a result, in December 1917 more than 300 COs were released from prison on medical grounds.|$|E
2500|$|Creedence Clearwater Revival was {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Robertson in performing three songs: [...] "Who'll Stop the Rain", [...] "Born on the Bayou" [...] and [...] "Green River". During the induction speech, Springsteen said, [...] "As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist.

2500|$|One {{of the two}} {{remaining}} warriors from the ravine was Charging Bear, who later became a U.S. Army Indian Scout. [...] They had 24 cartridges remaining among them, and bodies had been used as shields. [...] Finerty wrote that [...] "the skull of one poor squaw was blown, literally, to atoms, revealing the ridge of the palate and presenting a most ghastly and revolting spectacle. [...] Another of the dead females was so riddled with bullets that {{there appeared to be}} no unwounded part of her person left." [...] Crook ordered the remaining bodies removed from the cave. [...] "Several soldiers jumped at once into the ravine and bore out the corpses of the warrior killed by Pourier and three dead squaws." [...] "The old Indian Big Bat Pourier had killed was unceremoniously hauled up by what hair remained and a leather belt around the middle. The body had stiffened in death in the posture of an old man holding a gun, which was the way he shot. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man, and his features wore a look of grim determination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even more diversified {{than his}} {{activities}} in local affairs was {{his participation in}} those that concerned {{the state as a}} whole. Never a politician, and {{to the end of his}} days allowing such honors and offices as came to him to come unsought and unfought for, he nevertheless early became identified with the political life of his state. Starting as a Republican, he was nominated for state senator from the fourth district in 1867, but was not elected. In 1884 he was one of the [...] "independents" [...] who refused to support James G. Blaine, and was chosen president of the Republican organization in Connecticut. The greatest of his political honors came to him when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man. Automatically retired from the position of chief justice of the supreme court, February 5, 1910, because he had reached the age limit of seventy years, he that year was nominated for governor on the Democratic ticket and was elected. At the Democratic National Convention in June 1912 he received twenty votes for the presidential nomination. In November of the same year he was elected governor of his state, nominally strongly Republican, for a second term of two years. He was Democratic candidate for United States senator from Connecticut for the term beginning March 4, 1915. Caught in a Republican landslide and defeated by incumbent Senator Frank B. Brandegee, he nevertheless ran ahead of his party ticket by several thousand votes.|$|E
2500|$|With all of Scarfo's loyalists serving lengthy prison terms, {{it became}} clear that Scarfo {{would not be able to}} {{maintain}} control of the family from prison much longer. To avoid a total power vacuum in the Philadelphia Mafia, Sicilian-born mobster John Stanfa helped run the family for Scarfo. With the support and endorsement of the influential Gambino crime family in New York, Stanfa was named boss of the Philadelphia crime family in 1991. To many older Mafia members, and especially in the eyes of the New York crime families, Stanfa had substantial mafia credentials. He was born in Sicily to a Sicilian Mafia family, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> friend of Gambino boss Carlo Gambino, and he had served as a bodyguard and driver for the respected late Angelo Bruno starting in the 1960s. However, Stanfa was less respected in Philadelphia, especially among the new generation of young Philadelphia street mobsters. The New York Mafia's intrusion in Philadelphia Mafia affairs was not well received by many of these mobsters, who saw Stanfa as an outsider and unsuitable to run the Philadelphia family. Many of these young mobsters, born and raised on the streets of Philadelphia, were the next generation of jailed Scarfo lieutenants and capos. Deeply resentful of having been overlooked by the meddling New York families and dismissed by many of the older, more traditional Philadelphia mobsters, the new generation of mobsters felt it was their turn to run the crime family. This group of young, ruthless, overly ambitious men were led by Joseph [...] "Skinny Joey" [...] Merlino, the son of former underboss Salvatore Merlino.|$|E
