40|$|In {{opportunistic}} networks, putting {{devices in}} energy saving mode {{is crucial to}} preserve their battery, and hence to increase the lifetime of the network and foster user participation. A popular strategy for energy saving is <b>duty</b> <b>cycling.</b> However, when in energy saving mode, users cannot communicate with each other. The side effects of <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> are twofold. On the one hand, <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> may {{reduce the number of}} usable contacts for delivering messages, increasing intercontact times and delays. On the other hand, <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> may break long contacts into smaller contacts, thus also reducing the capacity of the opportunistic network. Despite the potential serious effects, the role played by <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> in opportunistic networks has been often neglected in the literature. In order to fill this gap, in this paper we propose a general model for deriving the pairwise contact and intercontact times measured when a <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> policy is superimposed on the original encounter process determined only by node mobility. The model we propose is general, i. e., not bound to a specific distribution of contact and intercontact times, and very accurate, as we show exploiting two traces of real human mobility for validation. Using this model, we derive several interesting results about the properties of measured contact and intercontact times with duty cycling: their distribution, how their coefficient of variation changes depending on the duty cycle value, how the <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> affects the capacity and delay of an opportunistic network. The applicability of these results is broad, ranging from performance models for opportunistic networks that factor in the <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> effect, to the optimisation of the duty cycle to meet a certain target performance.

40|$|Abstract—Energy {{conservation}} {{and reliability of}} wireless communications are two crucial requirements of practical sensor networks. Radio <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> is a widely used mechanism to reduce energy consumption of sensor devices and to increase the lifetime of the network. A side effect of radio <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> {{is that it can}} cause the wireless communications to be unreliable—if a sender node transmits a packet while the receiver is asleep, the communication fails. Early <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> protocols like B-MAC thatwere designedfor bitstreamingradios achieve low dutycycle by keeping the radio transceiver awake for short time periods. However, they require a transmitter node to precede a packet transmission with a long preamble to ensure the reliability of wireless communication. Furthermore, they cannot be used with modern packet radios likewidelyused IEEE 802. 15. 4 based radio transceivers, which cannot transmit arbitrarily long preambles. Recent <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> schemes like X-MAC, on the other hand, reduce the length of the preamble and are designed to work with packet radios. However, {{in order to ensure that}} a receiver can reliably detect a transmitter’s preamble transmission, these schemes need to turn the radio transceiver on for longer time durations than the early schemes like B-MAC. In this paper, we present a novel <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> scheme called QuickMAC, that achieves a very low duty cycle without compromising the reliability of wireless communication. Furthermore, QuickMAC is stateless, compatible with packet (and bit stream) radios, and does not require synchronization among sensor nodes. From our experiments using TMote sky motes, we show that QuickMAC reduces duty cycle by a factor of about 4 compared to X-MAC, and yet maintains the same level of reliability of wireless communication as X-MAC.

However, <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> in WCNs is made complex by the camera nodes having to anticipate the arrival of the objects in their field-of-view. What adds to this complexity is the fact that radio <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> and camera <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> are tightly coupled notions in WCNs. Abstract In this dissertation, we present a predictive framework to provide camera nodes with an ability to anticipate the arrival of an object in the field-of-view of their cameras. This allows a predictive adaption of network parameters simultaneously in multiple layers. Such anticipatory approach is made possible by enabling each camera node in the network to track an object beyond its direct sensing range and to adapt network parameters in multiple layers before the arrival of the object in its sensing range. The proposed framework exploits a single spare bit in the MAC header of the 802. 15. 4 protocol for creating this beyond-the-sensing-rage capability for the camera nodes. In this manner, our proposed approach for notifying the nodes about {{the current state of the}} object location entails no additional communication overhead. Our experimental evaluations based on large-scale simulations as well as an Imote 2 -based wireless camera network demonstrate that the proposed predictive adaptation approach, while providing comparable application-level performance, significantly reduces energy consumption compared to the approaches addressing only a single layer adaptation or those with reactive adaptation. ...|$|E

We also give two lower bounds: 15 11, for k ≥ 4, and 65, for k = 3, and provide experimental evidence suggesting that these lower bounds are tight.

We address different problems related with broadcasting, <b>duty</b> <b>cycling,</b> {{and capacity}} improvement by sensing different network conditions and dynamically adapting to them. We propose two cross layer broadcasting protocols called CASBA and CMAB which dynamically adapt to network conditions of congestion and mobility. We also propose a broadcasting protocol called DASBA which dynamically adapts to local node density. CASBA, CMAB, and DASBA improve the reachability while minimizing the broadcast cost. <b>Duty</b> <b>cycling</b> is an efficient mechanism to conserve energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Existing <b>duty</b> <b>cycling</b> techniques are unable to handle the contention under dynamic traffic loads. Our proposed protocol called SA-RI-MAC handles traffic contention much more efficiently than RI-MAC without sacrificing the energy efficiency. It improves the delivery ratio with a significant reduction in the latency and energy consumption. Due to limited battery life and fault tolerance issues posed by WSNs, efficient methods which ensure reliable coverage are highly desirable. One solution is to use disjoint set covers to cover the targets. We formulate a problem called MDC which addresses the maximum coverage by using disjoint set covers S 1 and S 2. We prove that MDC is NP-complete and propose a √n-approximation algorithm for the MDC problem to cover n targets. The use of multi-channel MAC protocols improves the capacity of wireless networks. Efficient multi-channel MAC protocols aim to utilize multiple channels effectively. Our proposed multi-channel MAC protocol called LCV-MMAC effectively utilizes the multiple channels by handling the control channel saturation.
