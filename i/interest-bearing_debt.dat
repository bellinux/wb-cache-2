40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} religion on the earnings management practices and capital structure of Malaysian firms. While prior studies have been useful in identifying economic factors affecting earnings management and capital structure decisions, the prior research has ignored cultural factors generally and religion specifically. My study attempts to augment this research by investigating whether religion, a non-economic motive, has any influence on management decisions related to earnings management and capital structure. In particular, I contrast the behaviour of Muslim and non-Muslim managers in Malaysia. Because Islam discourages <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debts,</b> I first hypothesise that Muslim managed firms use less <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debts</b> and preference shares relative to straight equity than the non-Muslim managed firms. Using a sample of 1607 firm-year observations over the period 1987 - 1998 {{and a series of}} univariate and multivariate analyses, I find that the firms' capital structure decisions are not influenced by the religious orientation of their managers. This suggests that Muslim managers and non-Muslim managers behave alike when making capital financing decisions. While this is contrary to expectations, a possible reason for this finding is that Islamic debt instruments were only available after 1991, and Muslim managed firms that had already issued ordinary debt capital were not able to switch to Islamic debt within the timeframe covered by the study. Another possible reason is that Muslim managers do not adhere strictly to the teachings of Islam and are influenced by the Western economic system. Second, I establish the argument that Islam prohibits earnings management practices and hypothesise that Muslim managed firms are less likely to manage earnings than their non-Muslim counterparts. I analyse the data from 170 Malaysian firms listed on the KLSE since 1980 using four common earnings management detecting models, i. e., the Healy, DeAngelo, Jones, and Modified Jones models. The results of the univariate and multivariate analysis are mixed. Tests using the Healy model provide some support for the earnings management hypothesis while the others do not. However, on balance, I conclude that religion does not affect the earnings management practices of Malaysian firms...|$|R

Until 1812, the French occupants requisitioned in money and kind from various corporations and persons, especially by billetting soldiers on cities, further contributions additionally amounting to between 146 and 309 million francs, according to different calculations. The Prussian government indebtedness soared between 1806 and 1815 by thaler 200 million to altogether 180.09 million <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debts,</b> 11.24 million non-interest-bearing unconsolidated treasury notes and another 25.9 million former provincial debts assumed by the royal government. The cities' debts, {{especially those of}} Berlin often billetted on, were not assumed by the Prussian government. Since the creditors deemed Prussia to be over-indebted in 1817, the 4-per cent state bonds were traded at the bourses with a disagio of 27 to 29 per cent, in 1818 even with a discountor of 35 per cent, causing the effective interest to rise to 6.15 per cent. At restructuring part of the debts in 1818 by a £5 million loan (= thaler 30 million) at 5% at the London financial market, the Prussian government had to accept a disagio of 28⅓%, thus paying an annual effective rate of 6.98%.|$|R

However, the ratio can be more discerning as to what is actually a borrowing, as opposed to other types of obligations that might exist on the balance sheet under the liabilities section. For example, often only the liabilities accounts that are actually labelled as [...] "debt" [...] on the balance sheet are used in the numerator, instead of the broader category of [...] "total liabilities". In other words, actual borrowings like bank loans and <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debt</b> securities are used, as opposed to the broadly inclusive category of total liabilities which, in addition to debt-labelled accounts, can include accrual accounts like unearned revenue.|$|E

40|$|IN a {{paper that}} has already become a classic, Sargent and Wallace (1981, 1984) (reprinted in Sargent (1986)) {{explored}} some unfamiliar implications of the government budget constraint and proposed a "fiscal theory of inflation. " Once the real per capita stock of non-monetary, <b>interest-bearing</b> government <b>debt</b> stabilises (say because it reaches some upper limit reflecting real resource constraints), and with the primary deficit (the public sector deficit net of interest payments) treated as exogenous, monetary growth is endogenously or residually determined by the requirement that {{the real value of}} seigniorage (the real value of nominal money stock increases) should satisfy the government budget constraint. Their paper then goes on to analyse the consequences for inflation, in the short run and in the long run, of short-run changes in monetary growth not accompanied by changes in the primary deficit.

40|$|The War for Independence (1775 - 1783) {{left the}} federal {{government}} deeply in debt. The spoils from winning that war also gave it an empire of land. So, post- 1783 was the government solvent—or {{at what point did}} it become solvent? While this question has not been addressed before, knowing the answer is important for understanding how the method for funding the national debt was chosen, how the adoption of the new Constitution in 1789 affected public finance, and how this new untried government—that was deeply in debt and had been in default on this debt for half a decade after independence—could garner an excellent credit rating by the early 1790 s. Evidence is gathered on the government’s liabilities and assets to estimate its net worth and so answer these questions. I. Liabilities Figure 1 shows the government’s debt position from 1784 to 1802. During the revolution the government issued two types of liabilities, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing debt. Official statistics exist only for the government’s <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debt</b> after 1791. The rest of the data in Figure 1 was estimated (Grubb, 2005). By 1780 a total of 200 million dollars in non-interest-bearing debt—Continental dollars (paper money) —had been issued, none after 1779, and by 1782 a total of 39 million dollars of <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debt,</b> mostly at 6 percent annual interest, had been issued. These debts are assumed to be the government’s only liabilities. Pre- 1789 {{the federal government}} (Congress) did not have the constitutional power to directly tax the public. Instead, Congress requested monies from state governments 1 who in turn taxed their citizens to raise the monies requested. Congress asked the states to accept its Continental dollars for payment of state taxes which could then be used to meet the states ’ money obligations to Congress. Continental dollars so paid into the U. S. Treasury were burnt. Desperate for specie, Congress also allowed the states after 1781 to meet their money obligations to Congress by paying one dollar in specie in place of 40 Continental dollars—temporarily defaulting on the face value of its non-interest-bearing debt. Through the above payment/retirement mechanism the outstanding face value of the non-interest-bearing debt fell from 200 million dollars in 1780 to 81 million by 179...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} whether {{eliminating the}} stock of government debt outstanding would reduce welfare. It models an economy with three assets—currency, government bonds, and storage, a transactions role for money, and a demand for liquidity and thus a role for banks. The Friedman rule is not optimal in this economy, so there is potentially a role for interest-bearing, risk-free government bonds. Because the government must raise enough revenue to meet its interest obligations on any bonds outstanding, the social value of government debt hinges on whether the benefits from greater portfolio diversification outweigh {{the costs associated with}} the necessary revenue-raising efforts. The paper shows that a positive stock of government debt is optimal only if interest payments on the debt are financed via money creation, agents are not too risk averse, there is a primary government budget deficit, and the economy is operating on the bad side of the Laffer curve. But under these conditions, welfare would be even higher if monetary policy were conducted to put the economy on the good side of the Laffer curve and there were no government bonds outstanding. Thus, there is little support for keeping a stock of <b>interest-bearing,</b> risk-free government <b>debt</b> outstanding. Fiscal policy; Monetary policy; Debts, Public...|$|R
40|$|Using {{detailed}} data from an online service, I analyze {{the influence of}} present bias on debt paydown behavior. Each user’s sensitivity of consumption spending to paycheck receipt proxies for his short-run impatience.

Consistent with present bias, planned paydown is significantly more predictive of actual paydown for sophisticated agents than naive agents and higher measured impatience reduces paydown for sophisticated agents only. The findings are inconsistent with several alternative explanations, including credit constraints. In 2010, nearly 70 % of households in the United States {{had at least one}} credit card.
