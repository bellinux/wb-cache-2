5|$|Distinguishing {{between these}} two models would require more {{information}} about the planet's radius or composition. The planet <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> transit its star, which makes obtaining this information impossible with current observational capabilities.|$|E

5|$|More {{controversial}} is {{the addition}} of ezetimibe, which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut. While it reduces LDL cholesterol, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the intima-media thickness.

5|$|Some older {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that statin therapy might reduce vasospasm, but a subsequent meta-analysis including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either vasospasm or outcomes. While corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity may help prevent vasospasm their use <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> change outcomes.|$|E
