40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the time domain {{envelope}} measurements based analysis of power amplifiers {{in order to improve}} both linearity and efficiency of microwave transmitters. First of all, a versatile time domain envelope test bench is presented. Then, two applications related to those RF PA measurements are reported. The first application concerns linearity characterization that can be specified in term of Noise Power Ratio (NPR) and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). Those figures of merit are essential to compute the final bit error rate in a system level simulation tool. A relationship between NPR and EVM is presented and validated by measurements. As a result it can be advantageously used to simplify simulation and measurement procedures for the linearity characterisation of devices and subsystems. The second application is regarding enhancement of the trade-off between linearity and energy efficiency. In order to have a good efficiency, a 10 W class-B GaN Power amplifier is considered. The work presented here, proposes a solution for linearity specifications at large output power back-off thanks to a dynamic gate bias control related to low <b>instantaneous</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>power</b> level. Meanwhile, a dynamic drain bias control handles good efficiency at a constant gain for high <b>instantaneous</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>power</b> level. The measurement-based gate and drain bias trajectory extraction will be fully detailed and take into account GaN dispersive effects such as thermal and trapping effects...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores a new {{technique}} to calculate and plot the distribution of <b>instantaneous</b> transmit <b>envelope</b> <b>power</b> of OFDMA and SC-FDMA signals from the equation of Probability Density Function (PDF) solved numerically. The Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of Instantaneous Power to Average Power Ratio (IPAPR) is computed from {{the structure of the}} transmit system matrix. This helps intuitively understand the distribution of output signal power if the structure of the transmit system matrix and the constellation used are known. The distribution obtained for OFDMA signal matches complex normal distribution. The results indicate why the CCDF of IPAPR in case of SC-FDMA is better than OFDMA for a given constellation. Finally, with this method it is shown again that cyclic prefixed DS-CDMA system is one case with optimum IPAPR. The insight that this technique provides may be useful in designing area optimised digital and power efficient analogue modules. ...|$|R
