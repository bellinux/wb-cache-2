5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the members of the Ministerium {{intended}} for this to be a permanent break, or a temporary protest. Regardless, it became permanent when the officials at the next Gathering of the General Synod refused to admit the <b>delegates</b> <b>from</b> the Ministerium. Thus, the Ministerium found themselves on their own.|$|E
5|$|Mathias' {{candidacy}} consideration did not endear him to {{the conservative}} wing of the Maryland Republican Party organization. In June 1976, he lost a vote by state Republicans to determine who would represent Maryland on the platform committee at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Instead, the group chose George Price, a conservative member of the Maryland House of <b>Delegates</b> <b>from</b> Baltimore County. At one point, Mathias was close to being denied attendance to the convention altogether as an at-large delegate, but a last minute compromise ensured all Republican congressional representatives seats as at-large delegates. Mathias maintained a low profile during the convention, and received harsh criticism {{from some of the}} conservative <b>delegates</b> <b>from</b> Maryland who attended.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} Rugby World Cup {{had been}} {{suggested}} on numerous occasions {{going back to the}} 1950s, but met with opposition from most unions in the IRFB. The idea resurfaced several times in the early 1980s, with the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) in 1983, and the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) in 1984 independently proposing the establishment of a world cup. A proposal was again put to the IRFB in 1985 and this time successfully passed 10–6. The <b>delegates</b> <b>from</b> Australia, France, New Zealand and South Africa all voted for the proposal, and the <b>delegates</b> <b>from</b> Ireland and Scotland against; the English and Welsh delegates were split, with one from each country for and one against.|$|E

5|$|A Venetian confidant on Hvar reported, in 1498, the Ottoman {{preparation}} of 25 ships for sea attack on Krajina and Kačićs. In the next year, they became Ottoman subjects. In 1500, the Split monarch reported to Venice that Ottomans captured several <b>delegates</b> <b>from</b> Split, and that safely arrived in Mostar only thanks to knez Juraj Marković, an Ottoman subject and Venetian friend. Marković wrote from Makarska to Venice {{that he was}} knez for 15 years and always {{a friend of the}} Venetians. In the Marković collection and archive, D.

The new city charter also tripled {{the size of the}} city to include the new rural parks (such as Forest Park) and the useful riverfront from the MissouriMississippi confluence to the mouth of the River Des Peres. After a fraudulent election initially showed a rejection of the plan, a recount in December 1876 showed voters had approved the separation.|$|E
5|$|At {{one meeting}} in October 1853, he shared the {{platform}} with John B. Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two <b>delegates</b> <b>from</b> Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1850s, St. Louis hosted annual {{agricultural}} and mechanical fairs at Fairground Park {{to connect with}} regional manufacturers and growers. By the 1880s, the connection to agriculture had declined, and in 1883, a new St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall was built to house industrial exhibits. In 1890, St. Louis attempted to host the World's Columbian Exposition, but the project was awarded to Chicago, which hosted the exposition in 1893. In 1899, <b>delegates</b> <b>from</b> states that {{had been part of}} the Louisiana Purchase met in St. Louis, selecting it as the site of a world's fair celebrating the centennial of the purchase in 1904.|$|E

On June 25, 1788, he joined Jefferson County delegates Robert Breckinridge and Rice Bullock in voting for ratification. Ten other Kentucky delegates opposed ratification and one abstained. The final convention vote was 8979 in favor of ratification. It was reported that even the Jefferson County delegates were beginning to waver in {{their commitment to the}} proposed constitution, but that Marshall steeled their resolve and also influenced several <b>delegates</b> <b>from</b> other parts of Virginia to favor it.|$|E

Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, Robert Potter called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the Alamo. Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Maine Republicans {{refused to}} pass more anti-alcohol legislation, and Dow quit {{the party to}} join the Prohibitionists; he {{instantly}} became the party's most prominent member.

The convention that met in Cleveland that June welcomed <b>delegates</b> <b>from</b> twelve states, but attracted almost no attention from the press. Dow himself did not attend, staying home with his ailing wife (candidates for a party's nomination often did not attend conventions in person at that time). He was nominated, heading a ticket with vice-presidential nominee Henry A. Thompson of Ohio.|$|E
