5|$|Beginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> {{industry}} to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, {{the top two}} private employers in the city are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (26,000 employees) and the West Penn Allegheny Health System (13,000 employees).|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{production}} stages, {{the album}} was not referred to as Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994 - 2000, but rather by its alternative title; <b>From</b> <b>Heavy</b> Metal to Centenary Medal. It is unknown when the band decided on the final title of the album.|$|E

5|$|Arise is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! and Metal Forces. Arise is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous album, Beneath the Remains, {{it was clear that}} the Sepultura sound was acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although a substantial amount of water was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{mainstream}} Arabic pop, {{there is a}} growing independent music scene in the city which includes many bands that have sizable audiences across the Arab world. Local Ammani bands along with other bands in the Middle East gather in the Roman Theatre during the Al-Balad Music Festival held annually in August. Music genres of the local bands are diverse, ranging <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> metal to Arabic rock, jazz and rap. Performers include JadaL, Torabyeh, Bilocate, Akher Zapheer, Autostrad and El Morabba3.|$|E

5|$|Before Iris {{moved through}} the Lesser Antilles, {{tropical}} storm watches, and later warnings, were issued from Barbados through the British Virgin Islands. The storm produced tropical storm force winds across the eastern Caribbean, although the primary meteorological event occurred <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall. Flooding prompted evacuations in communities in Saint Lucia, Dominica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Iris {{was the first of}} three storms in a three-week period to affect the region, preceding the more destructive hurricanes Luis and Marilyn.|$|E
5|$|During this period, {{the style}} of the {{building}} was changed <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> Romanesque into Early English Gothic. Although the base Norman columns were left alone, lancet pointed arches were placed over them in the triforium and some heavy columns were substituted with clustered pillars. The steeple was erected in 1221 and the cathedral was rededicated by Bishop Roger Niger in 1240.|$|E
5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction.

25|$|However, {{recently}} {{it has also}} benefited <b>from</b> <b>heavier</b> tourism, since the capital city has gained prestige and status as a national destination for its colonial beauty and cleanliness. In addition, the haciendas and baths around the state have historic and recreational importance.|$|R
50|$|While the album's songs range <b>from</b> <b>heavier</b> death metal {{to a more}} melodic thrash metal, it was the singer's {{ability to}} go from his {{distinct}} sound to a death metal growl while blending the two that has been truly noted as trademark Testament.|$|R
5|$|Most {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} storm was Martinique, which received 26.8in (680mm) of rainfall in a 24‑hour period. The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, resulting in about $34million in damage (1970USD); 186homes were destroyed, and 700people were left homeless. The flooding killed up to 50people on the island. Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, the storm killed one person on Dominica <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall, and in Guadeloupe heavy damage to the banana crop was reported.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Odette's {{predicted}} arrival, the Dominican Republic government {{issued for}} {{the evacuation of}} more than 10,000people, mostly from those living near rivers. At least 2,000 shelters were set up, capable of housing up to 800,000people. In addition, the government mobilized the army to force those unwilling to leave from their homes. Such precautions were taken due to already saturated grounds <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall three weeks prior.|$|E
50|$|The Safe bottle lamp, called sudeepa or sudipa {{for good}} lamp, is a safer {{kerosene}} lamp designed by Wijaya Godakumbura of Sri Lanka. The safety comes <b>from</b> <b>heavier</b> glass, a secure screw-on metal lid, and two flat sides which {{prevent it from}} rolling if knocked over.|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} with a strapping, although in practice both terms {{are also used}} unprecisely as synonyms, is that a strap is harder, made <b>from</b> <b>heavier</b> and/or thicker leather, and may be specially made for discipline and have a handle (notably a prison strap), unlike a 'real' belt.|$|R
50|$|This {{change in}} rate results <b>from</b> <b>heavier</b> isotopologues having a lower velocity/mobility and an {{increased}} stability from the higher dissociation energies {{when compared to the}} compounds containing lighter isotopes. The study of kinetic isotope effects can help the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of certain chemical reactions.|$|R
5|$|The {{noble gases}} have full valence {{electron}} shells. Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium, {{making it easier}} to remove outer electrons <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> noble gases.|$|E
5|$|Active and schooling, {{the black}} dogfish is an {{opportunistic}} predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters {{of four to}} 40 pups that are sustained to term by a yolk sac. There is no well-defined breeding season, and mating and birthing take place year-round. The black dogfish contributes significantly to the bycatch of deep-sea commercial fisheries operating in the North Atlantic; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded. As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species under Least Concern overall. It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic, where its numbers may have declined <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Although Bolaven {{struck the}} Ryukyu Islands as a {{powerful}} typhoon, damage was less than expected. Relatively few buildings were damaged or destroyed across the region. The most significant effects stemmed <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> rains, amounting to , that caused flash flooding and landslides. One person drowned on Amami Ōshima after being swept away by a swollen river. In mainland Japan, two people drowned after being swept away by rough seas. In South Korea, 19 people {{were killed by the}} storm. Many buildings were damaged and approximately 1.9million homes were left without power. Losses in the country reached ₩420billion (US$374.3million), the majority of which was due to destroyed apple orchards. Significant damage also took place in North Korea where at least 59 people were killed and 50 others were reported missing. Additionally, 6,700 homes were destroyed. Offshore, nine people drowned after two Chinese vessels sank.|$|E

5|$|At 7 am on 7 April, the Viet Cong massed {{for another}} ground assault {{from the north}} and west of Lộc Ninh, with support <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> artillery, tanks and armored {{personnel}} carriers. As the Viet Cong closed in, Vinh and his bodyguards ran out the opened gate and surrendered. Several South Vietnamese soldiers also tried to surrender, but they all returned to their positions after Smith stopped a South Vietnamese officer from raising a white T-shirt up the flagpole. By 8 am, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment was completely overwhelmed when the Viet Cong overran the southern compound with their superior numbers. At around 10 am, all tactical air support was called off in order to clear the way for B-52 strikes against Viet Cong formations west of Lộc Ninh. However, the B-52 strikes could not prevent the Viet Cong from overrunning Lộc Ninh. By 16:30, the Viet Cong were in complete control of Lộc Ninh District.|$|E
5|$|By November 1808, the Napoleonic Wars {{had lasted}} five years. Although the French had conquered large swathes of {{mainland}} Europe, {{they were unable}} to exert any significant influence at sea, where the British Royal Navy had been dominant since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. A vital part of Royal Navy strategy was the implementation of a close blockade of the major French seaports by squadrons of frigates and ships of the line, intended to intercept and capture any ships attempting to enter or leave French harbours. The greatest French Atlantic seaport, and consequently the most important target for the Royal Navy, was Brest, situated on the Northern Biscay coast. Watching Brest were a large number of warships, divided into the inshore squadron designed to watch the coast directly and formed principally of frigates and small fast vessels, and the offshore squadron formed <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> ships of the line and tasked with intercepting French fleets and battle squadrons spotted by the inshore squadron.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out <b>from</b> <b>heavy</b> water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
5000|$|Warmbloods are a {{group of}} middle-weight horse types and breeds {{primarily}} originating in Europe and registered with organizations that are characterized by open studbook policy, studbook selection, and the aim of breeding for equestrian sport. The term distinguishes these horses <b>from</b> both <b>heavy</b> draft horses ("cold bloods") and refined light saddle horses such as the Thoroughbred, Arabian, and Akhal-Teke ("hot bloods"). Although modern warmbloods are descended <b>from</b> <b>heavier</b> agricultural types systematically upgraded by hotblood influence, the term {{does not imply that}} warmbloods are direct crosses of [...] "cold" [...] and [...] "hot".|$|R
