A simple Debye sheath model will be shown to be adequate. From this the sheath field responsible for ion acceleration has been shown to expand at superluminal speeds, leading to very large ion-emission regions on the target's rear surface; a new explanation for the dynamics of the ion-accelerating sheath field accounts for this observation and demonstrates the <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> the angular divergence of the injected electron beam, crucial to fast ignition, from the lateral extent of the ion emission. However, it is shown that on careful probing the sheath field can provide unique insight into details of the fast electron's distribution function.

In order to analyze the reasonableness of the structural design and test {{the performance of the}} test bed, a three-dimensional solid simulation model of the test bed is set up first with virtual simulation technology to analyze motion characteristics of test-bed and modal analysis to analyze the vibration characteristics of the key components.

It gives a list of the sensors which smartphones contain and it briefly describes their function in ordinary use and their use for the measuring not only physical quantities. Sensors of the mechanical quantities are documented in a greater extent. The measurement limits are addressed as well as the information what <b>inaccuracies</b> <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> quantities can be expected. The study also deals with the added devices which help to overcome the limits of inbuilt sensors and by that they make the measurement more accurate. A review of several researches on already made measurements of the mechanical quantities with smartphones is also given. The last part of the study describes an experiment during which six mobile phones with Android system and six applications were tested by measuring a pink noise signal. Two main facts follows from the results. The measurement with a phone calibrated previously cannot be considered as reliable, the errors can be in the rate of tens of decibels. Whereas phones after calibration in the levels range 45 – 85 dB, when the measuring error is linear, can be used for measurement of the noise with the error less than 2 dB...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} dynamic {{thermocouple}} compensation is considered. Taking {{into account the}} nonlinear dependency of the thermocouple time constant on fluid velocity, a thermocouple model and a time constant model are proposed successively for estimation of nonlinear thermocouple time constant. This technique is most suitable for measuring dynamic temperature because of the precise description of time constant. The improve scheme offers better compensation of the thermocouple response. The parameter estimation is performed using GTLS {{to cope with the}} noise present on the regressors and the output. Instruction In many industrial applications, thermocouples are used due to their high credibility and good linear dependence with temperature. However there are drawbacks of thermocouples, the most important of which is <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> high frequency temperature fluctuations [1]. So, by establishment of the dynamic model, thermocouple input can be reconstructed. In general, thermocouple was model as a first order nonlinear model. Time constant is the undetermined parameter of the model. As the present research，a fixed (mean) time constant [2] is almost always used, although it is variable in fluctuating velocity and thermal field. The simplification of th...|$|E
40|$|When a robot is {{required}} to perform specific tasks defined in the world frame, {{there is a need}} for finding the coordinate transformation between the kinematic base frame of the robot and the world frame. The kinematic base frame used by the robot controller to define and evaluate the kinematics may deviate from the mechanical base frame constructed based on structural features. Besides, by using kinematic modeling rules such as the product of exponentials (POE) formula, the base frame can be arbitrarily located, and does not have to be related to any feature of the mechanical structure. As a result, the kinematic base frame cannot be measured directly. This paper proposes to find the kinematic base frame by solving a hand-eye calibration problem using 3 D position measurements only, which avoids the inconvenience and <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> orientations and thus significantly facilitates practical operations. A closed-form solution and an iterative solution are explicitly formulated and proved effective by simulations. Comprehensive analyses of the impact of key parameters to the accuracy of the solution are also carried out, providing four guidelines to better conduct practical operations. Finally, experiments on a 7 -DOF industrial robot are performed with an optical tracking system to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method using position data only over the method using full pose data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} dynamic transmit covariance {{design in}} point-to-point MIMO fading systems with unknown channel state distributions and inaccurate channel state information subject to both long term and short term power constraints. First, {{the case of}} instantaneous but possibly inaccurate channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is treated. By extending the drift-plus-penalty technique, a dynamic transmit covariance policy is developed and is shown to approach optimality with an O(δ) gap, where δ is the <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> CSIT, regardless of the channel state distribution and without requiring knowledge of this distribution. Next, the case of delayed and inaccurate channel state information is considered. The optimal transmit covariance solution that maximizes the ergodic capacity is fundamentally different in this case, and a different online algorithm based on convex projections is developed. The proposed algorithm for this delayed-CSIT case also has an O(δ) optimality gap, where δ is again the <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> CSIT.

30|$|Color {{information}} {{plays an}} important role in the color image segmentation and real-time color sensor, which affects the result of video image segmentation and correct real-time temperature value. In this paper, a novel real-time color image segmentation method is proposed, which is based on color similarity in RGB color space. According to the color and luminance information in RGB color space, the dominant color is determined at first, and then color similarity can be calculated with the proposed calculation method of color component, which creates a color-class map. Next, the information of the corresponding color-class map is utilized to classify the pixels. Due to the characteristic that thermal inks feature color values that change in real time as the temperature changes, the segmentation results of thermal ink can be used as a real-time color sensor. Then, we also propose a method of color correction and light source compensation for the sake <b>of</b> potential <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> its <b>measures.</b> We discuss the proposed segmentation method application combining with color sensor (thermal ink) in real-time color image segmentation for Cyber physical system (CPS) by the application in fire detection and summarize a new method in identifying fire in a video based on these characteristics. The experiments showed that the proposed method in vision-based fire detection and identification in videos was effective; the results were accurate and can be used in real-time analysis.|$|R

This entropy is {{a variant of the}} generalized entropy of order α, considered in Mathai and Rathie (1975), and it is also associated with Shannon, Boltzmann-Gibbs, Rényi, Tsallis, and Havrda-Charvát entropies. The generalized entropy measure introduced here is also shown to have interesting statistical properties and it can be given probabilistic interpretations in terms <b>of</b> <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>measure,</b> expected value, and information content in a scheme. Particular cases of the pathway model are shown to be Tsallis statistics (Tsallis, 1988) and superstatistics introduced by Beck and Cohen (2003).

40|$|Heat {{treatment}} {{is widely used}} for high reliability fastening components such as buckles and brackets. The current study focuses on mass production of safety components which are fineblanked from sheet metal, austempered and chromium electroplated. Electroplating together with stamping defects may lead to unexpected brittle failure of the component. It is widely known that during austenitisation, decarburisation could avoid brittle failure and, therefore, slight decarburisation is recommended. There is little information how much mass production is influenced by decarburisation and where the limits are. The current study has two goals. The first one focuses {{on the extent of}} decarburisation effect on the part properties, and the second aims to find the optimum furnace setting for the product type used in the study. Also, it is necessary to choose a reliable decarburisation control method for austempered components. The effect on material grades was analyzed by using three steel alloys with carbon content of 0. 37  wt. %, 0. 47  wt. % and 0. 62  wt. %. The specimens were austempered to hardness 45 – 51  HRC under endothermic protective atmosphere. To gain different decarburisation levels, two gas set-ups were used. Infrared gas analyzer was used to measure CO and CO 2 content in the furnace gas. Three characteristics of the specimens were evaluated: hardness, rupture strength and brittleness. The depth of the decarburisation was determined by three different approaches according to standard EN ISO  3887. Based on the results, the spectrographic method is the most reliable for determining the depth of decarburisation. This study reveals that higher surface decarburisation has a positive effect on the ductility and no effect on the rupture strength of the component. The material with carbon content of 0. 62  wt. % is the most sensitive to decarburisation. During mass production, the <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> hardness <b>measuring</b> raises which results in the <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> salt bath temperature regulation. For the used thermal cycle, the furnace gas carbon potential 0. 30 – 0. 40 has to be used to ensure expected performance of fastening products. </span...|$|R

40|$|Hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm are collectively {{known as}} soil-transmitted helminths. These worms are {{prevalent}} {{in most of}} the developing countries along with another parasitic infection called schistosomiasis. The tests commonly used to detect infection with these worms are less than 100 % accurate. This leads to misclassification of infection status since these tests cannot always correctly indentify infection. We conducted an epidemiological study where such a test, the Kato-Katz technique, was used. In our study we tried to show how misclassification error can influence the association between soil-transmitted helminth infection and schistosomiasis in humans. We used a statistical technique to calculate epidemiological <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> association after correcting for the <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> the test.
