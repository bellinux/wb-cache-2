40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} recent improvements made on the P 300 speller paradigm {{in the context of}} the CoAdapt project. The flashing sequence is elicited by a new design called RIPRAND, in which the flashing rate of elements can be controlled independently of grid cardinality. Element-based evidence accumulation allows early-stopping of the flashes as soon as the symbol has been detected with confidence. No calibration session is nec-essary, thanks to a mixture-of-experts method which makes the initial predictions. When sufficient data can be buffered, subject-specific spatial and temporal filters are learned, with which the interface seamlessly makes its predictions, and the classifiers are adapted online. This paper, which presents results of three online sessions totalling 26 subjects, is the first to report online performance of a P 300 speller with no calibration. 1 Material and Methods The P 300 speller presented in this work was implemented in C++ with OpenViBE [7], and a dedicated stimulating software controlled the keyboard display. The software is opensource and part of OpenViBE release 0. 18 We used a single Windows laptop to run all software components. The P 300 speller keyboard was displayed on a separate LCD screen. A TMSi Refa 8 amplifier, synchronized via hardware to the laptop, was used to record from 12 actively shielded electrodes. The visual stimulations consisted of briefly flashing "smiley" pictures. The P 300 wave was detected via 3 channels of an xDAWN spatial filter [8], combined with a Regularized LDA classifier hereforth called RDA, which incorporates a regularisation of the common covariance matrix. The output of the classifier at each <b>flashing</b> <b>time</b> t is denote y(t). To save time, elements are always flashed in groups. Initial design of P 300 speller groups involved rows and columns of a square matrix [2] or their randomizations [1]. The target element is then found at the intersection of the groups eliciting a P 300 response. But repetitively flashing the same groups causes elements within the target groups to be wrongly selected, because of visual attention effects, and because of the contamination of all group elements by classification errors. Element-wise evidence accumulation avoids these two effects. A different random per-mutation can then be performed at each repetition of the flashes, effectively changing elements' group membership across repetitions. At each flash t, let the binary vector a(t) represent the set of n flashed elements within the grid of cardinality N. The score α(t) of each element (initialized to 0 at time 0) is updated with the following scheme, in which both target and non-target flashes contribute to the accumulation: α(t) = α(t − 1) + lo...|$|E

50|$|According {{to a study}} {{published}} in Materials and Design, several parameters affect the final product. <b>Flash</b> <b>time</b> is the time that the arc is present. Upset time is {{the amount of time that}} the two pieces are pressed together. <b>Flash</b> <b>time</b> needs to be long enough to sufficiently heat the metal before it is pressed together. However, if it is too long, too much of the base metal begins to melt away. The upset time is critical in creating the desired mechanical properties of the finished weld. During the upset, any impurities in the base metal are pressed out creating a perfect weld. If the upset time is too short, all of the impurities may not be pushed out of the base metal creating a defective weld. The upset time is also crucial in the strength of the finished weld because it is during the upset that coalescence occurs between the two pieces of metal. If the upset time is too short, the two pieces of metal may not completely bond.|$|R
30|$|Painting {{of steel}} sheets {{is a complex}} {{phenomenon}} that depends on many physical processes. With the wavefront sensor developed by Phasics™, {{it was possible to}} perform experiments allowing an accurate monitoring of the topography of a film during its deposition. The fast response time of the wavefront sensor allowed us to access the rheological parameters of the paint in an original way by solving an inverse problem. The obtained parameters were used to perform a complete simulation of the film evolution during the painting process, which demonstrated that the Newtonian model was able to reproduce the leveling of the paint layer accurately and that Marangoni effect could be neglected {{at the beginning of the}} <b>flash</b> <b>time,</b> when significant flow occurs. At the end of the <b>flash</b> <b>time,</b> the flow rates decreases and it is clear that the film then exhibits a more complex rheology due to the solvent evaporation, but the leveling dynamic is then considerably attenuated, and the influence on the surface topography is negligible. The conducted simulations are however complex and require the development of advanced numerical tools, like those presented in this paper.|$|R
40|$|Conditions during {{finishing}} {{of advanced}} ceramics by magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) processes {{are found to}} be, by and large, transient. Consequently, the available quasi-steady-state solutions for the moving heat sources are not directly applicable for this case. Hence, the general solution for a moving disk heat source, developed in Part I of this three-part series, is applied to determine the minimum flash tempera-tures and <b>flash</b> <b>times</b> generated at the contact points between the workmaterial (Si 3 N 4 roller) and the abrasive (CriO)). Since chemo-mechanical action between the abra-sive—the workmaterial—the environment depends on both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the process, {{it is important to}} determine the flash temperatures as well as <b>flash</b> <b>times</b> during polishing. These were determined {{as a function of the}} polishing pressure and the rotational speed of the work material in this investigation. Thermody-namic considerations (not covered in this paper) indicate that even the minimum flash temperatures generated under the conditions of lower pressure, lower sliding velocity, and transient state would be adequate to initiate chemo-mechanical action, and experimental results conflrmed the formation of chemo-mechanical reaction prod-ucts during polishing (Bhagavatula and Komanduri, 1996). ...|$|R
