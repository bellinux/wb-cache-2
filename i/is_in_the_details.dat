2500|$|However, by {{the early}} 1950s, {{overhead}} valve V8s from sister divisions Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile, {{as well as new}} overhead valve V8s from Ford Motor Company and Chrysler Corporation, made the [...] "Silver Streak" [...] all but obsolete in power, It was a quiet, smooth running engine that served the needs of the 1930s and '40s American consumer adequately for power, if not reliability or economy, but by 1954, the engine was decidedly eclipsed not only by competing auto makers, but by General Motors' own divisions' products as well. Further hamstringing the [...] "Silver Streak" [...] was the aged, but cheap to produce, flathead configuration. Interesting to note that the Strato Streak V-8 was ready to go in 1953, but was held back by the protesting Buick and Olds divisions. Evidence of this <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of the chassis/steering of 1953 and 1954 Pontiac's which were designed for the V-8. [...] The V8 configuration of the [...] "Strato-Streak" [...] 287-cubic-inch engine that replaced it in 1955 did away with all the crankshaft and L-head related problems, replacing the Depression era [...] "cheap 8" [...] with a truly modern, durable but yet affordable design perfectly matched to Pontiac's target market. [...] A few years later (fall of 1956), under the guidance of Bunkie Knudsen Pontiac was determined to change its image into a performance car to boost sales, this led Knudsen to look for further talent such as in Pete Estes as chief engineer (taken from Olds division) and John DeLorean as director of advanced engineering,a former Packard and Chrysler engineer. Pontiac became known as a performance division based upon the durable, well performing V8s that came later, all of them based upon the original 287 of 1955.|$|E
2500|$|It is Europe's oldest extant {{psychiatric}} hospital and has operated continuously for over 600 years. It {{has also been}} the continent's most famous, and infamous, specialist institution for the care and treatment of the insane. Its popular designation– [...] "Bedlam"– has long been synonymous with madness. Precisely dating its transition to this role is difficult. From 1330 it was routinely {{referred to as a}} [...] "hospital" [...] but that does not necessarily indicate a change in its primary role from alms collection– the word [...] "hospital" [...] could as likely have been used to denote a lodging for travellers, equivalent to a hostel, and could have described an institution acting as a centre and providing accommodation for peregrinating alms-seekers or questores. It is unknown when it began to specialise in the care and control of the insane, but it has been frequently asserted that Bethlem was first used for the insane from 1377. This date is derived from the unsubstantiated conjecture of the Reverend Edward Geoffrey O'Donoghue, chaplain to the hospital, who published a monograph on its history in 1914. While it is possible that Bethlem was receiving the insane during the late fourteenth century, the first definitive record of their presence in the hospital <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of a visitation of the Charity Commissioners in 1403. This recorded that amongst other patients there were six male inmates who were [...] "mente capti", a Latin term indicating insanity. The report of the visitation also noted the presence of four pairs of manacles, 11 chains, six locks and two pairs of stocks {{but it is not clear}} if any or all of these items were for the restraint of the inmates. While mechanical restraint and solitary confinement are likely to have been used for those regarded as dangerous, little else is known of the actual treatment of the insane for much of the medieval period. The presence of a small number of insane patients in 1403 marks Bethlem's gradual transition from a diminutive general hospital into a specialist institution for the confinement of the insane. This process was largely completed by 1460.|$|E

His father, a carpenter, taught him how to build. But Cooper's unique, off-the-cuff {{approach}} to design is all his own. To him, design is all about bringing personality and comfort to a room. He thinks a person's environment should reflect who they are. He's part designer, part artist and part carpenter. When he was 17, his fine art skills earned him acceptance into the prestigious Art Institute of Chicago but he decided to take a more entrepreneurial path, starting his own company, Kustom Craft Papers Inc., to create one-of-a-kind handcrafted wall coverings instead. His career has led him to a variety of projects including restoring his family's Victorian home, painting murals for children's rooms, restaurants and offices, and crafting one-of-a-kind waterfalls. In 2004, his talents were showcased as a host on Fox's Design Invasion, where he shot a season redesigning homes across the country. As host and lead designer on Design on a Dime, Cooper wants to show people that a $1,000 budget doesn't necessarily have to look that way.
