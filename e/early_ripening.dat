25|$|Tempranillo is an <b>early</b> <b>ripening</b> {{variety that}} tends to thrive in chalky {{vineyard}} soils {{such as those of}} the Ribera del Duero region of Spain. In Portugal, where the grape is known as Tinto Roriz and Aragonez, it is blended with others to produce Port wine.|$|E
25|$|The {{fig tree}} (ficus carica) grew {{well in the}} hill country and {{produced}} two crops a season. <b>Early</b> <b>ripening</b> figs were regarded as delicacy because of their sweetness and were eaten fresh. Figs ripening in the later harvest were often dried and strung into a chain, or pressed into hard round or square-shaped cakes called a develah, and stored as {{a major source of}} winter food. The blocks of dried fig were sliced and eaten like bread.|$|E
25|$|Cumin is a drought-tolerant, tropical, or {{subtropical}} crop. It has {{a growth}} season of 100 – 120 days. The optimum growth temperature ranges are between 25 and 30° C. The Mediterranean climate is {{most suitable for}} its growth. Cultivation of cumin requires a long, hot summer of three to four months. At low temperatures, leaf colour changes from green to purple. High temperature might reduce growth period and induce <b>early</b> <b>ripening.</b> In India, cumin is sown from October {{until the beginning of}} December, and harvesting starts in February. In Syria and Iran, cumin is sown from mid-November until mid-December (extensions up to mid-January are possible) and harvested in June/July.|$|E
50|$|The results {{heterosis}} {{can be seen}} in traits such {{as increased}} fruit yield, <b>earlier</b> <b>ripening,</b> and heat tolerance. Heterosis has been shown to provide increased general growth and fruit yield in tomato plants (Xiaodong).|$|R

5000|$|The {{reason why}} Knight in Midknight is spelled with a [...] "K" [...] is because knight {{actually}} {{refers to the}} fruit originating on the place of A. P. Knight at Summerville, Addo, Eastern Cape. This name also refers to its significantly <b>earlier</b> <b>ripening</b> than the standard valencia.|$|R
25|$|Ferdinand Regner {{has argued}} that pinot noir is a cross between Pinot Meunier (Schwarzriesling) and Traminer, but this claim has since been refuted. In fact Pinot Meunier {{has been shown to}} be a chimerical {{mutation}} (in the epidermal cells) which makes the shoot tips and leaves prominently hairy-white and the vine a little smaller and <b>early</b> <b>ripening.</b> Thus Pinot Meunier is a chimera with two tissue layers of different genetic makeup, both of which contain a mutation making them non-identical to, and mutations of, Pinot noir (as well as of any of the other color forms of Pinot). As such, Pinot Meunier cannot be a parent of Pinot noir, and, indeed, it seems likely that chimerical mutations which can generate Pinot gris from other Pinots (principally blanc or noir) may in turn be the genetic pathway for the emergence of Pinot Meunier.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is also a}} smaller-berried, <b>early</b> <b>ripening,</b> lower yield variety called Frühburgunder (Pinot Noir Précoce, lit. [...] "Early Burgundian") {{which is}} grown in Rheinhessen and Ahr area and can produce good wines. In the last 20 years, efforts {{have been made to}} develop and husband good quality high health clones of Frühburgunder {{selected}} from Württemberg vineyards.|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, Northern and Eastern Europe (especially in Scandinavian countries), Finland, Poland, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, newly harvested, <b>early</b> <b>ripening</b> {{varieties}} {{are considered a}} special delicacy. Boiled whole and served un-peeled with dill, these [...] "new potatoes" [...] are traditionally consumed with Baltic herring. Puddings made from grated potatoes (kugel, kugelis, and potato babka) are popular items of Ashkenazi, Lithuanian, and Belarusian cuisine. German fries and various version of Potato salad are part of German cuisine. Bauernfrühstück [...] (literally Farmer's breakfast) is a warm German dish made from fried potatoes, eggs, ham and vegetables.|$|E
5000|$|The 'Minnewasheta' apple {{is known}} for its <b>earlier</b> <b>{{ripening}}</b> season, ripening in late August through September, marking an earlier start to the apple growing season in Minnesota. The 'Minnewasheta' trees were subject to cold climate testing in laboratories to ensure that the fruit is capable of growing in northern climates.|$|R
2500|$|Merlot {{is a dark}} blue-colored {{wine grape}} variety, that is used as both a {{blending}} grape and for varietal wines. The name Merlot {{is thought to be}} a diminutive of merle, the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and [...] "fleshiness", combined with its <b>earlier</b> <b>ripening,</b> makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin.|$|R
50|$|The fruit averages under a pound {{in weight}} and is oblong in shape {{with a smooth}} surface. The apex is bluntly pointed and the fruit lacks a beak. At {{maturity}} the skin is yellow in color, sometimes containing an orange-red blush. The flesh is orange-yellow in color, fiberless, and has a rich, sweet flavor. It contains a polyembryonic seed. Rosigold's fruit production is considered good. The fruit begin ripening in March in Florida, making Rosigold one of the <b>earliest</b> <b>ripening</b> cultivars.|$|R
2500|$|Harvesting time {{is crucial}} to winemaking, with the grape rapidly losing acidity {{as soon as it}} ripens. Some viticultural hazards include the risk of damage from springtime frost, as Chardonnay is an early-budding vine – usually a week after Pinot noir. To combat the threat of frost, a method {{developed}} in Burgundy involves aggressive pruning just prior to budburst. This [...] "shocks" [...] the vine and delays budburst up to two weeks, which is often long enough for warmer weather to arrive. Millerandage and coulure can also pose problems, along with powdery mildew attacking the thin skin of the grapes. Because of Chardonnay's <b>early</b> <b>ripening,</b> it can thrive in wine regions with short growing seasons, and in regions such as Burgundy, can be harvested before autumn rain sets in and brings the threat of rot.|$|E
2500|$|The Muscadet {{region is}} located at the westernmost edge of the Loire Valley near the city of Nantes. In the 17th century, Dutch wine merchants laid the {{foundation}} for the Muscadet style by encouraging the villagers of Nantes to plant the <b>early</b> <b>ripening</b> Melon de Bourgogne grape to use in the production of their brandewijndistilled wine with brandy added to it. Following the devastation in 1709 of winter frost to many of the vineyards in the Loire-Atlantique, King Louis XIV ordered that the frost resistant Melon de Bourgogne grape be given preferential treatment in the replanting of the area. Despite the inference of [...] "Muskiness" [...] in its name, Muscadet is a neutral flavor wine and the Melon de Bourgogne grape has no relation to the Muscat family of grapes. The area's four appellation all produces white wine made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape. The appellations are- ...|$|E
2500|$|What {{constitutes}} [...] "ripeness" [...] {{will vary}} according to what style of wine is being produced {{as well as the}} particular views of winemakers and viticulturists on what optimal ripeness is. The style of wine is usually dictated by the balance between sugars and acids. What may be considered [...] "ripe" [...] for one winemaker could be considered under ripe to another winemaker or even overripe to yet a third winemaker. Climate and the particular grape variety will also play a role in determining ripeness and date of harvest. In very hot climates, such as certain areas in California and Australia, ripeness is usually achieved around 30 days after veraison starts while in much cooler climates, like the Loire Valley and parts of Germany, this may not occur until 70 days after veraison. The ripening periods for each individual grape variety will vary with grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon taking much longer to ripen compared to <b>early</b> <b>ripening</b> varieties such as Chardonnay and Pinot noir.|$|E

2500|$|In 1849 Ephraim Bull {{developed}} the now-ubiquitous Concord grape {{at his home}} on Lexington Road, where the original vine still grows. Welch's, the first company to sell grape juice, maintains a headquarters in Concord. Boston-born Ephraim Wales Bull {{developed the}} Concord grape by experimenting with seeds {{from some of the}} native species. [...] On his farm outside Concord, down the road from the Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne and Alcott homesteads, he planted some 22,000 seedlings in all, before he had produced the ideal grape. [...] <b>Early</b> <b>ripening,</b> to escape the killing northern frosts, but with a rich, full-bodied flavor, the hardy Concord grape thrives where European cuttings had failed to survive. In 1853, Mr. Bull felt ready to put the first bunches of his Concord grapes before the public—and won a prize at the Boston Horticultural Society Exhibition. [...] From these early arbors, fame of Mr. Bull’s (“the father of the Concord grape”) Concord grape spread worldwide, bringing him up to $1,000 a cutting, but he died a relatively poor man.

2500|$|Provence has {{a classic}} Mediterranean climate, with the [...] sea forming its {{southern}} border. Mild winters {{are followed by}} very warm summers with little rainfall. Sunshine is found in abundance in this region with the grapevines receiving more than 3,000 hours per year, twice the amount needed to ripen grapes fully. This abundance does have the adverse effect of potentially over ripening grapes if vineyard owners are not cautious. The strong mistral wind from the north provides positive and negative influences on the viticulture. While it can cool the grapes {{from the heat and}} dry the grapes after rain, providing some protection against rot and grape diseases, it can also damage vines that are not securely trained and protected by hillside landforms. In areas where the wind is particularly strong, the ideal vineyard locations are on hillsides facing south towards the sea, with the hill providing some shelter from the mistral's strength. In those areas, the type of grape varieties planted will also play a role since south-facing slopes receive the most sunshine and in the warm climate can easily over expose delicate and <b>early</b> <b>ripening</b> varieties which would be better suited on north-facing slopes.|$|E

50|$|Pre-harvest crop {{desiccation}} (also siccation) {{refers to}} {{the application of a}} herbicide to a crop shortly before harvest. Herbicides used include glyphosate, diquat and glufosinate. For potatoes, carfentrazone-ethyl is used. Other desiccants are cyanamide, cinidon-ethyl, and pyraflufen-ethyl.Uneven crop growth is a problem in northern climates during wet summers or when weed control is poor and several of advantages of desiccation have been cited: More even ripening is achieved and harvest can be conducted earlier; weed control is initiated for a future crop; <b>earlier</b> <b>ripening</b> allows for <b>earlier</b> replanting; desiccation reduces green material in the harvest putting less strain on harvesting machinery. Some crop may be mechanically destroyed when crop desiccation machinery moves through the field.|$|R
