The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing...

2500|$|Unlike {{the magical}} realist writers, the McOndos wrote [...] "here-and-now!" [...] fiction, about the 21st-century world they inhabit, and which {{surrounds}} them, and the homogenizing cultural-identity messages of pervasive mass communications media; to be Latin in an Anglo culture. Because contemporary Latin America {{is a cultural}} conflation of the 19th and 21st centuries, the McOndos substantive and technical divergence from Magical Realism (style, narrative mode, etc.) voided their predecessor traditions. Alberto Fuguet explains, [...] "I feel [...] the great literary theme of ‘Latin American identity’ (who are we?) must now {{take a back seat}} to the theme of ‘personal identity’ (who am I?)." [...] Whilst rejecting the resultant stereotype [...] "Latin American Literature" [...] derived from Magical Realism, the McOndos nonetheless respect the man; [...] "I’m a really big fan of Márquez, but, what <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> is the software he created, that other people use [...] [...] [...] they turn [...] into more of an aesthetic [...] instead of an ideology.

5000|$|Petrosian {{was born}} to Armenian parents on June 17, 1929 in Tiflis, Georgian SSR (modern-day Georgia). As a young boy, Petrosian was an {{excellent}} student and enjoyed studying, as did his brother Hmayak and sister Vartoosh. He learned to play chess {{at the age of}} 8, though his illiterate father Vartan encouraged him to continue studying, as he thought chess was unlikely to bring his son any success as a career. Petrosian was orphaned during World War II and was forced to sweep streets to earn a living. It was about this time that his hearing began to deteriorate, a problem that afflicted him throughout his life. In a 1969 interview with Time magazine, he recalled: I started sweeping streets {{in the middle of the}} winter and it was horrible. Of course there were no machines then, so we had to do everything by hand. Some of the older men helped me out. I was a weak boy. And I was ashamed of being a street sweeper—that's natural, I suppose. It wasn't so bad in the early morning when the streets were empty, but when it got light and the crowds came out <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>hated</b> it. <b>I</b> got sick and missed a year in school. We had a babushka, a sister of my father, and she really saved me. She gave me bread to eat when I was sick and hungry. That's when this trouble with my hearing started. I don't remember how it all happened. Things aren't very clear from that time.|$|R

I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. <b>I</b> would <b>really</b> <b>hate</b> it if anybody else voiced him". According to Taylor, it would seem unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work.|$|R
40|$|When on {{my first}} fieldtrip in {{northwest}} Namibia, my field assistant always had two tapes with him. Both were by the Soul Brothers, a South African jive band immensely popular in their home country and in Namibia. He played them whenever he could. Those first weeks, I couldn’t wait for his battery to run down. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>hated</b> those tapes. The first thing I did when back in Belgium, was to buy a Soul Brothers record (the BBC sessions, the only I could find). I had grown fond of that Hammond organ and that sparkling guitar sound, even if I {{did not have a}} clue what they were singing about. And I cherish that record, if only because it was the start of my interest in African music. Apart from that, it symbolizes my initial estrangement, and reminds of the idiot I was. At the same time though, the Soul Brothers became the soundtrack of one of the best times of my life. Hearing that Hammond organ stills puts me in fieldwork gear. But there is more. To me, that record also marked an epistemological and methodological turn towards phenomenology: things have meaning on different levels, of which the discursive (the lyrics) is only one. It oriented me towards practices and performance, and towards the anthropology of the body (a course I still teach). Secondly, that record –and music in general– could be regarded as a metaphor of knowledge, and certainly of the way I understand all things cultural (as improvised, yet patterned; as syncopated; as “glocalized”, and so on). Thirdly, it has provided me with a great teaching aid to illustrate all the above. status: publishe...|$|R
