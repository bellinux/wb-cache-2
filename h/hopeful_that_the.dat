5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests {{that young people}} were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.|$|E

He and the OKW, early in the preparatory phase, were <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> offensive would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused {{more and more on}} the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the Panther tank, but also the Elefant tank destroyer and greater numbers of the Tiger heavy tank. He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival. Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the offensive to allow for more equipment to reach the front.|$|E
5|$|Nhu {{then decided}} that his men {{would go to}} Lâm Thao to {{reinforce}} their colleagues. On the way, they stopped at {{the nearby town of}} Kinh Khe, where the instructor, Nguyen Quang Kinh, and one of his two wives were slain by VNQDĐ members in an apparent revenge killing. Kinh had previously been affiliated with the VNQDĐ, whose members took him away. His wife had tried to follow him, so the VNQDĐ captured her as well. French intelligence reports speculated that Kinh had been killed because he would not join his former colleagues. Nhu then led his men through Lâm Thao. The plan was that they would help to consolidate the other unit's control on the town until the afternoon. They were <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attack in Yên Bái would have been successfully completed by then, and that the mutineers and people of Yên Bái would come to Lâm Thao and stage their forces before attacking the barracks at Phu Tho. However, they were not fast enough.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, PETA {{went before}} Burger King's board of {{directors}} during its parent company's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry suppliers switched to a more-humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane, {{the group claimed that}} CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal. Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens. Under the agreement, 2% of BK's North American egg suppliers are to use cage-free-produced eggs and 10% of pork suppliers are to use crate-free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were quoted as saying that Burger King’s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The mall {{also added}} new burdens to city services, with {{building}} inspectors {{having to work}} overtime to inspect each store area as it was completed. While mall security was issued citation books so they could issue parking tickets directly, the city police still had to work double shifts to cover the traffic during the mall's opening weekend. Overall, the mall increased traffic on the Earl Rudder Freeway, and city traffic engineers noted it would cause more traffic backup. Traffic signals {{were added to the}} mall's main entrance, while long-term plans were made to both expand the freeway and add additional interchanges along Harvey. Traffic studies were implemented to study the traffic after the mall's opening to developed additional plans to mitigate issues. There were concerns that the mall would be the final blow to the downtown area of neighboring city Bryan, Texas, which was already suffering reduced business after the opening of smaller Manor East Mall and the Townshire shopping center, both within Bryan. Bryan city officials noted an immediate decrease in revenue due to Sears moving from Bryan to College Station, taking $50–100,000 of sales taxes with it. However, as a whole the city was <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mall would have benefits to the city in the form of increased city growth as a whole. The city planners felt it would only be a passing fad for local rural and lower-income families, who would still return to downtown Bryan due to its proximity.|$|E

Counter-narcotics police came under enemy attack during the counter-narcotics drive in several occasions, inflicting casualties on the law-enforcers, he said. The campaign against poppy was successful in Logar, Ghazni, Wardag, Paktia, Paktika and Panjshir provinces.|$|E

Cain said managers were <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> issue could be resolved in time for the next available launch opportunity on 11 July 2009. Due to the delay of STS-127, managers noted that it was likely that the launch of STS-128 on 7 August 2009, would be pushed back slightly.|$|E
25|$|Plans for the {{restoration}} were threatened in 2103 when the route of High Speed 2, a high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham, Manchester and York, were published. This envisaged an East Midlands Hub station at Toton, which would have destroyed part of the canal route, but revised plans were published on 15 November 2016, with the station moved to avoid the canal. The chairman of the Derby and Sandiacre Canal Trust, Chris Madge, was still concerned that a tramway to link the station to Derby would impinge upon the canal, but was <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> canal in this area could be reopened before tramway construction began, and that {{the plans for the}} tramway would therefore have to accommodate the canal.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} World Wrestling Federation, the Bulldogs {{returned}} to Stampede Wrestling, {{and also to}} All Japan Pro Wrestling. Stampede officials were <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> return of the Bulldogs would revive a struggling promotion, but they were unsuccessful. Eventually in May 1989, {{the decision was made}} to split up the Bulldogs, which caused some problems with All Japan owner Shohei Baba, who was still promoting the Bulldogs as a tag team. On 4 July 1989 Smith, along with fellow wrestlers Chris Benoit, Ross Hart, and Jason the Terrible, was involved in a serious automobile accident. Smith, who was not wearing a seatbelt at the time, needed 135 stitches after slamming his head through the windshield and being thrown 25 feet onto the pavement. He recovered, and the Bulldogs continued teaming in All Japan against teams such as Joe and Dean Malenko, Kenta Kobashi and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, and The Nasty Boys. Personal problems began to surface between Smith and Billington, and Smith later left All Japan to return to the WWF.|$|E

500|$|The {{area known}} as the [...] "High Arctic" [...] was subject to claims of {{sovereignty}} not only from Canada, but also from Norway and the United States. The Canadian government was concerned that an American-financed expedition would give the United States a legal claim to any new land discovered in the Beaufort Sea, so when the Canadian prime minister Robert Borden met Stefansson in Ottawa in February 1913 he offered to assume financial responsibility for the entire expedition. Borden's government was <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> expedition would strengthen Canada's claim to sovereignty over the Arctic islands. The American sponsors agreed to withdraw, subject to an NGS condition that the Society could reclaim its rights to the expedition if Stefansson failed to depart by June 1913. This created a narrow deadline and hurried preparations for the journey north, although Stefansson maintained in his 1921 account that [...] "forethought appeared to have anticipated every eventuality".|$|E
500|$|However, RCA Records, {{their former}} label who {{released}} Hello Master outside their native Canada {{in all other}} territories starting in 2006, became <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band's next record would have similar success. As a result, the label continually rejected the material represented by the demo recordings the group were sending in, believing {{that none of the}} songs could perform as commercially-successful singles. RCA continually delayed the band from entering the studio in hopes that they could write such a song, {{but by the time the}} group had written 20 songs (including material that was eventually phased out of their concert setlist) the label still had no confidence in the new material. [...] "We really were in an amazing place, writing, jamming four to five times a week and coming up with great stuff," [...] recalled Heppner. [...] "We felt at the peak of our creativity. [...] And they were like, 'Can you write more songs?' (We were, like), 'This is insane.'" [...] RCA would continue to differ with Priestess on the issue, even after the album was finished.|$|E

500|$|Following Allen's {{failed attempt}} on St. John, {{many of his}} men drifted away, presumably drawn by the needs of home and farm.

Undoubtedly, we shall be rewarded according to our merit". Congress, for its part, at first not really wanting any part of the affair, effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts. Both Allen and Arnold protested these measures, pointing out that doing so would leave the northern border wide open. They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec. Allen, in one instance, wrote that [...] "I will lay my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men, and a proper artillery, I will take Montreal". Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause.|$|E
500|$|For {{the change}} from Ghost Rider to LMD, Joseph McCabe at Nerdist said that any doubts he had about the change [...] "are more or less eliminated" [...] by the series take on a robotic antagonist, which he called [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron done right ... where it most {{obviously}} improves on the overstuffed second Avengers film is in the humor department". Schwartz called the transition smooth, and felt the series' ongoing Inhuman subplot complimented the LMD storyline well. Valentine said that the beginning of LMD [...] "doesn’t maintain the heights of [...] days with Ghost Rider in the driver’s seat, but it does manage to remain a solid entry on the airwaves." [...] He was very critical of the Inhuman subplot, calling the Watchdogs [...] "pretty much played out at this point" [...] and feeling the Inhumans had become stale after the previous two seasons. Fitzpatrick also criticized the [...] "flat" [...] Inhuman storyline, but felt the change to LMD [...] "got off to the best possible start" [...] given the [...] "obviously less of an immediate hook" [...] than Ghost Rider. Beginning the Agents of Hydra pod, Schwartz said [...] "this return episode more than delivered" [...] on the previous episode's cliffhanger. She was satisfied that the Framework reality was not undone within a single episode, and was <b>hopeful</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remaining episodes of the season would offer [...] "similar surprises [...] our expectations". Valentine felt [...] "What If..." [...] "made for a very good start" [...] to the pod, feeling it [...] "continues {{to build on the}} goodwill created by season 4 of S.H.I.E.L.D. presenting an interesting concept and world to be explored". McCown-Levy continued the praise, saying [...] "This could’ve been a sodden slog through too-obvious reveals and portentous doom and gloom. Instead, S.H.I.E.L.D. kept its fleet and efficient pacing, but bent it to the service of a dark and compelling narrative arc already paying dividends in terms of rewarding long-time viewers with deep-pull references and stories". Fitzpatrick, however, felt the episode [...] "stumbled" [...] and was [...] "something of a bumpy reentry into season 4, and doubly so for anyone who lost sight of the Life Model Decoy conflict in play, or harbor concern ABC might not order a fifth season." [...] He found it difficult to determine the rules at play in the Framework, and felt the storyline was done more so because the [...] "producers missed working with Brett Dalton".|$|E
