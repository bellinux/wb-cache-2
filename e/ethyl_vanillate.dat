40|$|Background: Vitiligo is an {{acquired}} disease of skin that presents with depigmented patches {{due to lack}} of melanocytes in the epidermis. Accumulation of toxic free radicals like hydrogen peroxide in the epidermis may be responsible for melanocytes death. Since <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> (vanillic acid ethyl ester) is a strong hydrogen peroxide scavenger, it may be effective against vitiligo. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> cream on vitiligo patients receiving phototherapy. Methods: A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial using <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> cream 20 % was performed on 30 cases of generalized stable vitiligo (randomly selected) who were receiving phototherapy in the outpatient clinic of Faghihi Hospital (Shiraz, Iran). The patients randomly applied <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> on an assigned lesion (left or right side of the body...|$|E
40|$|Parabens are {{effective}} preservatives {{widely used in}} cosmetic products and processed food, with high human exposure. Recent evidence suggests that parabens exert estrogenic effects. This work investigated the potential interference of parabens with the estrogen-activating enzyme 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 β-HSD) 1 and the estrogen-inactivating 17 β-HSD 2. A ligand-based 17 β-HSD 2 pharmacophore model was applied to screen a cosmetic chemicals database, followed by in vitro testing of selected paraben compounds for inhibition of 17 β-HSD 1 and 17 β-HSD 2 activities. All tested parabens and paraben-like compounds, except their common metabolite p-hydroxybenzoic acid, inhibited 17 β-HSD 2. Ethylparaben and <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> inhibited 17 β-HSD 2 with IC 50 values of 4. 6 ± 0. 8 and 1. 3 ± 0. 3 µM, respectively. Additionally, parabens size-dependently inhibited 17 β-HSD 1, whereby hexyl- and heptylparaben were most active with IC 50 values of 2. 6 ± 0. 6 and 1. 8 ± 0. 3 µM. Low micromolar concentrations of hexyl- and heptylparaben decreased 17 β-HSD 1 activity, and ethylparaben and <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> decreased 17 β-HSD 2 activity. However, regarding the very rapid metabolism of these compounds to the inactive p-hydroxybenzoic acid by esterases, {{it needs to be}} determined under which conditions low micromolar concentrations of these parabens or their mixtures can occur in target cells to effectively disturb estrogen effects in vivo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBuddleja salviifolia {{leaves are}} used for the {{treatment}} of eye infections and neurodegenerative conditions in South Africa. Three phenolic compounds identified as 4 ′-hydroxyphenyl <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> (1), acteoside (2) and quercetin (3) from leaf extracts of the B. salviifolia were investigated for cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibition and antioxidant activities using β-carotene–linoleic acid and DPPH assays. In silico parameters were also determined for COX- 2. All the compounds exhibited good inhibition activity against COX- 2 and moderate antioxidant activities at a screening concentration of 25. 0 μg/ml. Acteoside was the most potent in all assays. It exhibited the lowest IC 50 value (4. 28 μg/ml) in the COX- 2 and EC 50 values of 24. 15 and 63. 30 μg/ml in the β-carotene–linoleic acid and DPPH assays respectively. Computational molecular docking showed its molecular interaction with important amino acid residues in the catalytic site of COX- 2, revealing its potential binding mode at the molecular level. In silico study revealed that quercetin and acteoside showed the highest binding affinity (dock score of 92. 18 and 68. 93 k. cal/mol) and good hydrogen bond interactions with active site residues. The activities demonstrated by these compounds (1 – 3) suggest that they could be useful in management of inflammatory conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the time of wood chip {{addition}} on phenolic content, color parameters and volatile composition of a red wine made by a native Greek variety (Agiorgitiko) was evaluated. For this purpose, chips from American, French, Slavonia oak and Acacia were added in the wine during and after fermentation. Various chemical parameters of wines were studied after one, two and three months of contact with chips. The results showed that the addition of oak chips during alcoholic fermentation did not favor ellagitannin extraction and the reactions involved in tannin condensation and anthocyanin stabilization. Moreover, wines fermented with wood chips contained higher contents of whiskey lactones, eugenol, <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> and acetate esters while their ethyl ester content was lower compared with the wines where chip addition took place after fermentation. Practical Application: The outcomes of this study would be of practical interest to winemakers since they could improve the control over the wood extraction process. When chips are added after fermentation wines seem to have a greater ageing potential compared to the wines fermented with chips due to their higher ellagitannin content and enhanced condensation reactions. On the other hand, color stabilization and tannin polymerization occur faster when chips are added during fermentation resulting in shorter ageing periods suitable for early consumed wines...|$|E
40|$|Póster presentado en la XVI Reunión Científica de la Sociedad Española de Cromatografía y Técnicas Afines (SECyTA 2016), celebrada en Sevilla del 2 al 4 de noviembre de 2016. This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of two groups of molecules in wine, enolones and vanillines. Both types of molecules present a common characteristic, their great polarity. Sotolon, maltol, furaneol and homofuraneol belong to the first group. Their chemical structures present certain similarity among them, which leads to similar physicochemical and olfactory properties. This group of compounds is described with the terms “burnt sugar, candy sugar, caramel and maple”. Sotolon and furaneol are the most powerful aromatic molecules within them, being their odor thresholds estimated in water‐ethanol matrix around 5 μg/L [1, 2]. The other group of molecules, vanillines, contributes to the oak related notes of alcoholic beverages. This work presents an automatized strategy to quantify the following aromatic compounds in wine: maltol, furaneol, homofuraneol, sotolon, vanillin, methyl vanillate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> and acetovanillone. The development of this strategy implied the use of Gilson system (GX‐ 274 liquid handler). The proposed method {{is based on a}} solid phase extraction (SPE) using LiChrolut EN resins (50 mg). Three mL of wine were passed through a LiChrolut EN cartridge. After this, two consecutive washing up steps were applied. The first one consisted of 2 mL of an aqueous solution at pH 8. 0 containing 1...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Douglas fir bark fines which {{contained}} 74. 8 percent of Klason lignin and 70. 2 percent {{of one percent}} sodium hydroxide solubility and decayed Douglas fir wood {{which contained}} 53. 9 percent of Klason lignin were subjected to ethanolysis. A slight modification of the Hibbert's ethanolysis procedure was used. The monomeric compounds present in the reaction products were then examined. Two fractions of ethyl ether soluble oil were obtained from both bark and wood samples, which were mixtures of monomeric compounds produced by the ethanolysis reaction. One, which was designated "PE" fraction, was obtained by an ether extraction of a tar-like water insoluble substance of the ethanolysis products, {{and the other one}} designated "LE" fraction was obtained by the ether extraction of a water solution of the water soluble ethanolysis product. Two dimensional paper partition chromatography of these ether soluble oils demonstrated the presence of 12 compounds in the bark "PE" fraction, four compounds in the bark "LE" fraction and nine compounds in the wood "LE" fraction. The wood "PE" fraction gave the same chromatogram as the wood "LE". In the wood "LE", the typical Hibbert's monomers, 1 -ethoxy- 1 -guaiacyl- 2 -propanone, 2 -ethoxy- 1 -guaiacyl-lpropanone, guaiacyl-acetone, vanilloyl-acetyle, vanillin, and vanillic acid were identified. Ethyl ferulate was isolated from the bark "PE", which was the only C₆-C₃, phenyl propane type compound obtained from the ethanolysis of the bark fines sample. Ethyl protocatechuate, protocatechuic acid, and vanillic acid were isolated from the bark "PE" and "LE". <b>Ethyl</b> <b>vanillate</b> was isolated from the bark "LE". Identification of the esters was confirmed by comparison with authentic samples prepared by synthesis. From these results, it was concluded that the major monomeric compounds which were produced by the ethanolysis reaction of the bark fines were ferulic acid, protocatechuic acid, and vanillic acid. This indicates that the building units of the bark phenolic acid molecule are different from those in the lignin from wood...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 16, 2014 - Dec. 16, 2014 High vegetative growth of Pinot Noir vine is a common problem in most vineyards of Oregon's Willamette Valley, where sunlight exposure and heat accumulation are limited. Consequently, growers in this region commonly use vineyard management strategies to regulate vine vigor and improve grape and wine quality. Wine quality is greatly correlated with grape volatile composition. However, no study {{has been done to}} fulfill the knowledge gap of how specific viticultural practice affect Oregon Pinot Noir grape and wine volatile composition. Accordingly, three studies were conducted to evaluate impacts of viticultural practices (i. e., cover crop, leaf removal, and crop thinning) on the volatile composition of Pinot Noir grape and wine in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Pinot Noir grape chemical and volatile composition was investigated over three growing seasons (2008, 2009, and 2010) in a commercial vineyard where vines were managed using three vineyard floor management practices. The vineyard floor practices included different inter-row management: permanent grass (Festuca rubra spp. rubra) cover (Grass), alternating grass cover and tillage (Alternate), and tillage of every alleyway (Tilled). Fruit chemical and volatile compositions were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (SBSE-GC-MS). Results showed that different vineyard floor practices did not affect the grape general ripeness in most of years (2008 and 2009), but in 2010, Grass treatment caused decreases levels of sugar and organic acids in grapes. In addition, Grass treatment reduced levels of berry free amino acids but increased levels of quercetin glycosides and anthocyanins. Compositions of grape volatile and their precursors were also affected by treatments. Grass treatment increased free-form terpenoids and decreased free-form C₆ compounds (hexanal, trans- 2 -hexenal and 1 -hexanol) and β-damascenone in most of the years. There was a negative correlation between vine pruning weight and levels of free-form terpenoids, while, a positive correlation between vine pruning weight and free-form C₆ compounds and β-damascenone. Furthermore, Alternate treatment had the highest concentrations of bound-form terpenoids. Wines were made when grapes reached commercial maturity and wine compositions were analyzed using HPLC, GC-FID and GC-MS. Results showed that the wine made from grapes with vineyard floor management treatments Alternate and Grass had higher levels of anthocyanins compared to Tilled treatment. Wine volatile composition was affected by treatments as well but in different ways. Cover crop treatments increased levels of branched-chain esters, acetates, terpenoids, and phenethyl alcohol in wine; meanwhile, they decreased levels of straight-chain ethyl esters, higher alcohols (1 -propanol, isobutyl alcohol, and isoamyl alcohols), β-damascenone, <b>ethyl</b> <b>vanillate,</b> dimethyl sulfite and methanethiol. A second study was conducted to further investigate the impact of fruit-zone leaf removal practice on Pinot Noir grape and wine volatile composition over three growing seasons (2010, 2011, and 2012). Grapevines were managed to have four different leaf removal treatments, including removing 0...|$|E
