With the number of wings of <b>internal</b> <b>mixer</b> increasing from two to six, the feeding speed of <b>internal</b> <b>mixer</b> increases accordingly. For every revolution of rotor, the rubber compound will receive more shears, and the shearing force imposed to the rubber mix from between rotor wing and internal surface of chamber will also increase, which is equal to the increase of shearing stress and shearing speed so as to greatly shorten the mixing time and improve production efficiency as well as help {{to improve the quality of}} rubber mix. Because the 6 -wing synchronous rotor is still in the process of development and improvement and its stress reception inside mixing chamber is significantly complex, it is necessary to conduct systematic analysis on the stress reception during its working process...|$|E
