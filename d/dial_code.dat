As mobile networks were introduced, PTK adopted the code 377 (Monaco) and IPKO adopted the code 386 (Slovenia). This situation resulted in the highly unusual simultaneous use of three international <b>dialing</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Despite its {{proximity}} to Bradford, its Bradford postal address and its mostly Bradford <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> (most of the village uses the 01274 phone number, but part uses the 0113 Leeds prefix), Birkenshaw forms part of Kirklees Metropolitan Borough. It {{is home to the}} headquarters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.|$|E
5000|$|The iNum Initiative is {{a project}} started in November 2008 by Voxbone to create a global <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> for IP communications. Voxbone is a Belgian company specializing in {{wholesale}} telephone numbers for VoIP applications. The International Telecommunication Union allocated {{a portion of the}} non-geographic [...] "country code" [...] +883 to this initiative. Specifically, iNums are 15-digit telephone numbers in the +883 5100 area code.|$|E
50|$|While +883 {{is a valid}} ITU <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> and the iNum numbers {{formally}} {{assigned by}} the ITU, not all access, fixed and mobile carriers know how to route the calls correctly. Skype, Belgacom, British Telecom, Colt, Sprint USA, Orange Switzerland and Verizon Europe are among the major communications companies that route voice calls to iNum. SMS to iNum is supported by several agreements with major international messaging providers.|$|E

50|$|Whereas {{markets in}} {{commodities}} such as pork bellies or oil have agreed definitions and arbitrating bodies for the commodities they trade, the carrier-carrier market has no agreed definitions of its destinations. Every carrier uses the International Telecommunication Union E.164 standard for country codes, but each carrier uses different codes for destinations within a country, usually {{because it is}} using different suppliers within that country. So one carrier's codes for Cali {{may not be the}} same as another's. This applies especially to mobile operators. While the difference in price between a call to a land-line and a call to a mobile may not seem much at 9 UK pence, the volumes can be one hundred thousand minutes a day or more, leading to losses of over £250,000 a month. When a carrier's <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> table can contain three thousand items, comparing codes is a critical and complex part of the process. The theory of <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> relationships actually involves the mathematical theory of lattices and code comparisons have to be done with computer software.|$|E

50|$|USA based Telex users {{could send}} {{the same message}} to several {{places around the world}} at the same time, like email today, using the Western Union InfoMaster Computer. This {{involved}} transmitting the message via paper tape to the InfoMaster Computer (<b>dial</b> <b>code</b> 6111) and specifying the destination addresses for the single text. In this way, a single message could be sent to multiple distant Telex and TWX machines as well as delivering the same message to non-Telex and non-TWX subscribers via Western Union Mailgram.|$|E
5000|$|A mobile <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> (MDC) is a phone number, {{typically}} {{preceded by}} a * or #, that allows the request and receipt of information directly to a mobile phone. MDC's are also known in carrier terminology as [...] "abbreviated dialing codes" [...] (ADC's). Mobile dial codes are dialed just like a regular telephone number. The caller can be presented with any one {{of a variety of}} responses that an advertiser defines - a voice or IVR call, a text message, a video or audio clip, a mobile coupon, game or an application. #250 and **MOVE are two such MDC's.|$|E
5000|$|Telex {{served as}} the forerunner of modern fax, email, and texting - both {{technically}} and stylistically. Abbreviated English (like [...] "CU L8R" [...] for [...] "see you later") as used in texting originated with telex operators exchanging informal messages in real time — they became the first [...] "texters" [...] long before the introduction of mobile phones. Telex users could send the same message to several {{places around the world}} at the same time, like email today, using the Western Union InfoMaster Computer.
