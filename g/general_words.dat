5|$|Greco-Roman mythology {{described}} the Empusae, the Lamia, and the striges. Over time {{the first two}} terms became <b>general</b> <b>words</b> to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the gelloudes or Gello. Like the Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} <b>general</b> <b>words</b> were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became <b>general</b> <b>words</b> to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named Strigoï has no direct relation to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there could drink its blood and communicate.|$|E
50|$|Equating {{the term}} for the male with the whole species is common in many {{languages}}, for example in French (l'Homme). On the other hand, some languages have a <b>general</b> <b>word</b> for 'human individual' which can apply to people of either gender. German has the <b>general</b> <b>word</b> Mensch, but Mann for (adult) male person; Latin has the <b>general</b> <b>word</b> homo and for males the word vir; modern Standard Chinese has 人 (/rén/), analogous to the German Mensch not English Man; the words 男人 (man) and 女人 (woman) are both diglyphs with the gender designations of individuals prefixed before 人.|$|R

500|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, reversing the Ninth Circuit and holding that the exception {{did not apply}} to this case. The main reason for this finding was the decision that section one's exemption would only be confined to [...] "transportation workers". [...] "The wording of [...] calls for the application of the maxim ejusdem generis, the statutory canon that 'where <b>general</b> <b>words</b> follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the <b>general</b> <b>words</b> are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words...'". Under this method of reading the statute, {{he would be able to}} reach an understanding of what the exemption meant. He wrote, [...] "Under this rule of construction the residual clause should be read to give effect to the terms 'seamen' and 'railroad employees,' and should itself be controlled and defined by reference to the enumerated categories of workers which are recited just before it; the interpretation of the clause pressed by respondent fails to produce these results". Therefore, section one [...] "exempts from the FAA only contracts of employment of transportation workers". Kennedy's decision was joined by four other Justices to create a 5-justice majority.|$|E

500|$|Common law constitutionalism, a {{view that}} there are {{fundamental}} constitutional values that are protected even from interference by Parliament, had become increasingly popular {{at the time of}} Jackson. Four recent cases had found that [...] "in the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts [...] presume that even the most <b>general</b> <b>words</b> were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual". There had also been extrajudicial comments by serving judges that parliamentary sovereignty may not be absolute: Lord Woolf had written that [...] "if Parliament did the unthinkable, then I would say that courts would also be required to act in a manner which was without precedent" [...] while John Laws had argued that [...] "ultimate sovereignty rests ... not with those who wield governmental power, but in the conditions under which they are permitted to do so. The constitution, not the Parliament, is in this sense sovereign". However, Jackson contained the first express support from judges acting in their official capacity for the proposition that courts might have the authority to strike down an Act of Parliament if it violated fundamental constitutional principles (albeit obiter). This was a significant challenge to the orthodox view of parliamentary sovereignty, expressed by Albert Venn Dicey, that Parliament can make and unmake law on any topic and that no body can make a higher form of law than Parliament or set aside primary legislation.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 43: “One {{is not to}} enfoeff a {{religious}} house and take back the land as a tenant of that house.” [...] The mischief to be prevented seems to be this: some favored religious bodies, e.g. the Templars, have royal charters which by <b>general</b> <b>words</b> set free all the lands that they now have, or shall hereafter acquire, from many burdens. A man gives land to such a house, and then becomes that house’s tenant, and as such he claims immunity under the charter. The granting of land to {{a religious}} body freed the tenant from his duties to the lord {{and owner of the}} land.|$|E

60|$|The {{next thing}} to be {{considered}} is,--How <b>general</b> <b>words</b> come to be made. For, since all things that exist are only particulars, how come we by general terms; or where find we those general natures {{they are supposed to}} stand for? Words become general by being made the signs of general ideas: and ideas become general, by separating from them the circumstances of time and place, and any other ideas that may determine them to this or that particular existence. By this way of abstraction they are made capable of representing more individuals than one; each of which having in it a conformity to that abstract idea, is (as we call it) of that sort.|$|E

After congratulating him with great heartiness on the improved state of his fortunes, Mr Crummles gave him to understand that next morning he and his were to start for Liverpool, where the vessel lay which was to carry them from the shores of England, and that if Nicholas wished to take a last adieu of Mrs Crummles, he must repair with him that night to a farewell supper, given in honour of the family at a neighbouring tavern; at which Mr Snittle Timberry would preside, while the honours of the vice-chair would be sustained by the African Swallower.|$|E
60|$|Having thus {{given an}} account of the original, sorts, and extent of our IDEAS, with several other {{considerations}} about these (I know not whether I may say) instruments, or materials of our knowledge, the method I at first proposed to myself would now require that I should immediately proceed to show, what use the understanding makes of them, and what KNOWLEDGE we have by them. This was that which, in the first general view I had of this subject, was all that I thought I should have to do: but, upon a nearer approach, I find that there is so close a connexion between ideas and WORDS, and our abstract ideas and <b>general</b> <b>words</b> have so constant a relation one to another, {{that it is impossible to}} speak clearly and distinctly of our knowledge, which all consists in propositions, without considering, first, the nature, use, and signification of Language; which, therefore, must be the business of the next Book.|$|E
60|$|The {{next thing}} {{therefore}} {{to be considered}} is, What kind of signification it is that <b>general</b> <b>words</b> have. For, as {{it is evident that}} they do not signify barely one particular thing; for then they would not be general terms, but proper names, so, on the other side, it is as evident they do not signify a plurality; for MAN and MEN would then signify the same; and the distinction of numbers (as the grammarians call them) would be superfluous and useless. That then which <b>general</b> <b>words</b> signify is a SORT of things; and each of them does that, by being a sign of an abstract idea in the mind; to which idea, as things existing are found to agree, so they come to be ranked under that name, or, which is all one, be of that sort. Whereby it is evident that the ESSENCES of the sorts, or, if the Latin word pleases better, SPECIES of things, are nothing else but these abstract ideas. For the having the essence of any species, being that which makes anything to be of that species; and the conformity to the idea to which the name is annexed being that which gives a right to that name; the having the essence, and the having that conformity, must needs be the same thing: since to be of any species, and to have a right to the name of that species, is all one. As, for example, to be a MAN, or of the SPECIES man, and to have right to the NAME man, is the same thing. Again, to be a man, or of the species man, and have the ESSENCE of a man, is the same thing. Now, since nothing can be a man, or have a right to the name man, but what has a conformity to the abstract idea the name man stands for, nor anything be a man, or have a right to the species man, but what has the essence of that species; it follows, that the abstract idea for which the name stands, and the essence of the species, is one and the same. From whence it is easy to observe, that the essences of the sorts of things, and, consequently, the sorting of things, is the workmanship of the understanding that abstracts and makes those general ideas.|$|E
