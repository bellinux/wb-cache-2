40|$|Background and objective: Dry {{pressure}} <b>curing</b> <b>device</b> {{is one of}} the <b>devices</b> used in <b>curing</b> of {{acrylic resin}} denture bases. This study aimed to evaluate some properties of acrylic resins, cured by three different techniques. Methods: Two hundred and fifty two specimens were prepared from two brands of heat curing acrylic resin (Paladent 20 and Major). The specimens were cured by three techniques (dry heat pressure curing, conventional curing and microwave irradiation). For each curing technique, seven specimens were prepared and some mechanical and physical properties were tested. Results: Less residual monomer showed in the dry heat pressure curing of Paladent 20 acrylic resin. The conventional curing of Major acrylic resin has shown the least porosity. The highest bending strength and less water sorption showed by microwave irradiation of Major acrylic resin specimens. Conclusion: Some properties of the specimens cured by the dry heat pressure <b>curing</b> <b>device</b> were better than other curing techniques. The microwave irradiation has some good properties when compared with other techniques. The Paladent 20 brand of acrylic resin showed better properties than the Major acrylic resin...|$|R

30|$|Grass {{production}} for storage as hay {{requires a lot}} of care from harvest handling which may determine the quality after storage to feeding. Crude protein (CP) has been used widely as proxy for feed quality analysis and has been reported to decline depending on post harvest handling. The same nutrient has been reported to be among the most limiting in the drylands especially during the dry seasons. Mechanisms of handling and storage to reduce its decline in forage during handling are imperative. The measurement of this vital nutrient that is most limiting in hay was therefore picked in this study and was measured from different curing methods and storage periods. We therefore evaluated the effect of stage of maturity (mature flowering at 12 -week phonological stage) and duration of curing before storage for periods of 2, 12, 24, and 36  weeks on the quality of hay. The selected grass species in were C. roxburghiana (CR), E. superb (ES), E. macrostachyus (EM), C. ciliaris (CC), C. gayana (CG), and S. sudanense (SB).
