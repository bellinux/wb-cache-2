40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is a {{conceptual}} design of a roadable aircraft. The comparison of existing concepts is made, as well as description of proposed solution, aircraft mass analysis, basic aerostatic calculations, flight and <b>gust</b> <b>envelope</b> calculation and a design of truss construction of the fuselage. The CS-VLA, alternatively ELSA-K, {{has been used as}} a certification base. The compliance to this certification specification is one of the goals of this thesis...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an aerodynamic {{analysis of a}} one-seat ultralight (UL) tailless aeroplane named L 2 k, with a very complicated layout. In the first part, an autostable airfoil with a low moment coefficient was chosen {{as a base for}} this problem. This airfoil was refined and modified to satisfy the design requirements. The computed aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoils for different Reynolds numbers (Re) were compared with available experimental data. XFOIL code was used to perform the computations. In the second part, a computation of wing characteristics was carried out. All calculated cases were chosen as points on the manoeuvring and <b>gust</b> <b>envelope.</b> The vortex lattice method was used with consideration of fuselage and winglets for very complicated wing geometry. The PMW computer program developed at IAE was used to perform the computations. The computed results were subsequently used for structural and strength analysis and design...|$|E
40|$|Research was {{initiated}} to investigate certain facets of {{modern control theory}} and their integration with a digital computer to provide a tractable flight control system for a VTOL aircraft. Since the hover mode is the most demanding phase {{in the operation of}} a VTOL aircraft, the research efforts were concentrated in this mode of aircraft operation. Research work on three different aspects of the operation of the X- 14 B VTOL aircraft is discussed. A general theory for optimal, prespecified, closed-loop control is developed. The ultimate goal was optimal decoupling of the modes of the VTOL aircraft to simplify the pilot's task of handling the aircraft. Modern control theory is used to design deterministic state estimators which provide state variables not measured directly, but which are needed for state variable feedback control. The effect of atmospheric turbulence on the X- 14 B is investigated. A maximum magnitude <b>gust</b> <b>envelope</b> within which the aircraft could operate stably with the available control power is determined...|$|E
40|$|The report {{contains}} the design airspeeds and the preliminary loads based on manoeuvre and gust V-n diagrams for the ALLEGRA configuration. For the <b>gust</b> <b>envelopes</b> the Pratt formula of ACJ 25 was used. The ALLEGRA configuration {{is based on}} the final LamAiR configuration developed in the DLR project LamAiR. The ALLEGRA configuration has forward swept wings, a T-Tail, and rear fuselage mounted nacelles. The 150 passenger aircraft is originally designed for laminar flow and less fuel consumption. Within this report all necessary design speeds are given and all the relevant data for manoeuvre- and gust load analysis with respect to CS- 25 and JAR- 25 requirements are computed. For the manoeuvre V-n diagrams the actual requirements, the "Certification Specifications for Large Aeroplanes CS- 25 " from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have been used. To avoid time consuming rational analysis, as required by CS- 25, gust V-n diagrams have been established by using the Pratt formula of JAR- 25. Therewith the gust load factors for the rigid aircraft are estimated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Designing and {{building}} of the unmanned aircraft, especially light and ultra light vehicles, is mainly performed using the experience gained when constructing the flying models. There have not been uniform principles of building and exploiting of the mini and micro UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) {{in the form of}} regulations similar to those for manned airplanes. The unmanned vehicles of these classes in terms of their abilities and attractive price are more frequently exploited using the same air area as manned airplanes performing missions over the inhabited areas. An urgent necessity arises to work out the norms of flight suitability of the mini and micro unmanned aerial vehicles. The work contains the analysis of suitability of the current aviation regulations to determine the requirements for the mini unmanned vehicles. The work concentrates on the phenomenon of determining the symmetrical loads from the maneuvers and the turbulence atmosphere. The result of this analysis is the Limit Maneuver Envelope, Limit <b>Gust</b> <b>Envelope</b> and Limit Combined Envelope for mini UAV. The analyzed flight states allowed selecting the so called design cases which can become a basis for determining the norms of loading of mini unmanned aerial vehicles which can constitute the beginning of the regulations for {{building of the}} unmanned aerial vehicles of this class...|$|E
