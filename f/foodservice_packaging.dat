5000|$|Marketplace {{shifts in}} the late 2000s {{accelerated}} the commercial application of enzymatic interesterification. Most impactful was the push for trans fat removal from both <b>foodservice</b> and <b>packaged</b> food products, which nearly eliminated the commercial application of partially hydrogenated products. Still in its commercial infancy, oils and shortening produced from enzymatic interesterification can provide the taste consumers desire in foods in a cost-effective and sustainable manner for manufacturers. [...] As {{with the history of}} hydrogenation and trans fats, no research has been conducted into the impact on human health of enzymatic interesterification.|$|R

500|$|Part of the product's format {{was in its}} packaging, {{which was}} {{designed}} to fit in a car cup holder. The BK Chicken Fry box, while square in shape, will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top, when opened, forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce. Burger King credits the design of this box with helping to make its Chicken Fries the most popular adult-oriented chicken product in the United States at the time. Since most of the fast food industry's business is take-out or drive-thru traffic, this allowed the convenience food purchaser to drive and eat with little effort. With the introduction of the BK Chicken Fries, BK began adapting some of its other product packaging so that it could also be placed in an automotive cup holder. In addition to the Chicken Fries container, the company added a trademarked and patented, round French fry container which it calls the [...] "FryPod", which is a paper cup made from 50 percent recycled materials that is also designed to fit in an automotive cup holder. The package design won an honorable mention at a packaging industry design competition hosted by the Quick Service Restaurant division of the <b>Foodservice</b> and <b>Packaging</b> Institute in 2007.|$|R

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also says that an often-cited waste prevention measure {{is the use of}} washable plates, cups, napkins instead of the disposables variety. (This will reduce solid waste but will have other environmental effects, such as increased water and energy use.) ...|$|E
50|$|A major {{development}} in disposable <b>foodservice</b> <b>packaging</b> happened in 1948 when the newly founded McDonald's restaurant closed to revamp its menu. Along with changing their menu items, the restaurant {{wanted to change}} the way it handled dishwashing and dishwashers, car hops and wait staff, and storage, breakage and (customer) theft of table ware.
