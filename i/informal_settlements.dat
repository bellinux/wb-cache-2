5|$|In {{the colonial}} period, {{most of the}} {{surviving}} Chajoma were forcibly settled in the towns of San Juan Sacatepéquez, San Pedro Sacatepéquez and San Martín Jilotepeque {{as a result of}} the Spanish policy of congregaciones; the people were moved to whichever of the three towns was closest to their pre-conquest land holdings. Some Iximche Kaqchikels seem also to have been relocated to the same towns. After their relocation some of the Chajoma drifted back to their pre-conquest centres, creating <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> and provoking hostilities with the Poqomam of Mixco and Chinautla along the former border between the pre-Columbian kingdoms. Some of these settlements eventually received official recognition, such as San Raimundo near Sacul.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{inadequate}} {{infrastructure to}} accommodate their surging population, <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> {{on the outskirts}} of the cities are being formed. Many refugees deforest the unexplored land and build squatters settlements, or slums, on the steeps, exploiting many hilly areas. Development of these hilly lands not only increase the rate of erosion but also put the inhabitants vulnerable to the risk of landslide, adding factors of insecurity to the already underprivileged community. Although these settlements are illegal, the government does not have the will nor power to form urban plans, strategies to stop people from migrating, or to regulate the migrants' behavior.|$|E
25|$|In February 2005 the {{government}} launched a programme {{to eradicate the}} use of bucket toilets. Bucket toilets consist of a bucket placed under a toilet seat; in formally established settlements the buckets are emptied {{on a daily basis}} by the municipality and the content is brought to a sewage treatment plant. However, buckets are also used in newly established <b>informal</b> <b>settlements.</b> There were 250,000 bucket toilets in formally established settlements as of 2005. There was a strong political will to carry out the program. As of March 2008, 91% of the bucket toilets were replaced by flush toilets or Ventilated Improved Pit Latrines where water was not readily available.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of slums within a city varies throughout the world. In {{most of the}} developed countries, {{it is easier to}} distinguish the slum-areas and non-slum areas. In the United States, slum dwellers are usually in city neighborhoods and inner suburbs, while in Europe, they are more common in high rise housing on the urban outskirts. In many developing countries, slums are prevalent as distributed pockets or as urban orbits of densely constructed <b>informal</b> <b>settlements.</b> In some cities, especially in countries in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan, slums are not just marginalized neighborhoods holding a small population; slums are widespread, and are home to a large part of urban population. These are sometimes called slum cities.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Biblical Studies)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2002. The {{study of}} {{planting}} and growing of {{churches in the}} <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> communities is an important research topic. It has not been covered by most researchers in their research work. Although {{it is a very}} important research topic, it is also a very difficult topic to handle because there are no adequate written records on the activities of the <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> communities in South Africa. In South Africa today there are millions of people who are staying in the <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> communities. These areas are mushrooming daily. Many people who are staying in these areas have not yet heard the gospel. Most churches neglect the planting and growing of churches in the inner cities and do very little to communicate the gospel to the <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> communities. This dissertation is an attempt to address the need to plant and grow churches in the <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> communities. Orange Farm <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> community is used as a special reference. The church is given the command to evangelize the whole world (Mathew 28 : 1820). Christians have been called to do mission work, but there are many misconceptions about the missionary calling. God calls all the converted people to a ministry within the church. Christ's servants must proclaim the gospel of the kingdom and bear witness in word and deed. We must therefore show that we do not only preach the gospel but our message is accompanied by skills we are offering to the poor. Jesus Had a particular interest in the poor and other marginalized groups. In His ministry He used both word and deed to minister them. He addressed both the spiritual and physical needs of the people. The church in the <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> community is also surrounded by growing numbers of those who are in need. It is the task of the church to reach out to all/ people with the gospel. The role of the church in the <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> communities is to interpret the reality of the gospel through the experience of the poor in the struggle for justice and wholeness.

40|$|In {{this study}} I use {{the notion of}} 'capabilities poverty', as theorised by Sen, to examine the {{experiences}} of learners attending <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> schools in North-West Province, South Africa. Sen distinguishes between functionings (what people do or their ability to do something) and capabilities (various combi­nations of what people do, their notions of freedom, what life opportunities they may have). The study {{was based on a}} sample of respondents from four schools in the Sarafina <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> in Ikageng township in the municipal district of Tlokwe (Potchefstroom). It captured some complexities of schooling within South Africa's democratic educational framework and clearly exposed the mani­festations of capabilities poverty. The precise location of capabilities poverty within the plethora of poverty approaches presents educational research with a reality check when looking at <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> schools. The study revealed a multiplicity of barriers for <b>informal</b> <b>settlement</b> learners that prevent them from choosing the educational experience they value and contributes to research into the nuanced nature of the interface between poverty and schooling...|$|R

25|$|In November 2009, a {{community}} of 1500-2500 Zimbabwean farm workers was forcibly evicted from {{their homes in the}} <b>informal</b> <b>settlements</b> of De Doorns, a grape-farming town in the Western Cape. No persons were physically assaulted but homes were trashed and looted and this led to the biggest displacement of foreign nationals since May 2008. The Zimbabweans were then housed in a displaced persons' camp where some remained for a year until it was closed. Researchers identified the role of a ward councillor, Mpumelelo Lubisi, in inciting the attack in possible collusion with informal labour brokers who had financial interests in getting rid of their Zimbabwean competitors. South African workers also accused farmers of employing the Zimbabweans at less than minimum wage (farmers and Zimbabwean workers denied this).|$|E

25|$|Urbanization {{might also}} force {{some people to}} live in slums when it {{influences}} land use by transforming agricultural land into urban areas and increases land value. During the process of urbanization, some agricultural land is used for additional urban activities. More investment will come into these areas, which increases the land value. Before some land is completely urbanized, there is a period when the land {{can be used for}} neither urban activities nor agriculture. The income from the land will decline, which decreases the people's incomes in that area. The gap between people's low income and the high land price forces some people to look for and construct cheap <b>informal</b> <b>settlements,</b> which are known as slums in urban areas. The transformation of agricultural land also provides surplus labor, as peasants have to seek jobs in urban areas as rural-urban migrant workers.|$|E
