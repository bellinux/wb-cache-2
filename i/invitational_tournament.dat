5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball <b>Invitational</b> <b>Tournament</b> in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E
5|$|In late 1999, Runnels {{arranged}} the Terri <b>Invitational</b> <b>Tournament,</b> a best-of-five series, between Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz, with the winner receiving her managerial {{services and the}} sum of $100,000. The Hardy Boyz won the tournament, which culminated in a ladder match at No Mercy (with the prize money suspended above the ring in a bag). Runnels spent {{the next few months}} as their manager until she was injured when Bubba Ray Dudley powerbombed her through a table. She returned on February 27 at No Way Out and cost the Hardy Boyz a match. She then became the manager of Edge and Christian, and the storyline originally called for her to come between the duo, resulting in them becoming singles wrestlers with Runnels managing Christian. The storyline, however, was rewritten, and on an episode of SmackDown!, Edge and Christian—who would now continue wrestling as a tag team—revealed they no longer wanted Runnels's services. She, therefore, slapped Edge, who responded by spearing her.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} collegiate game, against Duke, Farmer played 7 minutes and air balled his only shot. After an early season loss to Notre Dame in the Big Four Classic dropped the Wildcats' record to 23, Sutton noted that Farmer, Sean Sutton, and LaRon Ellis had all missed {{practice}} {{time with the}} flu. After managing just 17 points in the Wildcats' first five games, Farmer scored 10 points in 20 minutes in the team's sixth game against Northwestern State. With 12 seconds {{to go in the}} game and Kentucky trailing 8482, Farmer was whistled for an intentional foul on Northwestern State's Roman Banks while trying to draw a charge on an inbounds play. Banks maintained that Farmer had tugged Banks toward him and fallen down, attempting to draw the call, but Farmer and Sutton both denied the alleged chicanery. Banks hit one of two free throws, and Farmer missed a potentially game-tying three-point shot at the buzzer, dropping the Wildcats to 24 on the season. Farmer followed up with a 15-point performance in a win against Western Carolina. In the Kentucky <b>Invitational</b> <b>Tournament,</b> where Kentucky lost its opening round game to Bowling Green before winning the third-place game against Marshall, Farmer scored 12 points in each game.|$|E
