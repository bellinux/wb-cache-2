500|$|In March 1932, the {{arrangements}} for flying between Lympne and Croydon in poor visibility were altered. If the cloudbase {{was less than}} [...] above sea level, or the visibility was less than , aircraft were prohibited from using the Croydon–Caterham–Penshurst–Lympne route, but were to use either the Croydon–Merstham–Edenbridge or Croydon–Chelsfield–Shoreham–Otford–Wrotham route. Alternatively a rhumb line course could be flown on the Croydon–Chelsfield–Lympne route. Aircraft not fitted with radios had to notify the officer in charge at their <b>departure</b> <b>airport</b> as to which route they intended to take before departure. Royal Air Force aircraft would avoid these routes as far as practicable in conditions of poor visibility. On 25 August the Folkestone Trophy Race was held at Lympne and was won by a Comper Swift. In November, {{it was reported that}} new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15-cm waveband at 2,000 Megahertz. The new radios were to be used for the announcement of the departure of non-radio aircraft across the Channel. Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a teleprinter, providing a record of the communication. The new equipment was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933.|$|E

40|$|When {{weather or}} other {{circumstances}} reduce the landing capacity of an airport {{below the level}} of demand, arriving aircraft experience airborne holding. A ground delay program (GDP) controls the arrival flow by holding some aircraft at their <b>departure</b> <b>airports</b> for specified periods of time, converting airborne holding into less expensive and less risky ground holding. We developed a spreadsheet model of GDPs to provide an accessible and transparent platform for developing a better understanding of their properties. We used the model to address two questions. First, since GDPs are planned in anticipation of reductions in arrival capacity, when should uncertainty about those conditions affect the ground delays assigned to individual flights? Second, when is it advantageous to cancel flights rather than delay them, and which flights should be cancelled? Sometimes the capacity of an airport to accept arriving aircraft is reduced by weather or other circumstances {{below the level of}} demand. This reduced capacity causes airborne delays as aircraft are forced to queue for landing.

It is shown analytically that if the frequency elasticity of demand is smaller than 1, unique airfare-frequency and passenger-charge equilibria exist. Next, symmetric equilibria are derived analytically; their properties are also examined. Finally, asymmetric equilibria are derived numerically, while their properties are discussed as well. © 2000 Academic Press...|$|R

40|$|Key-words: airport choice, airport demand {{forecasting}} In {{this paper}} we describe a comprehensive, pragmatic air demand model {{system that has}} been implemented for Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. This model, called the Airport Network and Catchment area Competition Model (ACCM), provides forecasts of future air passenger volumes and aircraft movements not only based on generic passenger demand growth but also explicitly taking account of choices of air passengers among competing airports in Europe. The model uses a straightforward nested logit structure to represent choices of air passengers among <b>departure</b> <b>airports,</b> airport access modes, airlines, types of flight and main modes of transport. Because data is only available for Schiphol airport, synthetic data for other alternatives had to be generated. The forecasts are based on four scenarios {{that have been developed}} by the Dutch planning agencies (Global Economy, Strong Europe, Transatlantic Markets, Regional Communities). The total number of air passengers using Schiphol grows from 40 million in base year 2003 to 67 million in 2020 in the Regional Communities scenario, and up to 113 million in the Global Economy scenario. Aviation experts of the Dutch Ministry of Transport and other airport experts saw the forecasts that were obtained as credible...|$|R
