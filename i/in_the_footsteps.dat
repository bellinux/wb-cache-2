40|$|The brain organizes sound into {{coherent}} sequences, termed audi-tory streams. We {{asked whether}} task-irrelevant sounds would be detected as separate auditory streams {{in a natural}} listening envir-onment that included three simultaneously active sound sources. Participants watched a movie with sound while street-noise and sequences of naturally varying footstep sounds were presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background. Occasional deviations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> sequences elicited <b>the</b> mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential. The elicitation of MMN showed that the regular features of <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> sequences had been registered and their violations detected, which could only occur if <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> sequence had been detected as a separate auditory stream. Our results demonstrate that sounds are organized into auditory streams irrespective of their relevance to ongoing behavior. NeuroRepor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Footstep {{recognition}} {{is a relatively}} new biometric which aims to discriminate people using walking characteristics extracted from floor-based sensors. This paper reports {{for the first time a}} comparative assessment of the spatiotemporal information contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> signals for person recognition. Experiments are carried out on <b>the</b> largest <b>footstep</b> database collected to date, with almost 20, 000 valid footstep signals and more than 120 people. Results show very similar performance for both spatial and temporal approaches (5 to 15 percent EER depending on the experimental setup), and a significant improvement is achieved for their fusion (2. 5 to 10 percent EER). The assessment protocol is focused on the influence of the quantity of data used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reference models, which serves to simulate conditions of different potential applications such as smart homes or security access scenarios.

McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E
