25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|He stepped past me {{into the}} room. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind him.|$|E
60|$|With a {{last word}} of {{reassurance}} and comfort <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and plunged {{away into the}} darkness.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> {{and again}} {{advanced}} towards Bartleby. I felt additional incentives tempting {{me to my}} fate. I burned to be rebelled against again. I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear uncle," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> gently, and {{approaching}} {{him with}} the blandest of smiles, [...] "you are always so very kind and considerate, and have evinced your benevolence in so many--so very many ways--that--that I feel I have only to suggest this little point to you once more to make sure of your full acquiescence." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> moment <b>I</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>I</b> {{went downstairs}} to the porter in the hall.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Lady Angela was {{lounging}} in my easy {{chair with a}} slight smile upon her lips.|$|E
60|$|The Duke was in {{his study}} {{awaiting}} our arrival. I saw him rise and bow stiffly to my stepmother. Then <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and left them alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and seated}} myself by her side. She removed her hands {{from her face}} when she felt me near her. She {{looked at me with}} a cold and steady surprise.|$|E
60|$|With {{this she}} turned and stepped quickly from <b>the</b> room. <b>I</b> followed, <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind me.|$|R
60|$|By that time, <b>I</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on them, {{and was out}} {{of hearing}} {{of the rest of}} the dispute.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{behind her}} {{and come back to}} the little table at which we had been sitting, Doctor Winchester said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That can't happen, {{in the way}} you mean. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the {{old life}} against my return, with my own hands; and you don't gain distinction, as the Challoners think of it, in business." ...|$|E
6000|$|He made a sign {{of grave}} dissent. [...] "That can't happen, {{in the way you}} mean. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the old life against my return with my own hands, and you don't gain distinction, as the Challoners think of it, in business." ...|$|E
60|$|Louis appeared, as ever, {{punctual}} to the moment. He {{carried a}} menu card in his hand. He had {{the air of}} having come to take my orders for some projected feast. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the outer hall and the door of my sitting-room.|$|E
60|$|I {{was all but}} in when {{he turned}} {{the corner of the}} passage, and so caught sight of me before <b>I</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
30|$|Whenever you sing, <b>I</b> have to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That being so, Monsieur le Comte," [...] said I quietly, [...] "I {{will have}} a little talk with you before going after her." [...] And <b>I</b> {{carefully}} <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{passed down}} the avenue, {{and out of}} sight. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with a little shudder and turned round. Gomez was by my side. Through the gloom I could see that his dark eyes were full of fire, and his olive {{features}} were set and grim.|$|E
60|$|Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He {{staggered}} {{against the}} wall, while <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with an oath, and commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an instant; then, {{with a slight}} sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his defence.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{answered}} by a waiter--a mere lad. As {{the light in}} the passage fell on my face, he paused in the act of addressing me, and drew back a few steps. Without stopping for any explanations, <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind me, and said to him at once: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not exactly before I had left; {{but when}} <b>I</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and was on}} the landing I heard her boot drop on the floor, as it does {{sometimes}} when pulled off?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Following Miss Trelawny, I {{moved over}} to a dainty room which opened from the hall and {{looked out on the}} garden {{at the back of the}} house. When we had entered and <b>I</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> she said: ...|$|R
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} I caught sight of men coming into the street, perhaps {{at the corner of}} the Rue St. Pierre, and then more men, and as we went into the house I saw that they were running. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> There were cries in the street now, but he did not seem to heed them. He stood listening, heart-stricken, to the sounds that came through the bedroom wall, and a spasm crossed his face. Then he turned like a man not to be denied, to <b>the</b> bedroom <b>door.</b> I was before him, but Madame la Vicomtesse opened it. And I {{remember}} feeling astonishment that she did not show surprise or alarm.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> softly. I {{remained}} {{for a moment}} or so on the big landing, hesitating between my bedroom and my study. As I did so I heard the soft rustle of her movement and the click of the key in her bedroom door. Then everything was still....|$|E
60|$|Neither he nor {{his friend}} said any more. I gained {{the top of}} the stairs and ran along the passage. In my haste and my {{agitation}} I left the door of the ante-chamber open, but <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the bedroom the moment I was inside it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I will go by all means," [...] I answered: and I {{was glad}} of the {{unexpected}} opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I {{slipped out of}} the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> quietly behind me.|$|E
60|$|I took my hat {{and walked}} out. After <b>I</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>I</b> remembered {{something}} that I {{had forgotten to}} say. I opened it again. The doctor had not moved from {{where he had been}} sitting, but he gave a slightly nervous start when he saw me again.|$|R
6000|$|... "An it please your Grace," [...] said Bowyer, [...] "it is {{the same}} against whom <b>I</b> this instant <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> presence-room." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> {{heard her}} <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of her mother's room, I {{knew that she}} would first pray before the shrine of the little Virgin.|$|R
60|$|He left {{me without}} any further farewell, and turned slowly homewards. When {{he reached the}} bend in the road he paused, and {{remained}} there for several moments motionless. His eyes were fixed upon the small creek. He seemed to be measuring the distance {{between it and the}} road. He was still lingering there when <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|I tore downstairs, {{jumped into}} the waiting taxi and {{returned}} to the Milan. I entered the private room with a grave face. Evidently I was only just in time. The rubber of bridge had been broken up and my guests were standing about in little groups talking. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind me and held up my hand.|$|E
60|$|I was late. The First Act {{was nearly}} over. The play {{was not yet}} alive, neither in the bosoms of the actors nor in the audience. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the box softly, and came forward. The rolling Italian eyes of Hamlet glanced up at me. There came a new impulse over the Court of Denmark.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, my dear," [...] he assented. [...] "But I don't think it's a {{question}} of moral responsibility; it's {{a question}} of mental structure, isn't it? Your consciousness isn't built in thought-tight compartments, and one emotion goes all through it, and sinks you; but <b>I</b> simply <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and shut <b>the</b> emotion in, and keep on." ...|$|R
60|$|Tallant, too, added something, and Berringer,--I've {{forgotten}} what. I was tired, {{too tired}} to meet their advances halfway. I said that I had a speech {{to get ready for}} that night, and other affairs to attend to, and left them grouped together like crestfallen conspirators--all save Miller Gorse, whose pervasive gaze seemed to follow me after <b>I</b> had <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Gone again, {{with her}} dreadful wail of [...] "Frank! Frank!" [...] Now I hear her at <b>the</b> front <b>door,</b> and, half mad with a horrible fear, I {{run down the}} long, dark hall and unbar it. There is nothing there--nothing but the wild rush {{of the wind and}} the drip of the rain from the portico. But I can hear the wailing voice going round the house, past the patch of shrubbery. <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and listen. There, she has got through the little yard, and is at <b>the</b> back <b>door</b> now. Whoever it is, she must know the way about the house. Along the hall I go again, through a swing <b>door,</b> through <b>the</b> servants' hall, {{stumbling}} down some steps into the kitchen, where the embers of the fire are still alive in the grate, diffusing a little warmth and light into the dense gloom.|$|R
