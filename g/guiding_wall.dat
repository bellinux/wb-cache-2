Their purpose is to guide the fish to a bypass (i. e. a sluice gate, weir, or pipe) allowing the fish to circumvent the turbine intakes and safely pass downstream. This paper details a series of experiments (nine total) performed at the USGS Conte Anadromous Fish Research Center located in Turners Falls, MA {{and a series of}} computational fluid dynamics models (24 total).

The {{hydraulic efficiency}} of the tanks was assessed with a CFD model, which calculated the flow fields and the flow through curves (FTCs) for the initial and the modified geometries. From the comparison of the results the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the flow for the initial geometries was characterized by high levels of short-circuiting, large re-circulation regions and high degrees of mixing, and (2) the use of <b>guiding</b> <b>walls</b> created flow fields in the tanks with significant volumes of ""plug flow"", reduced short-circuiting, smaller re-circulation regions and thus less mixing. The modified geometries showing the best hydraulic efficiency were proposed for construction. This procedure, which can be applied in the all types of water tanks, resulted in significant cost savings, because the modifications were examined with the CFD model, prior to their actual implementation in the real tanks. © 2007 Elsevier B.

The TFCF functions to prevent fish entrainment at the Tracy Pumping Plant. The TFCF collects fish that are {{then returned to the}} Delta. To achieve efficient fish collection, velocity fields should be generated that are uniform and that supply well directed guidance to the bypass entrance. In the first phase of this study, modeling was used to develop low maintenance internal features of the bypass entrance that generated near-uniform internal velocity distributions (Kubitschek 2003). This second phase study focused on extending the 1 : 3 model findings to the approach flow. Study findings show that velocity distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} bypass entrance are influenced by approach flow velocity distributions. This may imply that the TFCF trashracks and louvers should be maintained clean to sustain uniform velocity fields approaching and entering the intakes. Findings also show that by adding a minor flow restriction to the backside of the louver immediately adjacent to the bypass entrances, a local through louver high velocity zone can be eliminated which should improve fish guidance to the bypass intake. Finally, findings show that acceptable passing flow and bypass entrance hydraulics can be maintained with the bypass <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> removed.

40|$|Due to a {{wide range}} of field {{vibration}} problems caused by flood discharge at the Xiangjiaba Hydropower Station, vibration characteristics and influencing factors were investigated based on prototype observation. The results indicate that field vibrations caused by flood discharge have distinctive characteristics of constancy, low frequency, small amplitude, and randomness with impact, which significantly differ from the common high-frequency vibration characteristics. Field vibrations have a main frequency of about 0. 5 – 3. 0  Hz and the characteristics of long propagation distance and large-scale impact. The vibration of a stilling basin slab runs mainly in the vertical direction. The vibration response of the <b>guide</b> <b>wall</b> perpendicular to the flow is significantly stronger than it is in other directions and decreases linearly downstream along the <b>guide</b> <b>wall.</b> The vibration response of the underground turbine floor is mainly caused by the load of unit operation. Urban environmental vibration has particular distribution characteristics and change patterns, and is greatly affected by discharge, scheduling modes, and geological conditions. Along with the increase of the height of residential buildings, vibration responses show a significant amplification effect. The horizontal and vertical vibrations of the 7 th floor are, respectively, about 6 times and 1. 5 times stronger than the corresponding vibrations of the 1 st floor. The vibration of a large-scale chemical plant presents the combined action of flood discharge and working machines. Meanwhile, it is very difficult to reduce the low-frequency environmental vibrations. Optimization of the discharge scheduling mode is one of the effective measures of reducing the flow impact loads at present. Choosing reasonable dam sites is crucial...|$|R
