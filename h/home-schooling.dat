40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{document}} relationships that exist between Indiana public-school superintendents and Indiana <b>home-school</b> families. The study examined if public-school superintendents' perceptions of home schooling and their perceptions of current Indiana <b>home-school</b> regulations influenced their relationships with home schoolers. Further, the study explored <b>home-schooler</b> perceptions of Indiana regulations on home schooling. For the superintendent questionnaire, the entire population of Indiana school district superintendents in office during the 1996 - 1997 school year was polled. Of the 297 superintendents polled, 192 responded to the initial mailing and three more to the follow-up resulting in a total of 195 responses- a return rate of 66 %. The desired population for the home schoolers was all <b>home-school</b> families in Indiana. Based on the Indiana Department of Education estimate of 5500 <b>home-school</b> families registered with them, 550 questionnaires were mailed to <b>home-school</b> families with a 26 % return rate. The following conclusions were drawn based on the findings in the study. 1. Indiana public-school superintendents probably have a weaker relationship with the <b>home-school</b> parents in their school district than they believe. While nearly 65 % of the superintendents believed they had at least a fair relationship with the home schoolers in their district, only 35. 5 % of the <b>home-school</b> parents believed their relationship with the superintendent was at least fair. 2. Home schoolers desire more interaction with the public schools than they are receiving. Twenty percent of the home schoolers who did not have access to services at their local school wanted access to classes and textbooks from their local school district. 3. Indiana superintendents are not knowledgeable about reasons parents choose to home school their children. Superintendents believed religion was a reason for home schooling in significantly larger numbers than the <b>home-school</b> parents (86 % superintendents verses 55 % of <b>home-school</b> parents). Superintendents did not recognize <b>home-school</b> parent concerns such as safety concerns, concerns with academics and problems with public schools. 4. All Indiana public schools need a board-approved policy concerning <b>home-schooled</b> students in their district. 5. There are children in Indiana receiving little or no education through home schooling. 6. Home schoolers in the present Indiana study, for the most part, are representative of home schoolers across the United States. 7. While the public perception of home schools has improved significantly in the last decade, superintendents' perceptions of home schools have changed little. Superintendents' perceptions of home schooling were virtually unchanged from the Lindley study completed in 1985. Superintendents believed home schools should have to participate in mandatory testing of students, certification of <b>home-school</b> teachers and should have mandatory registration with the state of Indiana.

40|$|The current thesis {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} Vietnamese {{parents of children with}} a disability and special educators who worked with these parents in both mainstream and special schools in Melbourne Metropolitan Regions of the state of Victoria, Australia. The key objective {{of the study was to}} research the role of the parent-educator (interpersonal) relationship and its interrelatedness with the task: two major components of a <b>home-school</b> partnership. The research question that guided this study was &# 039;How does the parent-educator relationship influence the operation of a family-centered <b>home-school</b> partnership?&# 039; With partnerships involving parents of diverse cultural backgrounds, investigating cultural influences on the partnership were an integral part of the research process. A qualitative interpretive approach was employed in searching for perceptions of involved pa rties about their <b>home-school</b> partnerships. The design selected was multiple embedded case studies with purposeful sampling. Influences on <b>home-school</b> partnership were investigated from a multidimensional perspective and were described and interpreted from the views of both parents and educators. The findings indicated that the relationship played a much more significant role than the task in the successfulness of an intercultural <b>home-school</b> partnership. Without a mutual understanding of <b>home-school</b> communication, the collaboration was far from productive or even did not work out. There was also evidence that a harmonious parent-educator interpersonal relationship did not seem to have any influence on the effectiveness of a <b>home-school</b> partnership without parent-educator mutual understanding and agreement in terms of goals and roles expectations. The need for the educators to be more appropriately equipped with cultural training and family-centered principles also arose from the study findings...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{a study that}} investigated {{the ways in which}} <b>home-school</b> structures shape the involvement of parents from the Horn of Africa (i. e. Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan) in their children's education. The fieldwork for the study was conducted in 2006 - 2007 academic year in three primary schools in two London local authorities (LAs). The study draws on an ethnographic research design, in which I carried out participant observations, examined documents and conducted semi-structured interviews with participants/contributors in the case study schools. The analysis of study suggests that Horn of Africa parents could be categorised into four main types: nomads, reactivists, devotees and advocates. Although the typology indicates subtle differences in the parents' experiences of <b>home-school</b> relationships, analysis of the data using Critical Race Theory (CRT) perspective, suggests that <b>home-school</b> discourse is shaped by a colour-blind and equal opportunities approach. In practice, this masks considerable inequalities and discrimination. The thesis highlights shortcomings of the prevailing <b>home-school</b> structures in the case study schools, which may undermine the role of many parents of Horn of Africa heritage in their children's education. It is argued that tackling the inequalities of the experiences of the <b>home-school</b> relationship is essential to creating an inclusive approach to involve Horn of Africa parents in their children's schooling. Based on this analysis, an equitable <b>home-school</b> approach, drawing on the CRT perspective, is proposed in an attempt to foster the <b>home-school</b> experiences of Horn of Africa parents in schools. Schools taking the initiative for involving Horn of Africa parents in their children's education have major imp Ii cations for raising the attainment of the children and most importantly meeting the Government's legislative obligations such as the last Labour's Government's policy, Every Parent Matters. The thesis seeks to broaden the understanding of the educational experiences of minority ethnic parents. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
