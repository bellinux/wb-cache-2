5|$|The castle is {{approached}} {{through the}} castle meadow, {{an area of}} open parkland, lined with Holm oaks planted in the 1860s, and is surrounded by the dry moat, now a garden dating from at least the 1850s and planted with trees and shrubs. Adjacent to the castle are the Queen Mother's Garden and the kitchen garden and <b>glasshouses.</b> The Queen Mother's Garden was built by English Heritage as a 95th birthday gift for the then Lord Warden in 1997, the site having been originally part of the wider kitchen gardens, before being turned into a tennis court in the 1920s. Designed by Penelope Hobhouse, the garden incorporates classical and Islamic themes, with a 92-foot-long (28 m) pool, a viewing mound and a classical pavilion. The two <b>glasshouses</b> have been restored, functioning as cold greenhouses, while {{the remainder of the}} kitchen garden is planted with a mixture of vegetables, fruit trees and flowers.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in <b>glasshouses.</b> It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E

5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who were hiding explosives at Killakee. When the bank {{was unable to find}} a buyer for the estate, it was acquired by a builder who stripped the house and then demolished it in 1941. The lands were eventually acquired by the State and opened to the public. In the late 1930s, the Director of Forestry, a German called Otto Reinhard, laid out the area as an urban forest.

25|$|The {{vast amounts}} of wood needed to produce glass in this way {{dictated}} that <b>glasshouses</b> be located in forest areas and that the woodland be managed carefully by coppicing and pollarding to maximise the wood resource and to optimise the size of wood pieces used. Even so, periodically the glasshouse would have to relocate, as the woodland was depleted. The glass industry had to compete for wood supplies with other industries such as mining, and domestic demand. In sixteenth-century England, an embargo {{was placed on the}} use of wood for fuel for glassmaking. <b>Glasshouses</b> often were located in forests owned by the church. One of the main uses of forest glass was for ecclesiastical stained glass windows.|$|E

25|$|A {{small glass}} {{industry}} existed in Newcastle from the mid-15th century. In 1615 restrictions {{were put on}} the use of wood for manufacturing glass. It was found that glass could be manufactured using the local coal, and so a glassmaking industry grew up on Tyneside. Huguenot glassmakers came over from France as refugees from persecution and set up <b>glasshouses</b> in the Skinnerburn area of Newcastle. Eventually, glass production moved to the Ouseburn area of Newcastle. In 1684 the Dagnia family, Sephardic Jewish emigrants from Altare, arrived in Newcastle from Stourbridge and established <b>glasshouses</b> along the Close, to manufacture high quality flint glass. The glass manufacturers used sand ballast from the boats arriving in the river as the main raw material. The glassware was then exported in collier brigs. The period from 1730 to 1785 was the highpoint of Newcastle glass manufacture, when the local glassmakers produced the 'Newcastle Light Baluster'. The glassmaking industry still exists in the west end of the city with local Artist and Glassmaker Jane Charles carrying on over four hundred years of hot glass blowing in Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} the {{district}} depends on agriculture, tourism and raising livestock. The town of Silifke is as a market for the coastal plain, which produces beans, peanuts, sesame, banana, orange, lemon, cotton, grapes, lentils, olives, tobacco, and canned fruits and vegetables. An irrigation project located at Silifke supplies the fertile Göksu delta. In recent {{years there has been}} a large investment in <b>glasshouses</b> for producing strawberries and other fruit and vegetables in the winter season.|$|E

25|$|Aphids {{may also}} be {{controlled}} by the release of natural enemies, in particular lady beetles and parasitic wasps. However, since adult lady beetles tend to fly away within 48 hours after release, without laying eggs, repeated application {{of large numbers of}} lady beetles are needed to be effective. For example, one large, heavily infested rose bush may take two applications of 1500 beetles each. In reality, therefore, the only cost effective situation in which mass release of natural enemies makes sense is in closed or semi-closed environments such as <b>glasshouses</b> or polytunnels.|$|E
25|$|Tiffany {{started out}} as a painter, but became {{interested}} in glassmaking from about 1875 and worked at several <b>glasshouses</b> in Brooklyn between then and 1878. In 1879 he joined with Candace Wheeler, Samuel Colman, and Lockwood de Forest to form Louis Comfort Tiffany and Associated American Artists. The business was short-lived, lasting only four years. The group made designs for wallpaper, furniture, and textiles. He later opened his own glass factory in Corona, New York, determined to provide designs that improved the quality of contemporary glass. Tiffany's leadership and talent, as well as his father's money and connections, led this business to thrive.|$|E
25|$|The First Presbyterian Church {{building}} of 1905 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, {{is said to}} be unique in that it uses Tiffany windows that partially make use of painted glass. Use of the colored glass itself to create stained glass pictures was motivated by the ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement and its leader William Morris in England. Fellow artists and glassmakers Oliver Kimberly and Frank Duffner, founders of the Duffner and Kimberly Company and John La Farge were Tiffany's chief competitors in this new American style of stained glass. Tiffany, Duffner and Kimberly, along with La Farge, had learned their craft at the same <b>glasshouses</b> in Brooklyn in the late 1870s.|$|E

50|$|The design encapsulates {{the solar}} thermal system within a greenhouse-like <b>glasshouse.</b> The <b>glasshouse</b> creates a {{protected}} environment {{to withstand the}} elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system. Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from {{the ceiling of the}} <b>glasshouse</b> by wires. A single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight. The mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the <b>glasshouse</b> structure. Water is carried throughout the length of the pipe, which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors.|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{changing}} climatic conditions mainly related to greenhouse effect, this study was focused on determining the responses of two differentially heat tolerant maize varieties to <b>glasshouse</b> condition. The parameters studies included growth, water relations, gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, oxidative damage and gene expression. Results revealed that prevailing <b>glasshouse</b> conditions {{played a crucial role}} in affecting the maize growth across winter and summer seasons. Despite differences in the growing seasons and varieties <b>glasshouse</b> conditions were adverse for the photosynthetic systems in maize. Major yardsticks of sensitivity were loss of chlorophyll and carotenoids in the light reactions, while reductions in the net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in the <b>glasshouse</b> grown maize. Prevailing <b>glasshouse</b> conditions were greatly effective in hampering the leaf water relation particularly those of winter sown crop. The <b>glasshouse</b> conditions in winter crop produced oxidative stress on the plants, which was explicit from the increased synthesis of H 2 O 2, MDA and increased permeability to the ion leakage. Greater free proline accumulation in the tolerant variety not only presented itself as a major amino acid accumulated in environmental stress tolerance but also indicated it as a reliable indicator of tolerance to <b>glasshouse</b> condition in maize. With great varietal difference, changes of temperature and relative humidity inside the <b>glasshouse</b> across the seasons were mainly responsible for the observed changes in mineral nutrients. More distinct changes were evident in K, Ca and nitrate nutrition, which were given greater credence in view of their closer association to the seasonal changes in the environmental conditions inside the <b>glasshouse.</b> Maize seedlings showed sensitivity to high temperature stress, which was recorded from morphological (reduction in shoot fresh weight, dry weight of shoot and root and a reduction in fresh-to-dry weight ratio) and gene expression patterns. The molecular studies suggested that the maize sensitivity to high temperature was mainly due to enhanced coexpression of sag and dhn 2 and failure to express hsp 70 and sgr 2 during relatively long term exposure to high temperature...|$|R
25|$|The 19th-century {{glasshouse}} {{grew out}} of the city-dweller’s desire to bring nature and the natural into urban life. These structures became popular in urban, public, and semi-public settings. As these structures gained popularity in Europe, greenhouses began to be constructed on larger scales and of stronger materials. One engineer, Joseph Paxton (1803–1865), had an enormous effect {{on the development of the}} conservatory building type. His structures called for a system of glass and metal roof construction, whereas past structures had typically been constructed of wood and glass. His choice of materials allowed designs for <b>glasshouses</b> of substantially larger scales. His best-known example is the Crystal Palace at the world’s first International Exhibition in 1851. Elsewhere in Europe, Hector Horeau designed several conservatories of glass and iron, such as the Lyons Conservatory in France of 1847. In Germany, August von Voit designed the Great Palm House in the Old Botanical Gardens in Munich in 1860.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining a {{comfortable}} temperature inside {{such a large}} glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. <b>Glasshouses</b> rely {{on the fact that}} they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions - they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function - the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors {{at the end of each}} day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.|$|E

40|$|This review {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} strategies for selection of salt tolerant woody Australian species for land reclamation. There {{is evidence that}} in selecting material to screen, provenances from saline areas will show higher levels of salt tolerance than those from non-saline areas. However, there are sufficient numbers of exceptions to justify inclusion in trials of some material from non-saline areas. Because of the complexity and long term nature of field trials, large numbers of species and provenances have been screened as juvenile plants (up to 1 year old) in the <b>glasshouse.</b> For very few of these, has the match between performance in <b>glasshouse</b> and field been checked. In Eucalyptus, the genus for which most species have been screened, the assessment of salinity tolerance is {{the same in the}} field and <b>glasshouse</b> for 20 species, three appear more tolerant in the field than the <b>glasshouse</b> and five are less tolerant in the field than would be expected from <b>glasshouse</b> results. For 13 eucalypt species there are conflicting results between different <b>glasshouse</b> and/or field trials. A similar picture emerges for Melaleuca, Acacia and Casuarina though in these genera fewer species have been tested in both <b>glasshouse</b> and field. <b>Glasshouse</b> trials have a role where specific information is needed from juvenile plants such as the ability of a species to exclude salt from the leaves, or performance under controlled conditions of waterlogging or saline waterlogging. However, as the objective of most experiments is to identify superior salt tolerant lines for the field, despite the complexity and cost, well designed and monitored field trials are the ultimate test. Researchers are also encouraged to consider inclusion of appropriate standard lines of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. occidentalis to enable better comparisons between trials...|$|R
