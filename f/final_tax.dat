40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the introduction of a <b>final</b> withholding <b>tax</b> on capital income on the progression of the German income tax. As previous literature shows, even with synthetic income taxation, tax progression was strongest {{in the middle of the}} income distribution, and decreased for high incomes. At the top, notably for the richest top 0. 001 % of potential taxpayers, tax progression was not further observable. In 2009, the tax schedule changed and capital income was excluded from the synthetic income tax tariff. Instead, it is taxed at a lower <b>final</b> withholding <b>tax</b> rate. This paper explores the effect of this change on the overall progression on total income. The analysis is based on a microlevel panel dataset of income tax returns between 2001 and 2006, which provides information on the distribution of total taxable income and is particularly representative for the top of the income distribution...|$|R

5000|$|The Danish {{minority}} {{government did}} propose a dual income tax {{in the spring}} of 1985, but the opposition was reluctant to give up the idea of progressive taxation of capital income. The <b>final</b> <b>tax</b> reform of 1987 included some amount of progressive taxation of capital income, but the top marginal tax rate on capital income (56 percent) was less than the top marginal tax rate of labour income (68 percent). It was thus not a pure dual income tax that was introduced in Denmark in 1987, but the Danish tax system moved considerably away from the comprehensive income tax.|$|E
50|$|In France {{statutory}} {{payroll tax}} only covers employee and employer {{contributions to the}} social security system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a general {{theoretical}} model that describes production and recycling in an n-firm oligopoly market in which firms can cooperate for recycling. We use a three-stage game to analyze a specific recycling issue. In stage 0, the government sets a target recycling rate as well as virgin material and <b>final</b> disposal <b>tax</b> rates. In stage 1, n identical firms simultaneously invest to reduce the cost of recycling given the recycling target. Here we treat this activity as a type of R&D. Furthermore, we consider three kinds of R&D activities depending on what firms maximize in stage 1, namely, industry-wide cooperation, within-group cooperation, and non-cooperation. In stage 2, firms engage in a Cournot competition. Surprisingly, positive virgin material <b>taxes</b> or positive <b>final</b> disposal <b>taxes</b> discourage firms from engaging in recycling R&D efforts in normal situations, regardless of whether R&D cooperation takes place. We compare second-best social welfare levels under the three regimes described above. We find that both non-cooperation and within-group cooperation are inferior from a welfare perspective to industry-wide cooperation. Furthermore, in the case of within-group cooperation, the symmetric division of firms induces the lowest welfare for all ranges of a given spillover parameter. Recycling, Cooperation, Cournot Competition...|$|R
30|$|Another {{somewhat}} surprising {{result is}} the moderate progressivity of the tax schedule. Remember that the tax schedule captures the progressivity of the gross tax payable {{in the absence of}} allowances. In a large number of countries, such as for example Latvia, Lithuania or France, the progressivity of either tax allowances or tax credits or both is positive suggesting that <b>final</b> net <b>taxes</b> are more progressive than what is suggested by the tax schedule alone. Unsurprisingly, the most progressive schedules are the ones with many tax brackets such as those in Germany, Luxembourg or France.|$|R

5000|$|Typically the {{withholding}} tax {{is treated as}} a payment {{on account of the}} recipient's <b>final</b> <b>tax</b> liability, when the withholding is made in advance.
