50|$|The Worcester Corset Company Factory is an {{historic}} factory building at 30 Wyman Street in Worcester, Massachusetts in the Main South neighborhood. The oldest {{part of the}} factory was built in 1895, with expansion of the facilities taking place up to 1909. The buildings were designed by Arthur Gray for the Worcester Corset Company, whose origins date to an 1861 business by David Hale <b>Fanning</b> making <b>hoops</b> for skirts, but shifted to manufacturing corsets after fashions changed. Fanning's business was immensely successful, and {{he became one of}} Worcester's larger employers. After the Corset Company folded in 1940, the facility was used to manufacture military-style boots.|$|R
50|$|In January 2009 {{the shirts}} for the 2009 season were unveiled. The home kit was {{a return to}} cherry red. The home kit {{consisted}} of the traditional club colours of cherry and white hoops. The replica shirts sold to <b>fans</b> had full <b>hoops</b> whilst the players shirts had a white panel on the back so that the name and number could be displayed and viewed easily. The away shirt was blue with one wide irregular white semi-hoop which was {{across the front of}} the shirt but did not stretch to the back.|$|R
5000|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a re-emergence of hula hooping, {{generally}} referred to as either [...] "hoopdance" [...] or simply [...] "hooping" [...] to distinguish it from the children's playform. The jam band The String Cheese Incident is widely credited with fostering a renewed interest in hooping. Band members started throwing larger adult-sized hoops into their audiences in the mid-1990s, encouraging their <b>fans</b> to <b>hoop</b> and dance, spreading the word and the fun. It wasn't until 2003 with the launch of Hooping.org that these small bands of hoopers began to find each other online and a real community and movement began to grow. Bay Area Hoopers began in San Francisco at that time holding regular [...] "hoop jams" [...] with music to hoop to and the hooping group began being replicated in cities around the world. In 2006 Hoopin' Annie had the idea to create a hooping holiday and the first World Hoop Day was held in 2007. Modern hula hooping is seen at numerous festivals and fairs in the USA, UK, Australia and Europe.|$|R
5000|$|BBC Sport {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 93% and said, [...] "The {{atmosphere}} of NBA Street is enhanced by an excellent soundtrack including hip-hop tracks {{from the likes of}} Nelly and Nate Dogg, plus various sound effects from the street - traffic, sirens, crowd abuse, etc." [...] Maxim gave it a score of eight out of ten and said, [...] "even if you aren't a <b>hoops</b> <b>fan,</b> there's plenty of unintentional humor to appreciate: Seeing Yao Ming dunk on Bill Walton alone is worth the price of admission." [...] The Village Voice gave the PS2 version eight out of ten, saying, [...] "The up-to-four-player game itself is hot to death." ...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} examples of bracket buster teams {{over the years}} of the NCAA Tournament, even dating back before the tournament came to be the widespread cultural event that it is today. One early example is the March 18, 1971 Mideast Regional game in which Western Kentucky defeated its better-known in-state [...] "big brother," [...] Kentucky, 107-83. The game was more significant to <b>hoops</b> <b>fans</b> in the Bluegrass State, as the Kentucky Wildcats and coach Adolph Rupp had steadfastly refused to play any other in-state schools (including Louisville) in regular season games, so the game itself was very significant no matter the outcome. The Hilltoppers later advanced to the Final Four.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after winning}} their 14th League title, Louis Kilcoyne {{announced}} that the Kilcoynes were selling Glenmalure Park, which they had recently purchased from the Jesuits. The team played the entire 1987â€“88 season in an almost empty Tolka Park {{as a result of}} a boycott called for by the Shamrock Rovers Supporters Club and KRAM (Keep Rovers At Milltown), which was observed by the vast majority of <b>Hoops</b> <b>fans.</b> Following the completion of the boycott season in Tolka, the Kilcoynes sold the football club to Dublin businessman John McNamara, who put forward a controversial proposal to move in with Bohemians at Dalymount Park. KRAM congregated to vote on whether to lift the boycott and on the proposal to move to Dalymount. Both motions were passed and the club spent the next two seasons at the Phibsboro venue, with an unrecognisable side playing in front of small attendances.|$|R
5000|$|IGN's Hilary Goldstein said of {{the same}} console versions: [...] "In many ways, NBA 2K8 is an {{improved}} game on the court. But {{there are a lot}} of minor issues that really drag it down. Over the course of my first dozen games, I was in love. But as the season wore on, the issues began piling up to a point that it became a source of frustration. The Lock-on D gaff is inexcusable and the lackluster defensive AI allows decent players to tear it up on offense. Jason Williams should not be dropping 30 points a game. Yet he won the MVP in year two of my franchise. Still, any <b>hoops</b> <b>fan</b> should give NBA 2K8 a look. It's certainly the best basketball game on any system this year. The Association is a solid franchise mode and, if Concepts can iron out its AI and gameplay issues, next year's model could be something very special." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the relaunched A-League, he {{secured a}} deal with Queensland Roar in 2005, before moving to Europe in June 2006 to join Scottish Premier League club Falkirk. His career was set to take of with some fantastic {{displays}} for Falkirk but unfortunately {{a difference of opinion}} with Falkirk boss John Hughes ended his stay in Scotland, the [...] "Bairns" [...] in a good position at sixth in the SPL and through to the semi finals of the League Cup. Before departing Scotland Higgins stated it was a boyhood dream to play against his much loved Glasgow Celtic at Park Head on December 23, 2006. Higgins played a key role at keeping Celtic at bay and was a stand out for the Bairns, saying after the game [...] "no one can take that away from me, I loved every minute of it and knowing my family was here and my best mate Barry who is a mad <b>hoops</b> <b>fan</b> was sitting watching back in Australia makes me very proud" [...] however they eventually went down one nil. He departed Scotland on 24 January 2007 to join Israeli side Maccabi Herzliya.|$|R
50|$|Shamrock Rovers Played in Glenmalure Park on the Southside of Dublin from 1926 to 1987. The club's owner Louis Kilcoyne {{announced}} he was selling Glenmalure Park, which they had recently purchased from the Jesuits. The team played the entire 1987-88 season in an almost empty Tolka Park on Dublin's Northside {{as a result of}} a boycott called for by the Shamrock Rovers Supporters Club and KRAM (Keep Rovers At Milltown), which was observed by the vast majority of <b>Hoops</b> <b>fans.</b> Following the completion of the boycott season in Tolka, the Kilcoynes sold the football club to Dublin businessman, John McNamara, who put forward a controversial proposal to move in with Rivals Bohemians at Dalymount Park.
