Without a surfactant like the denatured proteins of egg whites or in this case, saponins, the air would quickly escape and the mixture would return to a solution. However, by stabilizing the interface of the dispersed and continuous phases of the foam, the air remains trapped in the agitated berry solution.|$|R
30|$|Fresh {{samples of}} O. sativa husk and Q. phillyraeoides bark {{extracts}} were prepared as previously described and were concentrated using a rotary evaporator.

Mayer’s and Draggendoff’s reagents were used for test and confirmation {{of the presence of}} alkaloids in the extracts. The <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>cream</b> colour and reddish brown precipitate with Mayer’s and Draggendoff’s reagent respectively was regarded as the confirmatory test for the presence of alkaloids. The amount of total phenolics in extracts was determined with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Gallic acid was used as a standard and the total phenolics were expressed as mg/g gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> blue colour upon reaction with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was the confirmatory test for the presence of phenols in the plant extract samples. Similarly, the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a red precipitate when the extract was boiled with 1 % aqueous hydrochloric acid indicated the presence of phlobatannins. Other bioactive constituents such as saponins, tanins, flavonoids, steroids, terpenoides, anthraquinones etc. were also determined using standard procedures.|$|R

40|$|Effect of tannase enzymatic {{treatment}} on protein-tannin aggregation and sensory attributes of green tea infusion was investigated. Green tea leaves were extracted {{with hot water}} at 85 degrees C for 20 min, the tea infusion was then treated with tannase. Results showed that both EGCG and ECG of the tea catechins were hydrolyzed by tannase into EGC and EC, respectively, accompanied by production of gallic acid. The tannase-treated tea infusion had a relatively lower binding ability with protein. Changes in the content <b>of</b> tea catechins, <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> tea <b>cream,</b> and turbidity <b>of</b> tea infusion with or without tannase treatment were measured after 4 weeks. Content of catechins in the tannase-modified tea remained almost unchanged, while those without tannase treated (control) decreased significantly (p < 0. 05). Meanwhile, better color appearance and less tea cream formation were observed for the tannase-treated green tea, and tea cream formed for the control after storage. Results of the sensory evaluation showed that mouth feeling, taste and the overall acceptance of the tarmase-treated green tea infusion were all better {{than those of the}} control.

40|$|Interfacial changes {{occurring}} {{during the}} <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> whipped <b>cream</b> were followed using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. During {{the initial stages}} of whipping, air bubbles were stabilized by adsorbed 8 -casein and whey proteins with little involvement of fat globules. The adsorption of fat to a i r bubbles occurred ~. then the globule membrane coalesced with the protein a ir-water i nterface. As a res ult, fat was brought into direct contact with air but only rarely did it spread at the ai. r-fat interface. The crosslinking of fat globules adsor bed t o adjacent air bubbles by chains of coalesced globules established a stabilizing infrastructure in the foam. In t he final whipped <b>cream,</b> the surface <b>of</b> each bubble was stabilized by variable amounts o f adsorbed fat and by the o riginal air-water interface of adsorbed proteins. Although these remnants of protein do not cont r ibute to the mechanical proper ties of the foam, they betray the mechani. sm of bubble stabilization. A similar foam structure was also found in dairy and non-dai r y aerosols exami ned by freeze fracturi ng. Modifying the protein composition of the aqueous phase before whipping may have important effects on the final foam because of the way this affects the composition of the air-water interface and, subsequently, the ease of fat adsorption to air bubbles...|$|R

This paper presents a systematic way of generating such models, the techniques involved {{are inspired by}} numerical analysis. First we illustrate the process by constructing a simple model of RayleighB 'enard convection which gives a remarkably good estimate of the critical Rayleigh number and the corresponding roll size. We also examine a model which helps explain the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> shocks in <b>creaming</b> or sedimenting colloids. Finally we discuss two models of droplet break off which are in excellent agreement with experiment and {{have played a role}} in the study of cascading instabilities which can occur near snap off. 1 Introduction Simplified models of complicated physical systems can be useful in gaining insights into their behavior both analytically and numerically.

Aim: to study the degree <b>of</b> oxidation <b>cream</b> with natural antioxidants from fruits and berries processing products, namely {{in the form of}} concentrated juice of fruits and berries. Outlines the process of oxidation of lipids, one of the fundamental processes of loss of quality food products. Describes the action of antioxidants as antioxidants on accumulation intensity concentrations of primary and secondary oxidation products, making the final product unsuitable for the consumer and the bounding its shelf life. Presents the results of a study of the contents of primary and secondary oxidation products in butter cream immediately after cooking, as well as samples, stored for five days with the addition of antioxidants in the form of concentrated juice of fruits and berries in the amount of 2 – 7 % by weight <b>of</b> <b>cream.</b> As a control sample has been used cream with no additives.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{investigate}} in vitro the extent to which specific food structures alter gastric behaviour and could therefore impact on nutrient delivery and digestion in the small intestine. Results obtained from a specifically developed gastric digestion model, were compared to results from a previous human study on the same foods. The semi-dynamic model could simulate the main gastric dynamics including gradual acidification, lipolysis, proteolysis and emptying. Two dairy-based foods with the same caloric content but different structure were studied. The semi-solid meal comprised a mixture of cheese and yogurt and the liquid meal was an oil in water emulsion stabilised by milk proteins. Our findings showed similar gastric behaviour to that seen previously in vivo. Gastric behaviour was affected by the initial structure with creaming and sedimentation observed in the case of liquid and semi-solid samples, respectively. Lipid and protein digestion profiles showed clear differences in the amount of nutrients reaching the simulated small intestine and, consequently, the likely bioaccessibility after digestion. The semi-solid sample generated higher nutrient released into the small intestine at an early stage of digestion whereas nutrient accessibility from liquid sample was delayed due to the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>cream</b> layer in the gastric phase. This shows the strong effect of the matrix on gastric behaviour, proteolysis and lipolysis, which explains the differences in physiological responses seen previously with these systems in terms of fullness and satiety...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} for simulating the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> foam in aerated liquid is proposed. Foam is {{considered as a}} separate phase which is comprised of a mixture of air and liquid. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model has been developed for the simulation <b>of</b> <b>creaming</b> and <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> foam in aerated liquid using the proposed approach. The model accounts for the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> foam due to transformation of both air and liquid into foam and it is destruction due to liquid drainage and bursting of bubbles. The coalescence model of Prince and Blanch (1990. Bubble coalescence and break-up in air-sparged bubble columns. AIChE J. 36, 1485 - 1499.) was considered for air-liquid dispersion whereas for the foam layer, the bubble coalescence due to film rupture was modeled using the model developed by Tong et al. (2011. Drainage and stability of 2 D foams: foam behavior in vertical Hele-Shaw cells. Colloid Surf. A 382, 42 - 49). A population balance method was used to track the number density of different bubble class and the fixed pivot method was used to discretize the population balance equation. The source term for coalescence in the scalar transport equation was updated using a rectified model of Hagesaether et al. (2002. A model for turbulent binary breakup of dispersed fluid particles. Chem. Eng. Sci. 57, 3251 - 3267). The results obtained are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of Narsimhan (2010. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>creaming</b> and <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> foam layer in aerated liquid. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 345, 566 - 572.).
