The Weyl group W(E 8) acts on the con guration space of systems of labelled <b>eight</b> <b>lines</b> on a real projective plane. With a system of <b>eight</b> <b>lines</b> with a certain condition, a diagram consisting of ten roots of the root system of type E 8 is associated.

50|$|Interestingly, {{the above}} line of play {{starting}} with the deep finesse also fails to optimise the matchpoint objective as it gets beaten by another line of play. In turns {{out that there are}} a total of <b>eight</b> <b>lines</b> of play that are non-transitive: the <b>eight</b> <b>lines</b> of play can be thought to be placed on a circle such that each line of play beats its left neighbor. As a result, the optimal approach {{in the context of the}} matchpoint objective corresponds to a so-called mixed strategy and is probabilistic in nature: the declarer has to select randomly one of the <b>eight</b> <b>lines</b> of play.|$|R
