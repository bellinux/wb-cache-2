40|$|Background and Objectives: The World Health Organization End {{tuberculosis}} (TB) Strategy, {{approved in}} 2014, aims at a 90 % reduction in TB deaths and an 80 % reduction in TB incidence rate by 2030. One of the suggested interventions is the systematic screening {{of people with}} suspected TB, belonging to specific risk groups. The Hospital Raoul Follereau (HRF) in Bissau, <b>Guinea-Bissau,</b> is the <b>National</b> Reference Hospital for Tuberculosis and Lung Disease of the country. We performed an active case-finding program among pediatric age family members and cohabitants of admitted adult TB patients, from January to December 2013. Methods: Newly admitted adult patients with a diagnosis of TB were invited to bring their family members or cohabitants in childhood age for clinical evaluation in a dedicated outpatient setting within the hospital compound. All the children brought to our attention underwent medical examination and chest x-ray. In children with clinical and/or radiologic finding consistent with pulmonary TB a sputum-smear was requested. Results: All admitted adult patients accepted to bring their children cohabitants. In total, 287 children were examined in 2013. Forty-four patients (15 %) were diagnosed with TB. The number needed to screen (NNS) to detect one case of TB was 7. 35 patients (80 %) had pulmonary TB; 2 of them were sputum smear-positive. No adjunctive personnel cost was necessary for the intervention. Conclusions: children with TB represent {{a large proportion of}} the pool of undetected TB. A simple TB active case-finding program targeted to high risk groups like children households of severely ill admitted patients with TB can successfully be implemented in a country with limited resources...|$|R
