5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on {{the breeding}} grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs {{stay in their}} territory throughout the year where the climate <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> temperate.

5|$|One type of inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} signal is called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining {{whether there is a}} local population density that <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium alloys can be {{produced}} by adding a metal to molten plutonium. If the alloying metal <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> reductive, plutonium can be added {{in the form of}} oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium–gallium and plutonium–aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium, which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal.|$|E
5|$|Producers {{of foods}} and food {{additives}} can contact Jewish religious authorities {{to have their}} products certified as kosher: this involves {{a visit to the}} manufacturing facilities by an individual rabbi or a committee from a rabbinic organization, who will inspect the production methods and contents, and if everything <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> kosher a certificate would be issued.|$|E

The gray whale is the only benthic feeding baleen whale, filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. They also have a gestation period of over a year, which is unusual for baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{approximation}}: The plasma approximation applies {{when the}} plasma parameter, Λ, representing {{the number of}} charge carriers within a sphere (called the Debye sphere whose radius is the Debye screening length) surrounding a given charged particle <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> high so as to shield the electrostatic influence of the particle outside of the sphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{white dwarf}} {{companion}} could also accrete matter from {{other types of}} companions, including a subgiant or (if the orbit <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> close) even a main sequence star. The actual evolutionary process during this accretion stage remains uncertain, as it can depend both on the rate of accretion and the transfer of angular momentum to the white dwarf companion.|$|E

5|$|While some 19th-century {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the underlying premise is true if the heating <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out. Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other ectotherms.|$|E
5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees {{typically}} have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle's {{account of}} {{temperature}} regulation sought {{to explain how}} an animal maintained a steady temperature and the continued oscillation of the thorax needed for breathing. The system of regulation of temperature and breathing described in Youth and Old Age, Life and Death 26 <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> detailed to permit modelling as a negative feedback control system (one that maintains a desired property by opposing disturbances to it), with a few assumptions such as a desired temperature to compare the actual temperature against.|$|E
5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has {{a structure}} consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms {{in a chain}} is covalent, but {{there is evidence of}} a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E
5|$|Black {{honeyeaters}} feed on nectar, {{and have}} a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers {{such as those of}} the emu bush. They also take insects on the wing, and regularly eat charcoal left behind at campfires. The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest building and incubation. Both sexes feed and care for the young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> numerous and widespread to be considered least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E

5|$|Fluid models {{describe}} plasmas {{in terms}} of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters). One simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the plasma as a single fluid governed {{by a combination of}} Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. A more general description is the two-fluid plasma picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma {{in terms of}} a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} process, {{by which}} 1km planetesimals grow into 1,000km sized bodies, is well understood now. This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> high, and proceeds in a runaway manner. Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion. The {{end result is}} formation of planetary embryos of varying sizes, which depend on {{the distance from the}} star. Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a few Earth-sized bodies. Thus the origin of terrestrial planets is now considered to be an almost solved problem.|$|E
