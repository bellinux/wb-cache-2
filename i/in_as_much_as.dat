5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the field}} of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are {{concerned}} with the relations between mental and physical states and processes: Sensory neurophysiology investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation. Cognitive neuroscience studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes. Neuropsychology describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain. Lastly, evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> this is the basis of the mind, also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages. Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind, as the gene-based mechanism of natural selection does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods.|$|E
50|$|In 1813, {{during his}} “Über die Verschiedenen Methoden des Übersetzens” lecture, Friedrich Schleiermacher {{proposed}} the idea where “Either the translator leaves the author <b>in</b> peace, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible, and moves the reader towards him, or {{he leaves the}} reader <b>in</b> peace, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible, and he moves the author towards him”.|$|R

5|$|In 1914, the Australian Army mostly copied British Army doctrine, <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> one existed semi-officially in {{the form}} of the Field Service Regulations. Pre-war {{planning}} had largely seen the Australian Army focus on defending the continent from invasion with a relatively small force, and as a result any future war was thought to likely be a highly mobile one. This was in contrast to the offensive focus of many British and European theorists of this time, despite their influence on local professional military debate. As a result, there was an emphasis on entrenchments, and whilst there was a recognition of the problems posed by increasing firepower as a result of the continued development of small arms and artillery technology, there was considered to be little requirement for the direct assault of static defensive positions given the room for manoeuvre afforded by the vastness of the Australian continent. Meanwhile, in order to be compatible with British forces, pre-war agreements ensured that Australian Army units were mostly organised, trained and equipped in accordance with British Army doctrine and establishment tables.|$|E

25|$|In Communist Romania, up to 2,800 wolves {{were killed}} between 1955 and 1965.

It is estimated that Mitchell brought <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> $5 million annually.|$|E
25|$|The trait EI {{model is}} general and subsumes the Goleman model {{discussed}} above. The conceptualization of EI as a personality trait {{leads to a}} construct that lies outside the taxonomy of human cognitive ability.

25|$|Much of the {{characteristic}} flavour of Madeira {{is due to}} this practice, which hastens the mellowing of the wine and also tends to check secondary fermentation <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> it is, in effect, a mild kind of pasteurization. Furthermore, the wine is deliberately exposed to air, causing it to oxidize. The resulting wine has a colour similar to a tawny port wine. Wine tasters sometimes describe a wine which has been exposed to excessive heat during its storage as being cooked or maderized.|$|E
25|$|The {{miracle of}} the oil is widely {{regarded}} as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages. However, given the famous question Rabbi Yosef Karo posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day), {{it was clear that he}} believed it was a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Rabbi Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main Code of Jewish Law.|$|E

Often their attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service. Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.|$|E
