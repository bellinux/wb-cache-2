40|$|Multiphoton {{microscopy}} {{has become}} popular in studying <b>dermal</b> nanoparticle <b>penetration.</b> This necessitates studying the imaging parameters of multiphoton microscopy in skin as an imaging medium, {{in terms of}} achievable detection depths and the resolution limit. This would simulate real-case scenarios rather than depending on theoretical values determined under ideal conditions. This study has focused on depth profiling of sub-resolution gold nanoparticles (AuNP) in reconstructed (fixed and unfixed) and human skin using multiphoton microscopy. Point spread functions (PSF) were determined for the used water-immersion objective of 63 x /NA = 1. 2. Factors such as skin-tissue compactness {{and the presence of}} wrinkles were found to deteriorate the accuracy of depth profiling. A broad range of AuNP detectable depths (20100 mu m) in reconstructed skin was observed. AuNP could only be detected up to similar to 14 mu m depth in human skin. Lateral (0. 5 +/- 0. 1 mu m) and axial (1. 0 +/- 0. 3 mu m) PSF in reconstructed and human specimens were determined. Skin cells and intercellular components didn't degrade the PSF with depth. In summary, the imaging parameters of multiphoton microscopy in skin and practical limitations encountered in tracking nanoparticle penetration using this approach were investigated...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{in humans}} show {{comparable}} results. <b>Dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> through human skin {{has been shown}} to be very rapid. NMP is rapidly biotransformed by hydroxylation to 5-hydroxy-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, which is further oxidized to N-methylsuccinimide; this intermediate is further hydroxylated to 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide. These metabolites are all colourless. The excreted amounts of NMP metabolites in the urine after inhalation or oral intake represented about 100% and 65% of the administered doses, respectively. NMP has a low potential for skin irritation and a moderate potential for eye irritation in rabbits. Repeated daily doses of 450 mg/kg body weight administered to the skin caused painful and severe haemorrhage and eschar formation in rabbits. These adverse effects have not been seen in workers occupationally exposed to pure NMP, but they have been observed after dermal exposure to NMP used in cleaning processes. No sensitization potential has been observed.|$|E

Short chapters describe the anatomy of the skin, the skin as a diffusion barrier, Fick’s law of diffusion, factors affecting <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> and methods to assess <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration.</b> The major part of the report is devoted to compilation of data assessment of <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> (fluxes and permeability coefficients) for 165 substances corresponding to 150 entries listed in the Swedish ordinance (AFS 2005) on Occupational Expsoure Limits (OELs). The compilation covers all 117 substances marked with an “H” in the ordinance and, in addition, 50 substances that have not been given a skin notation. The compiled data can be used in future revision of skin notations. An analysis of the data shows that quantitative information on <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> is lacking for 53 or about one third of the 165 substances. For those who have quantitative data, a variety of species and experimental techniques have been used. There is a trillion-fold (1012) span in permeability coefficients between the substances. Moreover, for many chemicals with several experimental data sets on permeability, there is a huge intra-chemical span, sometimes several orders of magnitude. In these cases, a preferred study was selected, mainly based on the following criteria: human skin, in vivo studies, neat liquid, water as vehicle and infinite or large dose were preferred over animal skin, in vitro studies, vapor or diluted liquid, other vehicles and low dose, respectively. Notably, more than one third of the chemicals with high skin permeability and with a dermal/inhalation ratio higher than 0. 1 according to the ECETOC criteria (1993) lacks a skin notation. This suggests a need for revision of all substances, including those without a skin notation, in the Swedish list...|$|E
40|$|Sensitive {{individuals}} may develop {{allergic contact dermatitis}} (ACD) from exposure to chromium contaminated soil. However, health risk assessments often do not consider the amount of metal in soil that is absorbed by the body (bioavailability). Instead, they rely on the total concentration of metal that can be extracted from soil by rigorous procedures. This practice can overestimate health risks and soil remediation goals because metals can be sequestered in soil with time (“aging”) thereby decreasing bioavailability. In this study, the effects of aging in soil on the <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> of trivalent chromium as chromium chloride or hexavalent chromium as sodium chromate were evaluated in two soils – Atsion and Keyport. <b>Dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> was measured in vitro through dermatomed pig skin by Teflon flow-through diffusion cell methodology. After four months in soil, the <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> of both species was decreased by 93 - 96 % relative to pure chromium (without soil).

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a field study of {{occupational}} pesticide exposure (respiratory and dermal) among a group of Italian agricultural subcontractors. These workers consistently use pesticides during much of the year, thus resulting in a high exposure risk. Ten complete treatments were monitored during spring/summer. Pesticides that were applied included azinphos-methyl, dicamba, dimethoate, terbuthylazine, and alachlor. Several observations were made on worker operative modalities and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during work. Total potential and actual exposure ranged from 14 to 5700 mu g and from 0. 04 to 4600 mu g, respectively. Dermal exposure contributed substantially more than inhalation to the total exposure (93. 9 - 100 %). Hand contamination ranged from 0. 04 to 4600 mu g and was the major contributor to <b>dermal</b> exposure. <b>Penetration</b> through specific protective garments was less than 2. 4 % in all cases, although penetration through general work clothing was as high as 26. 8 %. The risk evaluation, based on comparison between acceptable daily intake and total absorbed doses, demonstrates that it is presumable to expect possible health effects for workers regularly operating without PPE and improper tractors. Comparisons between exposure levels and operative modalities highlighted that complete PPE and properly equipped tractors contributed to a significant reduction in total exposure to pesticides during agricultural activities. In conclusion, monitored agricultural subcontractors presented very different levels of pesticide exposure due to the high variability of operative modalities and use of PPE. These results indicate the need to critically evaluate the efficacy of training programs required for obtaining a pesticide license in Italy...|$|R
40|$|Toasting {{friends and}} family with realgar wines and {{painting}} children's foreheads and limbs with the leftover realgar/alcohol slurries is an important customary ritual during the Dragon Boat Festival (DBF); a Chinese national holiday and ancient feast day celebrated throughout Asia. Realgar is an arsenic sulfide mineral, and source of highly toxic inorganic arsenic. Despite {{the long history of}} realgar use during the DBF, associated risk to human health by arsenic ingestion or percutaneous adsorption is unknown. To address this urine samples were collected from a cohort of volunteers who were partaking in the DBF festivities. The total concentration of arsenic in the wine consumed was 70 mg L⁻¹ with all the arsenic found to be inorganic. Total arsenic concentrations in adult urine reached a maximum of ca. 550 μg L⁻¹ (mean 220. 2 μg L⁻¹) after 16 h post-ingestion of realgar wine, while face painting caused arsenic levels in children's urine to soar to 100 μg L⁻¹ (mean 85. 3 μg L⁻¹) 40 h after the initial paint application. The average concentration of inorganic arsenic in the urine of realgar wine drinkers on average doubled 16 h after drinking, although this was not permanent and levels subsided after 28 h. As would be expected in young children, the proportions of organic arsenic in the urine remained high throughout the 88 -h monitoring period. However, even when arsenic concentrations in the urine peaked at 40 h after paint application, concentrations in the urine only declined slightly thereafter, suggesting pronounced longer term <b>dermal</b> accumulation and <b>penetration</b> of arsenic. Drinking wines blended with realgar or using realgar based paints on children does result in the significant absorption of arsenic and therefore presents a potentially serious and currently unquantified health risk...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The {{dominant}} {{route of}} occupational exposure to pesticides in horticulture is dermal. However, preventive measures are seldom used when handling plant cultures recently treated with pesticides, thus causing significant dermal exposure and potential absorption. Assessment of exposure often depends on biological monitoring of blood or urine samples. The skin often {{acts as a}} temporary reservoir for chemicals before absorption. Failure to consider the lag time between dermal exposure and appearance of pesticide or metabolites in the general circulation may lead to false conclusions about assessment of exposure.  METHODS—In an experimental model in which in vitro static diffusion cells were mounted with human skin, <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> of three extensively used pesticides (methiocarb, paclobutrazol, pirimicarb) was evaluated.  RESULTS—Pirimicarb and paclobutrazol had comparable rates of <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> and lag times of around 18  hours.

The method used 2 -methyl- 4, 6 -dinitrophenol as an internal standard (IS). Water {{was used as the}} extraction solvent. The retention times of CMP and internal standard (IS) were 5. 56 and 6. 67 min, respectively. The standard plots of CMP are linear over the range of 62. 5 - 2, 500 ng·mL- 1 with correlation coefficients of 0. 999. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for CMP was estimated to be 62. 5 ng·mL- 1 and the limit of detection (LOD) was approached to be 20 ng·mL- 1. Reproducibility of the sample handling and HPLC analysis had a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 6 %. The average recoveries for the analyte in Trim VX were better than 92 %.

40|$|The <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> of {{compounds}} {{may be influenced}} by other compounds when mixtures are presented to the skin. Plant extracts, often used in cosmeceuticals, are complex mixtures of wanted bio-actives as well as undesirable impurities like nanoparticles and mycotoxines. A major question is if plant bio-actives (like spilanthol) can significantly alter the <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> of other compounds which can be actives (like testosterone) or impurities (like mycotoxins). If so, the qualification assessment of the product quality needs to include this influence within the Quality-by-Design strategy. Therefore, the concentration-dependent penetration promoting effect of spilanthol was investigated on the three CART transdermal model compounds i. e. caffeine, ibuprofen and testosterone [1]. It was shown that spilanthol has a compound and concentration dependent penetration enhancing effect. No significant penetration enhancing effect for ibuprofen has been observed. However, with increasing spilanthol concentration (from 0 up to 1 %, m/V), the permeability of caffeine increases, resulting in an enhancing ratio (ER) of 4. 60 ± 0. 49 (mean ± SEM, n= 4). For testosterone, a maximal penetration enhancing concentration of 0. 5 % spilanthol was found (ER = 4. 13 ± 0. 44 (mean ± SEM, n= 3)). Our findings with these model compounds are also confirmed with mycotoxins [2]. In conclusion, the existence of a significant mutual influence {{of compounds}} towards skin penetration should always be considered as part of the functional quality evaluation or in topical product development.

Methods: We created a new physiological pharmacokinetic model to describe the effect of blood flow, blood protein binding and dermal binding on the rate and depth of penetration of topical drugs into the underlying skin. We used this model to interpret literature in vivo human biopsy data on dermal drug concentration at various depths in the dermis after topical application of 6 substances. This interpretation was facilitated by our in vitro human <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> studies in which dermal diffusion coefficient and binding were estimated. Results: The model shows that dermal diffusion alone cannot explain the in vivo data and blood and/or lymphatic transport to deep tissues must be present for almost all of the drugs tested.

For this to be achieved, the oils tested must be well defined chemically for the dossier to be valid. This report outlines how, from eleven commercial samples screened, three oils (one fresh, one mildly oxidised and one oxidised) were chosen by peroxide index determination and thoroughly defined by GC, GCMS and physical constants as to whether they were typical oils meeting international standards before being tested for <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> and other safety parameters for the dossier. Such testing will be of economic benefit as a more acceptable oil will lead to more sales and be of social benefit as the safety and stability of the oil are better defined...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the in vitro dermal absorption of ethylene glycol (EG) through dermatomed human abdominal skin (containing epidermis and dermis), obtained from cadavers within 24 hours of death and kept frozen until processed. Three formulations of EG (neat, 50 %, and 10 % aqueous solutions) were applied in triplicate to skin samples from 6 donors, and placed in Teflon Bronaugh flow-through diffusion cells. Barrier integrity of each sample was evaluated with 3 H-H 2 O prior to applying EG and only data from samples passing the test were used. A physiological receptor fluid was pumped beneath the skin samples and collected in a fraction collector at predetermined time points through 24 hours. Possible volatilized EG was trapped in a charcoal basket located above each skin sample. Each skin sample was treated with an infinite dose of 500 mL of EG formulation/cm 2. At the end of 24 hours, volatilized EG trapped in the headspace was collected, the unabsorbed dose was removed from the skin and the skin was rinsed, tape stripped, and solubilized along with a rinse of the flow-through cells, and total radioactivity was determined. Only a small fraction (1 %) of the applied EG was absorbed in 24 hours, of which < 0. 7 % penetrated through the skin and* 0. 4 % remained in the skin. Recovery (mass balance) of the applied EG was between 93 % and 99 %, which further validated the observed low <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> of EG. The net penetration of the applied EG over 24 hours was concentration proportional, comprising 2. 97 + 0. 78, 1. 75 + 0. 62, and 0. 23 + 0. 12 mg/cm 2 of the neat, 50 %, and 10 % formula-tions, respectively. The steady-state flux of EG was established between 16 and 24 hours. The mean steady-state flux of EG through dermatomed skin was 217, 129, and 15 mg/cm 2 h for the neat, 50 %, and 10 % aqueous formulations, respectively, con-sistent with concentration-proportional penetration of EG. The steady-state permeation coefficient (Kp) for EG was low, between 1. 5 104 and 2. 6 104 cm/h. These findings demonstrate that EG <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> is expected to be very low and to be slow, indicating very limited systemic or internal dose of EG due to dermal exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{mathematical}} model predicted that 1 -BP was {{absorbed by the}} skin. Additionally, there was an in vitro <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> study identified that indicates that 1 -BP {{has the potential for}} substantial <b>dermal</b> <b>penetration</b> dependent on type and duration of exposure [Frasch et al. 2011]. A review of the available literature indicates that 1 -BP is capable of inducing a wide array of adverse systemic health effects, including neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, hematotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and developmental toxicity, regardless of exposure route [ClinTrials Bioresearch 1997; Zhao et al. 1999; Ichihara et al. 2000 a, 2000 b; WIL Research Laboratory 2001; Wang et al. 2002, 2003; Lee et al. 2005, 2007; Banu et al. 2007; Fueta et al. 2007]. Although the exact systemic hazards associated with skin contact and absorption of 1 -BP are unknown, 1 -BP is assigned the SK: SYS notation; this notation is based on the recognition of adverse health effects in test animals exposed via the inhalation, oral, and subcutaneous injection routes. Although a study using the EpiDerm human reconstructed epidermis model [Frasch et al. 2011] indicated that 1 -BP is not corrosive to the skin following exposure to 1 -BP, two in vivo tests, conducted with standard methods [Jacobs et al. 1987; P 1 lovics 2004], provide sufficient evidence that 1 -BP is irritating to the skin of rabbits. Although no human patch tests that evaluated the sensitization potential of 1 -BP were identified, one guinea pig maximization test [Elf Atochem 1995 b] showed that the substance is not a skin sensitizer. Therefore, {{on the basis of this}} assessment, 1 -BP is assigned the composite skin notation SK: SYS-DIR (IRR). Table 3 summarizes the skin designations for 1 -BP from NIOSH and other organizations. The equivalent skin designation for 1 -BP from the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling is Reproductive Category 1 B (Presumed human reproductive toxicant) and Skin Irritation Category 2 (Causes skin irritation) [European Parliament 2008].
