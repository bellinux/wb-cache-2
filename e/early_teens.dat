5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the <b>early</b> <b>teens</b> were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E

Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their <b>early</b> <b>teens,</b> especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters do not look very different from each other, her panels are too white, and there is much pathos.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes {{who were also}} in their <b>early</b> <b>teens.</b> One of these girls was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp.

She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E

5|$|A major {{influence}} on Ueshiba's early education was his elementary schoolteacher Tasaburo Nasu, {{who was a}} Shinto priest and who introduced Ueshiba to the religion. At {{the age of six}} Ueshiba was sent to study at the Jizōderu Temple, but had little interest in the rote learning of Confucian education. However, his schoolmaster Mitsujo Fujimoto was also a priest of Shingon Buddhism, and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect, which Ueshiba found intriguing. His interest in Buddhism was sufficiently great that his mother considered enrolling him in the priesthood, but his father Yoroku vetoed the idea. Ueshiba went to Tanage Higher Elementary School and then to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School, but left formal education in his <b>early</b> <b>teens,</b> enrolling instead at a private abacus academy, the Yoshida Institute, to study accountancy. On graduating from the academy, he worked at a local tax office for a few months, but the job did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo, funded by his father. Ueshiba Trading, the stationery business which he opened there, was short-lived; unhappy with life in the capital, he returned to Tanabe {{less than a year later}} after suffering a bout of beri-beri. Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{children}} attended the nearby George Street State School {{and one by one}} the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their <b>early</b> <b>teens.</b> The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access to all of the club's facilities. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E
