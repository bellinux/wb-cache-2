5000|$|The [...] "California truffle" [...] is a larger, lumpier {{version of}} the <b>French</b> <b>truffle,</b> first made by Alice Medrich in 1973 after she tasted {{truffles}} in France. She sold these larger truffles in a charcuterie in the [...] "Gourmet Ghetto" [...] neighborhood of Berkeley, then in 1977 she began selling them in her own store, Cocolat, which soon expanded into a chain. The American craze for truffles started with Medrich.|$|E
40|$|Production of {{the black}} truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) has {{experienced}} a decline in France over the last century. Different sociological factors as well as climate change have been suggested as possible explanations for this decline. The aims {{of this study were}} to assess the effects of annual climatic variations on black truffle sales by analysing reliable data. Over the past 25 years, almost 90 % of <b>French</b> <b>truffle</b> sales occurred in the southeastern region of France and, despite a decrease in southwestern France, for the last 25 years, sales were stable for France as a whole. An analysis of the two main southeastern wholesale markets (Richerenches and Carpentras) revealed that the main factor explaining the huge annual variations was the cumulative hydric balance from May to August of the year n. For the first time, frost days were also identified as an important factor in Richerenches. Using the model established for the past 25 years and the climatic data for the Richerenches and Carpentras basins, the truffle sales would have been stable from 1965 to nowadays. This simulation suggested that the production decline observed since 48 years could be attributed more to the change of rural world than to the climatic changes. The stability of production or the slight increase observed during the last 25 years could reflect the input of truffle orchards recently planted...|$|E

5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that [...] "Chocolate truffles were virtually {{unknown in the}} United States when, in 1973, Alice Medrich started making and selling them {{from her home in}} Berkeley."

5000|$|On January 13, 2009, as the Bush Administration neared its end, Schwab {{reportedly}} announced retaliatory {{tariffs on}} [...] "dozens" [...] of European luxury items, including <b>French</b> <b>truffles,</b> Irish oatmeal, Italian sparkling water and Roquefort cheese. The European ban on U.S. beef containing hormones {{was the reason}} cited by the US for the retaliatory action. Roquefort cheese, made from sheep's milk in a region of southern France, {{was hit with a}} 300% tariff, apparently the highest level by far of any in the package. When a 100% tariff was placed on the cheese in 1999, the report says, José Bové helped marshal opposition. As of 2009, the French complaint with the Roquefort tariff is being pursued through diplomatic channels. [...] She helped to launch negotiations for ACTA.|$|R

30|$|True truffles, {{belonging}} to the genus Tuber (Tuberaceae, Pezizales, Pezizomycetes), produce hypogeous ascocarps, which are formed in soil or sometimes within layers of leaf litter. They have {{lost the ability to}} actively discharge ascospores (Bonito and Smith 2016). They are symbiotic fungi that develop association with fine roots of specific host trees (T. oregonense Trappe, Bonito and P. Rawl. with Douglas fir) or broad host ranges (T. aestivum (Wulfen:Fr.) Spreng. with some plant species in Betulaceae, Corylaceae, Fagaceae, Tiliaceae, Pinaceae and Cistaceae) (Hall et al. 2007). The unique aroma makes some species greatly sought after as high-end culinary ingredients throughout the world, especially in Europe (Hall et al. 2007). The scarcity and irreplaceably scent of <b>French</b> Périgord black <b>truffle</b> (T. melanosporum Vittad.) and Italian Alba white truffle (T. magnatum Pico.) render them among the most famous and demanding truffles in the world (Hall et al. 2007; Bonito et al. 2010 a).|$|R
