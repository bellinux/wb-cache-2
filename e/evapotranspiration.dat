5|$|C. diaphanus is {{the only}} species of fairy shrimp to occur {{naturally}} in Great Britain; Tanymastix stagnalis is found in western Ireland, and Artemia salina formerly occurred in England. Within Great Britain, C. diaphanus is restricted to areas with a deficit of precipitation against <b>evapotranspiration</b> between April and September. This means {{that it is only}} found frequently in southern England, with scattered records as far north as Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} jet stream will gradually weaken {{as a result of}} global warming. Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, <b>evapotranspiration</b> patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E
5|$|Devised by the American {{climatologist}} and geographer C. W. Thornthwaite, {{this climate}} classification method monitors the soil water budget using <b>evapotranspiration.</b> It monitors {{the portion of}} total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type. The lower {{the value of the}} index in any given area, the drier the area is.|$|E
5|$|It has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Cfa {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification). whose main features are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year. This year-round rainfall occurs {{because most of the}} region lies north of the subtropical high pressure belt even in winter, exposing it to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. Water deficiencies and extended periods of drought are uncommon, and much of the region has a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential <b>evapotranspiration).</b>|$|E
5|$|Plants face severe {{challenges}} in arid environments. Problems {{they need to}} solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. Photosynthesis {{is the key to}} plant growth. It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot. Opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes <b>evapotranspiration,</b> and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting crassulacean acid metabolism, allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO2 to enter, and close them during the day, or by using C4 carbon fixation.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} a {{location}} {{is affected by}} its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates <b>evapotranspiration</b> along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus {{on the origin of}} air masses that define the climate of a region.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are often}} planted in town environments {{where they are}} known as street trees or amenity trees. They can provide shade and cooling through <b>evapotranspiration,</b> absorb {{greenhouse}} gasses and pollutants, intercept rainfall and {{reduce the risk of}} flooding. It has been shown that they are beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes. In London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to one tree for every resident.|$|E
5|$|A {{semi-arid}} desert or a steppe is {{a version}} of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to <b>evapotranspiration</b> and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot steppe) or BSk (temperate steppe) in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E
5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called <b>evapotranspiration</b> that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason is the lack of <b>evapotranspiration</b> (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, <b>evapotranspiration,</b> or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E
5|$|Turbulent {{forces in}} {{air and water}} affect the {{environment}} and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running {{over the surface of}} a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, {{and other parts of the}} aquatic ecosystem are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence <b>evapotranspiration</b> rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.|$|E
25|$|A {{little over}} 70% of {{rainwater}} in Mexico is lost through <b>evapotranspiration</b> {{and returns to}} the atmosphere. The rest runs off rivers and streams or infiltrates into the subsoil and recharges groundwater.|$|E
25|$|Water on Earth moves {{continually}} {{through the}} water cycle of evaporation and transpiration (<b>evapotranspiration),</b> condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. Evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land. Large amounts of water are also chemically combined or adsorbed in hydrated minerals.|$|E
25|$|Carlsbad {{is part of}} the Interior West climate zone. It is {{classified}} as semi-arid (Köppen BSk), meaning average annual precipitation is less than potential <b>evapotranspiration,</b> but more than half. A moderate amount of rain falls each year, with the maximum occurring during September. 53 tornadoes have been reported in Eddy County since 1950.|$|E
25|$|Climates can be {{classified}} according to the average and typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates <b>evapotranspiration</b> in addition to temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying animal species diversity and potential impacts of climate changes.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} rains fall in October and May while {{the dry season}} lasts from December to April. Fifty-six percent of the average annual rainfall are lost to <b>evapotranspiration.</b> Due to its geographic location, Jamaica is regularly {{in the path of}} tropical storms and hurricanes during the period of July to November. These storms are of high intensity and great magnitudes characterized by flood-producing rainfall amounts.|$|E
25|$|As water {{moves through}} the landscape, it {{collects}} soluble salts, mainly sodium chloride. Where such water enters the atmosphere through <b>evapotranspiration,</b> these salts are left behind. In irrigation districts, poor drainage of soils and surface aquifers can result in water tables' coming to the surface in low-lying areas. Major land degradation problems of soil salinity and waterlogging result, combined with increasing levels of salt in surface waters. As a consequence, major damage has occurred to local economies and environments.|$|E
25|$|Under the Köppen–Geiger climate {{classification}} system, Dnipro has a hot-summer humid {{continental climate}} (Dfa) with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. However, according to other schemes (such as the Salvador Rivas-Martínez bioclimatic one), Dnipro has a Supratemperate bioclimate, and {{belongs to the}} Temperate xeric steppic thermoclimatic belt, due to high <b>evapotranspiration,</b> Dnipro is in the transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa), with relatively drier summers {{than the rest of}} the year.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} type of drought is the hydrological or agricultural drought whereby moisture is in the soil but little is getting to vegetation, either because it is frozen (which can occur in severely cold winters in the United Kingdom) or because of very high temperatures {{which means that the}} rate of <b>evapotranspiration</b> is exceeding the rate of uptake of water from the plant (which {{can be seen in the}} United Kingdom, on hot days, when plants wilt as their stores of water are depleted).|$|E
25|$|Irrigation in Guatemala is {{concentrated}} in three regions of the country. The Atlantic coast region has low humidity and high <b>evapotranspiration</b> so irrigation is needed for the cultivation of bananas, tomatoes, watermelon, and tobacco. The high plains region has very little rain {{for much of the}} year and with fertile volcanic soils that do not retain moisture very well. Without irrigation, there is only one harvest per year so crops such as basic grains require irrigation. The lower coastal zones have irrigated sugarcane and banana plantations.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{potential}} diversity of climates in the ET category involving precipitation, extreme temperatures, and relative {{wet and dry}} seasons, this category is rarely subdivided. Rainfall and snowfall are generally slight due to the low vapor pressure {{of water in the}} chilly atmosphere, but as a rule potential <b>evapotranspiration</b> is extremely low, allowing soggy terrain of swamps and bogs even in places that get precipitation typical of deserts of lower and middle latitudes. The amount of native tundra biomass depends more on the local temperature than the amount of precipitation.|$|E
25|$|The central Sahara is {{estimated}} to include five hundred species of plants, which is extremely low considering the huge extent of the area. Plants such as acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny shrubs, and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions, by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds, by storing water in their thick stems {{to use it in}} dry periods, by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the maximum area of water and to find any surface moisture, and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by <b>evapotranspiration.</b> Plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover.|$|E
25|$|Northern Alberta is {{the coldest}} region of Alberta, with most places having a subarctic climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Dfc) though some {{areas in the}} south of this region, as well as much of the Peace River Country, have a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb). Winters in Northern Alberta are long, very cold, and harsh, while summers are short and warm. Precipitation levels are generally lower than Central Alberta and similar to Southern Alberta, but lower <b>evapotranspiration</b> results in there being greater effective precipitation than Southern Alberta. Natural vegetation in Northern Alberta consists primarily of mixed and coniferous taiga, with aspen parkland in the Peace River Country. With the exception of the Peace River Country, this region is generally quite poor for agriculture.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{facilitation}} is {{more likely}} to occur in physically stressful environments than in favorable environments, where competition {{may be the most important}} interaction among species. This can also occur in a single habitat containing a gradient from low to high stress. For example, along a New England, USA, salt marsh tidal gradient, a presence of black needle rush (Juncus gerardii) increased the fitness of marsh elder (Iva annua) shrubs in lower elevations, where soil salinity was higher. The rush shaded the soil, which decreased <b>evapotranspiration,</b> and in turn decreased soil salinity. However, at higher elevations where soil salinity was lower, marsh elder fitness was decreased in the presence of the rush, due to increased competition for resources. Thus, the nature of species interactions may shift with environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|With {{an average}} width of 120km, Costa Rica {{receives}} about 170km3 from rain and about 75km3 {{finds its way}} into the rivers and lakes of Costa Rica and yet another 37km3 ends up in underground aquifers. The remaining water is lost through evaporation and <b>evapotranspiration.</b> Costa Rica is divided into three major slopes or basins. The Atlantic side is the wet and rainy side and rarely experiences a deficit of water throughout the year. The Atlantic sloping side incorporates the Northern slope that drains into the San Juan River bordering Nicaragua and also towards the Caribbean Sea. The sub-basins within this slope contribute 5.8km3 annually to Lake Nicaragua {{and more than half of}} the water that flows into the San Juan River or around 23.2km3 The Pacific slope is more dry with a shared decline in average flow during the dry season. In total, there are 34 principal drainage basins in Costa Rica with 17 having a major sloping contour and range in size from 207km2 to 5,084km2.|$|E
25|$|Coastal salt marshes can be {{distinguished}} from terrestrial habitats by the daily tidal flow that occurs and continuously floods the area. It is an important process in delivering sediments, nutrients and plant water supply to the marsh. At higher elevations in the upper marsh zone, there is much less tidal inflow, resulting in lower salinity levels. Soil salinity in the lower marsh zone is fairly constant due to everyday annual tidal flow. However, in the upper marsh, variability in salinity is shown {{as a result of}} less frequent flooding and climate variations. Rainfall can reduce salinity and <b>evapotranspiration</b> can increase levels during dry periods. As a result, there are microhabitats populated by different species of flora and fauna dependant on their physiological abilities. The flora of a salt marsh is differentiated into levels according to the plants' individual tolerance of salinity and water table levels. Vegetation found at the water must be able to survive high salt concentrations, periodical submersion, and a certain amount of water movement, while plants further inland in the marsh can sometimes experience dry, low-nutrient conditions. It has been found that the upper marsh zones limit species through competition and the lack of habitat protection, while lower marsh zones are determined through the ability of plants to tolerate physiological stresses such as salinity, water submergence and low oxygen levels.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture is most {{commonly}} found in Mediterranean, continental and maritime climates with each unique climate providing its own challenges in providing sufficient water at critical times during the growing season. In Mediterranean climates irrigation is usually needed during the very dry periods of the summer ripening stages where drought can be a persistent threat. The level of humidity in a particular macroclimate will dictate exactly how much irrigation is needed {{with high levels of}} <b>evapotranspiration</b> more commonly occurring in Mediterranean climates that have low levels of humidity such as part of Chile and the Cape Province of South Africa. In these low humidity regions, primary irrigation may be needed, but in many Mediterranean climates the irrigation is usually supplemental. The amount of precipitation that occurs during spring and summer months is also important. For example, Tuscany receives an average of 8inches (200mm) of rainfall during the months of April through June - the period that includes flowering and fruit set, when the water is most crucial. While fluctuations in rainfall do occur, the amount of natural precipitation, combined with water holding capacity of soil, is typically sufficient to result in healthy harvest. In contrast, Napa Valley only gets 2.4inches (60mm), on average, during the same period of time, often in an erratic pattern (some years seeing more, some years seeing only trace amounts of rain), and most appellations in Central and Southern California (both along the coast and inland) receive even less than that, necessitating supplemental irrigation.|$|E
500|$|Potential <b>evapotranspiration</b> {{supplements}} {{the measurement}} of precipitation in providing a scientific measurement-based definition of a desert. The water budget of an area can be calculated using the formula P − PE ± S, wherein P is precipitation, PE is potential <b>evapotranspiration</b> rates and S is amount of surface storage of water. <b>Evapotranspiration</b> is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants. Potential <b>evapotranspiration,</b> then, {{is the amount of}} water that could evaporate in any given region. As an example, Tucson, Arizona receives about [...] of rain per year, however about [...] of water could evaporate {{over the course of a}} year. In other words, about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain. Rates of <b>evapotranspiration</b> in cold regions such as Alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation process.|$|E
500|$|A {{desert is}} {{a region of}} land that is very dry because it {{receives}} low amounts of precipitation (usually {{in the form of}} rain but may be snow, mist or fog), often has little coverage by plants, and in which streams dry up unless they are supplied by water from outside the area. Deserts generally receive less than [...] of precipitation each year. The potential <b>evapotranspiration</b> may be large but (in the absence of available water) the actual <b>evapotranspiration</b> may be close to zero. Semideserts are regions which receive between [...] and when clad in grass, these are known as steppes.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} arid and semi-arid climate dominates {{regions where}} {{the rate of}} moisture loss through <b>evapotranspiration</b> exceeds that from precipitation; it is subdivided into three climatic subtypes- [...] tropical semi-arid steppe, arid climate, tropical and sub-tropical steppe climate.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{any other}} wetland system on earth, the Everglades are {{sustained}} {{primarily by the}} atmosphere. <b>Evapotranspiration</b> – the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth's land surface to atmosphere – associated with thunderstorms, is the key mechanism by which water leaves the region. During a year unaffected by drought, the rate may reach [...] a year. When droughts take place, the rate may peak at over , and exceed the amount of rainfall. As water leaves an area through evaporation from groundwater or from plant matter, activated primarily by solar energy, it is then moved by wind patterns to other areas that border or flow into the Everglades watershed system. <b>Evapotranspiration</b> is responsible for approximately 70–90percent of water entering undeveloped wetland regions in the Everglades.|$|E
500|$|Approximately [...] {{of water}} falls as {{precipitation}} each year {{across the globe}} with [...] of it over the oceans. Given the Earth's surface area, that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is [...] Deserts are defined as areas with an average annual precipitation of less than [...] per year, or as areas where more water is lost by <b>evapotranspiration</b> than falls as precipitation.|$|E
500|$|Takalik Abaj sits at an {{altitude}} of approximately [...] above sea level in an ecoregion classed as subtropical moist forest. The temperature normally varies between [...] and the potential <b>evapotranspiration</b> ratio averages 0.45. The area receives high annual rainfall, varying between , with an average annual rainfall of [...] Local vegetation includes the Pascua de Montaña (Pogonopus speciosus), Chichique (Aspidosperma megalocarpon), Tepecaulote (Luehea speciosa), Caulote or West Indian Elm (Guazuma ulmifolia), Hormigo (Platymiscium dimorphandrum), Mexican Cedar (Cedrela odorata), Breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), Tamarind (Tamarindus indica) and Papaturria (Coccoloba montana).|$|E
500|$|Based on {{precipitation}} alone, hyperarid deserts receive {{less than}} [...] of rainfall a year; {{they have no}} annual seasonal cycle of precipitation and experience twelve-month periods with no rainfall at all. Arid deserts receive between [...] {{in a year and}} semiarid deserts between [...] However, such factors as the temperature, humidity, rate of evaporation and <b>evapotranspiration,</b> and the moisture storage capacity of the ground have a marked effect on the degree of aridity and the plant and animal life that can be sustained. Rain falling in the cold season may be more effective at promoting plant growth, and defining the boundaries of deserts and the semiarid regions that surround them on the grounds of precipitation alone is problematic.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the region}} {{receives}} less than [...] of precipitation per year, although some areas can receive less than [...] In northern Río Negro Province and eastern Neuquén Province, mean annual precipitation is around [...] while south of 50oS, precipitation increases southwards, reaching up to [...] There is a narrow transition zone running down from 39oS to 47oS that receives about [...] of precipitation a year. Much of northwestern Patagonia in the Andes, corresponding to the northern parts of the Bosque Andino Patagónico region, receives abundant precipitation in winter with occasional droughts in summer, allowing it to support forests with dense coverage. With the exception of certain areas such as Puerto Blest, no major towns receive more than [...] of precipitation a year. The southern parts of the Bosque Andino Patagónico region receive only [...] resulting in less dense forest coverage. The lower precipitation, compared to the northern parts, {{is due to the}} winds being more intense and drier, favouring <b>evapotranspiration.</b>|$|E
