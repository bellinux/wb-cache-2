40|$|There {{have been}} {{interesting}} theoretical {{developments in the}} study of international environmental problems over the past two decades, as scholars grapple to deal with the complexities and growing range of actors constituting the political realms of issues like climate change, biodiversity loss and other forms of environmental degradation (Morin and Orsini 2013). Most recently, Global Environmental Politics (GEP) _ has followed an emerging trend within critical International Relations (IR) that re-focuses scholarly attention on methods and the methodological approaches used to understand, generate knowledge and represent international political life (O’Neil et al. 2013). This chapter aims to review some of the key theoretical and methodological approaches and recent innovations within the field of GEP, and indicate how a turn to the sociology of <b>international</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>relations,</b> in particular the sociological approach of Pierre Bourdieu, may offer important tools for further unpacking and illuminating the power relations imbued in all international political activities directed at cleaning the planet. This is not only important for providing GEP scholars with critical tools to deconstruct the politics of global environmental degradation, but also because this field offers a key site for understanding patterns of social domination structuring contemporary international political order...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} the <b>international</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>relations</b> {{undertaken by}} subnational governments, a phenomenon conceptualised as environmental paradiplomacy. Research on paradiplomacy examines subnational governments’ international relations without considering their engagement with environmental issues, while multilevel governance (MLG) theory {{focuses on the}} rescaling of governance of environmental problems without addressing subnational engagement in international relations. Combining paradiplomacy studies and MLG theory, the thesis develops an original conceptual framework to investigate a leading example of environmental paradiplomacy. The conceptual framework {{is applied to the}} case of the state of São Paulo, a regional government in Brazil that, since the 1970 s, has strongly engaged in international environmental activities. In contrast with other findings on paradiplomacy, the state of São Paulo engages in international relations not only as a way of challenging, but also of collaborating with the national government. The major empirical data informing the thesis was gathered through participant observation and semi-structured interviews with key figures involved with environmental governance in the state and at the national level, as well as representatives from NGOs, universities, the private sector and foreign policy-makers. The study furthers the understanding of paradiplomacy offering analytical insight into: (1) how subnational governments engage in transnational relations; (2) the reasons driving them to undertake paradiplomacy; and (3) the outcomes of their actions. It also contributes more generally to research on global environmental governance, offering new theoretical insights on the roles of subnational governments and the changing relationships between different levels of government in national and international policymaking...|$|E
40|$|Article {{deals with}} the weakest link in the {{structure}} of international environmental law, which presence serves as a pretext for the continuation of discussions between international lawyers both in Russia and abroad on the recognition or non-recognition of international environmental law an independent branch of international law. This is a category of special principles that should form the skeleton of totality of international legal rules, if they apply for the name of an independent branch of international law. The article analyzes the main most authoritative offers of the catalogs of special principles of international environmental law, contained in the works of both Russian and foreign scientists, revealed the main reasons that do not allow to reach consensus on a common list of such principles today: a lack of understanding of the essence of special principles and the ongoing dynamic development of international legal regulation of <b>international</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>relations.</b> In this situation it is suggested that the experts in the field of international environmental law focus on the discussion, clarifications and additions to the list of special principles contained in the draft International Covenant on Environment and Development, presented for the first time by the IUCN experts in 1995 and based on the principles and achievements of all conducted under the UN auspices of all international conferences on the environment on the provisions of the World Charter for Nature and the existing international environmental agreements. The fourth edition of the draft Covenant adopted in 2010 indicates a consensus among the most prominent representatives of the science of international law different regions of the Earth with respect to 10 special principles, many of which require further refinement and development. The least studied in the "top ten" is the principle of the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, the legal content of which is analyzed in the article with special interest. The author suggests to concentrate scientific potential of the Russian doctrine of international environmental law and the activities of the foreign affairs agencies on the promotion of the ideas of the draft International covenant in order to present it in the end, at a specially convened intergovernmental conference...|$|E

40|$|The {{protection}} of {{human health and the}} environment are two major goals of <b>international</b> <b>environmental</b> law. However, there has been little coherent scrutiny of their scope or implementation at international and domestic levels in developing countries and Africa in particular. This thesis shows that <b>international</b> <b>environmental</b> law regimes with a health protection objective have not maximized opportunities to reinforce the promotion and {{protection of}} public health in Africa. Through inter alia a study of sustainable management of shared freshwaters, trans-boundary movement of hazardous wastes and their disposal and international climate law, the thesis shows that a range of legal frameworks comprised of substantive, institutional and procedural law mandates States to advance the health objective in <b>international</b> <b>environmental</b> law. However, the thesis demonstrates the limits of these regimes and suggests options to enhance their potential in promoting and protecting public health. An enhanced framework of adaptive governance is proposed to improve environmental health governance. The thesis illustrates how the discourse on health in <b>international</b> <b>environmental</b> law can strengthen <b>international</b> <b>environmental</b> health governance to improve environmental and public health outcomes. It contains seven publications that analyse the strengths and weaknesses and options for reform of the <b>international</b> <b>environmental</b> law regime for health.
