On September 10, 1990, Bennett submitted a confidential report, which soon leaked, that recommended that {{the committee}} continue its investigation of Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle, but take no action against Glenn and McCain, as there was <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence</b> to pursue the latter two. Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{hand washing}} {{appears to be}} {{effective}} in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown.

Open verdict, according to the Collins English Dictionary, means a finding by a coroner's jury of death without stating the cause. In other words, Gunasegaran’s death was deemed suspicious by the jury but none of the other verdicts open to them could be reached.|$|R

5|$|Frank Stilwell {{had just}} arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the {{preliminary}} hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence</b> {{just as he had}} done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year.|$|E
5|$|Glob's book {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} both Barry Cunliffe in Nature and Ralph M. Rowlett in American Anthropologist. They praised Glob's arguments {{as well as}} his writing style and use of illustrations, alongside Bruce-Mitford's translation. In subsequent decades, it has received both praise and criticism from specialists in the field, who have lauded the publicity which it brought to the subject, but rejected many of Glob's conclusions as being based on <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, three others, Julián Sancristóbal, Juan Alberto Perote and Francisco Álvarez, were {{implicated in}} the case. Sancristóbal had been the former {{director}} of state security, Perote {{the former head of the}} Spanish secret service, while Álvarez had been head of the anti-terrorist squad. They all denied the accusations. The Monbar case was closed in October 2001, with Garzón declaring that, although suspicions remained about involvement of some of those accused, there was <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence</b> to prosecute.|$|E
5|$|The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment {{considered}} {{that there was}} <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence</b> to justify leaving agriculture out of the NZ ETS until 2015.

5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence</b> to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E

5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. In the early nineteenth century, Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence</b> after a hearing at the Monroe County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru {{was also}} known for his history of legal problems. He {{was a member of}} Satan's Choice, a biker gang. He was convicted of assault, {{trafficking}} cocaine and bombing a police station. In 2005, Croitoru was arrested for the murder of lawyer Lynn Gilbank and her husband Fred. After a lengthy investigation, the charges were dropped in June 2006 because of <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence.</b> He worked as a security guard in Vancouver, British Columbia, until being arrested in May 2009 for conspiracy to commit murder. On January 24, 2011, Croitoru was charged with first degree murder in connection with the 2008 killing of Jonathan Barber in Burnaby, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{joined the}} Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923; his Party number was 14,303. As {{a member of}} Röhm's {{paramilitary}} unit, Himmler {{was involved in the}} Beer Hall Putsch—an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence.</b> However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as an agronomist, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.|$|E
50|$|Although {{considerable}} {{research has}} examined the potential for soy consumption to {{lower the risk of}} breast cancer in women, assessment of these studies indicates there is <b>insufficient</b> population <b>evidence</b> to make a conclusion about this relationship as of 2016.|$|R
50|$|As of June 2013, 46 detainees (in {{addition}} to two who were deceased) were designated to be detained indefinitely, {{because the government}} said the prisoners were too dangerous to transfer and there was <b>insufficient</b> admissible <b>evidence</b> to try them.|$|R

5|$|In July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting {{those they}} found there and {{uncovering}} paperwork documenting MK's activities, {{some of which}} mentioned Mandela. The Rivonia Trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar. Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence,</b> but Yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from December 1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.|$|E
5|$|In cases falling {{under the}} second sub-heading, a public {{authority}} has satisfied all the factual and legal conditions required for exercising a statutory power conferred upon it, but nevertheless may have acted illegally {{by doing so}} in a manner contrary to administrative law rules. The grounds of review available under this heading include the authority acting in bad faith, acting {{on the basis of}} no evidence or <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence,</b> making an error of material fact, failing to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant ones, acting for an improper purpose, fettering one's discretion, and not fulfilling a person's substantive legitimate expectations.|$|E
5|$|Much of Savile's career {{involved}} {{working with}} children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting Top of the Pops before a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting Jim'll Fix It, in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each {{concluded that there was}} <b>insufficient</b> <b>evidence</b> for any charges to be brought relating to sexual offences. In October 2012, it was announced that the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.|$|E
