50|$|Enamovirus is a genus of viruses, in {{the family}} Luteoviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There is {{currently}} only one species in this genus: the type species Pea <b>enation</b> mosaic virus 1. Diseases associated with this genus include: pea <b>enation</b> disease: if both PEMV-1 and PEMV-2 are present.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Enation</b> is an American indie {{rock band}} formed in Battle Ground, Washington, in 2002. In 2014 {{they changed their}} {{official}} name to Jonathan Jackson + <b>Enation</b> and released their fourth studio album [...] "Radio Cinematic" [...] through Loud & Proud Records. The band currently resides in Nashville, TN.|$|E
50|$|Pea <b>enation</b> mosaic virus (PEMV) is a plant {{pathogenic}} virus.|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms include chlorotic, {{translucent}} or necrotic lesions, malformation {{of leaves}} and stipules, and plant distortion. However, the most characteristic symptom is the formation of <b>enations</b> on the abaxial, i.e. downy, leaf side. <b>Enations</b> are derived from the cells of vascular bundles undergoing hyperplasia.|$|R
50|$|Leaves become {{studded with}} {{projections}} or <b>enations</b> between the lateral veins and {{all along the}} midrib. As a result, the leaves become deformed and folded, looking very narrow. The face of the leaf has a bumpy texture {{as a result of}} the <b>enations</b> on the underside.|$|R
50|$|All Psilotaceae share a few characteristics. They are {{vascular}} {{plants and}} they lack leaves, having instead small outgrowths called <b>enations.</b> The <b>enations</b> {{are not considered}} true leaves because {{there is only a}} vascular bundle just underneath them, but not inside, as in leaves. Psilotales also do not have true roots. They are anchored by rhizoids. Absorption is aided by symbiotic fungi called mycorrhizae.|$|R

50|$|Jonathan Stevens Jackson (born May 11, 1982) is an American actor, {{musician}} and author. His first well known character was Lucky Spencer on the ABC Daytime soap opera General Hospital, a role which has won him five Emmy Awards. In 2002, he played Jesse Tuck {{in the film}} Tuck Everlasting. In 2004 he started the band <b>Enation</b> (currently: Jonathan Jackson + <b>Enation)</b> with his brother, actor Richard Lee Jackson and friend Daniel Sweatt. He currently portrays Avery Barkley in the CMT drama Nashville.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Psilotum has {{secondarily}} lost leaves, {{and bears}} <b>enations</b> resembling the microphylls of early land plants.|$|R
5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{case is that}} of Psilotum, {{which has}} a (simple) protostele, and <b>enations</b> devoid of vascular tissue. Some species of Psilotum have a single vascular trace that terminates {{at the base of}} the <b>enations.</b> Consequently, Psilotum was long thought to be a [...] "living fossil" [...] closely related to early land plants (Rhyniophytes). However, genetic analysis has shown Psilotum to be a reduced fern.|$|R
50|$|<b>Enations</b> are scaly leaflike structures, differing from {{leaves in}} {{their lack of}} {{vascular}} tissue. They are created by some leaf diseases. Also found on some early plants such as Rhynia, where they are hypothesized to aid in photosynthesis.|$|R
5000|$|Also in 2008, <b>Enation</b> {{combined}} two previously recorded rock records [...] "Identity Theft" [...] and [...] "Where the Fire Starts" [...] {{into one}} compilation album, Falling Into Sounds: The Early Sessions 2004-2007.|$|E
5000|$|Amber’s voice, musical talent, and songwriting {{have also}} been {{featured}} in two CW television series: One Tree Hilland Life Unexpected ("Flying Machine," [...] "Girl In The Moon," [...] "Quicksand," [...] "Maybe," [...] "Stars," [...] "Feel This" [...] - written by Jonathan Jackson of <b>Enation)</b> while {{one half of the}} duo known as Everly. Her voice has also been featured in Stephen King’s film adaptation of Riding The Bullet, while bass player and back up singer for the rock band <b>Enation.</b> She can also be heard on another northwest band’s album, The Alleged Album by One From Many ("Tears We Cry Alone" [...] and [...] "Shape Of Your Heart").|$|E

50|$|While it {{is common}} for the hosts not to show any {{symptoms}} of the pathogens influence, there are some symptoms that can occur in the hosts. The most prevalent symptoms of the ArMV are stunting of the plant and leaf flecking/molting and leaf <b>enations.</b> The symptoms will vary based on the type of rootstock, environmental conditions and variety.|$|R
50|$|Drepanophycus has {{similarities}} to the genus Halleophyton. It differs from a closely related genus {{of the same}} period, Baragwanathia, {{in the position of}} the sporangia, and the arrangement and shape of the leaves; see Drepanophycaceae for more details. It is more derived than the coexisting genus Asteroxylon, which has <b>enations</b> lacking vascules, in contrast to the true leaves of Drepanophycus.|$|R
50|$|Oryzavirus is a genus of viruses, in {{the family}} Reoviridae, in the {{subfamily}} Spinareovirinae. There are currently only two species in this genus including the type species Rice ragged stunt virus. Diseases associated with this genus include: RRSV: stunting, <b>enations</b> on veins of leaves and leaf sheaths, ragged leaves, flower suppression; FDV: Fiji disease, with severe stunting, deformation and death.|$|R

50|$|The genus Umbravirus {{includes}} plant viruses {{assigned to}} the family Tombusviridae. The genus has seven recognized species: Carrot mottle mimic virus, Carrot mottle virus, the type species, Groundnut rosette virus, Lettuce speckles mottle virus, Pea <b>enation</b> mosaic virus 2, Tobacco bushy top virus, and Tobacco mottle virus.|$|E
5000|$|Brothers {{and actors}} Jonathan Jackson and Richard Lee Jackson {{originally}} formed the music group {{that came to}} be known as <b>Enation</b> along with their good friend Daniel Sweatt (bass) in 2002. Jonathan, the band's frontman, sings, plays guitar, piano, and writes most of the songs, while Richard plays drums and percussion with Daniel Sweatt on bass.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the same}} time, the zosterophyllophytes were {{becoming}} important. This group is recognisable by their kidney-shaped sporangia, which grew on short lateral branches {{close to the}} main axes. They sometimes branched in a distinctive H-shape. The majority of this group bore pronounced spines on their axes. However, none of these had a vascular trace, and the first evidence of vascularised <b>enations</b> occurs in the Rhynie genus Asteroxylon. The spines of Asteroxylon had a primitive vascular supply - at the very least, leaf traces could be seen departing from the central protostele towards each individual [...] "leaf". A fossil clubmoss known as Baragwanathia had already appeared in the fossil record about 20 million years earlier, in the Late Silurian. In this organism, these leaf traces continue into the leaf to form their mid-vein. One theory, the [...] "enation theory", holds that the leaves developed by outgrowths of the protostele connecting with existing <b>enations,</b> {{but it is also}} possible that microphylls evolved by a branching axis forming [...] "webbing".|$|R
40|$|An Early Devonian (Pragian) plant, Hueberia zhichangensis gen. et sp. nov., is {{described}} from the Posongchong Formation, Wenshan district of southern Yunnan, China. It {{is characterized by}} stems < 2 mm wide and closely helically-arranged <b>enations.</b> A creeping habit is suggested due to K-type branching. No fertile organs are preserved. Hueberia gen. nov. resembles Drepanophycus and Kaulangiophyton, but is much smaller and has a more regular phyllotaxy...|$|R
50|$|The {{stems of}} zosterophylls were either smooth or covered with small spines known as <b>enations,</b> {{branched}} dichotomously, and grew {{at the ends}} by unrolling, {{a process known as}} circinate vernation. The stems had a central vascular column in which the protoxylem was exarch, and the metaxylem developed centripetally. The sporangia were kidney-shaped (reniform), with conspicuous lateral dehiscence and were borne laterally in a fertile zone towards the tips of the branches.|$|R
50|$|Bethany Joy Lenz {{and musical}} acts Angels & Airwaves and {{occasional}} One Tree Hill guest star Kate Voegele {{teamed up with}} the USO for a live concert event for military personnel. The event also included Lenz's ex-husband's band <b>Enation,</b> and music partner Amber Sweeney who accompanied Lenz on stage to perform Lenz's hit single Feel This and song entitled The Sweetest Thing. The duo also performed their single written for troops, Home Is Me - You Are Mine.|$|E
50|$|Extinct {{terrestrial}} vascular {{plants of}} the Silurian to Devonian periods. Stem {{of the order}} of several mm to several cm in diameter and several cm to several metres long, erect or arched, dichotomizing occasionally, furnished with true roots at the base. Vascular bundle an exarch actinostele, tracheids of primitive annular or helical type (so-called G-type). Stem clothed in either microphylls (leaves with a single vascular thread or 'vein'), or with leaf-like enations (unvascularized projections) with a vascular trace into the base of each <b>enation.</b> Homosporous, with sporangia borne singly and dehiscing by a single slit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ensemble}} {{morphed into}} <b>Enation,</b> where Jackson is the frontman, playing guitar, vocals and writing most the songs. Other band members include Jonathan's brother Richard (drums), {{and their friends}} Daniel Sweatt (bass), Luke Galeotti (guitar) and Michael Galeotti (keyboard). The band has released several albums and their song [...] "Feel This" [...] became a Top 10 hit on the iTunes national Rock Charts after it was featured on the CW television drama series One Tree Hill. Enation's songs have also been featured on Riding the Bullet, and General Hospital.|$|E
5000|$|Lycopodolica is a genus of extinct {{plants of}} the Late Silurian ( [...] , around [...] ). Fossils {{were found in}} the Rashkov Beds in Podolia in modern Ukraine. Plants there are {{preserved}} as compressions without internal detail. Lycopodolica had stems (axes) which appear to have branched and which are covered with lax, hair- or thread-like outgrowths. Considered to be a lycophyte, Lycopodolica differs from Baragwanathia in the nature of its outgrowths or <b>enations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) is {{a severe}} disease of cotton {{that occurs in}} Africa and Pakistan/northwestern India. The disease is caused by begomoviruses in {{association}} with specific betasatellites that differ between Africa and Asia. During survey of symptomatic cotton in Sindh (southern Pakistan) Cotton leaf curl Gezira virus (CLCuGV), the begomovirus associated with CLCuD in Africa, was identified. However, the cognate African betasatellite (Cotton leaf curl Gezira betasatellite) was not found. Instead, two Asian betasatellites, the CLCuD-associated Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB) and Chilli leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB) were identified. Inoculation of the experimental plant species Nicotiana benthamiana showed that CLCuGV was competent to maintain both CLCuMB and ChLCB. Interestingly, the <b>enations</b> typical of CLCuD were only induced by CLCuGV {{in the presence of}} CLCuMB. Also in infections involving both CLCuMB and ChLCB the <b>enations</b> typical of CLCuMB were less evident. This is the first time an African begomovirus has been identified on the Indian sub-continent, highlight the growing threat of begomoviruses and particularly the threat of CLCuD causing viruses t...|$|R
50|$|Whisk ferns in {{the genus}} Psilotum lack true roots but are {{anchored}} by creeping rhizomes. The stems have many branches with paired <b>enations,</b> which look like small leaves {{but have no}} vascular tissue. Above these <b>enations</b> there are synangia formed by the fusion of three sporangia and which produce the spores. When mature, the synangia release yellow to whitish spores which develop into a gametophyte less than 2 mm long. The gametophyte lives underground as a saprophyte, sometimes in a mycorrhizal association. When the gametophyte is mature, it produces both egg and sperm cells. The sperm cells swim using several flagella and when they reach an egg cell, unite with it to form the young sporophyte. A mature sporophyte may grow to a height of 30 cm or more but lacks true leaves. The stem has a core of thick-walled protostele in its centre surrounded by an endodermis which regulates {{the flow of water}} and nutrients. The surface of the stem is covered with stomates whiich allow gas exchange with the surroundings.|$|R
5000|$|Lenz married former <b>Enation</b> keyboardist, Michael Galeotti, on December 31, 2005. On February 23, 2011, Lenz {{gave birth}} to a daughter, Maria Rose Galeotti. In March 2012, Lenz {{announced}} that she would be divorcing her husband after six years of marriage. She wrote: [...] "You'll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me 'Bethany Joy Lenz' again. I'm sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time." [...] She and her daughter reside in Los Angeles, California. Lenz is a Christian.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>enation</b> {{theory of}} microphyll {{evolution}} posits that small outgrowths, or enations, {{developed from the}} side of early stems (such as those found in the Zosterophylls). [...] Outgrowths of the protostele (the central vasculature) later emerged towards the enations (as in Asteroxylon), and eventually continued to grow fully into the leaf to form the mid-vein (such as in Baragwanathia). [...] The fossil record appears to display these traits in this order, but this may be a coincidence, as the record is incomplete. The telome theory proposes instead that both microphylls and megaphylls originated by the reduction; microphylls by reduction of a single telome branch, and megaphylls by evolution from branched portions of a telome.|$|E
5000|$|On September 19, 2008 at the Marine Corps Air Station New River in Jacksonville, North Carolina Bethany Joy Lenz {{and musical}} acts Angels & Airwaves, and {{occasional}} One Tree Hill guest star and fellow musician Kate Voegele {{teamed up with}} the USO for a live concert event for military personnel.

50|$|In Asia and Africa {{the major}} disease of cotton {{is caused by}} the Cotton leaf curl geminivirus (CLCuV). Leaves of {{infected}} cotton curl upward and bear leaf-like <b>enations</b> on the underside along with vein thickening. Plants infected early in the season are stunted and yield is reduced drastically. (A. Nadeem and Z. Xiong, University of Arizona) This virus devastated the Pakistan cotton industry in early 1990s where it caused an estimated yield reduction of 30-35%.|$|R
40|$|Background Cotton leaf curl {{disease in}} the Indian subcontinent is {{associated}} with several distinct begomoviruses that interact with a disease-specific DNA satellite named Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB). However, we have recently reported that Chili leaf curl betasatellite (ChLCB) is also occasionally found associated with the disease in Pakistan. The {{question as to whether}} ChLCB contributes to the development of disease symptoms such as leaf curling and <b>enations</b> remain to be answered. We have previously shown that the expression of βC 1 of CLCuMB develops all symptoms of cotton leaf curl disease in Nicotiana benthamiana when expressed from PVX vector. Findings The role of ChLCB in the induction of typical disease symptoms was studied by its expression from PVX vector in N. benthamiana. The expression of βC 1 from PVX vector developed severe leaf curl symptoms and leaf-like <b>enations</b> that resemble the phenotype induced by βC 1 of CLCuMB. Conclusions The results presented here show that the expression of βC 1 of ChLCB from PVX vector exhibit phenotype typical of cotton leaf curl and therefore ChLCB may contribute to the disease symptoms. </p...|$|R
