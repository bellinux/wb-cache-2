[...] In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I {{was on the road}} for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things... just to keep going, you know?" [...] In 2011, BBC Radio 4 reported that, in an interview that Robert Shelton taped in 1966, Dylan said he had kicked heroin in New York City: [...] "I got very, very strung out for a while... I had about a $25-a-day habit and <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> it."

No. 4 Commando were in the second wave and landed behind the initial assault battalion, from the East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the 3rd Infantry Division. Captain Porteous described how their dead and wounded were [...] "just swilling around in the water." [...] Captain McDougal later wrote, [...] "as we were coming ashore the assault troops were committing suicide by trying to dig in on the beach. In passing <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> the nearest man telling him to keep going. The man was dead. So was the man next to him and a third was seriously wounded by machine gun fire." [...] The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible. Once clear they headed for their assembly area, which was also the commando medical post. Leaving their rucksacks behind, they set off along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objectives.|$|E

500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest.

500|$|Beginning {{on the day}} of the fort's capture, Allen and Arnold began a war of words, each {{attempting}} to garner for himself as much credit for the operation as possible. [...] Arnold, unable to exert any authority over Allen and his men, began to keep a diary of events and actions, which was highly critical and dismissive of Allen. [...] Allen, in the days immediately after the action, also began to work on a memoir. Published several years later (see Further reading), the memoir fails to mention Arnold at all. [...] Allen also wrote several versions of the events, which John Brown and James Easton brought to a variety of Congresses and committees in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. [...] Randall (1990) claims that Easton took accounts written by both Arnold and Allen to the Massachusetts committee, but conveniently lost Arnold's account on the way, ensuring that Allen's version, which greatly glorified his role in the affair, would be preferred. [...] Smith (1907) indicates that it was highly likely that Easton was interested in claiming Arnold's command for himself. [...] There was clearly no love lost between Easton and Arnold. Allen and Easton returned to Crown Point on June 10 and called a council of war while Arnold was with the fleet on the lake, a clear breach of military protocol. [...] When Arnold, whose men now dominated the garrison, asserted his authority, Easton insulted Arnold, who responded by challenging Easton to a duel. Arnold later reported, [...] "On refusing to draw like a gentleman, he having a [...] by his side and cases of loaded pistols in his pockets, <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> him very heartily and ordered him from the Point." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the game, Lyle Blackwood {{criticized the}} referee's ruling of Freddie Solomon's fumble as an {{incomplete}} pass. [...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't make much of a difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far as my own game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in. We got in sort of a groove. Once you get going like that you gain confidence, and it carries over to the defense, and then back to the offense. It's a snowball kind of thing." ...|$|E

I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. <b>I</b> <b>kicked</b> the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident."

Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success.
