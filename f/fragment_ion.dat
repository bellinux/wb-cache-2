Using a built-in electrically heated filament electron gun, it was demonstrated that good quality ECD spectra of peptides (MW < 2500) {{could be obtained}} by irradiating the isolated peptide molecule-ions with a short pulse (50 ms) of low-energy (3 – 6 eV) electrons. In addition, we have also demonstrated that pulsing of inert cooling gas (argon) could further improve {{the intensity of the}} ECD-induced <b>fragment</b> <b>ions.</b> Due presumably to the influence of the strong magnetic field on the trajectories of electrons, the distance between the electron gun and the trapped-ion cell (i. e., 108 mm versus 20 mm) was found to have little influence on the efficiency of the ECD process(es). From a systematic study on the impact of the filament heating current, filament bias voltage, and electron irradiation time on the intensities of precursor <b>ions</b> and various <b>fragment</b> <b>ions,</b> it was postulated that subsequent capture of electrons by the <b>fragment</b> <b>ions,</b> i. e., neutralization of the <b>fragment</b> <b>ions,</b> might be a significant event for limiting the intensity of the <b>fragment</b> <b>ions...</b>|$|R

50|$|Quadrupole mass analyzers use {{oscillating}} electrical {{fields to}} selectively stabilize or destabilize {{the paths of}} ions passing through a radio frequency (RF) quadrupole field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow {{a wide range of}} m/z values to be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the quadrupole ion trap, particularly the linear quadrupole ion trap except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole.A magnetically enhanced quadrupole mass analyzer includes the addition of a magnetic field, either applied axially or transversely. This novel type of instrument leads to an additional performance enhancement in terms of resolution and/or sensitivity depending upon the magnitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field.
