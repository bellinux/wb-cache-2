30|$|According {{to the key}} informants, all {{authority}} concerning {{management of}} the state forest was exclusively vested on Tehulederi <b>District</b> <b>forestry</b> department. The management practice so far consisted of guarding the state forest. The participants in all focus group discussions confirmed {{that they could not}} harvest any wood products from the state forest. However, the local people could harvest grass for fodder if they had a licence from Tehulederi <b>District</b> <b>Forestry</b> Office. The participants of the focus group discussions confirmed that timber harvesting was banned. However, majority of the participants noted that illegal tree cutting at nights was common in the state forest. For example, according to the key informants, the <b>District</b> <b>Forestry</b> Department filed about 20 cases from 2008 to 2011. About half of those cases were concerned with the possession of illegally obtained poles, while illegal grazing in the state forest accounted for 40 % of the cases and very few cases (10 %) involved actual illegal tree cutting in the state forest. According to the key informants and participants in all focus group discussions, when the number of cases of illegal activity is considered at the state forest in Tehulederi District, the practice of guarding has apparently not yet produced positive results as expected. The Tehulederi <b>District</b> <b>forestry</b> staff also expressed their views on the law enforcement that has been generally constrained by lack of adequate personnel. Participants in the focus group discussions reported that guards patrol only in the nearby areas during the daylight hours; however, those who cut trees tend to operate during the nighttime.|$|R
