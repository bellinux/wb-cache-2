40|$|Wireless <b>igniter</b> <b>system</b> (namely WISys in this research) is {{a modern}} type <b>igniter</b> <b>system,</b> which {{utilizes}} the concept of radio frequency (RF) communication between a transmitting device and a receiving device and also the usage of a specified designated igniter. This type of <b>igniter</b> <b>system</b> is now becoming the main focus in most rocketry industries, especially for small scale solid rocket motor (SRM). The main purpose of using a wireless <b>igniter</b> <b>system</b> is because it can provide secure feeling when conducting experiment and testing, {{especially when it comes}} to the matter of explosive materials. The main components that a wireless <b>igniter</b> <b>system</b> must have include a transmitter, a receiver and an igniter. In this research, both the transmitter and receiver were designed to be function able at various ranges and the maximum communication range must reach up to 100 meters. Therefore, selection for wireless communication module is very significant and here the XBee-S 1 Starter Kit from Cytron Technologies was used as the main wireless communication module. With its ability to communicate with another XBee-S 1 Starter Kit as far as 100 meters range and simplicity of performing configuration and synchronisation, the XBee-S 1 Starter Kit module is simply the best choice, especially for those who are unfamiliar with radio frequency communication. Moreover, the power supply for the ignition must be at least 12 V so that there is sufficient heating energy to ignite the pyrolant contained inside the igniter within 3 to 5 seconds. For a good igniter, the igniter must possess good characteristics, such as made from stainless steel, sustainable material, high melting point, able to withstand very high pressure and temperature, high resistance to rust, small size and portable, light weight and tough. So, igniter with these characteristics will be able to store enough pressure inside the combustion or primary chamber to achieve complete combustion of the pyrolant before it is forced out from the igniter into the thrust chamber of rocket motor to burn the propellant grains. As a conclusion, with high pressure inside the primary chamber the velocity inside the chamber would be low. Hence, the burning rate of the pyrolant would also be slower. With this condition achieved, the pyrolant inside the igniter could be burnt completely...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give a {{detailed}} description of the design, activation, and operation of the J 2 -X Subscale Simulator (JSS) installed in Cell 1 of the E 3 test facility at Stennis Space Center, MS (SSC). The primary purpose of the JSS is to simulate the installation of the J 2 -X engine in the A 3 Subscale Rocket Altitude Test Facility at SSC.

A Pyrofuze/pyrotechnic <b>igniter</b> <b>system</b> was demonstrated that uses a relatively low electrical current level for initiation and that eliminates the necessity of a pyrotechnic squib, with its accompanying accidental firing hazards and the typical basket of pyrotechnic pellets.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop a solid-propellant rocket <b>igniter</b> <b>system</b> that would build up thrust at a controlled rate of less than 0. 2 G/sec. The system consisted of a long burning, regressive burning, controlled flow igniter and an inhibited progressive burning surface in the main rocket motor. The igniter performed the dual role of igniting, under vacuum backpressure and low L* (motor free volume/nozzle throat area ratio) conditions, the nonrestricted portion of the propellant and providing the mass addition necessary to sustain combustion until the propellant burning area had increased sufficiently to provide a stable motor-chamber pressure. Two series of tests were conducted with existing small test motor hardware to: (1) demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, (2) determine the important parameters governing the system, and (3) obtain design guidelines for future scaled-up motor tests.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the progress of}} technology development of a laser ignition system at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Laser ignition has been used at MSFC in recent test series to successfully ignite RP 1 /GOX propellants in a subscale rocket chamber, and other past studies by NASA GRC have demonstrated the use of laser ignition for rocket engines. Despite the progress made {{in the study of}} this ignition method, the logistics of depositing laser sparks inside a rocket chamber have prohibited its use. However, recent advances in laser designs, the use of fiber optics, and studies of multi-pulse laser formats 3 have renewed the interest of rocket designers in this state-of the-art technology which offers the potential elimination of torch <b>igniter</b> <b>systems</b> and their associated mechanical parts, as well as toxic hypergolic ignition systems. In support of this interest to develop an alternative ignition system that meets the risk-reduction demands of Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT), characterization studies of a dual pulse laser format for laser-induced spark ignition are underway at MSFC. Results obtained at MSFC indicate that a dual pulse format can produce plasmas that absorb the laser energy as efficiently as a single pulse format, yet provide a longer plasma lifetime. In an experiments with lean H 2 /air propellants, the dual pulse laser format, containing the same total energy of a single laser pulse, produced a spark that was superior in its ability to provide sustained ignition of fuel-lean H 2 /air propellants. The results from these experiments are being used to optimize a dual pulse laser format for future subscale rocket chamber tests. Besides the ignition enhancement, the dual pulse technique provides a practical way to distribute and deliver laser light to the combustion chamber, an important consideration given the limitation of peak power that can be delivered through optical fibers. With this knowledge, scientists and engineers at Los Alamos National Laboratory and CFD Research Corporation have designed and fabricated a miniaturized, first-generation optical prototype of a laser ignition system that could be the basis for a laser ignition system for rocket applications. This prototype will be tested at MSFC in future subscale rocket ignition tests...|$|R
40|$|Green" {{propellants}} {{based on}} Ionic-liquids (ILs) like Ammonium DiNitramide and Hydroxyl Ammonium Nitrate {{have recently been}} developed as reduced-hazard replacements for hydrazine. Compared to hydrazine, ILs offer up to a 50 % improvement in available density-specific impulse. These materials present minimal vapor hazard at room temperature, and this property makes IL's potentially advantageous for "ride-share" launch opportunities where hazards introduced by hydrazine servicing are cost-prohibitive. Even though ILs present a reduced hazard compared to hydrazine, in crystalline form they are potentially explosive and are mixed in aqueous solutions to buffer against explosion. Unfortunately, the high water content makes IL-propellants difficult to ignite and currently a reliable "coldstart" capability does not exist. For reliable ignition, IL-propellants catalyst beds must be pre-heated to greater than 350 C before firing. The required preheat power source is substantial and presents a significant disadvantage for SmallSats where power budgets are extremely limited. Design and development of a "micro-hybrid" igniter designed {{to act as a}} "drop-in" replacement for existing IL catalyst beds is presented. The design requires significantly lower input energy and offers a smaller overall form factor.

40|$|Hybrid rockets motors provide {{distinct}} safety advantages {{when compared}} to traditional liquid or solid propellant systems, due to the inherent stability and relative inertness of the propellants prior to established combustion. As {{a result of this}} inherent propellant stability, hybrid motors have historically proven dicult to ignite. State of the art hybrid igniter designs continue to require solid or liquid reactants distinct from the main propellants. These ignition methods however, reintroduce to the hybrid propulsion system the safety and complexity disadvantages associated with traditional liquid or solid propellants. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of a novel direct electrostatic arc ignition method for hybrid motors. A series of small prototype stand-alone thrusters demonstrating this technology were successfully designed and tested using Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic and Gaseous Oxygen (GOX) as propellants. Measurements of input voltage and current demonstrated that arc-ignition will occur using as little as 10 watts peak power and less than 5 joules total energy. The motor developed for the stand-alone small thruster was adapted as a gas generator to ignite a medium-scale hybrid rocket motor using nitrous oxide /and HTPB as propellants. Multiple consecutive ignitions were performed. A large data set as well as a collection of development 2 ̆ 7 lessons learned 2 ̆ 7 were compiled to guide future development and research.

40|$|The Space Launch System (SLS) Vehicle {{consists}} of a Core Stage with four RS- 25 engines and two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs). This vehicle is launched from the Launchpad using a Mobile Launcher (ML) which supports the SLS vehicle until its liftoff from the ML under its own power. The combination of the four RS- 25 engines and two SRBs generate a significant Ignition Over-Pressure (IOP) and Acoustic Sound environment. One of the mitigations of these environments is the Ignition Over-Pressure/Sound Suppression (IOP/SS) subsystem installed on the ML. This system {{consists of}} six water nozzles located parallel to and 24 inches downstream of each SRB nozzle exit plane as well as 16 water nozzles located parallel to and 53 inches downstream of the RS- 25 nozzle exit plane. During launch of the SLS vehicle, water is ejected through each water nozzle to reduce {{the intensity of the}} transient pressure environment imposed upon the SLS vehicle. While required for the mitigation of the transient pressure environment on the SLS vehicle, the IOP/SS subsystem interacts (possibly adversely) with other systems located on the Launch Pad. One of the other systems that the IOP/SS water is anticipated to interact with is the Hydrogen Burn-Off <b>Igniter</b> <b>System</b> (HBOI). The HBOI system's purpose is to ignite the unburned hydrogen/air mixture that develops in and around the nozzle of the RS- 25 engines during engine start. Due to the close proximity of the water system to the HBOI system, the presence of the IOP/SS may degrade the effectiveness of the HBOI system. Another system that the IOP/SS water may interact with adversely is the RS- 25 engine nozzles and the SRB nozzles. The adverse interaction anticipated is the wetting, to a significant degree, of the RS- 25 nozzles resulting in substantial weight of ice forming and water present to a significant degree upstream of the SRB nozzle exit plane inside the nozzle itself, posing significant additional blockage of the effluent that exits the nozzle upon motor start leading to detrimental effects. The purpose of the CFD simulations were to i) characterize the location of the IOP/SS water after it is ejected from the IOP/SS nozzles, ii) characterize the interaction of the IOP/SS system with the HBOI system and iii) characterize the interaction of the IOP/SS water with the RS- 25 nozzles and the SRB nozzles...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAl/CuO {{energetic}} structure {{are attractive}} materials {{due to their}} high thermal output and propensity to produce gas. They are widely used to bond components or as next generation of MEMS <b>igniters.</b> In such <b>systems,</b> the reaction process is largely dominated by the outward migration of oxygen atoms from the CuO matrix toward the aluminum layers, and many recent studies have already demonstrated that the interfacial nanolayer between the two reactive layers {{plays a major role}} in the material properties.

The CuO/ZnO/Al foils generate 98 % of their theoretical enthalpy within a single reaction at 900 °C, whereas conventional ZnO-free CuO/Al foils produce only 78 % of their theoretical enthalpy, distributed over two distinct reaction steps at 550 °C and 850 °C. Combining high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry, we characterized the successive formation of a thin zinc aluminate (ZnAl 2 O 4) and zinc oxide interfacial layers, which act as an effective barrier layer against oxygen diffusion at low temperature...|$|R
50|$|E1Designated as Experiment 1 in {{the fall}} of 1940, the initial model {{consisting}} of four main components: fuel storage system, compressed gas storage <b>system,</b> <b>igniter,</b> and flame gun. The E1 had a single fuel tank vertical cylinder with two compartments, an upper and lower compartment. The upper compartment contained pressurized nitrogen that pushed the five gallons of fuel oil in the lower compartment through the barrel and into the flame gun. The fuel system for the E1 consisted of either diesel oil, fuel oil, or blends of gasoline and oil. An igniter, consisting of a compressed hydrogen cylinder and battery, was attached to the flame gun. The flame gun had two triggers, dispense fuel and ignition of fuel as it exited the metal barrel.Weighing in at 70 pounds when filled, the E1 was capable of ranges from fourteen to twenty-one yards. Issues - engineer board tests identified that the fuel-compressed gas reservoir was impractical, prone position firing was difficult, and as the E1 was firing, gas pressure decreased in the upper compartment tank lowering gas pressure to push the fuel in the lower compartment through the flame gun, thereby reducing weapon range. Additional issues were identified with the dependability, weight, and maneuverability of the E1 flame thrower system. E1R1The E1 was redesigned by the Chemical Warfare Service and labeled Experiment 1 Revision 1 and was ready for testing in March 1941. The compressed nitrogen was separated away from the fuel reservoir, a feature carried forward in all subsequent models. Additional improvements included the flame gun, valves, and ignition system. The E1R1's filled weight was reduced to 57 pounds and was capable of sustaining 15 to 20 yards for 15 to 20 seconds; the E1R1 weighed 28 pounds when empty. Issues - Weight, easily damaged parts, and access to the control valves were identified during testing as being problematic. M1Test board results {{led to the development of}} the M1 production model, consisting of a heavier weight, the M1 was more rugged and had a longer range as standardized for production in March 1942. The M1 system made it to the South Pacific theater by the end of the year. M1A1The invention of napalm led to its evaluation as a flamethrowing agent. Gasoline and oil mixtures sprayed as it left the barrel of the flame gun, whereas napalm thickened fuel left the barrel in a compact stream capable of ricocheting off of and into openings and subsequently sticking to flat surfaces. Initial tests showed that the current M1 platform was incapable of providing the ideal range with napalm. The Chemical Warfare Service was asked to adapt the napalm fuel system to the M1 platform to avoid procurement issues, thus facilitating the development of the M1A1 platform. Modifications included the fuel system, pressure regulator, valves, and the flame gun to facilitate the higher pressures required to achieve ideal ranges with the napalm. The M1A1 was capable of reliably firing to distances fifty yards away versus the M1's ideal firing range of twenty yards.|$|R
