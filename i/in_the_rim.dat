5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E

In addition to these weapons, many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off his senses {{and his ability to}} feel pain.|$|E
5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E

5|$|On April 17, 2014, Stanislaus National Forest {{issued an}} order closing the {{majority}} of the burn area to the public through November 18, 2014, citing safety issues from potential falls of heavily burned trees, rock falls, and uneven ground. The decision was met with disappointment by morel mushroom hunters who had looked forward to extensive post-fire fruiting of this highly sought-after mushroom. The safety rationale was questioned, as Yosemite National Park, which largely prohibits mushroom collecting, had opened up the burn areas within its boundaries to the public earlier in the month. Some mushroom hunters stated that {{they would be willing to}} sign liability waivers in order to enter the area, but the Forest Service rejected this idea, stating they were ultimately responsible for the safety of those entering the area. Extensive harvesting of morels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rim</b> Fire area nevertheless took place in May 2014, in a few cases legally by special permit, but in most cases through illegal harvesting. The closure of the burn area was also criticized by the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors for, among other reasons, causing the cancellation of grazing allotments by local ranchers.|$|E

25|$|Basket interference, or goaltending is a {{violation}} charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot. This violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket, unless {{it is obvious that}} the ball has no chance of entering the basket, if a player touches the ball while it is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> or in the area extended upwards from the basket, or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot.

25|$|On the {{initiative}} of the municipality of Linkebeek, the Constitutional Court of Belgium was asked for an opinion on the constitutionality of article 23 {{of the law of}} 18 July 1966 that stipulates that the internal language of administration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> municipalities has to be Dutch. In its ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998, the Court ruled this was not in violation with articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution of Belgium and that the mayor and aldermen do indeed {{not have the right to}} speak in another language than Dutch during council meetings. The Court further specified that the language facilities do not alter the principle of Dutch unilingualism of the concerned municipalities and that the Constitution guarantees the primacy of Dutch.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the leading}} {{hypotheses}} for why ancient Mars was wetter than today is that a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere created a global greenhouse, that warmed the surface enough for liquid water to occur in large amounts. Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, {{to try to solve}} this question about what happened to Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in Nili Fossae in 2008. Soon thereafter, landed missions to Mars started identifying carbonates on the surface; the Phoenix Mars lander found between 3–5 wt% calcite (CaCO3) at its northern lowland landing site, while the MER Spirit rover identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16–34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. Later CRISM analyses identified carbonates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of Huygens crater which suggested that there could be extensive deposits of buried carbonates on Mars. However, a study by CRISM scientists estimated that all of the carbonate rock on Mars holds less that the present Martian atmosphere worth of carbon dioxide. They determined that if a dense ancient Martian atmosphere did exist, it is probably not trapped in the crust.|$|E

500|$|As for the Kinetoscope itself, {{there is}} a {{significant}} disagreement over the location of the shutter providing the crucial intermittent visibility effect. According to a report by inventor Herman Casler described as [...] "authoritative" [...] by Hendricks, who personally examined five of the six still-extant first-generation devices, [...] "Just above the film,...a shutter wheel having five spokes and a very small rectangular opening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> [...] directly over the film. An incandescent lamp...is placed below the film...and the light passes up through the film, shutter opening, and magnifying lens...to the eye of the observer placed at the opening {{in the top of the}} case." [...] Robinson, on the other hand, says the shutter—which he agrees has only a single slit—is positioned lower, [...] "between the lamp and film". The Casler–Hendricks description is supported by the diagrams of the Kinetoscope that accompany the 1891 patent application, in particular, diagram 2. A side view, it does not illustrate the shutter, but it shows the impossibility of it fitting between the lamp and the film without a major redesign and indicates a space that seems suitable for it between the film and the lens. Robinson's description, however, is supported by a photograph of a Kinetoscope interior that appears in Hendricks's own book.|$|E

40|$|A 50 : 50 {{blend of}} {{polystyrene}} (PS) and poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PnBMA) {{has been characterized}} with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) in Tapping Mode and with force-distance curves. The polymer solution has been spin-coated on a glass slide. PnBMA builds a uniform film on the glass substrate with a thickness of @ 200 nm. On top of it, the PS builds an approximately 100 nm thick film. The PS-film undergoes dewetting, leading {{to the formation of}} holes surrounded by about 2 µm large rims. In those regions of the sample, where the distance between the holes is larger than about 4 µm, light depressions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PS film can be observed. Topography, dissipated energy, adhesion, stiffness and elastic modulus have been measured on these three regions (PnBMA, PS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> and PS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depressions). The two polymers can be distinguished in all images, since PnBMA has a higher adhesion and a smaller stiffness than PS, and hence a higher dissipated energy. Moreover, <b>the</b> polystyrene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depressions shows a very high adhesion (approximately as high as PnBMA) and its stiffness is intermediate between that of PnBMA and that of PS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rims.</b> This is attributed to higher mobility of <b>the</b> PS chains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depressions, which are precursors of new holes...|$|R
