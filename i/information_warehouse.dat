The ultimate aim {{is to increase the}} market share in an omnichannel retail environment. The various formats face different challenges in their respective markets which are tackled individually. Product and brand innovation play a key role as well as intensifying of cooperation with strategic suppliers. Supporting this will be the marketing department whose spending will be increased. A further emphasis will be put on e-commerce activities which will be further expanded and refined in order to gain a substantial share in online revenue. Additionally, the company aims to expand in the markets where it is already a participant, particularly in the Benelux but also in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In France and Spain expansion is also expected whereas in Sweden this has been postponed to a later stage. Another emphasis is put on purchasing whose objectives include the improving of margins, developing the online range, optimising lead times, having fewer, yet more strategic, suppliers with fewer stock keeping units, developing additional ranges and creating the most possible synergies between the different formats. In order to ensure the implementation and execution of the strategy as well as delivering the defined results functions related to the back office are expected to focus on customer satisfaction and furthering professionalism and proactivity. Human resource management will {{play a key role in}} providing training opportunities, recruiting young talent and focussing on creating a customer-centred, high-performance KPI and team culture. Finance will evolve into business support function whereby the analysis capacity will be expanded by means including implementing a modern business <b>information</b> <b>warehouse</b> and applying function-specific dashboards. Logistics will focus on creating an optimal infrastructure which, for every country in Beter Bed is active in, will be optimised individually. The aim is to accelerate the supply chain. With regards to corporate social responsibility (CSR), the ambition of Beter Bed is “to further develop initiatives in the field of promoting the circular economy from within the sector and in dialogue with strategic suppliers.” ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{credit default swap}} (CDS) is a {{financial}} swap agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer (the creditor of the reference loan) {{in the event of}} a loan default (by the debtor) or other credit event. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS [...] "fee" [...] or [...] "spread") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults. It was invented by Blythe Masters from JP Morgan in 1994.In the event of default the buyer of the CDS receives compensation (usually the face value of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan. [...] However, anyone can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct insurable interest in the loan (these are called [...] "naked" [...] CDSs). If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a credit event auction; the payment received is usually substantially less than the face value of the loan.Credit default swaps have existed since the early 1990s, and increased in use after 2003. By the end of 2007, the outstanding CDS amount was $62.2 trillion, falling to $26.3 trillion by mid-year 2010 but reportedly $25.5 trillion in early 2012. CDSs are not traded on an exchange and there is no required reporting of transactions to a government agency. During the 2007-2010 financial crisis the lack of transparency in this large market became a concern to regulators as it could pose a systemic risk. In March 2010, the DTCC Trade <b>Information</b> <b>Warehouse</b> (see Sources of Market Data) announced it would give regulators greater access to its credit default swaps database.CDS data can be used by financial professionals, regulators, and the media to monitor how the market views credit risk of any entity on which a CDS is available, which can be compared to that provided by credit rating agencies. U.S. courts may soon be following suit.Most CDSs are documented using standard forms drafted by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), although there are many variants. [...] In addition to the basic, single-name swaps, there are basket default swaps (BDSs), index CDSs, funded CDSs (also called credit-linked notes), as well as loan-only credit default swaps (LCDS). In addition to corporations and governments, the reference entity can include a special purpose vehicle issuing asset-backed securities.Some claim that derivatives such as CDS are potentially dangerous in that they combine priority in bankruptcy with a lack of transparency. A CDS can be unsecured (without collateral) and be at higher risk for a default.|$|E

Accordingly, {{there is some}} deferral between a business exchange and its appearance in the information stockroom. The latest information is caught in the operational sources where it is occupied for examination. For opportune choice making, today's business clients requests ever fresher information. Close continuous <b>information</b> <b>warehousing</b> addresses this test by shortening the information stockroom refreshment interims and thus, conveying source information to the information stockroom with lower idleness. One result is that information stockroom refreshment can never again be performed in o®-top hours just. Specifically, the source information may be changed simultaneously to information stockroom refreshment. In this paper we demonstrate that peculiarities may emerge under these circumstances prompting a conflicting condition of the information stockroom and we propose methodologies to maintain a strategic distance from refreshment oddities...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{management}} {{is one of}} the most critical tasks, which needs to be performed in manufacturing facility, since manufacturing consumes 1 / 3 of world’s energy. Same time, manufacturing facilities are equipped with large amounts of field devices, which generate vast amounts of information every second. With such a huge amount of real-time data, which has a potential to provide insight information for energy management needs, capturing, storing and processing of it becomes a challenge. In this thesis an <b>information</b> <b>warehouse</b> system supporting holistic energy {{management is}} designed and implemented. The main goal is to provide a system, which can capture, store and provide information relevant for energy management purposes in manufacturing facility. The thesis consists of three main parts. In the first part current and most relevant for energy management concepts and technologies, including Big Data, NoSQL, Service Oriented Architecture and Complex Event Processing, are explored, analyzed and compared. In the second part an architectural design of <b>information</b> <b>warehouse</b> is presented. During this step a set of tools and technologies is selected for implementation. In a third part, an <b>information</b> <b>warehouse</b> system is implemented and tested in a manufacturing line test-bed. Implemented <b>information</b> <b>warehouse</b> is based on multi-layered architectural pattern, where layers are communicating with each other via services. The most important advantage of this modular architecture is an ability to use implemented solution in any manufacturing facility, as modules can be easily reconfigured in order to adjust to different context.
