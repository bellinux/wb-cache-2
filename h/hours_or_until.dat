25|$|Members of {{the species}} have been {{observed}} to use their bodies to fill potholes in the pathway between the nest and prey. By filling these obstacles, the ants greatly increase the overall prey-laden traffic back to the nest. Each ant will walk to a hole and measure itself {{to see if it}} fits; if it does, it will lie across the hole motionless to allow other members of the colony to cross at a higher speed. If it does not fit, it will continue past the hole and allow another ant to check. Ants will also cooperate, with multiple ants forming a plug, if one ant is too small for the hole. Once in place in a hole, the ant(s) can stay there for many <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> it is dark and the traffic flow has diminished greatly, at which point they will return to the nest. This behavior most likely formed among members of the Eciton burchelli species because of its evolutionary advantage. An increase in trail speed and efficiency leads to a larger daily prey intake by the colony. This raises the colony's collective fitness, allowing for faster reproduction.|$|E

60|$|The {{efforts to}} restore {{breathing}} must be commenced immediately and energetically, and persevered in {{for one or}} two <b>hours,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> a medical man has pronounced that life is extinct. Efforts to promote warmth and circulation beyond removing the wet clothes and drying the skin must not be made until the first appearance of natural breathing.

25|$|Panic {{disorder}} sufferers {{usually have}} a series of intense episodes of extreme anxiety during panic attacks. These attacks typically last about ten minutes, and can be as short-lived as 1–5 minutes, but can last twenty minutes to more than an <b>hour,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> helpful intervention is made. Panic attacks can wax and wane for a period of hours (panic attacks rolling into one another), and the intensity and specific symptoms of panic may vary over the duration.|$|R
50|$|Electrodes {{last about}} two <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> {{the power is}} cut. A classic Yablochkov candle cannot be relit, since the fuse wire between the {{electrodes}} has been consumed. Later versions of the candle, however, included powdered metal in the inert separator. This would act as a new fuse wire, allowing a half-burnt candle to be restarted once extinguished.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "picnic ham" [...] {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} the cured and smoked primal pork shoulder, which is cut from the lower portion of a hog's foreleg still containing the arm and shank bones.

50|$|Suet pastry {{is used to}} line a bowl {{into which}} the steak and kidney mix is placed with onions, stock etc. A suet pastry lid is then placed on top and sealed tightly. The top is then covered with muslin cloth which is tied round the bowl. This is placed in a covered {{saucepan}} and steamed for about four <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the pudding is cooked. Some recipes then stipulate making a small opening in the top and pouring rich stock into the pudding ten minutes before serving.|$|E
5000|$|Spray-applied {{cellulose}} is {{used for}} applying cellulose to new wall construction. The differences are the addition of water to the cellulose while spraying as well as adding some kind of moisture retardant such as chlorine [...] to prevent mold cultures. In some cases the insulation might also mix {{in a very small}} percentage of adhesive or activate a dry adhesive present in the cellulose. Wet-spray allows application without the need for a temporary retainer. In addition, wet-spray allows for an even better seal of the insulated cavity against air infiltration and eliminates settling problems. Wet-spray installation requires that the wall be allowed to dry for a minimum of 24 <b>hours</b> (<b>or</b> <b>until</b> maximum of 25% moisture is reached) before being covered.|$|E

50|$|Sample sale {{websites}} are a {{new trend}} expanding upon the popular brick-and-mortar (B&M) sample sales that often occur in New York, Los Angeles, and other prominent locations. Sample sale sites are usually invite-only websites that receive the opportunity to sell certain products from top labels in the fashion industry (often these items are from previous seasons, but just as often they are current products) at a heavily discounted rate. Each sample sale tends to run for about 24 to 48 <b>hours,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> sold out; since inventory is often limited and some sites are extremely popular, some items on some sites will sell out {{in a matter of}} minutes or even seconds. Sometimes these sites place their orders for the number of products they would like ahead of time, sometimes they place their orders after receiving the customers' orders (in the latter case, shipping to you will take longer). The popularity of these sites has exploded in recent months such that many of the sites have expanded beyond fashion labels to household items, wines, and even travel. Comparatively speaking, the prices and selection are typically better than department store discount stores.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{bridge was}} built in 1903. Chittenden {{describes}} the process in his 1915 history of Yellowstone: The Arch Bridge over the Yellowstone. Until 1903 there was no bridge across the Yellowstone {{in the vicinity of}} the Falls and the right bank of the Grand Canyon was practically inaccessible to the public. As some of the finest views were to be had from that side (Artist Point, for example, which Moran chose for his painting), it was considered desirable to provide means of getting across. This section of the river, immediately above the Upper Palls, presented numerous sites on which an ordinary bridge could be built at no great cost; but the remarkable scenic attractions of the rapids made any ordinary structure seem out of place. Accordingly it was decided to build something worthy of the situation and a single arch of slender profile was selected as the type of structure. The exact form was a matter of careful study in order to get the lines which would appeal to the eye as meeting the artistic requirements. The span of the bridge is 120 feet and the rise of the arch is 15 feet. The height of the roadway at the center is 43 feet above low water in the river. The abutments are natural rock. The arch contains ten steel girders, which give it great strength. The body of the structure is solid concrete. The forms for the ornamental railing were manufactured in St. Paul, but the railing itself was molded in rich Portland cement mortar in place. The most difficult feature of the work, and the only one involving serious risk, was the building of the false work to support the forms for the concrete while in plastic condition. It was necessary to build a temporary pier in the center of the stream in the swiftest part of the rapids with the Upper Falls of the Yellowstone only a little way below. There would be small chance of escape for any one falling into the stream; but the chance was taken by one man who fell from the work, but, providentially, was caught in an eddy a little way below the bridge site and carried into shallow water near the bank. The concrete work, contrary to usual practice at that time with such large masses, was placed in one continuous operation. This would have been simple enough with a mechanical mixer, but was much more difficult where the mixing was done by hand. Elaborate preparations were made. All the material—gravel, broken rock, sand, cement—was gathered and distributed at convenient points about the site. A date was chosen in full moon in August and a temporary electric lighting plant was installed. A force of 150 men was assembled from the various road crews and divided into three shifts. When all was ready, the concrete mixing was begun and continued without intermission in 8-hour shifts for 74 <b>hours,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the work was complete. Hiram M.
