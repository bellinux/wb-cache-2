50|$|<b>Interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> {{methods are}} often {{referred}} to as tempering, although the processes are very different from traditional tempering. These methods consist of quenching to a specific temperature that is above the martensite start (Ms) temperature, and then holding at that temperature for extended amounts of time. Depending on the temperature and the amount of time, this allows either pure bainite to form, or holds-off forming the martensite until much of the internal stresses relax. These methods are known as austempering and martempering.|$|E
50|$|In the {{martempering}} process, austenitized {{metal part}} is {{immersed in a}} bath at a temperature just above the martensite start temperature (Ms). By using <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching,</b> the cooling is stopped at a point above the martensite transformation region to ensure sufficient time for the center to cool to the same temperature as the surface. The metal part is then removed from the bath and cooled in air to room temperature to permit the austenite to transform to martensite. Martempering is a method by which the stresses and strains generated during the quenching of a steel component can be controlled.|$|E
5000|$|Martempering is {{also known}} as stepped {{quenching}} or <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching.</b> In this process, steel is heated above the upper critical point and then quenched in a salt bath kept at a temperature of 150-300° C. The workpiece is held at this temperature above (Ms) until the temperature becomes uniform throughout the cross-section of workpiece. After that it is cooled in air or oil to room temperature. The steel is then tempered. Martempering is a heat treatment for steel involving austenitisation followed by step quenching, at a rate fast enough to avoid the formation of ferrite, pearlite or bainite to a temperature slightly above the martensite start (Ms) point.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Vickers {{hardness}} time-temperature-properties (TTP) {{curve of}} aluminum alloy 7055 was evaluated by <b>interrupted</b> <b>quench</b> technique. The critical temperature range of TTP curve was determined from 210 ºC to 420 ºC with the nose temperature of 355 ºC. The hardness decreased rapidly with isothermal duration {{in the critical}} temperature range. The hardness of aluminum alloy 7055 was predicted by quench factor analysis using the TTP curve and cooling curves. The predicted hardness agreed reasonably well with the measured results. The influence of time step and summation temperature range on the predicted results was studied. The cooling rate through the critical temperature range had dominant influence on the final hardness of the alloy...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{analysis}} and <b>interrupted</b> <b>quench</b> experiments {{have been carried}} out to study the formation of beta-FeSiAl 5 and (Be-Fe) -BeSiFe 2 Al 8 phases in Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg alloy with and without Be addition. In the base alloy with 0. 6 % Fe (without Be addition), a needle- and plate-shaped beta-phase is present in the interdendritic regions and is formed by a ternary eutectic reaction. In the Be- added alloy with 0. 6 % Fe, a Be-Fe phase of Chinese script and polygon shapes grows along with the primary alpha-Al dendrites, leading to superior mechanical properties. It is proposed that this Be-Fe phase is formed by a peritectic reaction. Be addition has also resulted in some grain refinement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{properties}} and precipitation behavior of Cu-bearing steels have been investigated. The optical microscope and transition electron microscope {{were employed to}} study the influence of <b>interrupted</b> cooling and <b>quenching</b> temperature on the precipitation behavior. Also, the properties of samples with different quench processes were tested. The results show that when the steel is interruptedly cooled and quenched from 650 - 700 °C, with the quenching temperature increasing the volume fraction of martensite becomes larger and the hardness becomes higher. When the microstructure is ferrite the second-phase precipitates occurs and they are proved copper-rich particles. However there are no obvious precipitates in martensite. The copper-rich second phase forms by the way of inter-phase precipitatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is focused on {{analyzing}} {{the effect of the}} <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> followed by a partitioning process in a high carbon steel 0, 50 % C, 1, 50 % Mn, 0, 40 % Si, 2, 00 % Cr without significant contribution of Al. Thermal treatments were performed at laboratory scale in a quenching dilatometer Linseis R. I. T. A RL 78. The fractions of retained austenite were evaluated by scanning electron microscope. The temperature for the <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> phase was evaluated based on the Koistenen and Marburger equation (adapted to the 0, 50 % C steel) and the result highlights a correlation between the chosen different temperature of quenching and the fraction of retained austenite formed during the quenching step of the process...|$|E
40|$|The 5160 {{spring steel}} is mainly used to endure fatigue and since its Mf is below room temperature, {{retained}} austenite is usually present after conventional quenching, which is detrimental from a fatigue point of view. To {{reduce the amount}} of retained austenite, a partial decarburization was promoted (to increase the Ms and Mf, respectively) by austenitizing the steel at different temperatures and times in air, prior to performing an <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> in an accelerated media (brine) instead of the conventional oil quenching. The same quenching conditions with partial decarburization and without decarburization are compared. In addition, conventional oil quenching was performed as reference. Results showed that with a controlled partial decarburization, it is possible to increase the fatigue limit compared to the conditions without decarburization (both <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> and oil quenching). Fatigue experiments were carried out in a rotating bending fatigue type tester. Cooling curves, decarburization profiles, fraction of martensite plots, and fatigue data are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Generally the {{residual}} stresses {{of the surface}} hardened steel are {{higher than that of}} the ordinary quenching steel, consequently the surface hardened steel is usually tempered at low temperature for the purpose of stress relief, but the amount of {{the residual}} stress is not decreased remarkably by the tempering at low temperature, subsequently the various types of the <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> methods are applied to the induction surface hardening for the purpose of stress relief...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} tests, {{performed}} {{to determine the}} strain necessary to initiate intergranular cracking in Inconel 718 {{as a function of}} temperature, contained enough scatter near the melting temperature that questions remained as to the best curve of curves to fit to the data. Fracture surface analysis showed that the scatter was due to incipient melting in the grain boundary region. The melting contributed to low fracture strain but had only a small on the incipient cracking strain. Gleeble tests, which could be <b>interrupted</b> by water <b>quenching,</b> were used to study the incipient intergranular melting of Inconel 718. This modified weld simulation test provided a sufficiently rapid quench to preserve the intergranular microstructure created during incipient melting. This structure was studied both microscopically and with energy dispensive X-ray analysis. The implications of incipient melting and low-strain incipient cracking on the development of microfissuring envelopes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen and {{hydrogen}} distributions are key elements influencing the residual ductility of zirconium-based {{nuclear fuel cladding}} during the quench phase following a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA). During the high temperature oxidation, a complex partitioning of the alloying elements is observed. A finite-difference code for solving the oxygen diffusion equations has been developed by Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire to predict the oxygen profile within the samples. The comparison between the calculations and the experimental results in the mixed α+β region shows that the oxygen diffusion is not accurately predicted by the existing modeling. This work aims at determining the key parameters controlling the average oxygen profile within the sample in the two-phase regions at 1200 [*]°C. High temperature steam oxidation tests <b>interrupted</b> by water <b>quench</b> were performed using pre-hydrided Zircaloy- 4 samples. Experimental oxygen distribution was measured by Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA). The phase distributions within the cladding thickness, was measured using image analysis to determine the radial profile of α(O) phase fraction. It is further demonstrated and experimentally checked that the α-phase fraction in these regions follows a diffusion-like radial profile. A new phase fraction modeling is then proposed in the cladding metallic part during steam oxidation. The modeling results are compared to a large set of experiments including the influence of exposure duration {{and hydrogen}} content. Another key outcome from this modeling is that oxygen average profile is straightforward derived from the proposed modeling...|$|R

Here {{we examine the}} dissolution of niobium carbide precipitates present in the cast slabs, {{as a function of}} the temperature during heating at a typical rate. The initial condition of precipitates in slab is quantified with   transmission electron microscope. Kinetic simulations and <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> experiments indicate that the precipitates persist well beyond the equilibrium dissolution temperature. The coarsening of the precipitates during heating, as opposed to a general lowering in the mean size due to dissolution, occurs only at heating rates some two orders of magnitude slower than typical...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The novel non-equilibrium heat {{treatment}} procedure known as Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P) may offer {{the prospect of}} higher strength steel products with enhanced formability based upon martensitic microstructures containing controlled quantities of carbon-enriched retained austenite. The Q&P process requires an interrupted quench and isothermal annealing (partitioning) step at intermediate temperatures, whereby untransformed austenite can be thermodynamically stabilised by carbon migration from supersaturated martensite regions. The concept is comparable to that producing carbide-free bainite, for example, in TRIP-assisted steel, although Q&P allows separation of the ferrite formation and austenite enrichment stages of the process. However, although the Q&P concept is readily understood, evolution of the microstructure during <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> and partitioning has been inferred indirectly from dilatometer studies and metallographic examination after final quenching to room temperature. Consequently, a model alloy was developed in which the sequential steps of {{heat treatment}} could be separated for direct inspection by conventional metallography, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction techniques...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{transformation}} sequence and solidification behaviour of an Al- 13 Mg- 7 Si- 2 Cu in-situ composite was examined {{using a combination}} of computer-aided cooling curve thermal analysis and <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> techniques. Five different phases were identified by analysing the derivative cooling curves, the X-ray diffraction profile, optical and scanning electron microscopy images and the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy. It has been found that the solidification of this alloy begins with primary Mg 2 Si precipitation and continues with the formation of eutectic Al-Mg 2 Si, followed by Al 5 FeSi and simultaneous precipitation of Al 5 Cu 2 Mg 8 Si 6 and Al 2 Cu complex intermetallic phases. The formation of the last three intermetallic compounds changes the solidification behaviour of these composites remarkably due to their complex eutectic formation reactions. The solidification of the alloy, calculated using the Factsage thermochemical analysis software, has demonstrated a good agreement with the experiments in terms of compound prediction, their weight fractions and reaction temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Time-temperature-precipitation (TTP) {{diagrams}} deliver important material data, such as {{temperature and}} time ranges critical for precipitation during the quenching {{step of the}} age hardening procedure. Although the quenching step is continuous, isothermal TTP diagrams are often applied. Together with a so-called Quench Factor Analysis, {{they can be used}} to describe very different cooling paths. Typically, these diagrams are constructed based on mechanical properties or microstructures after an <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching,</b> i. e., ex situ analyses. In recent years, an in situ calorimetric method to record continuous cooling precipitation diagrams of aluminum alloys has been developed to the application level by our group. This method has now been transferred to isothermal experiments, in which the whole heat treatment cycle was performed in a differential scanning calorimeter. The Al-Mg-Si-wrought alloy 6005 A was investigated. Solution annealing at 540 °C and overcritical quenching to several temperatures between 450 °C and 250 °C were followed by isothermal soaking. Based on the heat flow curves during isothermal soaking, TTP diagrams were determined. An appropriate evaluation method has been developed. It was found that three different precipitation reactions in characteristic temperature intervals exist. Some of the low temperature reactions are not accessible in continuous cooling experiments and require isothermal studies...|$|E
40|$|Semisolid rheoforming (SSR) is a {{promising}} {{technology for the}} production of Mg wrought alloy in foundry settings. In order to realize SSR, it is necessary to characterize the grain structure evolution during slurry preparation. In this paper, slurry of AZ 31 alloy was produced by a novel rheocast process known as self-inoculation method (SIM). <b>Interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> technology was applied to investigate the primary α-Mg evolution during continuous cooling and isothermal holding. Results indicate that the initial microstructure of slurry produced by SIM is a mixture of irregular grains, which becomes ideally globular when the slurry slowly cools to 620 ℃ and isothermally held for at least 30 s. The local solute diffusion leads to dendritic fragmentation and forms separated particles. During prolonged holding, the particle surface gradually becomes smooth because of protuberance melting and groove advancement. Coarsening of α-Mg grains in isothermal holding was analyzed using Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory. Results suggest that coalescence is most likely the dominant coarsening mechanism in the early stage while Ostwald ripening tends to be the principal one later. The EDS results indicate that a longer holding time leads to Al solute element segregation at the grain boundaries, but Zn distribution within liquid matrix has no obvious change...|$|E
40|$|Medium {{and high}} carbon steels are usually {{quenched}} in polymer and oil {{in order to avoid}} cracking and distortion; however, recent studies have proved {{that it is possible to}} minimize cracking using water as a coolant of these steels by promoting extremely high cooling rates. By great agitation and velocity of quenchant, the vapor blanket is reduced or prevented during water quench, allowing uniform hardening of the surface. In this study, the cooling severity of a spray quenching system and a high-speed quenching chamber are studied. Cylindrical samples of AISI 304 stainless steel (20 mm in diameter and 100 mm length) were employed to characterize the cooling severity. Thermal data was acquired through K-type thermocouples placed in the sample at three positions, 1 mm below surface, mid-radius and at center of the specimen, connected to a data acquisition system. High thermal gradients were observed in both systems, being the high-speed chamber the severest cooling. The maximum cooling rate obtained at the surface was 470 and 300 °C/s for the high-speed chamber and the spray system, respectively. In addition, 5160 spring steel samples were quenched for short times in both systems; the cooling was interrupted to avoid through transformation and to produce a case-core type microstructure. Different cooling times were used for the <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> to modify the martensite case thickness. No cracks were observed. Thermal results and microstructures are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Martempering {{ductile iron}} (MDI) was {{produced}} {{through the use}} of salt-bath which is of high cost and non-users friendly because of the elevated temperature of the salt, high energy consumption during production, as well as the increased capital equipment cost for the bath and the equipment that operates it. This hinders the MDI production which becomes a big challenge and needs immediate urgent solution which is the rationale behinds this work. This research investigates the possible use of warm water for the interrupted or step quenching processes which is more users friendly and will minimize energy consumption that is {{associated with the use of}} salt-bath because of the elevated temperature of the salt as well as the increased capital equipment cost for the bath and the equipment that operates it. The evaluation of the suitability of warm water for <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> of ductile cast irons in the production of MDI was carried out. Ductile cast irons used were normalized at a temperature of 850 o C for 60 minutes. The normalized specimens were subsequently heat-treated in muffle furnace to a pre-determined temperature of 850 o C for 30 minutes, then step-quenched in warm water maintained at temperature of 80 o C for 40 seconds followed by tempering at different tempering temperatures (175 o C- 425 o C) and times (30 - 180 minutes).

40|$|AISI 5160 {{steel is}} used for the {{production}} of coil and leaf springs. Springs are usually oil-quenched and tempered. In this work, a brine solution is used as a quenchant. The brine promotes a more severe and uniform quenching. The severity of the quenching was analysed, and the heat transfer characteristics determined. A brine <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> was developed to produce a martensite case with a bainite core. The effect of various conditions after the interruption of the cooling is addressed. Tempering temperatures of 150, 250, 350, 450 and 550 °C were employed. In addition, a partial decarburisation was promoted in the samples prior to the quenching and tempering, this in order to modify the local martensite start temperature and promote the martensite transformation to take place at a higher temperature, while reducing the amount of retained austenite. To determine the fatigue properties of heat treatments, a rotating bending fatigue tester with constant deflection was developed. Fatigue results showed that the interrupted brine quenching with partial decarburisation has a higher fatigue limit that the case with no decarburisation and also that the case of conventional oil quenching and tempering. Fractography and load data from experiments allowed to model the cracking stages. The model was useful to establish the presence of cracks and their length. It was found that when a martensite case and a pearlite core was produced, nucleation was retarded up to 5 times, however after a crack nucleates it propagates much rapid than in bainite...|$|E
40|$|Iron is {{the most}} common and {{detrimental}} impurity in aluminum casting alloys and has long been associated with an increase in casting defects. While the negative effects of iron are clear, the mechanism involved is not fully understood. It is generally believed {{to be associated with the}} formation of Fe-rich intermetallic phases. Many factors, including alloy composition, melt superheating, Sr modification, cooling, rate, and oxide bifilms, could play a role. In the present investigation, the interactions between iron and each individual element commonly present in aluminum casting alloys, were investigated using a combination of thermal analysis and <b>interrupted</b> <b>quenching</b> tests. The Fe-rich intermetallic phases were characterized using optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and the results were compared with the predictions by Thermocalc. It was found that increasing the iron content changes the precipitation sequence of the beta phase, leading to the precipitation of coarse binary beta platelets at a higher temperature. In contrast, manganese, silicon, and strontium appear to suppress the coarse binary beta platelets, and Mn further promotes the formation of a more compact and less harmful a phase. They are therefore expected to reduce the negative effects of the phase. While reported in the literature, no effect of P on the amount of beta platelets was observed. Finally, attempts are made to correlate the Fe-rich intermetallic phases to the formation of casting defects. The role of the beta phase as a nucleation site for eutectic Si and the role of the oxide bifilms and AIP as a heterogeneous substrate of Fe intermetallics are also discussed...|$|E
