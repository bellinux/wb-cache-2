We focused our work on the characterization of events occurring on SpO 2 signal, this signal being used to detect vital problems. Our aim was to recognize events related to technical or vital problems to assist medical staff in his decision process. Our results show that both methods are able to detect and distinguish between probe <b>deconnection,</b> transient hypoxia and desaturation events...|$|E
40|$|A {{tax system}} is an {{arbitrage}} between desirable properties, {{three of them}} especially in the Musgrave tradition, efficiency, equity and stability. Although, in the past,national legislators could make such an arbitrage independently, now it is strongly influenced by globalisation and fiscal interdependencies, reinforced by European integration. Therefore {{we focus on the}} possible distance, for some types of income,between the area of mobility of the income and that of sovereignty of the jurisdiction of residence of his beneficiary. On that basis we review existing tax designs and issue some suggestions for the future. Ce texte examine l'implication pour la fiscalité de la <b>déconnection</b> entre l'espace de souveraineté des Etats et l'aire de mobilité des bases imposables.

These changes result in a fundamental modification of flowing conditions during floods and connections between channel and floodplain ecosystems. Within the framework of compensatory measures, the CNR (Compagnie Nationale du Rhône, i. e. the Rhône River manager) wants {{to carry out a}} restoration project along the downstream reach of the Rhône River (southern France, 100 km length upstream from the mouth). The ambition is to combine both a decrease in local flood risk (by enlarging flood-carrying capacity) and an enhancement of geomorphological and ecological properties of the margins into the reach (sediment reworking, pioneer species regeneration…). The Rhône River is a good case study for complex and deeply altered systems. Indeed, important issues have to be integrated: (i) flood risk for the major city along the reach (Arles), (ii) bank erosion control near cultivated areas, (iii) former channels loss of diversity due to terrestrialisation processes and floodplain forest <b>deconnection</b> because of the channel degradation, (iv) pollution risk if polluted sediments are reworked (contamination b...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{intraoperative}} angioscopy, {{till now}} utilized exclusively in arterial surgery, is now used also in venous surgery. From January 1992 54 patients underwent to video-guided venous surgery: 23 cases of external valvuloplasty of the sapheno-femoral junction (EV-SFJ), 25 cases of hemodynamic correction of varicose veins (French acronyms CHIVA), 5 cases of high ligation plus long saphenous vein intraoperative sclerotherapy (HL-IS) 1 case of sub-fascial perforators interruption (SPI), the only extraluminal videoguided procedure. We have used 3 different video-angioscopes: a 1 mm monofibroscopy let in a 6 Fr Fogarty catheter, a disposable 2, 8 mm colangioscope and a 2, 2 mm operative angioscope. For the perforators interruption we have utilised the thoracoscope. EV-SFJ: the angioscopy has confirmed {{the presence of}} normal valvular cusps in a dilated vein wall in 21 cases, so excluding 2 patients from the planned treatment. At {{the end of the}} operation the angioscope has verified the reapproach of valvular cusps. CHIVA: the angioscopy has allowed to identify the exact points of the superficial venous system which should be interrupted, according to the Franceschi's theory. This procedure can avoid the technical errors due to intraoperatory misleadings of the duplex mapping. HL-IS: consists of a classic high ligation followed by long saphenous vein intraoperative sclerotherapy. The angioscopy has allowed a complete <b>deconnection</b> of the long saphenous vein from tributaries and perforators. Furthermore has facilitate the proportional distribution of the sclerosing agent along the long saphenous vein. SPI: the videoassistance have permitted the identification of the insufficient perforating veins reducing their surgical exposures...|$|E

40|$|During patient {{studies with}} the Technegas {{equipment}} in our department, we regularly detected small to considerable contaminations of the operator {{and in the}} area surrounding the apparatus. These contaminations {{were found to be}} of different origin: residual activity in the tubing from the apparatus to the patient which diffuses after <b>deconnection,</b> residual activity and small particles of the destroyed carbon crucible in the apparatus which are dispersed during opening of the door of the gas preparation chamber, leakage at the patient site during studies in uncooperative patients and a dysfunctioning valve inside the apparatus. To reduce the contamination risks, we made some adaptations to the apparatus. In the first place, the dysfunctioning valve was replaced. In addition, a powerful air exhaust pump with an efficient filter was installed. It was connected with (1) a newly installed transparent box {{in front of the door}} of the gas preparation chamber, (2) a dome on a flexible arm which can be positioned above the patient's face during the examination and (3) a nipple on which the mouthpiece can be placed after the study. After these adaptations, a study showed the absence of measurable contamination on the clothing of the personnel handling the apparatus. Occasionally, considerable contamination was still measured on the gloves worn during filling of the carbon boat with generator eluate, but only small contaminations (up to 9. 25 kBq) were measured on the mouthmask worn by the operator during administration of the Technegas. This results in a maximum effective dose equivalent from activity deposited in the lungs of 0. 008 microSv per study. The total body dose of the operator from external radiation for one Technegas examination was determined to be 2 microSv. The highest dose rate was measured during filling of the crucible (0. 2 mSv/h). status: publishe...|$|E

Given the gravity of CVCIs in HD patients using catheter access, precise, safe installation of the device, and good nursing technique are crucial. Aim: To assess and compare safety performance and complications of a Y-connection (n= 133) versus the usual tunneled central venous catheter (CVC) technique (n= 73) among HD patients and then explore preferences between techniques among patients and frontline HD nurses. Materials and methods: A prospective, comparative, 3 -month point prevalence survey was conducted among HD outpatients and frontline HD nurses in a 600 -bed teaching hospital in the canton of Valais. Results: Nine HD outpatients (average age, 68. 3 years; SD= 12. 3) were recruited. The two techniques showed no differences in C-reactive protein levels (p= 0. 465), pain (p= 1. 00), or local complications due to dressings soiled by exudate at the catheter insert point (p= 0. 066). The relative risk ratio (RR) indicated that CVCI was 1. 667 times (95 % CI; 0. 437, 6. 358, p= 0. 50) more likely with a Y-connection. Neither the Y-connection technique (RR 1. 63; [95 % CI; 0. 554, 4. 790]; p= 0. 32) nor usual CVC technique (RR 0. 58; [95 % CI; 0. 277, 1. 217]; p= 0. 13) were significant relative risk factors for complications. Fifty-seven percent of HD patients stated that they felt more secure and comfortable using the Y-connection technique than the usual care technique. Eleven of the 12 nurses involved preferred the Y-connection technique, feeling that is was safer and easier in use. Conclusion: No difference {{was found in the}} complication rates of two blood restitution techniques – the Y-connection versus the usual CVC technique. HD outpatients and nurses preferred the Y-connection for blood restitution.
