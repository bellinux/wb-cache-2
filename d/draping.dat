40|$|<b>Drape</b> is {{a unique}} {{property}} that allows a fabric to be bent {{in more than one}} direction with double curvature. For many years, researchers studied fabric <b>drape</b> in order to evaluate the aesthetic performance of finished garments. However, the behaviour of fabric <b>drape</b> may not be same as the behaviour of garment <b>drape</b> stand on the same object by visually observation. Such difference would affect the prediction of garment <b>drape</b> based on fabric <b>drape.</b> At present, the study of the difference between the behaviour of fabric <b>drape</b> and garment <b>drape</b> is very limited. This study aims to examine the difference of the behaviour of fabric <b>drape</b> and garment <b>drape</b> through <b>drape</b> coefficient analysis and <b>drape</b> profile analysis. The effects of fabric mechanical properties on fabric <b>drape</b> and garment <b>drape</b> are also investigated experimentally.

40|$|<b>Drape</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors influencing the aesthetics and functionality of fabrics. Therefore, investigation into <b>drape</b> parameters is important for analysing its behaviour. <b>Drape</b> parameters were investigated from different aspects using the Cusick <b>Drape</b> meter and Image Analyser. Firstly, the influence of time on the <b>drape</b> coefficient and number of folds was studied over 24 hours. Usually, <b>drape</b> is considered as a static, time-independent problem. However, this investigation shows that the <b>drape</b> coefficient of a fabric changes si-gnificantly over a longer time period. Furthermore, the comparison of <b>drape</b> parameters is shown using samples with two different diameters. The larger samples have smaller <b>drape</b> coefficient than those with smaller diameters, and their <b>drape</b> is less changeable over time. Basically, the three-dimensional fabric <b>drape</b> is not an independent fabric property, there-fore, the connection between bending rigidity and drapecoefficient was studied. The last aspect of this investigation was the repeatability of <b>drape</b> measurements, and the establish-ment of the required number of measurements for <b>drape</b> coefficient and fold numbers...|$|R

40|$|Methods and {{technologies}} that provide effective 3 D representation of <b>drape</b> could bridge {{both physical and}} communication barriers in the textile and apparel supply chain.

A framework integrating different segments of this research was also built. Current methods and procedures used in evaluating <b>drape</b> for fabrics were studied from the published literature. An improved digital technique was developed to capture and eval-uate fabric <b>drape,</b> and a complex set of metrics needed to discriminate <b>drape</b> configuration in 3 D was devised. <b>Drape</b> variability for fabrics having varied mechanical properties was investigated, and a method of measuring <b>drape</b> by three dimensional scanning of <b>draped</b> fabric specimens was established.

40|$|<b>Drape</b> of {{the fabric}} {{is its ability to}} hang freely in graceful folds when some area of it is {{supported}} over a surface and the rest is unsupported. <b>Drape</b> is a unique property that allows a fabric to be bent in more than in one direction, When two-dimensional fabric are converted to three-dimensional garment form. In the present study, the effects of sewing of different seam were selected on different fabric and their behaviors were studied. In this study <b>drape</b> of ten fabrics are analyzed with three types of seams and three stitch densities. Sample without seam is a control sample and <b>drape</b> of seamed samples are compared with control sample to analyse the <b>drape</b> behavior of seamed fabrics. This paper presents a fundamental <b>drape</b> analysis of seamed fabrics using <b>drape</b> meter. <b>Drape</b> behavior is determined in terms of <b>drape</b> coefficient.

The <b>drape</b> coefficient is the widely used parameter to describe fabric <b>drape</b> but it needs other parameters to explain the fabric behavior. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between the fabric <b>drape</b> parameters such as <b>drape</b> coefficient, <b>drape</b> distance ratio, fold depth index, amplitude and number of nodes and low stress mechanical properties. <b>Drape</b> parameters were tested on a specially developed instrument based on a digital image processing technique and the low stress mechanical properties were tested by the Kawabata evaluation system. Then the <b>drape</b> parameters were predicted by constructing models using multiple regressions method and feed-forward back-propagation neural network technique. Simple equations are derived using regressions method to predict the five shape parameters of <b>drape</b> profile from the low stress mechanical properties.

5|$|Nelson's {{body was}} {{unloaded}} from the Victory at the Nore. It was conveyed upriver in Commander Grey's yacht Chatham to Greenwich {{and placed in}} a lead coffin, and that in another wooden one, made from the mast of L'Orient which had been salvaged after the Battle of the Nile. He lay in state in the Painted Hall at Greenwich for three days, before being taken upriver aboard a barge, accompanied by Lord Hood, chief mourner Sir Peter Parker, and the Prince of Wales. The Prince of Wales at first announced his intention of attending the funeral as chief mourner, but later attended in a private capacity with his brothers when his father George III reminded him that it was against protocol for the Heir to the Throne to attend the funerals of anyone except members of the Royal Family. The coffin was taken into the Admiralty for the night, attended by Nelson's chaplain, Alexander Scott. The next day, 9 January, a funeral procession consisting of 32 admirals, over a hundred captains, and an escort of 10,000 soldiers took the coffin from the Admiralty to St Paul's Cathedral. After a four-hour service he was interred in the crypt within a sarcophagus originally carved for Cardinal Wolsey. The sailors charged with folding the flag <b>draping</b> Nelson's coffin and placing it in the grave instead tore it into fragments, with each taking a piece as a memento.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of the <b>drape</b> properties of fabrics on final garment appearance and fit has been long understood {{and a great deal}} of research has been carried out in this area.

In this study, the conventional method of measuring fabric <b>drape</b> was compared with garment <b>drape</b> measurement using an alternative <b>drape</b> measurement system based on an image analysis technique. Garment <b>drape</b> was investigated using dresses suspended on a mannequin. A garment chosen was a shift dress because of its relatively uncomplicated style and shape.

A graphical user interface was developed to carry out the image analysis and to calculate <b>drape</b> values identifying and determining 23 <b>drape</b> parameters. A range of fabrics including conventional (knitted, woven) and nonwoven fabrics were compared in terms of FAST properties, <b>drape</b> coefficient and <b>drape</b> values. Some nonwoven fabrics were found to give similar performance to some conventional fabrics and better than others.
