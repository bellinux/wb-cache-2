500|$|In an {{interview}} with Architectural Digest, production designer Stuart Craig remarked on creating sets for Part2. Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, [...] "our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That {{was part of the}} fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble." [...] About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, [...] "We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Jan Delasara, one of {{the major}} themes of [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] is the {{exploration}} of [...] "irresistible physical drives." [...] In Betts' case, his desire to kill is due to a biological need, not a malevolent desire to murder. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff, in his review of the episode, wrote that [...] "It also <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> Leonard's such an understandably human monster. On some level, he just wants to survive, and he's not happy about {{what he has to do}} to be able to survive." [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] serves as the first story in a multi-season story-arc that features Agent Scully being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Richard Edwards, in the chapter [...] "Some Philosophical Reflections on 'Trust No One'" [...] of their book The Philosophy of The X-Files, argue that Scully withholding the knowledge of her cancer from Mulder is an example of psychological egoism in a protagonist. They reason that by not telling her partner, she is withholding the information in an act of self-interest.|$|E
500|$|Both {{episodes of}} [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly described them as [...] "nearly perfect", calling them {{the two best}} episodes of the season so far: [...] " [...] nailed the characterizations, the interactions, the tossed-off one-liners, the weird-yet-realistic scenarios...I wonder how much it <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> she's out on the acting floor every day, getting attuned to her costars' rhythms?" [...] Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said the first [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] episode was his favorite episode of the fifth season so far, which he said provided several laugh-out-loud moments and a poignancy with Michael's decision to find Holly. McAuliffe described the second episode as a [...] "satisfying wrap-up" [...] and said Michael's outburst during the lecture was [...] "one of the most painful Michael meltdown moments in the show's history". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the first episode perfectly balanced drama and comedy. He particularly complimented the chemistry between both Carell and Fischer and between Krasinski and Wilson, {{and said he was}} particularly pleased to receive closure over the Karen character. But Sepinwall said the second episode felt padded with [...] "material I would have been fine seeing as deleted scenes". Although he said Carell's reaction to the news that Holly still has feelings for him as a [...] "wonderful performance", Sepinwall also said the subplot involving Angela's cat was particularly unfunny and that subplot with Jim and Dwight, [...] "so brilliant last week, ran out of steam quickly here." ...|$|E

500|$|Stankonia {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from contemporary}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 95, based on 20 reviews. Derek A. Bardowell of NME noted that with Stankonia, OutKast [...] "hit that rare balance of creative eccentricity and mass appeal" [...] and {{wrote that the}} album contains [...] "eternal qualities that will unravel in time on an emotional, intellectual and spiritual level." [...] Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone called the record [...] "one of the best albums of the year" [...] noting {{that all of the}} tracks contain [...] "a down-home generosity and accessibility" [...] and that [...] "even the most street-oriented songs have some sort of commentary in them." [...] Tony Green of The Village Voice praised OutKast's [...] "feel for sonics and structure" [...] and stated, [...] "they've moved toward harder, darker textures, in service of song designs that are often disarmingly subtle." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic commented that, [...] "given the variety of moods, it <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it's striking how few weak tracks there are". Aishah Hight of PopMatters stated, [...] "Within Stankonia, Outkast successfully presented a southern perspective of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But on the surface, phat beats and pure funk should suffice." [...] Alternative Press commented that [...] "experienced, acclaimed groups rarely make albums as bold and confrontational as Stankonia, because they have too much to lose", but felt that [...] "OutKast don't care", writing that they [...] "coalesced the political and societal challenges of hip hop's past into what is one of the genre's most artistically unorthodox releases so far." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, our {{dependence}} on fossilized skeletons also significantly limits our understanding of evolution. Only the parts of organisms that were already mineralized are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. It <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> exoskeletons often contain [...] "muscle scars", marks where muscles have been attached to the exoskeleton, which may allow the reconstruction of much of an organism's internal parts from its exoskeleton alone. The most significant limitation is that, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds of these phyla have never been found as fossils, because most animal species are soft-bodied and decay before they can become fossilized.|$|E
2500|$|Then Guardian {{features}} editor Ian Katz asserted in 2004 that [...] "it is {{no secret}} we are a centre-left newspaper". In 2008, Guardian columnist Jackie Ashley said that editorial contributors were a mix of [...] "right-of-centre libertarians, greens, Blairites, Brownites, Labourite but less enthusiastic Brownites, etc," [...] and that the newspaper was [...] "clearly left of centre and vaguely progressive". She also said that [...] "you can be absolutely certain that come the next general election, The Guardian stance will not be dictated by the editor, still less any foreign proprietor (it <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> there isn't one) but will {{be the result of}} vigorous debate within the paper". The paper's comment and opinion pages, though often written by centre-left contributors such as Polly Toynbee, have allowed some space for right-of-centre voices such as Sir Max Hastings and Michael Gove. Since an editorial in 2000, The Guardian has favoured abolition of the British monarchy. [...] "I write for the Guardian," [...] said Max Hastings in 2005, [...] "because it is read by the new establishment," [...] reflecting the paper's then-growing influence.|$|E

2500|$|Time {{magazine}} {{praised the}} series, saying [...] "Forget sleeping through this one--you won't {{even want to}} blink. 24 is the most distinctive, addictive new TV series this season. As an old-fashioned thriller, it's relentless, tense and deliciously paranoiac, with more twists than a Twizzler. But it's also boldly different. Most notably, there's its clever visual signature: picture-in-picture screens that show two, three and even four different scenes simultaneously." [...] Time also noted that [...] "The show takes {{to the next level}} the trend of serial story 'arcs', which began with '80s dramas like Hill Street Blues and Wiseguy and which continues on The West Wing and The Sopranos." [...] Time also praised the performances of Kiefer Sutherland and Dennis Haysbert, saying that [...] "It <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> there's a strong cast driving the train. Haysbert is commanding, if a tad underutilized in the pilot, as an idealist with a dangerous secret. And Sutherland plays the gravel-voiced Bauer with an assurance that belies his teen-movie-star past; his overstressed agent is stalwart but weary, a haunted spook." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ceremonials {{was named}} the best album of 2011 by Q {{magazine}}. Time magazine ranked it as the second best album of 2011, stating, [...] "Despite her penchant for emotive gloom, Welch's tales of heartache can be oddly uplifting; when she sings about darkness and demons, we know she will ultimately conquer them." [...] Entertainment Weekly, on its list of the 10 Best Albums of 2011, listed the album at number five and wrote, [...] "A big believer in Red Sea-parting melodrama, she's got the orchestral grandeur to pull it off. Of course, it <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> she attacks the harp {{as if she were}} wielding an ax." [...] Billboard placed it at number eight on its list of the 10 Best Albums of 2011, noting that [...] "Shake It Out" [...] and [...] "What the Water Gave Me" [...] "possess an anthemic quality, but they're far from the only epic moments on the rock-tinged record, which finds Welch channeling avant-pop luminaries like Annie Lennox and Kate Bush." [...] Slant Magazine included Ceremonials at number 22 on its list of The 25 Best Albums of 2011, commenting that the album is [...] "steeped in melodrama, with pump organs, choirs, and strings expertly deployed as pure pomp on already rousing singles like 'Shake It Out' and 'No Light, No Light.' But Welch is perfectly capable of doing delicate too, as evidenced by the gorgeously textured lead single 'What the Water Gave Me' and 'Never Let Me Go,' while tracks like [...] "Lover to Lover" [...] are reminiscent of the Eurythmics at their most soulful." [...] PopMatters ranked the album at number 25 on its list of The 75 Best Albums of 2011, calling it [...] "an expansive album, haunted by tragedy but boldly offering a comforting embrace in reply." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Lost Hero {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics and fans. Publishers Weekly gave The Lost Hero a favorable review, {{and stated that}} [...] "Riordan's storytelling is as polished as ever, brimming with wit, action, and heart". The novel received a mixed review from Vicky Smith of Kirkus Reviews, who wrote that the [...] "Greek-vs.-Roman tension tantalizes" [...] and that [...] "incidental details that bring the gods into the story often shine." [...] However, she also noted that there are [...] "far too many pages of stretched-out action, telling not showing and awkward dialogue" [...] and believed that only the die-hard fans would enjoy the book. She said that [...] "unless Riordan tightens things up considerably by number five, they may find themselves hoping {{that it does not}} end with a third Great Prophecy". The Seattle Times Karen Macpherson called the Greek and Roman mix [...] "fascinating" [...] and also said that the [...] "characters are interesting and well-developed, and the richly complex story has Riordan's trademark wry humor and nearly nonstop action". Kidsreads, on the other hand, gave a mixed review, stating [...] "I always learn something new whenever I read these books, and it certainly <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> I laugh along the way. You’re {{not going to want to}} miss this one!" [...] but also comments on the confusing plot line, commenting that [...] "This time, they cross over to Roman mythology, and the sometimes-blurred lines between the two cultures are examined in closer detail." [...] The book also received a positive review from The Epoch Times, which said [...] "If anyone was afraid that Riordan couldn’t top his Percy Jackson series—they can quit worrying. This new series, even though in the same genre as the Percy Jackson group, has fresh ideas, more mystery and magic and keeps the reader engrossed from start to finish." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oxymoron {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 31 reviews. Randal Roberts {{writing for the}} Los Angeles Times stated, [...] "This is not an album to give your teenage kid without a companion conversation {{about the dangers of}} drugs. But after the disclaimer, sit down and wonder on the miraculous ways in which musical talent can germinate amid such a landscape and grow to create work filled with boundless promise." [...] Michael Madden of Consequence of Sound said, [...] "The moral of Oxymoron, though, is that Q couldn't have made a much better album being the rapper he is. It deserves the term [...] "rap opera" [...] more than most [...] "rock operas" [...] deserve theirs. It's something special, just like it was always planned to be." [...] Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone said, [...] "It <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> his voice is simply elastic – reminiscent at times of everything from Pusha T's steely grimace to T.I.'s effortless assonance to Eminem's giddy singsong: a finessed tool consistently going [...] "hamhock" [...] on some of the hardest beats this side of Illmatic. A not-as-good-kid traversing the same m.A.A.d. city as Kendrick, Schoolboy complements Lamar's narrative distance with evocative, unflinching first-person dispatches from the front lines." [...] Luke Fox of Exclaim! stated, [...] "Anticipation was already high upon hearing the quality of pre-released bangers [...] "Man of the Year", [...] "Break the Bank" [...] and [...] "Collard Green", but it's the album cuts that make Oxymoron — a double-entre nod to the former Oxycontin dealer and current No. 1 dad's paradoxical lifestyle — an early favourite for Top 10 of 2014." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{some critics}} viewed the album's sound as unoriginal and dated. Johnny Dee of Virgin Media said [...] "Flesh Tone marks a thrilling {{comeback}} ... The only complaint {{is that at}} 9 tracks it feels a little light." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquenmani was more critical of Kelis' direction towards dance music, stating that the album [...] "sounds dated in {{the worst kind of}} way—that is, not enough to sound retro-cool, but enough to sound totally uncool. It <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> the album ... segued together with interludes that are more interesting than the actual songs. Flesh Tone should sound desperate, but it often sounds inspired instead. Kelis seems electrified by her new genre shift, and the result is an album that's one of her most consistent to date." [...] Kaya Burgess of The Times pointed out that 'Acapella' and 'Home' are the only tracks which [...] "stand out from an otherwise rather copy-and-paste collection of electronic numbers". Magaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times expressed that Kelis has managed to [...] "make a spirited but disciplined set of classic Euro-club bangers. Sometimes they're darkly contemplative, slipping into trance; other times they nearly rip at the seams ... it's clear that Kelis has carved out a new niche for herself, dancing in front of the turntables till the lights come on, if they dare." [...] Sam Richards of Uncut complimented its fusion of [...] "R sass to thumping club beats" [...] and stated [...] "most everything Kelis touches drips with class". Gavin Haynes of the NME felt that [...] "Flesh Tone has already filled out an application form for pop record of the year" [...] and stated, [...] "Her ability to appear unimpeachably cool hasn't wavered either. But these are as nothing. What's important here is simply her direction: a genuinely innovative bearing that breaks new ground for pop without sounding any less pop for it. Kelis. Genius. Pop auteur." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gavin Mackenzie of PLAY wrote Kasumi's [...] "breasts explode {{the myth}} that ninjas like to go unnoticed, as they make it {{impossible}} not to notice Kasumi." [...] In 2004, Official PlayStation Magazine (Australia) chose Kasumi as one of top ten game characters [...] "to invite to your party," [...] representing [...] "beautiful bouncing girls." [...] "This voluptuous vixen [...] a killer body and the moves to match" [...] was often featured as GameDaily's 'Babe of the Week' feature, including in the galleries [...] "Girl Power", [...] "Asian Beauties" [...] and [...] "Kasumi". In 2010, UGO featured Kasumi in its lists of top 50 [...] "videogame hotties" [...] and 30 best swimsuits in all works of fiction. According to that website, [...] "Kasumi is the flagship protagonist of the Dead or Alive series of games, and it's for good reason. Her huge breasts, flowing hair, and butt-bumpin' volleyball skills represent {{at least half of}} what the series is all about. It only <b>helps</b> <b>that</b> she's equally deadly when the fighting portion comes around." [...] GamePro ranked her third in its 2007 list of [...] "top asses in gaming" [...] and Joystick Division's Hawkins ranked her ninth on his 2011 list of the [...] "greatest asses" [...] in video game history. In 2011, Ross Lincoln of GameFront ranked Kasumi's breasts as the 14th finest, while Rich Shivener of Joystick Division chose them (together with Tina Armstrong's) as the seventh [...] "most incredible chest" [...] in video games. Sega Saturn Magazine stated in 1997 that her breasts are [...] "putting even Lara Croft to shame, [...] can only be referred to as the biggest, bountiful breasts we've ever gawped at," [...] while China's NetEase ranked her as second top [...] "eye candy" [...] game character in history largely due to the impression her sexy costumes and breast physics have made in early DOA games. In 2012, Zachary Miller of Nintendo World Report ranked Kasumi as the second [...] "top chesty heroine" [...] on Nintendo systems solely for her appearance in Dimensions for the Nintendo 3DS, noting that [...] "Tina and Kasumi are the only ladies with bikini costumes, and they both display the usual DoA jiggle more than the other ladies." [...] That same year, Italian edition of Tom's Games also included Kasumi among top ten best necklines in video games: “We could have chosen the more abundant forms of Tina, or provocative costumes of Christie, but we preferred Kasumi in her classic costume.” ...|$|E
