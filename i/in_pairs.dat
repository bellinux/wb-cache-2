5|$|A wary species, {{the black}} stork avoids contact with people. It is {{generally}} found alone or <b>in</b> <b>pairs,</b> or in flocks {{of up to}} a hundred birds when migrating, or over winter.|$|E
5|$|Breeding densities (<b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> per 10ha) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as 2.4 in the Jura Mountains, 3.0–3.6 in the Alps and 4.5 in the Tatra Mountains of Poland.|$|E

50|$|The {{population}} in the United Kingdom is about 22,000 birds, as of the 2006-2007 winter, a slight decline from the peak of about 26,000-27,000 birds in 1990. This includes about 5,300 breeding pairs, the remainder being immatures. Other significant populations in Europe include 6,800-8,300 breeding <b>pairs</b> <b>in</b> Germany, 4,500 <b>pairs</b> <b>in</b> Denmark, 4,000-4,200 <b>pairs</b> <b>in</b> Poland, 3,000-4,000 <b>pairs</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands, about 2,500 <b>pairs</b> <b>in</b> Ireland, and 1,200-1,700 <b>pairs</b> <b>in</b> Ukraine.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>pair</b> skating, Japanese ladies {{have had}} success in {{switching}} countries. This {{has historically been}} mostly American/Japanese pairings, but Japanese women are now competing for Russia and Canada <b>in</b> <b>pair</b> skating at the highest levels.|$|R

5|$|The black honeyeater {{is usually}} {{encountered}} alone or <b>in</b> <b>pairs,</b> though up to 50 may gather at stands of plants in flower.|$|E
5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant is a generalist feeder that eats insects. It is {{also known}} to eat seeds in rare circumstances. It is an active forager that hunts <b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> or, after the {{breeding}} season, small family groups. It has also been known to feed with mixed-species foraging flocks, although this behavior is abnormal. When this does occur, it is most frequently seen foraging with the thorn-tailed rayadito; flocks of thirty tufted tit-tyrants in these mixed-species foraging groups have been reported. Birds <b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> tend to feed leapfrog style and maintain constant visual contact with each other. This species feeds at all strata of its habitat from the understory to the canopy.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-six {{full-length}} episodes (each {{consisting of}} two segments) and forty-seven shorts aired during the series' run. The shorts were shown between Noggin's regular schedule of programs. The full-length episodes, each one spanning ten minutes, were aired <b>in</b> <b>pairs.</b>|$|E
5|$|A graph {{is formed}} by a {{collection}} of vertices and edges, where the vertices are structureless objects that are connected <b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> by edges. In {{the case of a}} directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex.|$|E
5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird is found <b>in</b> <b>pairs,</b> {{in a small}} family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E

5|$|A player (or a pair), {{who wins}} {{at least one}} trick {{receives}} an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute <b>in</b> <b>Pairs</b> the declarations can be performed {{until the end of}} round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in the deck.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the most}} {{abundant}} carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves. A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would favor the wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live <b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites usually hunt singly or <b>in</b> <b>pairs,</b> though {{where food}} is {{plentiful}} they occur in small family groups {{and can be}} loosely gregarious at times of irruptions, with up to 70 birds reported feeding together during a mouse plague. They roost communally, like other Elanus species.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, of 393 men {{sentenced to}} death for falling asleep on sentry duty in all theatres in World War I, only two were {{executed}} (sentries were usually posted <b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> to keep one another awake; these two, who served in Mesopotamia, were made an example of because they were found sitting asleep together, suggesting that they had colluded).|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males compete {{for access to}} females. Such competition can {{take the form of}} fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working <b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female for weeks at a time, waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females.|$|E
5|$|Excepting for the head, snakes have imbricate scales, {{overlapping}} {{like the}} tiles on a roof. Snakes have rows of scales along the whole {{or part of}} their length and also many other specialised scales, either singly or <b>in</b> <b>pairs,</b> occurring {{on the head and}} other regions of the body.|$|E

5|$|Fast and active, {{the copper}} shark may be {{encountered}} alone, <b>in</b> <b>pairs,</b> or in loosely organized schools containing up {{to hundreds of}} individuals. Some aggregations seem to form for reproductive purposes, while others form in response to concentrations of food. This species may fall prey to larger sharks and killer whales. Known parasites of the copper shark include the tapeworms Cathetocephalus australis, Dasyrhynchus pacificus and D. talismani, Floriceps minacanthus, Phoreiobothrium robertsoni, and Pseudogrillotia spratti, the leech Stibarobdella macrothela, and the fluke Otodistomum veliporum.|$|E
5|$|Gergonne's {{approach}} is to consider the solution circles <b>in</b> <b>pairs.</b> Let a pair of solution circles be denoted as CA and CB (the pink circles in Figure6), and let their tangent points with the three given circles be denoted as A1, A2, A3, and B1, B2, B3, respectively. Gergonne's solution aims to locate these six points, and thus solve for the two solution circles.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas are {{generally}} encountered <b>in</b> <b>pairs</b> or small groups, though young birds may gather {{in groups of}} 20 or more outside the breeding season. They sometimes share the company of eastern rosellas. They fly in a straight line, making rapid shallow wingbeats and gliding briefly in between.|$|E
