40|$|<b>In</b> <b>situ</b> <b>inspections</b> were {{performed}} on tarp-covered 55 -gallon drums of transuranic (TRU) waste stored underground at the Hanford Site. These inspections {{were part of a}} task to characterize TRU drums for extent of corrosion degradation and uncertainty in TRU designation (inaccuracy in earlier assay determinations may have led to drums that actually were low-level waste to be termed TRU), and to attempt to correlate accuracy of existing records with actual drum contents. Two separate storage trench sites were investigated; a total of 90 drums were inspected with ultrasonic techniques and 104 additional drums were visually inspected. A high-humidity environment in the underground storage trenches had been reported in earlier investigations and was expected to result in substantial corrosion degradation. However, corrosion was much less than expected. Only a small percentage of drums had significant corrosion (with one breach) and the maximum rate was estimated at 0. 051 mm/yr (2 mils/yr). The corrosion time of underground exposure was 14 to 15 years. These inspection results should be applicable to other similar environments (this applicability should be restricted to arid climates such as the Hanford Site) where drums are stored underground but shielded from direct soil contact by a tarp or other means.

Field visits, a questionnaire and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>inspections</b> were conducted <b>in</b> 2012 – 2014 to understand people’s perception and awareness of drought and its impact, {{particularly with respect to}} adaptation strategies. We mainly focused on drought adaptation actions and planning implemented at the government level under the double pressures of drought and allocation. We described a suitable adaptation pathway for socio-economic sustainable development and discussed existing adaptation barriers. Construction of modern efficient water-saving agriculture lies at the core of drought adaptation, with socio-economic sustainable development being the ultimate goal. To achieve this, policies and institutional, engineering, technological, structural and social initiatives and measures—classified into macro adaptation strategies and specific coping measures—are implemented. Adaptation often encounters obstacles, e. g., policy issues from household contract responsibility systems, funding difficulties of low-income farmers, traditional behavioral habits and low education and literacy levels among farmers. The adaptation pathway involves the construction of modern efficient water-saving agriculture. Agricultural water savings are then transferred to developed industries, which back-feed socio-economic sustainable development in the NX region...|$|R

40|$|Localized wall {{thinning}} due to corrosion in utility boiler water-wall tubing is {{a significant}} inspection concern for boiler operators. Historically, conventional ultrasonics {{has been used for}} inspection of these tubes. This technique has proven to be very manpower and time intensive. This has resulted in a spot check approach to inspections, documenting thickness measurements over a relatively small percentage of the total boiler wall area. NASA Langley Research Center has developed a thermal NDE technique designed to image and quantitatively characterize the amount of material thinning present in steel tubing. The technique involves the movement of a thermal line source across the outer surface of the tubing followed by an infrared imager at a fixed distance behind the line source. Quantitative images of the material loss due to corrosion are reconstructed from measurements of the induced surface temperature variations. This paper will present a discussion of the development of the thermal imaging system as well as the techniques used to reconstruct images of flaws. The application of the thermal line source coupled with the analysis technique represents a significant improvement in the inspection speed for large structures such as boiler water-walls. A theoretical basis for the technique will be presented which explains the quantitative nature of the technique. Further, a dynamic calibration system will be presented for the technique that allows the extraction of thickness information from the temperature data. Additionally, the results of applying this technology to actual water-wall tubing samples and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>inspections</b> will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{interest}} earned recently by modern heritage structures, seismic assessment criteria of Eurocode 8 for ordinary reinforced concrete structures {{are applied to}} a modern heritage RC building. This case study, the Tower of the Nations in Naples, was designed {{at the end of}} 1930 s. Modal dynamic identification, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>inspections</b> and testing provided the necessary knowledge of the structure in terms of geometry, structural details, and material properties. Two nonlinear models of the structure are built up in both the hypotheses of accounting and not accounting for tuff infills’ stiffness and strength contribution. Lumped plasticity model for reinforced concrete elements and equivalent strut macro-models for tuff and concrete infills are employed. Seismic assessment through nonlinear dynamic analyses is carried out for both limit states of Significant Damage and Damage Limitation. Assessment of bare and infilled models emphasizes a lower demand in terms of maximum interstorey drift of the infilled model with respect to the bare model, for both limit states considered. Record-to-record variability for the sets of seven records becomes larger if infills strength and stiffness contribution is taken into account. Outcome of the assessment is not affected by infills, i. e. the structure can be considered safe (according to EC 8 provisions) for both limit states, and in both modeling hypotheses. On the other hand, the ratio demand over capacity, for both the limit states considered, is strictly influenced by infills’ contribution. Assessment tools provided for ordinary RC structures can be addressed to modern heritage buildings as shown in this case study, even if specific care is necessary for nonlinear structural modeling in case of non-conventional structural elements and non-conventional structural materials (e. g., tuff infills in lieu of clay hollow brick infills) ...|$|R

To address the challenges, this study evaluates several non-contact measurement technologies for in situ stylus inspection and based on those findings proposes a cost-effective microscopy approach. The operational principle is then demonstrated by an automated prototype, coordinated directly by the CMM software MCOSMOS, with an effective threshold of detection as low as 400 nm and large field of view and depth-of-field. The level of stylus contamination on the stylus has been found to increase steadily with the number of measurement contacts made. Once excessive contamination is detected on the stylus, measurement should be stopped and stylus cleaning procedure should be performed to avoid affecting measurement accuracy...|$|E
