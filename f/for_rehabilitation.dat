5|$|From 1993 to 1995 {{a presidential}} decree on {{measures}} {{to prevent future}} abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission <b>for</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> of the Victims of Political Repression. For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, {{at the request of}} Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report. It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials for discussion in the Commission <b>for</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill. The documents failed to reach the head of the Commission Alexander Yakovlev.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Kim Deal {{was eager}} to {{continue}} recording and performing. At first, she envisioned her next album as a solo record, on which she would play all of the instrument parts. When she was recording initial demos for the project, she asked Kelley to play on some of them, to distract her from her drug difficulties. Since Kelley was now also involved, Deal {{decided not to go}} solo, but formed a new group. She recruited Macpherson to play drums, musician Luis Lerma, bass, and Nate Farley, guitar. Later, Kelley dropped out of the project <b>for</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> and moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota. For fun, Deal began calling herself Tammy Ampersand, and the group, Tammy and the Amps. This later became simply the Amps.|$|E
5|$|Owners of income-producing {{properties}} listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or {{of properties}} that are contributing resources within a National Register Historic District may {{be eligible for}} a 20% investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of the historic structure. The rehabilitation may be of a commercial, industrial, or residential property, for rentals. The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State Historic Preservation Offices, and the Internal Revenue Service. Aside from the 20% tax credit, the tax incentive program offers a 10% tax credit <b>for</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> to owners of non-historic, non-residential buildings constructed before 1936.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{measures}} include use {{of protective}} technology in vehicles, such as seat belts and sports or motorcycle helmets, {{as well as}} efforts {{to reduce the number}} of collisions, such as safety education programs and enforcement of traffic laws. Depending on the injury, treatment required may be minimal or may include interventions such as medications, emergency surgery or surgery years later. Physical therapy, speech therapy, recreation therapy, occupational therapy and vision therapy may be employed <b>for</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> Counseling, supported employment, and community support services may also be useful.|$|E
40|$|Background: There are an {{increasing}} number of studies focusing on the effect of tai chi for different diseases. As a special form of physical activity, tai chi may be beneficial <b>for</b> the <b>rehabilitation</b> of stroke, a leading cause of disability worldwide. Objective: This review summarizes the existing literature on the potential benefits of tai chi <b>for</b> stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> and offers recommendations for future research. Methods: Studies on the biomechanics and physiology of tai chi <b>for</b> stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> are reviewed. Research on tai chi <b>for</b> stroke <b>rehabilitation</b> and related diseases are summarized. Finally, the shortcomings of existing studies and recommendations for future studies are discussed. Conclusions: Tai chi appears to be beneficial <b>for</b> stroke <b>rehabilitation.</b> But reporting quality of existing studies are sub-optimal. Future trials should define tai chi style, apply rigorous methodology to sample size calculation, randomization, recruiting criteria, and outcome measures. To avoid inadequacies during the research and reporting processes, investigators may wish to follow CONSORT guidelines and refer to well-conducted clinical studies on tai chi...|$|R

A new toll and customs plaza was built in 1991, and later the next year, an international task force determined that traffic on the existing structure was exceeding capacity. Environmental planning started in 1993, and construction started on the second span between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario in 1995. In July 1997, the second span opened.

5|$|There are six {{hospitals}} in Nablus, {{the four major}} ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani(the National) and the Rafidia Surgery Hospital. The latter, located in Rafidia, a suburb in western Nablus, is the largest hospital in the city. Al-Watani Hospital specializes in oncology services. The Anglican St. Lukes hospital and the National Hospital were built in 1900 and 1910 respectively. In addition to hospitals, Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center <b>for</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> and 68 pharmacies. In addition to that, in 2001, Nablus Speciality Hospital was built, {{in which it is}} specialized in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasties.|$|E
5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} {{incentives}} were virtually non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards <b>for</b> <b>Rehabilitation.</b> Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.|$|E

5|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{many of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital <b>for</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> in October 1971. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.|$|E
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche <b>for</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> and eventual release.|$|E
5|$|During the Restoration (1814–30), LouisXVIII and CharlesX {{between them}} added 135pieces {{at a cost}} of 720,000francs and created the {{department}} of Egyptian antiquities curated by Champollion, increased by more than 7,000works with the acquisition of antiquities in the Edme-Antoine Durand, the Egyptian collection of Henry Salt or the second collection former by Bernardino Drovetti. This was less than the amount given <b>for</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> of Versailles, and the Louvre suffered relative to the rest of Paris. After the creation of the French Second Republic in 1848, the new government allocated twomillion francs for repair work and ordered the completion of the Galerie d'Apollon, the Salon Carré, and the Grande Galérie. In 1861, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte bought 11,835artworks including 641 paintings, Greek gold and other antiquities of the Campana collection. During the Second French Empire, between 1852 and 1870, the French economy grew; by 1870 the museum had added 20,000new pieces to its collections, and the Pavillon de Flore and the Grande Galérie were remodelled under architects Louis Visconti and Hector Lefuel.|$|E

The rainfall triggered more than 80landslides statewide, and two {{were killed in a}} rockslide near the town of Jacala. Swollen rivers in El Arenal and Huejutla caused two drownings. Total damage from Arlene reached Mex$2.6billion (US$207.4million) across Hidalgo. In response, the state government allocated a total Mex$17million (US$1.45million) <b>for</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> works. Downpours in the state of Puebla triggered landslides that cut off roads to traffic. Toppled trees struck a home in the municipality of Zihuateutla, killing its inhabitant. In Tlacotepec municipality, a girl was left missing after falling into a rushing stream; by July4, officials confirmed she had drowned. After hours of prolonged rainfall, concerns arose over the potential overflow of a dam in the municipality of Tlatlauquitepec. Three houses sustained damage in Eloxochitlán as a consequence of excessively saturated soils, and another collapsed in Atempan. Elsewhere in Puebla, mud and flood waters reached 1.6ft (0.5m) in a school after a nearby river overflowed.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, BOT {{superintendent}} Philip E. Pheifer {{put forth}} a proposal for Second Avenue Subway services, which would branch extensively off to B Division. The subway was originally to be opened by 1951, but by 1945, plans for the Second Avenue Subway were again revised. Another plan was put forth in 1947 by Colonel Sidney H. Bingham, a city planner and former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) engineer. O'Dwyer and Gross believed that construction of a Second Avenue subway line would be vital to both increasing capacity on existing lines and allowing new branch lines to be built. Bingham's proposal involved more branch lines and track connections than did Phiefer's, and similar to the 1960s and 1990s phased proposals, was {{to be built in}} sections. However, by the next year, New York City was short $145 million that was needed for a $800 million program <b>for</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> and proposed capital improvements. The City petitioned the New York State Legislature to exceed its $655 million debt ceiling so that the city could spend $500 million on subway construction, but this request was denied.|$|E
5|$|In late December, Bonneau {{signed for}} UMF Njarðvík of the Icelandic Úrvalsdeild. He scored a regular season-high 45 points, {{to help his}} team win Stjarnan 92–86. On 17 April 2015, he scored 52 points against KR for the fifth game of the Playoffs semi-final series. Following that performance, {{opponent}} head coach, Finnur Freyr Stefánsson, acknowledged Bonneau {{as one of the}} best players to ever play in the league. Bonneau led the Úrvalsdeild in scoring, averaging 36.9 points per game, also averaging 7.0 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 2.5 steals per game, in 11 games. On 17 June 2015, Bonneau signed a new annual contract with UMF Njarðvík; the contract would make Bonneau the highest paid player of UMF Njarðvík ever. Gunnar Örlygsson, the team's chairman, compared Bonneau with Lionel Messi in terms of impact on the club. During a pre-season training in September he suffered an achilles tendon rupture. Bonneau stayed in Iceland <b>for</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> with an intent to join the team in the play-offs. In his first game back from the injury, Bonneau again thore his achilles tendon, this time on his right foot. In October 2016, Bonneau signed a two-month contract with Njarðvík. At the end of the contract Njarðvík decided not renew it, citing their desire to acquire a bigger player.|$|E
