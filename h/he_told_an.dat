5|$|The {{morning of}} the 23rd, {{the day of the}} speech, brought the reports from the lawyers, who opined that it was legal for a senator to accept expense reimbursements, and from the accountants, who stated that there was no {{evidence}} of misappropriation of money. The Fund was to be dissolved, and gifts accepted since Nixon's nomination were to be accounted for as campaign contributions. Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket. Believing they had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland.|$|E
25|$|He capped {{off this}} period of intense {{creativity}} with another monograph, a full-length study of Wallace Stevens, with whom he identified {{more than any other}} poet at this stage of his career, as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Hostettler {{signed the}} Contract with America, but <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> Evansville Courier & Press {{reporter}} {{the day he}} signed it he did not support two provisions: {{a balanced budget amendment}} and term limits. He was one of 40 Republicans in the House to vote in March 1995 against a constitutional amendment to set 12-year term limits for Representatives.|$|E

25|$|Following the correction, {{a journalistic}} review was {{conducted}} by Al Ortiz, CBS News' executive director of standards and practices. He determined that red flags about Davies' account were missed. Davies had said to the program and written in his book that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> alternative version of his actions to his employer, who he said had demanded that he stay inside his Benghazi villa as the attack unfolded. That alternative version was shared with US authorities and 60 Minutes was unable to prove the story Davies had told them was true.|$|E
25|$|Adams and Cary {{have claimed}} to be reuniting Whiskeytown on {{multiple}} occasions, as recently as 2010, but nothing new has been released yet. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer in January 2017 that he was {{writing a book about}} the band, but had no plans to record or tour with Whiskeytown. A scheduling conflict was blamed as the reason for the reunion not taking place. The band did reunite for a one-off, impromptu gig after one of Adams' shows in Raleigh, NC, in 2005. Gilmore, Cary, and Adams were joined on-stage by Adams' pedal steel player, Jon Graboff, and bassist Catherine Popper.|$|E
25|$|At Brown's urging, NATO members pledged in 1977 to {{increase}} their individual defense spending three percent per year in real terms for the 1979-86 period. The objective, Brown explained, was to ensure that alliance resources and capabilities-both conventional and nuclear-would balance those of the Soviet bloc. Although some NATO members hesitated to confirm the agreement to accept new missiles and did not always attain the three percent target, Brown was pleased with NATO's progress. Midway in his term <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer that he thought his most important achievement thus far had been the revitalization of NATO.|$|E

Harry Joseph Letterman survived a heart attack at age 36, when David was a young boy. The fear of losing his father was constantly with Letterman as he grew up.

500|$|The {{failure of}} the proposal, and the wider issue of why the Allies were unable to save the 435,000 Hungarian Jews {{deported}} to Auschwitz between May and July 1944, {{became the subject of}} bitter debate for many years. In 1961 Life magazine called Brand [...] "a man who lives in the shadows with a broken heart". <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer shortly before his death in 1964: [...] "An accident of life placed the fate of one million human beings on my shoulders.

500|$|In 1998, {{after the}} success of Either/Or and [...] "Miss Misery", Smith signed to a bigger record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, {{speaking}} openly of considering suicide, and {{on at least one}} occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall.

500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted the {{extraordinary}} development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines {{to the fact that}} Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer: [...] "Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1993 promotional {{interview}} for the album, Steinman reasserts {{the continuation of}} the Bat world. [...] "I didn't call it Bat Out of Hell II just to identify with the first record. It really does feel like an extension of that... It was a chance {{to go back to that}} world and explore it deeper. It always seemed incomplete because I conceived it like a film, and what would you do without Die Hard 2?" [...] Meat Loaf himself was more succinct. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interview at the time, [...] "We called it Bat Out of Hell II 'cos that would help it sell shitloads." ...|$|E

500|$|Those {{close to}} him thought he was {{suffering}} from dementia, and in mid-1960 Mary placed him in a clinic near Merano when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary infection. Dorothy felt unable to look after him, so he went to live with Olga in Rapallo, then Venice; Dorothy mostly stayed in London after that with Omar. Pound attended a neo-Fascist May Day parade in 1962, but his health continued to decline. The following year <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer, Grazia Levi: [...] "I spoil everything I touch. I have always blundered... All my life I believed I knew nothing, yes, knew nothing.

500|$|True to his nature, Grant did not panic at the Confederate assault. As Grant rode {{back from}} the river, he heard the sounds of guns and sent word to Foote to begin a {{demonstration}} of naval gunfire, assuming that his troops would be demoralized and could use the encouragement. Grant observed {{that some of the}} Confederates (Buckner's) were fighting with knapsacks filled with three days of rations, which implied to him that they were attempting to escape, not pressing for a combat victory. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> aide, [...] "The one who attacks first now will be victorious. The enemy will have to be in a hurry if he gets ahead of me." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{playing for}} the Giants in October 1965, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>an</b> interviewer: [...] "I'm playing {{football}} to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people. [...] The eye of American is upon the sports' field, so I can reach more people playing football. [...] I guess you can say {{my goal is to}} spread a Christian message." [...] At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. [...] Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that [...] "you don't need to hurt anyone to get by" [...] in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence. [...] He then joked, [...] "There's nothing really wrong with good, clean violence." ...|$|E
