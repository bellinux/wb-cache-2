The {{apparatus}} {{enables a}} small crystal {{to be rotated}} through 360 ~ about an axis parallel to the stage of a polarizing microscope, while immersed in a liquid of known refractive index. Angles of rotation are measured on a <b>graduated</b> <b>drum</b> to the nearest degree. The working distances separating the crystal from the objective and the condenser a e sufficiently small for wide-angle interference figures to be obtained. The crystal is easily mounted a~d centred. M ANY forms of apparatus have been devised for rotating a small crystal, immersed in {{a few drops of}} a liquid of known refractive index, about an axis parallel to the stage of a polarizing microscope, such as, for example, those described by Wood and Ayliffe (1935), Bernal and Carlisle (1947), Rosenfeld (1950), Tatarskii (1951), Hart-shorne and Swift (1955), and Wilcox (1959). The advantages of this simple technique in determining the optical properties of crystals have been demonstrated by several authors, notably by Vedeneeva and Kolotushkin (1934), Joel (1950), Swift (1954), Joel and Garaycochea (1957), and Hartshorne and Stuart (1960), as well as by those just men-tioned. More recently, Fisher (1962) has described a modification of a Vigfusson-type warm stage to take a needle and graduated rum, so that the refractive indices of small single crystals can be determined by the double variation method. Among these various devices the 'spindle stage ' of Wilcox (1959) has impressed the writer by its elegant simplicity, and {{by the fact that the}} working distances separating the crystal from the objective and the con-denser are so small that wide-angle interference figures can be obtained with ease. It has, however, the disadvantages for some operations that the rotation of the crystal is restricted to 180 ~, and that the plastic half-circle against which angles of rotation are measured is only gradu-ated at intervals of 5 ~. The apparatus here described (fig. 1) combines working distance...|$|E

Cobb regarded the experience as positive, on balance, describing it as [...] "the best and worst thing that could have happened to me. The best thing, because we would not have had anything at the time. The worst, it was scary not being a family anymore." [...] He regarded the experience as providing him with a strong work ethic, and remained in the home until the age of 16, graduating from Paxon High School in Jacksonville.

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 63 : 55 in lengthThe five works presented on this graduate percussion recital represent {{the wide range}} of music available in the percussion repertory both in the types of percussion instruments represented and the periods and styles of the music. Although only works from the baroque era and the twentieth century are represented on this program, transcriptions of works from the renaissance, classic, and romantic eras are available to the percussionists of today. The recital opens with the chaconne from the Partita no. 2 in D Minor from the set of Six Sonatas and Partitas for Violin Solo by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 - 1750), representing repertory from the baroque era. This movement, set in the style of a the dance known as the sarabande, is the final movement of this partita, actually a set of five works in dance styles also including an allemande, acourante, a sarabande (different from the chaconne) and a gigue. Written during Bach's tenure at the court of Anhalt-Cothen, the Chaconne is a large set of variations on a four-note ground bass theme. Performed on this recital on the vibraphone, the chaconne is a cornerstone of the violin repertory, and tests the performer on the levels of patience, technique, endurance, musicality. Images, for four timpani, five cymbals, and large tam tam, is the first of two pieces by William Kraft (b. 1923) to be performed on this program and is representative of repertory from the twentieth century. this piece, composed in 1978, is set in four movements, each of which is dedicated to a different master of the timpani; Saul Goodman, Cloyd Duff, Vic Firth, and Fred Hinger. This work is unique in its original blending of the use of different special effects and techniques with lyrical and beautifully conceived textures and melodies. Due to its technical and musical demands, images stands as one of the premier pieces in the solo timpani repertory and well represents the graduate level of achievement. Encounters V also by Mr. Kraft, is scored for one percussionist and 'cello and was inspired by a poem by Carl Faber entitled In the Morning of the Winter sea, which reads as follows: This work, commissioned by the ford foundation for violoncellist Nathaniel Rosen, was premiered in new York by the composer and Mr. Rosen in 1976 and revised into its present state in 1982. The percussion part of the piece is written for vibraphone (played with bass bows, normal mallets, and specially made "cluster" mallets), three tams, five <b>graduated</b> <b>drums,</b> crotales, and car spring coil, while the 'cello part makes use of difficult harmonics, col legno, pizzicato and snap pizzicato techniques. Together these parts blend to from an eerie musical atmosphere reminiscent of Mr. Faber's poem. Also part of the modern repertory for percussion, the Duo for Two Marimbas by David Wheatley is a Three movement work composed in 1978 and scored for two percussionists playing two marimbas. the first movement features challenging four-mallet work and difficult mallet changes as the texture moves from boisterous septal chordal exclamations to softer, more lyrical textures and melodies. The second movements is a study in space and control as each player Navigates a very sparse musical landscape where texture is altered by changes in mallet type and hardness. The finale is an exciting two mallet movement based on quartal harmony. The final work of the recital is a piece of some importance to the continuing legacy of jazz music and specifically jazz drumming, music which exits only in the twentieth century. This piece was passed to Jazz drummer Max Roach aurally by Jonathan (Papa Jo) Jones, drummer with the early Count Basie Band, who composed this work. This aural transmission is a staple of the African tradition in jazz music. performed on the Hi-Hat alone,"this piece," says Mr. Roach,"teaches one how to do the most with the least.... The title of the piece is simply 'Papa Jo"...|$|R
