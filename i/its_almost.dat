5|$|Little {{more was}} {{discovered}} about Venus until the 20thcentury. <b>Its</b> <b>almost</b> featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E
5|$|Degraded by revolt and fifth-column activity, the 27th Infantry Division Savska {{numbered}} about 2,000 effectives {{when the}} German attack began. The 14th Panzer Division vanguard reached their {{positions in the}} Bilogora range around 08:00, and {{the remnants of the}} division began withdrawing towards Križevci under heavy air attack. When they reached the town around 14:00, they were quickly encircled by German motorised troops that had outflanked them. The divisional headquarters staff escaped, but were captured a little further down the road at Bojnikovec. The remnants of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment had to fight its way towards Bjelovar, but was attacked by German tanks on the outskirts, captured and detained.

5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With <b>its</b> <b>almost</b> cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} {{named by the}} Roman Emperor Vespasian in 72 CE as Flavia Neapolis. Since then, Nablus has been ruled by many empires {{over the course of}} <b>its</b> <b>almost</b> 2,000-year-long history. In the 5th and 6th centuries, {{conflict}} between the city's Christian and Samaritan inhabitants climaxed in a series of Samaritan revolts against Byzantine rule, before their violent quelling in 529 CE drastically dwindled that community's numbers in the city. In 636, Neapolis, along with most of Palestine, came under the rule of the Islamic Arab Caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab; its name Arabicized to Nablus. In 1099, the Crusaders took control of the city for less than a century, leaving its mixed Muslim, Christian and Samaritan population relatively undisturbed. After Saladin's Ayyubid forces took control of the interior of Palestine in 1187, Islamic rule was reestablished, and continued under the Mamluk and Ottoman empires to follow.|$|E
5|$|The colour of {{the head}} and gaster are black, shading into reddish brown on the clypeus and around the frontal carinae. The mesosoma (alitrunk), node, and legs are brownish-red and light, with the legs {{becoming}} yellowish in certain areas. The antennae and mandibles are brownish yellow, and the teeth have black edges. Overall, M. inquilina can be distinguished from others by its black head and <b>its</b> <b>almost</b> hairless body. Its colour is similar to M. nigriceps, but M. nigriceps is larger and covered in hair, along with a head more rounded than other species. M. inquilina does not have a worker caste, making it a workerless parasite.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building, which incorporated {{stone and}} tiles scavenged from the Roman fort, {{was a simple}} one consisting only of a nave and an apsidal chancel, with a small room, or porticus, built out {{from each of the}} church's northern and southern sides where the nave and chancel met. The church was much altered and expanded during the Middle Ages; the last addition, in the 15th century, was of north and south porches leading into the nave. This expansion coincided with a long period of prosperity for the settlement of Reculver, but its decline led to the church's decay and, in the face of coastal erosion, <b>its</b> <b>almost</b> complete demolition in 1809.|$|E

5|$|After the {{crossing}} was complete, the division was relieved from V Corps and assigned to Major General Wade H. Haislip's XV Corps. The division was allowed a one-month rest, resuming its advance on 25 November, attacking the forts north of Mutzig. These forts {{had been designed}} by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1893 to block access to the plain of Alsace. The 45th Division next crossed the Zintzel River before pushing through the Maginot Line defenses. During this time much of the division's artillery assets were attached to the 44th Infantry Division to provide additional support. The 45th Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Robert T. Frederick, who had previously commanded the 1st Special Service Force, was reassigned to VI Corps on New Year's Day. From 2 January 1945, the division fought defensively along the German border, withdrawing to the Moder River. It sent half of its artillery to support the 70th Infantry Division. On 17 February the division was pulled off the line for rest and training. Once this rest period was complete, the division was assigned to XV Corps for the final push into German territory. The 45th moved north to the Sarreguemines area and smashed through the Siegfried Line, on 17 March taking Homburg on the 21st and crossing the Rhine between Worms and Hamm on the 26th. The advance continued, with Aschaffenburg falling on 3 April, and Nuremberg on the 20th. The division crossed the Danube River on 27 April, and liberated 32,000 captives of the Dachau concentration camp on 29 April 1945. The division captured Munich {{during the next two}} days, occupying the city until V-E Day and the surrender of Germany. During the next month, the division remained in Munich and set up collection points and camps for the massive numbers of surrendering troops of the German armies. The number of POWs taken by the 45th Division during <b>its</b> <b>almost</b> two years of fighting totalled 124,840 men. The division was then slated to move to the Pacific theater of operations to participate in the invasion of mainland Japan on the island of Honshu, but these plans were scrubbed before the division could depart after the surrender of Japan, on V-J Day.|$|E
