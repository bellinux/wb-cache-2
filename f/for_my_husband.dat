6000|$|... 'And now,' she said, 'I {{ought not}} to stay any longer, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> will think that I have run away, or that some evil beast has devoured me.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Major Fitz-David is an {{old friend}} of my husband's," [...] I said, [...] "and he is kind to me <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> sake. He has given me {{permission}} to look in this room--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} you looking so well," [...] she {{answered}} frankly. [...] "Now I must hurry off. I {{am going to}} call <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> and take him to lunch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Madam Lion, take me back, I pray you, to my castle; and {{fix what}} ransom you like, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> will pay it, {{whatever}} it is. But the giantess shook her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] she {{answered}} composedly. [...] "That is how I {{like to have}} you call me. I am speaking <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> He is here by my side at the present moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|JUDITH (almost stifled with resentment, {{which she}} has been expecting her husband to share and express for her at every insult of Richard's). You are welcome <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> sake. (She brings the teapot to the {{fireplace}} and sets it on the hob.) ...|$|R

60|$|The doctor! They {{had called}} the doctor in to help them! I began dimly to {{understand}} that my fainting fit must have presented symptoms far more serious than the fainting fits of women in general. I appealed to the doctor, in a helpless, querulous way, to account to me <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> extraordinary absence.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts: [...] "I {{was just}} looking <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> He was to meet me here at ten minutes past three; but there don't {{seem to be any}} gentlemen. You haven't {{happened}} to notice--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas! Macumazahn, I am rich {{in nothing}} except trouble, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> saves, like the ants for winter. Why, he even grudged me this poor kaross; {{and as for}} friends, he is so jealous {{that he will not}} allow me any." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "HONORED MISS--I take up my pen to bespeak {{your kind}} sympathy <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> and myself; two old people thrown {{on the world}} again {{by the death of}} our {{excellent}} master. We are under a month's notice to leave Redwood Hall.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bob's small nose {{seemed to}} be {{following}} the example of her eyes in turning up reverentially toward Maggie, but she was able now to smile and curtsey, and say, [...] "I'd looked forrard like aenything to seein' you, Miss, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> tongue's been runnin' on you, like {{as if he was}} light-headed, iver since first he come a-courtin' on me." ...|$|R
60|$|She had perhaps {{been hearing}} of my wilfulness and insubordination, {{for she was}} very grand and formal with me, solemnly calling me Madame la Vicomtesse, and never her niece, and I thought {{all the time that}} I {{detected}} a sneer. If I had wished <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> sake to accompany him, I wished it ten thousand times more when I fully beheld the alternative.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] demanded Mrs. Simpson. [...] "How {{dare you}} call me by my Christian name. It’s a good job <b>for</b> you <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> is not here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to sleeping," [...] {{the woman}} said, [...] "John and I {{have been talking}} it over, {{and the best way}} we can see is that you should sleep with me, ma'am, and we will make up a bed on the floor here <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> and yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For myself, by my honour as a woman, I care nothing. I am {{rich and}} {{have all that}} the world can give me. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> in this matter, I care nothing. His career he will make for himself, and it will depend on no title." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I lost {{every penny}} of that {{thousand}} pounds," [...] she declared. [...] "That is why I sent <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> {{this morning and}} asked him to take me back to England. I am getting afraid of the place. My luck seems to have gone for ever." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{found nothing}} for their turn, for the trunk had been searched before, but they {{discovered}} several things {{very much to}} my satisfaction, as particularly a parcel of money in French pistols, and some Dutch ducatoons or rix-dollars, and the rest was chiefly two periwigs, wearing-linen, and razors, wash-balls, perfumes, and other useful things necessary for a gentleman, which all passed <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's,</b> and so I was quit to them.|$|R
6000|$|... "The hurried pace {{at which}} we rode, and the anxiety of the moment, kept me silent, and {{prevented}} my expressing my surprise or my joy save in a few broken words. It also served as an apology <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> silence. At length we stopped at a solitary hut--the cavaliers dismounted, and I was assisted from my saddle, not by M----M----my husband, I would say, who seemed busied about his horse, but by the stranger.|$|R
6000|$|... "a {{great deal}} of Mrs. Leigh (Augusta), having passed some days with [...] her and Colonel Leigh, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> {{shooting}} near Newmarket, when [...] Lord Byron was in the house, and, as she told me, was writing 'The [...] Corsair', to <b>my</b> great astonishment, <b>for</b> it was a wretched small house, [...] full of her ill-trained children, who were always {{running up and down}} [...] stairs, and going into 'uncle's' bedroom, where he remained all the [...] morning."] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; you did quite right," [...] {{she said}} after a moment's pause. [...] "I was waiting <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> outside the club, and quite by chance I took up the Post and saw your paragraph. I drove here at once. Will you show me to the Count's rooms, if you please?" ...|$|E
60|$|When we {{returned}} to the inn, we ordered supper to be ready by eight o'clock, that we might drink a parting glass to settle it, before we went on board; <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> who knew the sea very well, said a full stomach was the forerunner of sea-sickness, which I was willing to avoid.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't take Peter Steinmarc for my husband," [...] said Linda; {{and she did}} in part {{effect that}} flying round of which she had been thinking. [...] "I won't take Peter Steinmarc <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> let the man say what he may. How can I marry him if I hate him? He is a--beast." ...|$|E
60|$|The Major and Benjamin both opposed this hasty {{resolution}} on my part. They appealed {{to my own}} sense of self-respect, without (so far as I remember it) producing the slightest effect on my mind. They were more successful when they entreated me next to be patient <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> sake. In mercy to Eustace, they begged me to wait half an hour. If he failed to return in that time, they pledged themselves to accompany me in search of him to the hotel.|$|R
60|$|Almah. You know I am from recompence debarred, But I {{will grant}} your merit a reward; Your flame's too noble to deserve a cheat, And I too plain to {{practise}} a deceit. I no return of love can ever make, But what I ask is <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> sake; He, I confess, has been ungrateful too, But he and I are ruined if you go: Your virtue to the hardest proof I bring;-- Unbribed, preserve a mistress and a king.|$|R
6000|$|It is {{not saying}} much for myself, I know--but, having confessed it when I was wrong, let me, at least, record it when I did what was right--I decided {{instantly}} on giving up all further {{connection with the}} recovery of the torn letter. If Eustace asked me the question, I was resolved to be able to answer truly: [...] "I have made the sacrifice that assures your tranquillity. When resignation was hardest, I have humbled my obstinate spirit, and I have given way <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} {{that you should}} know it all, and then {{you will not be}} led into {{fighting}} my battles again. You cannot fight them so that I should win; I do love your brother; love him truly, fondly, tenderly. I would wish to have him <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> as you wish to have Mr Oriel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{believes}} she is alive, too," [...] she said. [...] "He can't sleep or rest till he finds her, <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> loves {{her as well}} as I do. But sometimes I feel it's wicked to hope she is alive. I know what she suffers, for I suffered, myself; and life isn't worth living when despair and disappointment fills it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Them broad hats {{will never}} do," [...] the woman said; [...] "but I have got some blue nightcaps I knitted <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> They are {{something}} like the caps I have seen some sailors wear; anyhow, they will pass at a distance, and when you take your coats and vests off, them colored flannel shirts will be just the right thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|The New York-based Helsinki Watch {{issued a}} {{statement}} about Orlov’s health deterioration, [...] "He has frequent headaches and dizzy spells, resulting from an old skull injury. He suffers from kidney and prostate inflammation, low blood pressure, rheumatic pains, toothaches, insomnia and vitamin deficiency. Medical care in the labor camp is extremely inadequate." [...] Orlov also suffered from tuberculosis. He has lost {{a good deal of}} weight and most of his teeth. Orlov’s wife said he looked extremely emaciated and that she was [...] "very fearful <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> health. The authorities are gradually killing him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Almah. You know I am from recompence debarred, [...] But I {{will grant}} your merit a reward; [...] Your flame's too noble to deserve a cheat, [...] And I too plain to {{practise}} a deceit. [...] I no return of love can ever make, [...] But what I ask is <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> sake; [...] He, I confess, has been ungrateful too, [...] But he and I are ruined if you go; [...] Your virtue to the hardest proof I bring; [...] Unbribed, preserve a mistress and a king.|$|R
60|$|As to <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> and me, that voyage {{had made}} us as fond of one another's company {{on one side}} of the Channel as we had been afraid of it before on the other, but there was no more riding {{together}} for us. I had to travel in the great coach with M. le Marquis, the three ladies, and all our women, where I was so dull and weary that I should have felt ready to die, but <b>for</b> watching <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> plume, or now and then getting a glance and a nod from him as he rode among the other gentlemen, braving all their laughter at his devotion; for, bashful as he was, he knew how to hold his own.|$|R
