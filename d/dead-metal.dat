40|$|Abstract. Extrusion is a {{deformation}} process used {{in metal}} sections fabrication. Metal flow pattern during extrusion process {{is of great}} importance. How circular initial section of billet changes to final section provides more details of extrusion process, and {{plays an important role}} in optimizing the extrusion energy. Extrusion in flat-faced die, without intermediate section, needs much more energy than is required for die having intermediate section. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of strain rate on metal flow pattern in T-section extrusion process. Four different ram speeds were applied to realize how the shape and position of intermediate section would be affected. Flat-faced die with “T ” final section was designed and manufactured. Straight layout of metal was of top concern in die design. Commercial purity aluminum, Al 99. 5, was extruded in flat-faced die in hot condition. Graphite was used as lubricant in deformation process. After partial extrusion of billets, the residual part of billets pounced out of container and then mounted for metallographic tests. This part of billets consisted of <b>dead-metal</b> zone and deformation zone. Then, step-by-step decreasing of specimen height followed by macro-etching of metal surface paved the way for determining the metal flow pattern. An egg-shaped intermediate section appeared between initial round section and final “T ” section. The size and position of the intermediate section changed by varying the strain rate of extrusion process; It was also revealed that as the strain rate of extrusion process is increased, the <b>dead-metal</b> zones become narrower and the <b>dead-metal</b> zone semi angle increases...|$|E
40|$|With many {{innovations}} in process technology, forging is establishing {{itself as a}} precision manufacturing process: as forging is used to produce complex shapes in difficult materials, it requires dies of complex configuration of high strength and of wear-resistant materials. Extensive research and development work is being undertaken, internationally, to analyse the stresses in forging dies and the flow of material in forged components. Identification of the location, {{size and shape of}} <b>dead-metal</b> zones is required for component design. Further, knowledge of the strain distribution in the flowing metal indicates {{the degree to which the}} component is being work hardened. Such information is helpful in the selection of process parameters such as dimensional allowances and interface lubrication, as well as in the determination of post-forging operations such as heat treatment and machining. In the presently reported work the effect of aperture width and initial specimen height on the strain distribution in the plane-strain extrusion forging of machined lead billets is observed: the distortion of grids inscribed on the face of the specimen gives the strain distribution. The stress-equilibrium approach is used to optimise a model of flow in extrusion forging, which model is found to be effective in estimating the size of the <b>dead-metal</b> zone. The work carried out so far indicates that the methodology of using the stress-equilibrium approach to develop models of flow in closed-die forging can be a useful tool in component, process and die design...|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{heterogeneity}} in indentation {{is fundamental}} for understanding mechanics of hardness testing and impression-based deformation processing methods. The heterogeneous deformation underlying plane-strain indentation {{was investigated in}} plastic loading of copper by a flat punch. Deformation parameters were measured, in situ, by tracking the motion of asperities in high-speed optical imaging. These measurements were coupled with multi-scale analyses of strength, microstructure and crystallographic texture {{in the vicinity of}} the indentation. Self-consistency is demonstrated in description of the deformation field using the in situ mechanics-based measurements and post-mortem materials characterization. Salient features of the punch indentation process elucidated include, among others, the presence of a <b>dead-metal</b> zone underneath the indenter, regions of intense strain rate (e. g. slip lines) and extent of the plastic flow field. Perhaps more intriguing are the transitions between shear-type and compression-type deformation modes over the indentation region that were quantified by the high-resolution crystallographic texture measurements. The evolution of the field concomitant to the progress of indentation is discussed and primary differences between the mechanics of indentation for a rigid perfectly plastic material and a strain-hardening material are described...|$|E
