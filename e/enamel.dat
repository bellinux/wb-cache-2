5|$|Ectopic <b>enamel</b> is <b>enamel</b> {{found in}} an unusual location, such as the root of a tooth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enamel</b> is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of <b>enamel</b> consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of <b>enamel</b> varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the <b>enamel,</b> the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since <b>enamel</b> is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the <b>enamel</b> strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. <b>Enamel</b> varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of <b>enamel,</b> called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in <b>enamel</b> accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for <b>enamel</b> and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, <b>enamel</b> does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of <b>enamel</b> are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of <b>enamel</b> by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E

50|$|The <b>enamels</b> of the edging {{alternate}} with gemstones. In total {{there are}} five different motifs in five different colours. Eleven of the <b>enamels</b> have a carpet-like stepped pattern, seven <b>enamels</b> are divided into fields. In five <b>enamels</b> a diagonal cross is the motif, often featuring circular motifs with quatrefoil flowers. The remaining <b>enamels</b> feature modified quatrefoil flowers. Diagonal crosses, stepped patterns and quatrefoil flowers also occur as motifs on the Senkschmelz Cross. The colours employed are translucent bottle green and dark blue as well as opque white, red, jade green, turquoise, blue and yellow. Several of the <b>enamels</b> have a reversed counterpart, which is sometimes located opposite. It is probable {{that all of the}} <b>enamels</b> of the edging were originally paired, so that the appearance of the cross was less chaotic than it is today.|$|R
5|$|In {{the upper}} incisors, the chewing edges are located behind the {{vertical}} {{plane of the}} incisors; thus, they are opisthodont. The microstructure of the <b>enamel</b> of the lower incisor was reported in a 2005 study. The inner portion (portio interna, PI) is much thicker than the outer portion (portio externa, PE). The PI consists of Hunter-Schreger bands, which are uniserial (consisting of a single <b>enamel</b> prism), as in all myomorph rodents. The PE consists of radial <b>enamel,</b> with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the <b>enamel</b> and the dentine. The microstructure {{is similar to that}} of Holochilus brasiliensis and displays several characters seen only in Myomorpha.|$|E
5|$|Prismatic <b>enamel</b> - The <b>enamel</b> coating on {{the surface}} of a tooth {{consists}} of prisms, solid, rod-like structures extending from the dentin to the tooth's surface.|$|E
5|$|UA8653, the holotype, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2mm high, {{of which}} the crown makes up about 85%, and the {{dimensions}} of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2mm. The occlusal (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a V-shaped island of dentine surrounded by <b>enamel.</b> One side of the crown lacks <b>enamel.</b> Between the two arms of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with cementum, which extends {{all the way through}} the tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from Gondwanatherium. The <b>enamel</b> is made up of small, round prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of interprismatic matrix (IPM; the material between the <b>enamel</b> prisms).|$|E

5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: <b>enamel,</b> dentin, and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by <b>enamel)</b> — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and <b>enamel</b> layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E

5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in <b>enamel.</b> The incorporated fluoride makes <b>enamel</b> more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess teeth with {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of <b>enamel</b> on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does <b>enamel</b> show. Mysticetes have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes contain only one.|$|E

50|$|The badge {{depicts a}} golden kite, a {{messenger}} of the kami {{as described in}} the ancient Japanese chronicle Nihon Shoki, which helped Emperor Jimmu defeat his enemies in battle. The golden kite stands on an eight-pointed star with 32 rays <b>enameled</b> in red. Below the kite are two crossed ancient samurai shields, <b>enameled</b> blue, with two crossed swords <b>enameled</b> yellow, with silver hilts. On one side is a halberd (<b>enameled</b> green with white trappings), with the mitsu tomoe Shinto symbol on red banners. The reverse side is plain.|$|R
5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille <b>enamel</b> with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the <b>enamel</b> and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are <b>enamel</b> medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains <b>enamel</b> Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black <b>enamel,</b> with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E
5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between <b>enamel</b> or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of dentin {{is known as}} dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than <b>enamel,</b> it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increased}} interest in Kraków created by the film, the city bought Oskar Schindler's <b>Enamel</b> Factory in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Continued {{demand for}} {{enhancement}} of reliability and other performance characteristics has necessitated {{the development of}} highly heat resistant <b>enameled</b> wire. Organic/inorganic nanocomposites technology is seen as being useful in this regard, so we used a sol-gel process {{to develop a new}} type of highly heat-resistant <b>enameled</b> wire that has silica particles finely dispersed in polyimide. This product has a thermal index 280;, which exceeds the 240; thermal index of conventional <b>enameled</b> wire. The silica particles are evenly dispersed in the polyimide at nm order so that the wire's windability {{is similar to that of}} regular <b>enameled</b> wire comprising only an organic material layer. This new wire is expected to overcome the limitations of conventional <b>enameled</b> wire in the future...|$|R

40|$|Transparent and {{opaque glass}} <b>enamels</b> for {{aluminum}} plates were designed {{with a minimum}} or with no heavy atom oxides such as lead and bismuth oxides. The thermal properties of the <b>enamels</b> were studied by DTA and their stability {{as measured by the}} difference of glass transition and crystallization onset temperatures was determined. Bending and rapid deformation (impact) tests indicated the interfacial adhesion. The enamel/aluminum interfacial qualities were viewed and examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A large amount of NaF and P 2 O 5 in their formulation created opaque <b>enamels.</b> The three methods of melt dipping, pouring, and sintering were used to apply layers of <b>enamels</b> on aluminum plates. The novelty of the pouring and spreading method and its advantages over other methods, were in the use of lower stability and higher melting point <b>enamels,</b> without thermally/mechanically damaging the aluminum. Observations suggested that the interfacial contact and adhesion properties were good, particularly with the transparent or glassy state <b>enamels...</b>|$|R
5|$|Lavanify had high-crowned, curved teeth. One of the {{two teeth}} is 11.2mm high and shows a deep furrow and, is {{centered}} laterally in the crown, a V-shaped area that consists of dentine. The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8mm high and {{has at least one}} deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by the teeth of Lavanify and Bharattherium include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled hydroxyapatite crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the <b>enamel,</b> and perikymata—wave-like ridges and grooves in the <b>enamel</b> surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{diet and}} {{physiology}} of Edmontosaurus have been probed by using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen as recorded in tooth <b>enamel.</b> When feeding, drinking, and breathing, animals take in carbon and oxygen, which become incorporated into bone. The isotopes {{of these two}} elements are determined by various internal and external factors, such as the type of plants being eaten, the physiology of the animal, salinity, and climate. If isotope ratios in fossils are not altered by fossilization and later changes, they can be studied {{for information about the}} original factors; warmblooded animals will have certain isotopic compositions compared to their surroundings, animals that eat certain types of plants or use certain digestive processes will have distinct isotopic compositions, and so on. <b>Enamel</b> is typically used because the structure of the mineral that forms <b>enamel</b> makes it the most resistant material to chemical change in the skeleton.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of <b>enamel</b> {{on the front and}} little <b>enamel</b> on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp <b>enamel</b> edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a Raman spectroscopic study of the cloisonne' and basse-taille <b>enamels,</b> which beautify two Byzantine style {{bindings}} from the Marciana Library (Venice), namely the Lat. III, 111 and the MsGR. I. 53 codexes, are presented in this work. The first binding {{dates back to the}} 13 th century and was subject to an early restoration work in the 14 th century, when new <b>enamels</b> substituted four originals. The second binding, from the 15 th century, shows a lower number of <b>enamels,</b> all originals, and with a larger color palette. The white and yellow <b>enamels</b> of both codexes were successfully characterized and the red ones, where hematite was not used. Interestingly the white and yellow color of the 13 th century <b>enamels</b> of the Lat. III, 111 codex has been obtained by an ancient technique of the glass technology, which was already obsolete in the 13 th century, and is based on the use of calcium antimonate and Naples yellow. The white color in the other binding's <b>enamels</b> have been instead obtained by using cassiterite, according to the tradition of the time. Cassiterite was also mixed to Naples yellow in the <b>enamels</b> of the MsGR. I. 53 codex, to change the yellow hue. The identification of agents determining some colors is instead uncertain or not feasible by Raman spectroscopy. The transparency of the 14 th century <b>enamels</b> of the Lat. III, 111 codex has allowed the comparison of metal degradation below the <b>enamels</b> and in regions exposed to the atmosphere. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
