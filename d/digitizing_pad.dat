40|$|We {{describe}} a relatively inexpensive <b>digitizing</b> <b>pad,</b> available from Houston Instruments, {{for which we}} have written software which allows the direct reading of DNA (or RNA) sequencing gel autoradiographs. This eliminates several sources of error in nucleic acid sequencing, and renders computer analysis less cumbersome...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Previous {{studies in}} {{rehabilitation}} in poststroke hemiplegia {{have suggested that}} brief periods of bilateral train-ing improve subsequent unilateral performance of the paretic upper limb. The bilateral training protocol involved task-specific practice using both upper limbs simultaneously and homologously (such that they mirrored each other). This study aimed to determine {{the generalizability of the}} bilateral training phenomenon by replicating the work with different tasks, measures, and a different experimenter. Methods. Five single-case experiments were performed using a within-participant multiple-baseline design. Participants with post-stroke hemiplegia underwent 25 to 40 daily training sessions involving repetitive practice of 3 copying tasks. Pen move-ments were recorded on a <b>digitizing</b> <b>pad.</b> During the baseline phase, participants performed tasks unilaterally with thei...|$|E
40|$|QT {{dispersion}} {{from the}} 12 lead ECG {{has been extensively}} evaluated as a risk parameter in pts prone to arrhythmias. Usually, this parameter is assessed directly from the ECG tracing {{by means of a}} magnifying glass and a <b>digitizing</b> <b>pad</b> with reproducibility and accuracy not being optimal. We therefore developed a software program with a graphical interface permitting conversion of a scanned image of the ECG on paper to a digital ECG function (sampling rate 500 or 1000 Hz) which can then be analyzed by a second interactive computer program for standard ECG intervals, QT dispersion and other repolarization parameters (JTpeak, T areas, T peak to T end interval). Digitally available ECGs can also be converted to a format analyzable by the program. The respective signals are processed channel-by-channel with enlarged high resolution display on a 20 â€³ computer screen. The computer program uses customized algorithms to detect important features of the ECG waveforms (Q onset, J point, T peak, and T end for ECG signals) and then displays colored vertical spikes superimposed on the signal marking these points with high resolution for confirmation or manual correction by the observer. The processed data are automatically written to a spreadsheet for further processing. With this methodology accuracy and reproducibility of QT intervals and ECG parameters of dispersion of repolarization can be increased and parameters not easily measurable on paper can be determined (T wave areas) ...|$|E
40|$|The precise {{location}} and progression of anastomotic hyperplasia and its possible relationship to flow disturbances {{was investigated in}} femoro-femoral Dacron grafts in 28 dogs. In 13 grafts, the outflow from the end-to-side downstream anastomosis was bidirectional (BDO), and in 15 it was unidirectional (UDO) (distally). Grafts were electively removed at intervals of two to 196 days or {{at the time of}} thrombosis. Each anastomosis and adjacent artery was perfusion-fixed and sectioned sagittally. The mean sagittal section was projected onto a <b>digitized</b> <b>pad,</b> and the total area of hyperplasia internal to the arterial internal elastic lamina and within the adjacent graft was integrated by computer. The location of the hyperplasia was compared with previously established sites of flow separation and stagnation. The observation was made that hyperplasia is significantly greater at the downstream, as compared with the upstream, anastomosis in both groups (BDO = p less than 0. 001 and UDO = p less than 0. 001) (analysis of variance for independent groups). Furthermore, this downstream hyperplasia was progressive with time (BDO p less than 0. 01) (UDO p less than 0. 01); Spearman Rank Correlation. There was no significant increase in the extent of downstream hyperplasia where flow separation was known to be greater (BDO). Five grafts failed (three BDO, two UDO), as a result of complete occlusion of the downstream anastomosis by fibrous hyperplasia. Transmission electron microscopy showed the hyperplasia to consist of collagen-producing smooth muscle cells. Anastomotic hyperplasia is significantly greater at the downstream anastomosis, is progressive with time, and is the primary cause of failure of Dacron arterial grafts in this model. Quantitative analysis of downstream anastomotic hyperplasia may be a valuable measure of the biocompatibility of Dacron grafts...|$|R
