5|$|<b>Flamethrower,</b> {{double piston}} and gunpowder-activated: Although the single piston <b>flamethrower</b> was first {{developed}} in the Byzantine Empire during the 7th century, the 10th-century Chinese <b>flamethrower,</b> or Pen Huo Qi, boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing double piston syringes (which had been known since the Han Dynasty) spouting Greek fire which had been imported from China's maritime trade contacts in the Middle East. It was first used in battle 932 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and the earliest illustration {{is found in the}} early Song Dynasty military manuscript Wujing Zongyao of 1044, which also described the device in full. Unlike the Greek model which employed a furnace, the Pen Huo Qi was ignited by an incendiary gunpowder fuse.|$|E
5|$|The police {{return in}} force but are {{overwhelmed}} and repelled by the guests. They decide {{to let the}} party end naturally before moving in. T-Rick arrives armed with a <b>flamethrower</b> {{in an attempt to}} reclaim his gnome.

Thomas, Costa, J.B., and Dax flee with the other guests as Thomas' house burns and the SWAT team moves in to retake the neighborhood. The neighborhood is left aflame.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Monroe Parker (Yaphet Kotto) is the Nostromo chief engineer; Brett is his assistant. On the ship, he incessantly demands {{bonuses for}} {{investigating}} the Derelicts distress beacon. After Dallas' fateful {{confrontation with the}} Alien, Parker investigates and finds the <b>flamethrower</b> left behind. When Ash attacks Ripley, Parker and Lambert save her and decapitate the android. After Ripley extracts the meaning of Ash's directive to allow the crew to die, Parker uses the <b>flamethrower</b> to incinerate his remains. He and Lambert are killed by the Alien when it ambushes them {{in their attempt to}} flee aboard the shuttle, with the Alien crushing Parker and finishing him off with a head bite.|$|E

5|$|When the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union began on 22 June, the corps was equipped with 1,070 tanks, including 59 <b>flamethrower</b> tanks and 10 BT-2 tanks, and at least 493 BT-7s. On 26 June, it was ordered to move with the 16th Army to the Orsha and Smolensk area. After reaching Smolensk, it was subordinated to the 20th Army on 4 July for a counterattack to recapture Senno and Lepel {{in conjunction with the}} 7th Mechanised Corps.

5|$|Although Amanda gains {{access to}} a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, and a <b>flamethrower</b> {{over the course of}} the game, Alien: Isolation {{emphasizes}} evasion over direct combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. Fortunately, the player can also craft several items by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, among others. These items help the player deal with enemies and the alien. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in one particular direction. The alien is afraid of fire, so using the <b>flamethrower</b> or a molotov cocktail will force it to retreat into the station's ventilation system. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Nevertheless, the player can restore lost health using medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Koblenz Dallas (Tom Skerritt) is {{the captain}} of the Nostromo and the only human crew member with access to Mother, the onboard computer. When he {{receives}} a distress signal from the Derelict, an Engineer ship, Dallas steers the Nostromo off course to investigate the beacon. After the Alien hatches from Gilbert Kane's chest and murders Samuel Brett, Dallas enters the ship's air ducts to lure it to the airlock and eject it into space. He is attacked by the Alien and disappears – presumed dead – leaving only his <b>flamethrower.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some <b>flamethrowers</b> {{project a}} stream of ignited {{flammable}} liquid; some project a long gas flame. Most military <b>flamethrowers</b> use liquids, but commercial <b>flamethrowers</b> tend to use high-pressure propane and natural gas, which is considered safer. They are used by the military and by people needing controlled burning capacity, such as in agriculture (e.g., sugar cane plantations) or other such land management tasks. They can be designed to be either carried by the operator or mounted on a vehicle.|$|R
5|$|Players use melee attacks, {{firearms}} and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons {{such as the}} Micro Uzi, an M16 rifle and a <b>flamethrower.</b> The game's three-dimension environment allows a first-person view while aiming with the sniper rifle, rocket launcher and the M16 rifle. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways in a vehicle. The game gives players {{a wide variety of}} weapon options—they can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{incendiary}} liquids of {{the ancient}} and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents. World War I saw {{the development of the}} <b>flamethrower,</b> a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that could throw a large canister of inflammable liquid (it was soon used for poison gas instead).|$|E
5|$|The main {{antagonist}} of the series, Doctor Neo Cortex, is a mad {{scientist who}} created Crash Bandicoot among other characters and now seeks Crash's elimination along with world domination. The controlling force behind Cortex's plots for conquering {{the world is}} Uka Uka, the twin brother of Aku Aku. Four recurring villains from the series serve minor roles in the game: Doctor N. Gin, Cortex's main assistant; Doctor Nefarious Tropy, a scientist who specialises in time travel; Tiny Tiger, a hulking and ferocious thylacine; and Dingodile, a dingo-crocodile hybrid armed with a <b>flamethrower.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 25 September, {{the area}} {{occupied}} by the Lonsdale Force saw heavy fighting against self-propelled guns, <b>flamethrower</b> tanks, and infantry. There were no PIATs available to the force by now; instead Cain armed himself with a two-inch mortar. Mortars are muzzle-loading indirect fire weapons but Cain was forced to fire it on an almost horizontal plane due to the enemy's proximity. His citation states that his leadership ensured that the South Staffordshire gave no ground and drove the enemy off in complete disorder. By {{the end of the}} battle, Cain had been reportedly responsible for the destruction or disabling of six tanks, four of which were Tigers, {{as well as a number}} of self-propelled guns.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States' {{entry into}} World War II, Dean was {{promoted}} to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel in 1941, and colonel in 1942. He {{was promoted to}} brigadier general later that year and made head of the Requirements Division in 1943. He held this office only briefly, before being assigned as assistant commander of the US 44th Infantry Division, under Major Generals James I. Muir and Robert L. Spragins beginning in late 1943. The division was to sail for the European Theater and Dean went with them despite being injured shortly before departure in a <b>flamethrower</b> accident which {{claimed the lives of}} two other soldiers. Dean was promoted to major general in late 1943.|$|E
5|$|Gunnery Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews) is {{the squad}} {{leader of the}} Colonial Marines sent to {{investigate}} LV-426. During the first incursion into the atmospheric processor, he enforces Gorman's orders not to use pulse rifle and smartgun ammunition. Shortly after finding a surviving, cocooned colonist whose chest bursts to reveal an Alien, Apone grabs a <b>flamethrower</b> from Frost to incinerate it. In the subsequent Alien attack, he is captured alive. Hudson later states that the life sign computer readouts indicate that Apone was not killed in the attack; presumably impregnated by an Alien, he died when the atmosphere processor exploded or from an Alien gestating in his body.|$|E

5|$|Hadji Ali (c.1887–92– November5, 1937) was a {{vaudeville}} performance artist, {{thought to}} be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation. His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene, and then acting by turns as a human <b>flamethrower</b> and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed.|$|E

In October, a new 13th Mechanised Brigade was formed in Kaluga. On 7 May 1938, the corps' Separate Tank Battalion became the Moscow Military District's 4th Light Tank Regiment. In August 1938, the corps was converted into the 15th Tank Corps when the Red Army reorganized its mechanized forces to make them more tank-heavy.|$|E
5|$|Saints Row IV was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in North America on August 20, 2013, and worldwide on three days later. Preorders included a patriot-themed downloadable content pack that included <b>flamethrower,</b> dubstep, and rocket launcher weapons, a bald eagle jet, and an Uncle Sam outfit.

5|$|The Egyptians {{proceeded}} {{to clear the}} bunkers. They utilized <b>flamethrower</b> teams, which had a visible psychological impact on the fort's garrison. At one point, the Egyptians, {{with the help of}} a wounded Israeli prisoner, managed to secure a bunker by convincing the panicked Israelis inside to come out and surrender. Soon after losing contact with the fort, the Israelis attempted to reach it once more. By this time, Malhov was dead. A group of tanks from Baluza advanced to Lahtzanit, but the Sa'iqa company occupying the firing ramp managed to destroy two tanks, forcing the remainder to retreat. Another group of tanks and half-tracks tried to break through the southern isolation force, but were ambushed and withdrew after losing a tank.|$|E
5|$|The {{assistant}} US divisional commander, Brigadier General William A. McCulloch, {{arrived in}} the afternoon to begin directing the battle on Hill 206, and afterwards reinforcements {{in the form of}} <b>flamethrower</b> teams from the 132nd Infantry Regiment also arrived. In the afternoon American forces attempted to regain the South Knob. While this effort was initially successful and led to the extraction of several American soldiers who had been isolated on the position, by late afternoon the US units had been forced to withdraw to the North Knob. The fighting on Hill 206 died down in the evening of 11March as neither the Japanese nor US forces attempted any offensive action, although Muda took the opportunity to concentrate his forces completely in occupation of the South Knob and established several pillboxes overnight.|$|E
