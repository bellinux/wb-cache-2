40|$|Although not a {{new concept}} in {{academic}} literature, <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> is recently gaining increased attention from scholars and policymakers. Technological developments and social evolutions cause profound {{changes in the way}} people use the media. Recent reports on ICT penetration indicate that even though in most Western European countries a majority of the population has access to computers, Internet and other new media technologies, there are still huge differences in the frequency of use and the different ways in which people use these new media in their daily lives. These new emerging digital inequalities is related to differences in the <b>level</b> of <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> among the Internet population. Starting from Livingstone’s conceptualization of (<b>digital)</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy,</b> this paper gives a definition of <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> and a conceptual model of how to measure <b>media</b> <b>literacy.</b> This model makes clear that a good understanding of <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> requires research into people’s motivations, experiences, attitudes, skills, social resources and other factors that shape their use of new media. This conceptual model will be the first step in our research towards the development of a multi-method measurement instrument for monitoring people’s <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>levels</b> in a social media culture. In the conclusion, we give a preview of the next steps in our research...|$|R
40|$|While new {{technology}} continues {{to develop and}} become increasingly affordable, and students have increased access to <b>digital</b> <b>media,</b> one might wonder if requiring such technology {{in the classroom is}} akin to throwing the car keys to a teen-ager who has not completed a driver’s education course. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a valid and reliable quantitative survey providing accurate data about the <b>digital</b> online <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> of university-level students in order to better understand how <b>digital</b> online <b>media</b> can and should be used within a teaching/learning environment at a university. This study identifies core constructs of <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> as recognized by noted researchers including ethical awareness, media access, media awareness, media evaluation, and media production. Because of the familiarity with media technology by today’s traditional higher education students and the expectation to incorporate these tools in the classroom, the digital divide that once was separated by socio-economic status may be shifting instead to divide generations. While this study is confined to the creation of the instrument, the survey – in the future – is intended to measure <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>levels</b> in both university students and faculty to determine if differences exist between those two groups and to better understand how <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> can and should be used within a teaching/learning environment at a university. Using a 12 -step process, the study resulted in a 50 -item instrument allowing a quantitative measurement of <b>digital</b> online <b>media</b> <b>literacy.</b> Results repeatedly showed a reliable instrument when viewed as a whole, with individual constructs indicating varying degrees of reliability on their own.

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{dimensions}} of <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy,</b> {{this study aims}} {{to look at the}} aspect of 2 ̆ 7 device literacy 2 ̆ 7. <b>Digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> can be defined as the ability to access, understand and create content using <b>digital</b> <b>media.</b> It is a multi-dimensional concept consisting of various skills and competency in using <b>digital</b> <b>media.</b> Due to the rapid changes in technological environment, <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> is not generally acquired through formal education systems but within the home or through personal networks of peer groups. This study examines young people 2 ̆ 7 s <b>level</b> of device <b>literacy</b> and how each dimension is related to each other. Technology access, use and skills are essential to communicate in an increasingly networked world. Young people spend a tremendous amount of time and energy online. However, {{it is not clear how}} much of that time is spent using technologies that benefit their <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy.</b> Part of the rationale guiding policy initiatives is to provide digital technology access to everyone equally. However, providing access to technologies is not a sufficient condition of acquiring adequate skills. As well as access, both formal and informal education is necessary in order to gain competent <b>levels</b> of <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy.</b> In this study, the relationship between different dimensions of <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> is explored specifically within the dimension of device literacy, with an attempt to explain how access to technologies is related to the use and understanding of content. There have been few studies that empirically examine the process of acquiring the literacies and this study will shed light on how young people experiment with new technologies and eventually develop their digital literacy skill...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of this study, we see that {{teachers}} need in-service training for classes in media literacy; the <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> lesson is adequate in terms of content but inadequate as an activity. Students indicated significant changes in their perceptions of media after taking this lesson. A «Media <b>Literacy</b> <b>Level</b> Scale» was applied {{in order to determine the}} <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>levels</b> of the students, and a «Media Literacy Attitude Scale» was used to measure the <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> status of students. The information on students was obtained through the «Private Information Form» developed by the researchers. As {{a result of}} this research, a positive, low-level and significant relationship was found between the students’ attitude <b>levels</b> on <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> lessons and their <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>levels.</b> The study’s conclusion is that there is no significant difference between the <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> classes taken by the primary school second grade students and their attitudes on <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> in the classroom and their <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>levels.</b> Also, no significant difference was found between the educational levels of the parents of these second graders and their attitudes on <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> classes and their <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>levels.</b> However, there was a significant difference between the students’ daily newspaper reading habits and the frequency that these second graders listened to the radio and their attitudes on <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> classes and <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

The study wishes to explore the interpretations of students as they become creators and producers of their own learning and how pedagogies may need to change across the curriculum. The proposed participants in this study are school students, teachers, academic lecturers and media students from different socio-economic groups in the Sydney and Greater Western Sydney areas. The researcher in this study will look at digital artifacts such as the Learning Federation learning objects and student’s use of Adobe CS 4 and other multimedia software, where students and teachers construct their own learning to evaluate a new pedagogical practice in teaching. In addition, the social software’s such as Facebook and MySpace will also be addressed to determine changes in pedagogies in regards to collaboration in the classroom.

40|$|Although <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> is {{recognized}} as the essential competencies required for living in a new media age, it just starts to gain focus in Taiwan's elementary education. One {{of the reasons is}} examination-oriented education, with the result that diverts scarce resources away from this informal learning. The other reason is that educators tend to think <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> education as a series of purely technical operation, which might lead student <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> learning to mindless work. Therefore, this study designed a media exhibition based on Kolb's experiential learning model for teaching students concepts of stop-motion films and techniques of film production. A design experiment involved 247 third-grade elementary students that were grouped to visit the experiential exhibition. The findings suggest that the students have improved their knowledge of stop-motion films. Analysis of these produced films also shows that they have improved their media ability to represent their ideas and communicate with others. Through the analysis of the influence of demographics on the knowledge test, the findings revealed that the experiential exhibition is more effective for female elementary students and students' relevant previous experiences may not affect their acquired knowledge. Given those results and observations, we believe that the proposed experiential exhibition is a promising way to carry out <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> education in elementary schools.
