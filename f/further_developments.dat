5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there were}} so many {{uncritical}} and unproven speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with <b>further</b> <b>developments</b> in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E

5|$|In any event, the Lithuanians {{were not}} {{prepared}} to accept Christianity, and Mindaugas's baptism had little impact on <b>further</b> <b>developments.</b> The {{majority of the population}} and the nobility remained pagan; his subjects were not required to convert. The cathedral he had built in Vilnius was superseded by a pagan temple, and all the diplomatic achievements made after his coronation were lost, although the practice of Christianity and intermarriage were well tolerated.|$|E
5|$|In {{his initial}} {{negotiations}} with Willamette Week, Goldschmidt agreed to resign his positions with the Texas Pacific Group and the Board of Higher Education, which he did.

Burtchaell in keeping his molestation of the girl a secret. In return, Goldschmidt gave his support to Burtchaell's (unsuccessful) bid to extend a lease for a houseboat moorage on the Willamette River.|$|E

5|$|The first Formula Three Brabham, the BT9, {{won only}} four major races in 1964. The BT15 which {{followed}} in 1965 {{was a highly}} successful design. 58 cars were sold, which won 42 major races. <b>Further</b> <b>developments</b> of the same concept, including wings {{by the end of}} the decade, were highly competitive up until 1971. The BT38C of 1972 was Brabham's first production monocoque and the first not designed by Tauranac. Although 40 were ordered, it was less successful than its predecessors. The angular BT41 was the final Formula Three Brabham.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} {{in light of}} his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum.

In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E

More details of the sale were released {{at the end of}} July, with the club announcing that they intended to sell 16.7million shares (approximately 10% of the club) at between $16 and $20 each, raising up to $330million (£210million). Shares in the club would be divided into two groups, with Class A shares sold to the public and Class B shares retained by the Glazer family.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the wide-body 747, Boeing began considering <b>further</b> <b>developments</b> of its narrow-body 727 trijet. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Highland Airways {{looked into the}} {{possibility}} of including Stroma in the hospital ambulance plane service that was then in operation. On 19 August 1937, Captain Fresson of Highland Airways landed a small aircraft in farmland adjoining the Mains of Stroma, and the following spring the islanders cleared an area of moorland {{on the west side}} of the island to create an airstrip. The first official flight landed in June 1938. However, the Second World War prevented any <b>further</b> <b>developments</b> and a regular service was not established. After the war, Highland Airways was taken over by British European Airways, which abandoned any interest in serving the island.|$|E

5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding <b>further</b> <b>developments.</b> In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E
5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency to darken the colours, so they took back the game and made <b>further</b> <b>developments</b> on it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the stadium}} was {{expected}} to start in late 2007 and finish {{in time for the}} 2010 season. Planning permission for the first stage of developments was granted on 7 April 2008 and work on the new players' block was planned to commence in the summer of 2008. It was decided to not start building until permission had been received for all phases of the development including the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand. In October 2008, the project was put on hold by the club {{as a result of the}} global economic crisis restricting available funds. Revised plans were revealed in November 2009, with further announcements expected in early 2010. However <b>further</b> <b>developments</b> may be further delayed due to the club's relegation from the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|A plan {{to upgrade}} the {{waterways}} to allow the use of 300 to 500-tonne boats {{led to the formation}} of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Limited in November 1888. The cost of the scheme was estimated to be around £1million, in addition to the cost of acquiring the canals from the railway company. The new company obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, creating the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, which was authorised to raise £1.5million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation, or by compulsory purchase if negotiations failed. The railway company was unwilling to sell, and it was not until 1895, after protracted negotiation and legal battles that the transfer was agreed. The Navigation Company had only succeeded in raising £625,000, which was less than the purchase price of the canals, and therefore the railway company nominated half of the ten directors, while the Aire and Calder Company declined to buy any shares because of railway influence. Many of the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system were hindered by a lack of capital, although some <b>further</b> <b>developments</b> took place.|$|E
5|$|It {{took some}} time before a Bishop of Lithuania was {{appointed}} because of various conflicts of interest. The Bishop of Gniezno appointed Vito (Lithuanian: Vitas), a monk of the Dominican Order, to this position, {{but he was not}} recognized by Mindaugas or accepted by the populace. The activities of Vito in Lithuania are unknown, although he is sometimes associated with Mindaugas' Cathedral. Finally, in 1254, Christian (Lithuanian: Kristijonas) from the Livonian Order was appointed. Mindaugas endowed him with some lands in Samogitia, but not much is known about his activities. Historical sources do not mention any sponsorship of missionaries, education of priests, or construction of churches during that time, and Bishop Christian went back to Germany in 1259, where he died in 1271. The establishment of Mindaugas' Cathedral remains problematic, but recent archeological research found the remains of a 13th-century brick building {{on the site of the}} present-day Vilnius Cathedral. The general assumption is that the remains are those of Mindaugas Cathedral, built to satisfy the agreement with the pope. However, as later events showed, Lithuanians resisted Christianization, and Mindaugas' baptism had only a temporary impact on <b>further</b> <b>developments.</b>|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous {{materials in the}} 1940s, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it provided faster welding time compared to other welding processes. The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. <b>Further</b> <b>developments</b> during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more versatility and as a result, it became a highly used industrial process. Today, GMAW {{is the most common}} industrial welding process, preferred for its versatility, speed and the relative ease of adapting the process to robotic automation. Unlike welding processes that do not employ a shielding gas, such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of air volatility. A related process, flux cored arc welding, often does not use a shielding gas, but instead employs an electrode wire that is hollow and filled with flux.|$|E
