25|$|The {{number of}} loci in a {{vertebrate}} species {{has been estimated}} at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at {{most of them are}} very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more,</b> for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.|$|E

500|$|However, O'Connor {{remarked that}} American audiences might find the [...] "languorous walks across meadows" [...] and [...] "ornately choreographed dances" [...] of the British {{production}} too slow. In {{one of the}} most negative reviews, People Magazine considered the adaptation [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> thorough than necessary" [...] and [...] "not the best Austen on the suddenly crowded market". Although the reviewer thought Firth [...] "magnificent", he rebuked the casting of Jennifer Ehle as her oval face made her [...] "look like Anaïs Nin in period clothes, and that ain't right". The official A Network magazine summarised a year later that [...] "critics praised the lavish production, audiences adored it, and women everywhere swooned over Darcy. So much, in fact, that newspapers began to joke about 'Darcy fever.'" [...] Commendation for the serial continued in the years following its original transmission.|$|E

500|$|The Tagora´s {{handling}} {{was deemed}} [...] "on the good side", wrote Autocar, and performance {{was described as}} [...] "good but not outstanding". As such the car lay [...] "uneasily close to being listed as under-engined" [...] though the authors conceded that generally the Tagora did not feel under-engined when in use. LJK Setright dissented saying the Tagora was as [...] "refined in its ride as should be expected of it" [...] and that [...] "the car also has a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> road-holding and cornering than might be expected". However, in December 1981 Car magazine judged the car (2.2 GLS model) {{to be prone to}} [...] "untidy" [...] handling, tending to under-steer first followed by excessive over-steer. The magazine made a particular note of the advantage in handling and grip enjoyed by the older live-axled Volvo 244, underlining the point about the Tagora's lack of advantage in terms of road manners.|$|E

500|$|During the war, McKinley also {{pursued the}} {{annexation}} of the Republic of Hawaii. The new republic, dominated by business interests, had overthrown the Queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself. There was strong American support for annexation, {{and the need}} for Pacific bases in wartime became clear after the Battle of Manila. McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation, and lobbied Congress to act, warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter-revolution or a Japanese takeover. Foreseeing difficulty in getting two-thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation, McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress. The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins, and McKinley signed it into law on July 8, 1898. McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes, [...] "McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii, showing... a firmness in pursuing it"; the President told Cortelyou, [...] "We need Hawaii just as much and a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> than we did California. It is manifest destiny." ...|$|E

500|$|Of Wolfgang's music {{composed}} {{during the}} tour, around thirty pieces survive. A number of [...] works are lost, including the Zürich cello pieces and several symphonies. The surviving works include the keyboard sonatas written in Paris, London and The Hague, four symphonies, various arias, the assorted music {{written for the}} Prince of Orange, a Kyrie, and other minor pieces. Mozart's career as a symphonist began in London where, {{in addition to the}} direct influences of Abel and J.C. Bach, he would have heard symphonies from leading London composers including Thomas Arne, William Boyce and Giuseppe Sammartini"a nearly ideal introduction to the genre", according to Zaslaw. The earliest symphonies, Zaslaw points out, while not in the same class as the later Mozart masterpieces, are comparable in length, complexity and originality to those written at the same time by the acknowledged symphonic masters of the day. Indeed, Abel's Symphony No. 6 in E Flat was similar enough in style and technique to be mistaken as Mozart's, and is listed as such (Symphony No. 3, K. 18) in the original Köchel catalogue. Sadie observes that the K. 22 symphony composed in The Hague is a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated than the earlier ones which were written in London.|$|E
500|$|White Dog {{quickly became}} a bestseller in the United States after its English release. Phoebe Adams of The Atlantic felt the story was ironic, and noted that it was [...] "presumably" [...] true. She felt the {{depiction}} of Marlon Brando was [...] "tartly funny" [...] and that story as a whole served [...] "as an excuse for Mr. Gary's comments on racial affairs in this country, a matter on which is somewhat less pessimistic than the natives and a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> sensible." [...] The Globe and Mails H. J. Kirchhoff considered it a [...] "riveting, thoughtful work" [...] {{that serves as a}} metaphor for American racism. Julien Roumette felt Romain's depiction of the racial tensions in America at the time was [...] "meticulously reconstituted, with a realistic, even documentary, rather exceptional dimension." [...] Julia Weldon of Harper's Magazine remarked with amusement that the events of the novel were ones that [...] "only a Frenchman" [...] could have found himself in. She felt the novel was a [...] "decathlon event" [...] in which Gary turned a [...] "household crisis into a full-scale allegory." [...] Overall, she praised the book as a [...] "memorable portrait of guilt and largess in black and white", noting she felt Gary had lived to [...] "witness his own maturity" [...] though she also wondered if he stretched the truth to [...] "make himself a legend in his own time." [...] It should be noted that all of these commentators are white and not in the least African-American nor have they lived the Black experience.|$|E

5000|$|Combat is {{affected}} by several random factors. In addition to simulating dice rolls to determine damage, a variety of influences including hero abilities and special bonuses determine a unit's luck and morale ratings, which affect the likelihood of those units triggering a bonus during combat. A unit that triggers <b>good</b> luck <b>deals</b> <b>more</b> (or receives less) damage, and a unit that triggers high morale receives an extra turn. In some other games, luck and morale can also be negative, with opposite corresponding effects. Luck and morale can be improved by hero abilities, artifacts, and spells. Morale may suffer with overwhelming odds in combat or by mixing incompatible unit types (e.g. Chaos with Order.) ...|$|R
