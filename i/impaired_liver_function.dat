30|$|The amine transferases GOT and GPT are {{distributed}} in {{blood in the}} liver and spleen of fish bodies. While they maintain low activity when the fish body is healthy, they are released {{in the presence of}} tissue necrosis or diseases, resulting in increased activity (Min et al. 2003). GOT was observed to increase in trout when stress was induced with rapid changes of the salinity in the feeding water (Chang and Hur 1999). Juvenile black sea breams also showed increased GOT with acute salt stress (Min et al. 2003). Significantly increased GOT was found in adult and juvenile Paralichthys olivaceus in response to acute stress from low salt levels in the feeding water (Her et al. 2002). Her et al. (2002) reported that this was due to <b>impaired</b> <b>liver</b> <b>functions</b> owing to physiological burdens on liver and spleen cells and excess energy consumption. However, although we observed a decrease in GOT and an increase in GPT, results that differed from previous studies, we were able to confirm that the stress due to air exposure negatively influenced <b>liver</b> <b>functions.</b> The FSM groups had especially high GPT levels compared to the control group. Even though such a difference is considered to mainly be caused by vitamin C concentrations, it showed higher values in the supplement group with greater than FSM 10 % than the control group. It is therefore expected that FSM functional substances such as collagen have positive effects that promote the quick recover of energy metabolism following <b>impaired</b> <b>liver</b> <b>functions.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Praziquantel is well absorbed (about 80%) {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract.

In patients with significantly <b>impaired</b> <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> (Child-Pugh score B and C), the serum half-life is increased to 3 to 8 hours. Praziquantel and its metabolites are mainly excreted renally; within 24 h after a single oral dose, 70 to 80% is found in urine, but less than 0.1% as the unchanged drug. Praziquantel is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 pathway via CYP3A4.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Liver and biliary {{abnormalities}} are well-known {{complications of}} {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD). It {{has been suggested that}} using total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may further <b>impair</b> <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> in these patients; this seems not to be so with total enteral nutrition (TEN). However, prospec-tive trials comparing the incidence of <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> test (LFT) abnormalities with either TPN or TEN have not been carried out. Twenty-nine IBD inpatients with normal LFT, random-ized to receive either TEN with a polymeric diet or isocaloric, isonitrogenous "all-in-one " TPN because of protein-energy malnutrition and/or severe disease, were included in the study. Sixteen patients (five with ulcerative colitis and 11 with Crohn’s disease) received TEN, and 13 patients (eight ulcera-tive colitis and five Crohn’s disease) were on TPN.

30|$|In {{accordance}} with other studies [10, 17], ICU stay was significantly prolonged {{in patients with}} AKI; 28 -day mortality rate in patients with AKI was 40  % in the total study cohort. In contrast, AKI in HH was associated with significantly higher 28 -day mortality rates exceeding 60  % by far. The high mortality rates are in part attributable to the severity of illness reflected by high SAPS and SOFA scores on ICU admission. Yet, AKI, the presence of septic shock and peak INR values during HH were independent predictors of mortality in HH patients. Furthermore, we observed a synergistic effect of HH and AKI resulting in longer stay and increased mortality at the ICU. One reason for that observation may be the described systemic effects of AKI, which may further <b>impair</b> <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> [28].|$|R

Methods: eight non-diabetic obese adults were restricted for daily energy intake (800 kcal) and low carbohydrate ( 0. 05).

40|$|Background/Aims: Intermittent {{ischemia}} (INT) {{can improve}} <b>liver</b> <b>function</b> following inflow occlusion. The {{aim was to}} test {{whether the number of}} cycles of INT can be increased without <b>impairing</b> <b>liver</b> <b>function.</b> Methods: <b>Liver</b> <b>function</b> in the acute phase of ischemia reperfusion injury was assessed by measuring bile flow in rat livers. Phospholipid and bile salts in bile, liver marker enzymes in blood, and liver histology were measured. Aged livers were compared with young livers. Results: Clamping for 45 min reduced postperfusion bile flow to 13 % of the initial value compared with 88 +/- 5 % for control livers (means +/- SEM, n = 5 - 8), and substantially reduced the phospholipid: bile salt ratio in bile. Application of 3, 4, 5 and 6 cycles of INT (15 min) restored bile flow to 70 +/- 11, 61 +/- 4, 48 +/- 2 and 35 +/- 3 % (p < 0. 01) of the initial value, respectively, and restored the phospholipid: bile salt ratio. Multiple cycles of INT were less effective in aged rats. Conclusion: Several cycles of INT, through promotion of bile flow recovery and reduction in the cytotoxic actions of bile salts, may provide an effective clinical strategy for increasing clamping time in liver resections.
