40|$|The {{growth of}} {{electricity}} generated by renewables increases the intermittency of the Dutch electricity production. To deal with this, the Dutch power system requires a higher amount of {{flexibility in the}} future. Demand response <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> {{is one of the}} options with a high potential to provide flexibility, because it offers the potential to store energy close to demand. In this thesis, the potential for electricity cost reduction with demand response <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> for space <b>heating</b> by using the thermal inertia of buildings in the Netherlands is investigated. The effect of different heat load profiles, seasonality, and different comfort requirements on the economic potential demand response <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> is analysed. An existing Matlab model is revised and expanded to perform simulations with different cluster types, seasons and predefined comfort limits. The model simulates the DR algorithm, R. E. X., and shifts the load of clusters based upon their thermal demand and the EPEX market prices within the predefined technical and consumer flexibility constraints, to analyse the potential of operational cost reductions of DR <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> Therefore, the key input parameters of the model are: (1) the thermal demand, (2) electricity market prices, and (3) the flexibility constraints. The key output parameters are: (1) the operational savings in euro, (2) the operational savings in percentage, and (3) the amount of shifted load. The model design, behaviour and results are validated with an expert validation. It is concluded, that DR <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> can facilitate flexible balancing of supply and demand by aggregators in the Netherlands. The potential of DR <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> for different stakeholders can increase depending upon the penetration of RES-E, <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> and EVs. Current obstacles for the development of DR of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are the high share of fixed energy taxes and the reduced efficiency and lifetime of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> when DR is used. Designing flexible tariffs and a focus on flexibility in the re-design of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> can take these obstacles away. Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{assessing}} {{the value of}} load shifting and demand side flexibility for improving electric grid system operations. In particular, this study investigates to what extent residential <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> participating in load shifting can contribute to reducing operational costs and CO 2 CO 2 emissions associated with electric power generation and how home owners <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems can be best motivated to achieve these flexibility benefits. Residential <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> when intelligently orchestrated in their operation, can lower operational costs and CO 2 CO 2 emissions by performing load shifting {{in order to reduce}} curtailment of electricity from renewable energy sources and improve the efficiency of dispatchable power plants. In order to study the interaction, both the electricity generation system and residences <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are modeled. In a first step, an integrated modeling approach is presented which represents the idealized case where the electrical grid operation in terms of unit commitment and dispatch is concurrently optimized with that {{of a large number of}} residential <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> located in homes designed to low-energy design standards. While this joint optimization approach does not lend itself for real-time implementation, it serves as an upper bound for the achievable operational cost savings. The main focus of this paper is to assess to what extent load shifting incentives are able to achieve the aforementioned savings potential. Two types of incentives are studied: direct load control and dynamic time-of-use pricing. Since both the electricity generation supply system and the residential building stock <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> had been modeled for the joint optimization, the performance of both load shifting incentives can be compared by separately {{assessing the}} supply and demand side. Superior performance is noted for the direct-load control scenario, achieving 60 – 90 % of the cost savings attained in the jointly optimized best-case scenario. In dynamic time-of-use pricing, poor performance in terms of reduced cost and emissions is noted when the <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> response is not taken into account. When the <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> response is taken into account, dynamic time-of-use pricing performs better. However, both dynamic time-of-use pricing schemes show inferior performance at high levels of residential <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> penetration. status: publishe...|$|R

The experiments carried out allowed to determine the optimum vapor pressure of compression, providing the column operation without the heating steam supply. At a slight overpressure of vapor the optimal compression ratio is 3. 4 – 3. 7 kPa, the pressure after the compressor is 352 – 376 kPa; in the bottom part of column at the atmospheric pressure the optimal compression pressure is 303 – 325 kPa, the compression ratio is 4. 0 – 4. 4.

The purpose of this work is to identify promising areas for the development of this type of renewable energy.

To determine the geothermal potential, Ground Source Heat Exchanger (GSHE) coupled <b>with</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> was used to supply a fixed demand equivalent to the energy required to heat a Chilean standard house.
