40|$|To make a web {{warehouse}} {{reflect the}} real web accurately, {{we should keep}} timeliness, freshness and consistency for the webviews. This paper <b>fouses</b> <b>on</b> one important part of webview maintenance – mutual consistency between webviews, which is formally named as multiple webview consistency (abbreviated as MVC). Although the same problem has been well studied in a traditional data warehouse, however, {{it has never been}} considered for a web warehouse. Since data sources in a web warehousing environment do not propagate base data changes to the information consumers, which is different from the case in the traditional data warehouses, it is not feasible to keep complete mutal consistency between the webviews in web warehouses. In this paper we introduce the Interrelated-MVC, a new term based on the features of the web environment. We show that it is enough to keep Interrelated-MVC in web warehouses. After that we present the algorithms which guarantee Interrelated-MVC and are scaleable to the vertiginous real web...|$|R
40|$|Masters Research - Masters of Philosophy (MPhil) Direct oil {{painting}} methodologies are simple in their application and optical effects compared to indirect layering systems, particularly the procedures {{developed during the}} Renaissance. Today, modern painting mediums alter oil paint’s flow and drying characteristics by using ingredients which are unnecessarily complex and mainly based on solvent usage; creating a health-hazardous environment. However, when a selection of some natural materials are combined, tested and amalgamated with ancient and modern painting processes direct painting methodologies are invested with {{a wider range of}} optical interplay. Thus by paying closer attention to the relationship between the artist’s tools and substances, modern and traditional painting systems are deepened and expanded. The outcome is that the relationship between the artist’s pictorial intentions and the means to achieve them are synchronised. Therefore, this research found, through an active professional painting practice, that there exists a highly symbiotic, richer, and more fluid relationship between ideas and materials, when using a direct {{oil painting}} methodology which <b>fouses</b> <b>on</b> its physical means of expression...|$|R
40|$|Gram-negative plant {{pathogenic}} bacteria {{possess a}} type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to inject bacterial proteins, called type III effectors (T 3 Es), into host cells through a specialized syringe structure. T 3 Es are virulence {{factors that can}} suppress plant immunity {{but they can also}} converely be recognized by the plant and trigger specific resistance mechanisms. The T 3 SS and injected T 3 Es {{play a central role in}} determining the outcome of a host-pathogen interaction. Still little is known in plant pathogens on the assembly of the T 3 SS and the regulatory mechanisms involved in the temporal control of its biosynthesis and T 3 E translocation. However, recent insights point out the role of several proteins as prime candidates in the role of regulators of the type III secretion (T 3 S) process. In this review we report on the most recent advances on the regulation of the T 3 S by <b>fousing</b> <b>on</b> protein players involved in secretion/translocation regulations, including type III chaperones (T 3 Cs), type III secretion substrate specificity switch (T 3 S 4) proteins and other T 3 S orchestrators...|$|R
40|$|School {{organization}} {{research and}} research <b>on</b> teaching have <b>foused</b> <b>on</b> {{different aspects of}} schools and accumulated results to improve school effectiveness. Adovocates of Effective Schools research {{argue that it is}} necessary to integrate these two lines of research. Little is known, however, about the relationship between teachers' perception of their workplace, their educational belief, and their classroom instuructional behavior. This article investigates this issue. A questionnare survey to public elementary school teachers was earned out in November, 1992. Preliminary analysis indicates that educational beliefs of teachers are least influenced by sex or experience. As to sex difference, female teachers evaluated principals less favorable than male counterparts, although overall ratings of principals' leadership were siginificantly lower than other orgnaizational features. As to experience, the data suggests that perceptions of school organization are more critical among 35 - 39 and 40 - 44 age groups. 35 - 39 age group shows lower scores in classroom instructional behaviors. This may imply some change in their role expectation occurs in this age group (35 - 39) and they can allocate less efforts for classrooms in order to learn new skills and techniques to implement their roles effectively. Factor analysis shows that 13 factors contributed to variation of answers. A prelimary model for further analysis is presented...|$|R
40|$|Background: In daily {{practice}} serum creatinine measurement still {{often used}} as an idex of renal function. The sensitivity of this test however is low. A number of prediction equations {{have been developed to}} estimate the GFR using serum creatinine and some other variables. Of all those equations the Cockroft-Gault forumla and the MDRD formula have been studied most. Questions: Which formula estimates GFR most accurately? Which formula can be implemented easily in daily general practice? Methods: We retrospectively collected data from the Intego database of all patients witha known weight, serum creatinine, age and gender. Only patients older than 20 years were enrolled. The GFR was estimated by using the CG and the MDRD equation. We analysed the prevalence of a decreased kidney function in function of age and sex using the five stages of the American Natinal Kidney Founation guidelines. We <b>foused</b> <b>on</b> differences in estimated GFR between the two formulas. Results: Required data were known fromm 9969 persons, of whitch 5442 patiens were woman and 4527 were men. The average GFR was 90 ml/min (Sd 33, 55) estimated by the CG formula and 80 ml/min/ 1, 73 m 2 (SD 20, 32) estimated by the MDRD formula. The two formulas classified 88 % of all patients within the same stage. Differences in classification were most pronounced for patients being 80 years and older (only 54 % of those patients were classifed within the same stage). Conclusion: The MDRD formula in general is a more accurate estimation in comparison with the CG formula. The MDRD formula only requires serum creatinine, age and sex, without the need to know patient's weight. We propopose all laboratories to mention the estimated FGR next to te serum creatinine value. status: publishe...|$|R
