40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on microcrystalline wax (<b>E</b> <b>905)</b> when used as a food additive. Microcrystalline wax (<b>E</b> <b>905)</b> is authorised quantum satis as a surface treatment agent on non-chocolate confectionery, chewing gum and decorations, coatings and fillings, except fruit based fillings. It is also permitted as a surface treatment of melons, papaya, mango and avocado. The substance was evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1990 and 1995 and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the latest in 1995. The JECFA established a group ADI of 20 mg/kg bw/day for mineral oils, paraffins and microcrystalline waxes. The Panel noted that all mineral oil products accumulated in tissues in a dose- and time-dependent manner {{with the exception of}} microcrystalline waxes. The Panel concluded that there is no concern for genotoxicity from microcrystalline wax (<b>E</b> <b>905).</b> The Panel also considered that the available toxicity studies with mineral hydrocarbons, closely related from a chemical point of view with microcrystalline waxes, consistently reported no effects of concern associated with the intake of microcrystalline wax. The Panel further concluded that since no long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies with microcrystalline wax <b>E</b> <b>905</b> were available, no ADI could be established. The Panel also concluded that the conservative exposure estimates to microcrystalline wax (<b>E</b> <b>905)</b> from its use at maximum permitted level (following quantum satis rules), resulted in a sufficient margin of safety compared to the NOAEL established by the Panel for the closely related high viscosity mineral oils, and therefore the use microcrystalline wax (<b>E</b> <b>905)</b> as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern...|$|E

Los resultados se estratificaron por grupos de edad. Las frecuencias de muertes por picaduras de alacrán se compararon mediante el riesgo relativo (RR) y sus intervalos de confianza de 95 % (IC 95 %). RESULTADOS: Entre 1979 y 2003, en México se registraron 6 077 muertes por picaduras de alacrán. Se observó una tendencia descendente estadísticamente significativa en la mortalidad estandarizada (beta = - 0, 195; P OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the trends in mortality from scorpion stings in Mexico {{as a whole}} and in each of its states for the period of 1979 to 2003. METHODS: We estimated the crude and standardized mortality rates due to scorpion stings and the trends during the period studied based on official mortality data for Mexico, using the codes (<b>E</b> <b>905.</b> 2 and X 22, respectively) from the 9 th and 10 th editions of the International Classification of Diseases. The results were stratified by age group. The frequencies of deaths from scorpion stings were compared using relative risk (RR), with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Between 1979 and 2003 in Mexico, 6 077 deaths from scorpion stings were registered. A statistically significant downward trend was found in standardized mortality rates (beta = - 0. 195; P < 0. 001), with a total reduction of 86. 5 % for the period of 2001 - 2003 versus 1979 - 1982. For the 2001 - 2003 period, the highest mortality rates were in children under 1 year of age (7. 07 per 1 000 000), children 1 to 4 years old (3. 78 per 1 000 000), persons 60 and older (0. 84 per 1 000 000), and males (0. 81 per 1 000 000). Persons in communities with fewer than 2 500 inhabitants had a relative risk that was 11. 8 times (95 % CI: 7. 86 to 17. 72) that found in communities with more than 20 000 inhabitants. The states with the highest mortality rates were in the central and western regions of the country. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the sustained {{decline in the number of}} deaths from scorpion stings in the last 20 years in Mexico, there is still an important public health problem.

40|$|The resin {{transfer}} molding (RTM) process offers important advantages for cost-effective composites manufacturing, and consequently {{has become the}} subject of intense research and development efforts. Several new matrix resins have been formulated specifically for RTM applications in aircraft and aerospace vehicles. For successful use on aircraft, composite materials must withstand exposure to the fluids in common use. The present {{study was conducted to}} obtain comparative screening data on several state-ofthe-art RTM resins after environmental exposures were performed on RTM composite specimens. Four graphite/epoxy composites and one graphite/bismaleimide composite were tested; testing of two additional graphite epoxy composites is in progress. Zero-deg tension tests were conducted on specimens machined from eight-ply (+ 45 -deg, - 45 -deg) laminates, and interlaminar shear tests were conducted on 32 -ply 0 -deg laminate specimens. In these tests, the various RTM resins demonstrated widely different strengths, with 3501 - 6 epoxy being the strongest. As expected, all of the matrix resins suffered severe strength degradation from exposure to methylene chloride (paint stripper). The 3501 - 6 epoxy composites exhibited about a 30 percent drop in tensile strength in hot, wet tests. The <b>E</b> <b>905</b> -L epoxy exhibited little loss of tensile strength (less than 8 percent) after exposure to water.

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, Fairbanks Alaska {{experienced}} its first two known cases of fatal anaphylaxis {{as a result of}} Hymenoptera stings, presumably from yellowjackets. An increase in insect bites and stings has been observed throughout the state. Has there been an increased incidence of medical visits due to insect bites and stings in Alaska in recent years? We conducted a retrospective review of three independent patient databases in Alaska to identify trends of patients seeking medical care for adverse reactions following insect bites and stings. For each database, an insect bite or sting episode warranting medical care was defined as a claim for the Clinical Modification of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD- 9 -CM), codes <b>E</b> <b>905.</b> 3 (venomous insect; Hymenoptera); E 906. 4 (bite; non-venomous arthropod), and 989. 5 (toxic effect; venom). Increases in bite and sting events in each region were compared to temperature changes in the same region. Each database revealed a statistically significant trend in patients seeking care for reactions to insect bites and stings. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital Emergency Department reported a four-fold increase in patients in 2006 compared to previous years (1992 - 2005). The Allergy Asthma and Immunology Center of Alaska reported a three-fold increase in patients from 1999 - 2002 to 2003 - 2007. A retrospective review of the Alaska Medicaid database between 1999 and 2006 showed increases in billings for insect bites and stings among all regions, with the largest percentage increases occurring in the most northern areas. Alaska has experienced an increase in insect bites and stings, most dramatically indicated by two anaphylaxis deaths due to Hymenoptera stings. Statistically significant increases in patients seeking medical care for insect bite and sting related events are observed throughout the state, with 5 of the 6 regions experiencing at least a 6 degree Fahrenheit increase in winter temperature since 1950...|$|E

From [URL] The Einstein Observatory (High Energy Astronomical Observatory 2, HEAO- 2; known as HEAO-B prior to launch) was a pioneering space astronomy mission which flew from 1978 to 1981. It {{was the first}} imaging X-ray telescope in orbit {{to be used for}} extrasolar astronomy, following the success of the Skylab solar X-ray telescope. Together with IUE, {{it was one of the}} first NASA missions with a guest observer program, helping create today's broad community of space scientists. The HEAO-B X-ray telescope was designed by SAO's Leon van Speybroeck, and the mission was conceived by Riccardo Giacconi and operated by the former American Science and Engineering group at CfA in collaboration with the managing NASA center, Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. We hope to put historical materials from the HEAO- 2 /Einstein mission in this area. To start off with, we have digitized the Einstein Slide Collection, used for talks and presentations by Einstein staff during and after the mission. Early results, with some exceptions, are in the first slides. Most captions accurately describe content of the slide. Some do not. We have corrected obvious problems but a few captions remain mysterious. You are welcome to browse or extract and use any of these images. Be aware that large color images (made by photographing a monitor display) are sometimes distorted. Also, the digitization was a batch job and the focus and/or exposure was sometimes not optimum. Many of the black and white slides were dirty or damaged. Most of the original slides are available from the SAO High Energy Division and for presentation or publication some could be greatly improved by cleaning and redigitization. A set was made for the Smithsonian institution and is included here as E 672 -E 730. These make a nice presentation of Einstein results for several classes of objects and are all very good reproductions. As an extension of this, later results can be found in slides E 860, E 887 -E 894, <b>E</b> 899 -E <b>905,</b> <b>E</b> 919, and E 1081. First Light for the Observatory is in E 778.

Samples were collected in a mesocosm fertilized with phosphate at depths of 1, 6 and 12 m and in the surrounding waters. Light absorption coefficients of chro-mophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) [a g (λ) ] and particulate matter [a p (λ) ] were determined using a point-source integrating-cavity absorption meter (PSICAM), while fluorescent DOM (FDOM) components were determined from excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The evolutions of a g (λ) and a p (λ) in the mesocosm were similar to those of total chlorophyll a concentration, Synechococcus spp. and picoeukary-ote abundances, bacterial production, particulate organic nitrogen and total organic carbon concentrations, with roughly a decrease from the beginning of the experiment to days 9 – 10, and an increase from days 9 – 10 to the end of the experiment. In the surrounding waters, the same trend was observed but the increase was much less pronounced, emphasizing the effect of the phosphate fertilization on the mesocosm's plankton community. Correlations suggested that both Syne-chococcus cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were strongly involved in the production of CDOM and absorption of particulate matter. The increase in phytoplankton biomass during the second part of the experiment led to a higher contribution of particulate material in the absorption budget at 442 nm. The three FDOM components identified (tryptophan-, tyrosine-and ultraviolet C (UVC) humic-like fluorophores) did not follow the evolution of CDOM and particulate matter, suggesting they were driven by different production/degradation processes. Finally, the results of this work support the idea there is indirect coupling between the dynamics of N 2 fixation and that of chromophoric material via the stimulation of Synechococcus bloom...|$|R

40|$|A adolescÃncia Ã uma fase da vida caracterizada por diversos acontecimentos, dentre os quais se destaca o inÃcio da atividade sexual. PorÃm, devido Ãs modificaÃÃes advindas do processo de adolescer, as prÃticas sexuais, em muitos casos, sÃo {{realizadas}} de forma desprotegidas, com isso tornando o adolescente vulnerÃvel Ãs DST/Aids. Diante deste panorama, surge o enfermeiro para tentar intervir junto a este grupo com o intuito de prevenir Ãs DST/Aids. Uma das formas de se alcanÃar isto Ã por meio da educaÃÃo em saÃde que pode fazer uso de tecnologias educativas na sua prÃtica. Dentre os diversos tipos de tecnologias educativas destaque-se o jogo educativo que devido Ãs suas caracterÃsticas dinÃmicas e lÃdicas favorecem o processo ensino-aprendizagem dos adolescentes, sendo uma ferramenta importante na prevenÃÃo das DST/Aids na adolescÃncia. Com isto, este estudo teve o intuito de validar um jogo educativo, no auxÃlio da prevenÃÃo de adolescentes Ãs DST/Aids, em escolas pÃblicas de Fortaleza-CE e comparar a aquisiÃÃo do conhecimento dos adolescentes em relaÃÃo prevenÃÃo de DST/Aids usando o jogo educativo, a palestra expositiva e aula ministrada tradicionalmente. Trata-se de um estudo quase-experimental com abordagem quantitativa que foi dividido em duas fases, sendo que a primeira foi composta de 120 adolescentes e a segunda de 198 inicialmente. A primeira fase compreendeu a construÃÃo dos instrumentos de prÃ e pÃs-teste que foi utilizado na fase seguinte. Na segunda etapa ocorreu a aplicaÃÃo da intervenÃÃo propriamente dita, sendo que um grupo participou do jogo educativo que abordava a prevenÃÃo das DST/Aids, o segundo grupo participou de uma palestra ilustrada tambÃm sobre a mesma temÃtica e o terceiro grupo da aula ministrada em sala de aula pelo professor responsÃvel. O trÃs grupos responderam ao prÃ-teste antes da intervenÃÃo educativa e ao pÃs-teste vinte dias depois da intervenÃÃo realizada. A anÃlise dos dados ocorreu por meio de testes estatÃsticos do Software Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), versÃo 17. 0 for Windows. Considerou significantes as anÃlises estatÃsticas inferenciais quando p < 0, 05. Salienta-se que a anÃlise tambÃm ocorreu baseada na literatura da referente ao tema. Esta pesquisa atendeu os aspectos Ãticos, sendo aprovada com o protocolo nÃmero 229. 369. A primeira etapa da pesquisa originou o prÃ-teste e o pÃs-teste com dez questÃes de mÃltipla-escolha, menciona-se que estes instrumentos foram oriundos de um questionÃrio com trinta questÃes. No que se refere Ã segunda etapa, foi verificado que nÃo houve diferenÃa estatisticamente significante entre as variÃveis sexo (p valor 0, 168), sÃrie (p valor 0, 509), moradia (p valor 0, <b>905)</b> <b>e</b> inÃcio da atividade sexual (p valor 0, 695). No que se refere Ãs diferenÃas estatisticamente significantes entre a aplicaÃÃo do jogo educativo, palestra expositiva e aula ministrada tradicionalmente, notou-se que nÃo houve diferenÃa entre a palestra e o jogo, mÃdia dos postos foram 2, 1 e 2, 45 respectivamente. No entanto quando comparado o jogo ao grupo que nÃo recebeu uma intervenÃÃo especÃfica, percebeu-se que houve diferenÃa (p valor < 0, 001). Por meio deste estudo concluiu-se que o jogo educativo auxilia no processo educativo do adolescente assim como a palestra expositiva, no entanto melhor que nenhuma atividade especÃfica na prevenÃÃo de DST/Aids. Adolescence is a {{stage of}} life characterized by several events. One {{of the most important}} is the sexual activity. But due to the resulting changes at the adolescent process, sexual practices, in many cases, are made of unprotected form, as a result of it, teenagers are becoming more vulnerable to sexual diseases like STD / AIDS. In order to prevent this, the nurse comes up to try to intervene with this group in order to prevent and inform them about STD / AIDS. One way to achieve this is through health education that can make use of educational technologies in their practice. Among the various types of educational technologies highlighted, the educational game, due to its dynamic and entertaining features, favors the teaching-learning process of adolescents, being an important tool in the prevention of STD / AIDS in adolescence. This study aimed to validate an educational game built to help with the prevention of adolescent STD / AIDS in public schools of Fortaleza city, and also to compare the acquisition of knowledge of adolescents regarding STD / AIDS educational game using the expository lecture and regular class. It was a quasi-experimental study with a quantitative approach that was divided into two phases, the first of which was composed of 120 adolescents and the second of, initially, 198 adolescents. The first phase included the construction of a pre- and a post-test that were used in the next step.
