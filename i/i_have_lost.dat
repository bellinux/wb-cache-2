25|$|The Imperial Closet {{this small}} {{building}} was situated {{to the east}} of the Temple of Friendship designed by Gibbs and built in 1739. The interior had paintings of Titus, Hadrian & Marcus Aurelius with these inscriptions beneath each painting: 'Diem perdidi' (<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> the day), 'Pro me: si merear in me' (For me, but if I deserve it, against me) & 'Ita regnes imperator, ut privatus regi tevelis' (So govern when an emperor, as, if a private person, you would desire to be governed). The building was demolished in 1759.|$|E
25|$|Pownoll's {{death was}} widely mourned, Pellew writing {{in his report}} to the Admiralty that: 'The loss of Captain Pownoll will be {{severely}} felt. The ship's company have lost a father. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> much more, {{a father and a}} friend united; and that friend my only one on earth. Never, my lord, was grief more poignant than that we all feel for an adored commander. Mine is inexpressible.' Admiral John Jervis wrote of him that he was ‘the best officer, & most excellent, kind hearted man in the Profession’, and claimed that he had ‘lost the best Partizan, if not the best officer under every line of description in the Service’. Edward Osler wrote in 1835 that 'St Vincent and Pownoll who were brought up under Boscawen, and received their Lieutenant's commission from him, contributed materially to form a Nelson or an Exmouth; each the founder of a school of officers, whose model is the character of their chief, and their example his successes.' As well as Pellew, John Borlase Warren served under Pownoll and {{went on to become a}} leading frigate captain, while Jervis remembered Pownoll's contribution to the navy in 1804, when he promoted Pownoll's grandson, John Bastard. Pellew named his eldest son Pownoll Bastard Pellew in honour of his former captain and his family.|$|E

Berni continued corresponding with Aragon after leaving France, later recalling, [...] "It is a pity that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost,</b> among the many things <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost,</b> the letters that I received from Aragon all the way from France; if I had them today, I think, they would be magnificent documents; because in that correspondence we discussed topics such as the direct relationship between politics and culture, the responsibilities of the artist and the intellectual society, the problems of culture in colonial countries, the issue of freedom." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} two races, Massa {{came under fire}} from the press for two errors that left him without points: a {{collision}} with Red Bull driver David Coulthard in Australia and his spin at Malaysia. Massa promised that the first two races would not be indicative {{of the rest of}} the season: [...] "It was not the start to the season that I wanted, but there are still 16races to go and 160points up for grabs. In the next few races I plan to get back all the points <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> in the opening two rounds." ...|$|E

[...] Nelson the botanist quickly succumbed to the harsh Coupang climate and died. On 20 August, the party departed for Batavia (now Jakarta) to await a ship for Europe; the cook Thomas Hall died there, having been ill for weeks. Bligh obtained passages home for himself, his clerk Samuel, and his servant John Smith, and sailed on 16 October 1789. Four of the remainder—the master's mate Elphinstone, the quartermaster Peter Linkletter, the butcher Robert Lamb and the assistant surgeon Thomas Ledward—all died either in Batavia or on their journeys home.|$|E

500|$|Morgan met {{his first}} wife in Kent in the early 1980s. They married in 1982, but he left her when she became {{pregnant}} with twins. He met another woman after moving to Dorset. She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son, and they married in 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan {{had a reputation as}} a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following Morgan's conviction, brother Ray Morgan said, [...] "He has had so many affairs over the years <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> count." [...] He also had a violent temper. One friend, Dave Moemken, described him as being [...] "on a short fuse".|$|E

[...] Believing that Aaron is dead, Christian spends {{the next few days}} {{thinking}} continually about Aaron. Julie discovers an entry about Christian's feelings in his cellphone journal and uses it as the basis for her new song. Christian travels to the Davis home in Idaho, where he tearfully returns Aaron's watch to his mother. During an encounter with Julie, she hesitantly shows him her new video, which upsets Christian, realizing that part of the lyrics came from his personal journal without his consent. Julie tells Christian that she hoped something good would come from it.|$|E

500|$|The titling {{capitals of}} Gill Sans were first {{unveiled}} at a printing conference in 1928; {{it was also}} shown in a specimen issued in the Fleuron magazine edited by Morison. While initial response was partly appreciative, it was still considered dubious by some ultra-conservative printers who saw all sans-serif type as modern and unsound; one called it [...] "typographical Bolshevism". Sans-serifs were still regarded as vulgar and commercial by purists in this period: Johnston's pupil Graily Hewitt privately commented of them that: In Johnston <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> confidence. Despite all he did for us... he has undone too much by forsaking his standard of the Roman alphabet, giving the world, without safeguard or explanation, his block letters which disfigure our modern life. His prestige has obscured their vulgarity and commercialism. Nonetheless, Gill Sans rapidly became popular after its release.|$|E
500|$|During the {{exhibition}} Etty suffered a serious bout of rheumatic fever.

On 3November 1849 he suffered a serious asthma attack, thought to have been made worse by his neglecting to wear his flannel undershirt the night before. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and by 10November he was bedridden. On Tuesday 13November, watching the sun set over the River Ouse, he was heard to say [...] "Wonderful! Wonderful! This death!" [...] Later that night, Betsy Etty wrote to Joseph Gillott that [...] "Uncle paid the last debt to nature at [...] past Eight [...] tonight. I do not know what to do.

500|$|For a time, Anderson {{directed}} Fitzgerald {{toward the}} relative safety of Whitefish Bay; then at 4:39p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in Grand Marais, Michigan, to inquire whether the Whitefish Point light and navigation beacon were operational. The USCG replied that their monitoring equipment indicated that both instruments were inactive. McSorley then hailed any {{ships in the}} Whitefish Point area to report {{the state of the}} navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of Avafors between 5:00 and 5:30p.m. that the Whitefish Point light was on but not the radio beacon. Woodard testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, [...] "Don't allow nobody on deck," [...] as well as something about a vent that Woodard could not understand. Some time later, McSorley told Woodard, [...] "I have a 'bad list,' <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> both radars, and am taking heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas I have ever been in." ...|$|E
500|$|The Quest, a [...] two-masted sealing ship sourced from Norway, {{set sail}} on 18 September 1921. Problems soon arose; the ship did not sail well and it leaked. There were also {{problems}} with the engine. A week was spent in Portugal undergoing repairs, and after crossing the Atlantic, the Quest spent {{a month in the}} docks of Rio de Janeiro. While in Brazil, Shackleton, whose health had been poor for some time, suffered a heart attack. After he declined treatment for his condition, the expedition left for South Georgia on 18 December. The island was sighted on 4 January 1922 and both Worsley and Shackleton were [...] "like a pair of excitable kids", pointing out landmarks from their walk across South Georgia back in 1916. The following day, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack. Worsley described the loss of his friend as [...] "...a terribly sad blow. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> a dear pal, one of the whitest men, in spite of his faults, that ever lived." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{motorcade}} {{arrived at}} the Cathedral and Reagan's casket was removed. The bearers carrying it paused on the Cathedral steps, and an opening prayer was given by Bishop John Bryson Chane, Dean of the Washington National Cathedral. The casket was then carried down the aisle; the Reagan family followed and Nancy Reagan was escorted to her seat by President Bush. Rabbi Harold Kushner and Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (the first female Supreme Court justice, whom Reagan appointed), then each gave a reading, which preceded the eulogies. The choir then sang hymns—"Faire is the Heaven"; [...] "Bring Us, O Lord"; [...] "And I saw a New Heaven"—before Thatcher delivered the first eulogy. In view of her failing mental faculties following several small strokes, the message had been pre-recorded several months earlier and was broadcast throughout the Cathedral on plasma television screens. During the speech, Thatcher said, [...] "We have lost a great president, a great American and a great man, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> a dear friend." ...|$|E

500|$|Against all expectations, the war {{continued}} for five years. During this period, PedroII's {{time and energy}} were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that [...] "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." [...] "Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness {{had no effect on}} his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroII remarked: [...] "What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me? Many better kings than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry." ...|$|E

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina described Kalam as [...] "a rare combination of a great statesman, acclaimed scientist, and a source of inspiration to the young generation of South Asia" [...] and termed his death an [...] "irreparable loss to India and beyond". Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief Khaleda Zia said [...] "as a nuclear scientist, he engaged himself in the welfare of the people". Ashraf Ghani, the President of Afghanistan, called Kalam [...] "an inspirational figure to millions of people," [...] noting that [...] "we have a lot to learn from his life". Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala recalled Kalam's scientific contributions to India: [...] "Nepal has lost a good friend and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> an honoured and ideal personality." [...] The President of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain, and Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif also expressed their grief and condolences on his death. The President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, also expressed his condolences. [...] "Dr. Kalam was a man of firm conviction and indomitable spirit, and I saw him as an outstanding statesman of the world. His death is an irreparable loss not only to India but to the entire world." [...] Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen and Vice-President Ahmed Adheeb condoled Kalam's death, with Yameen naming him as a close friend of the Maldives who would continue to be an inspiration to Indians and generations of South Asians. Former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had made an official visit to India during Kalam's presidency, termed his demise as a great loss to all of humankind.
