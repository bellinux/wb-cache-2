5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding <b>euro</b> deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the <b>euro</b> against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus <b>euro</b> deposits, then any excess return on <b>euro</b> deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the <b>euro</b> against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on <b>euro</b> deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the <b>euro</b> against the dollar.
