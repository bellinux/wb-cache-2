This nanobiosensor platform comprises of mercaptopropionic acid functionalized electrospun zinc oxide nanofiber modified <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> film for covalent conjugation of protein. The highly oriented zinc oxide nanowires were synthesized by simple, low cost electrospinning technique and electrophoretically deposited on the ITO coated <b>flexible</b> <b>plastic</b> sheet.

50|$|Flexo has an {{advantage}} over lithography in that it can use {{a wider range of}} inks, water based rather than oil based inks, and is good at printing on a variety of different materials like plastic, foil, acetate film, brown paper, and other materials used in packaging. Typical products printed using flexography include brown corrugated boxes, flexible packaging including retail and shopping bags, food and hygiene bags and sacks, milk and beverage cartons, <b>flexible</b> <b>plastics,</b> self-adhesive labels, disposable cups and containers, envelopes and wallpaper. In recent years there has also been a move towards laminates, where two or more materials are bonded together to produce new material with different properties than either of the originals. A number of newspapers now eschew the more common offset lithography process in favour of flexo. Flexographic inks, like those used in gravure and unlike those used in lithography, generally have a low viscosity. This enables faster drying and, as a result, faster production, which results in lower costs.|$|E
5000|$|Nordic: Problems {{with the}} {{geometry}} of the boot sole, which meant only certain boots would work, meant the Rottafella was not widely used. This problem was eventually solved through the same evolution of plastic components that changed the alpine skiing market. The use of highly <b>flexible</b> <b>plastics</b> allowed for a sole that was very strong torsionally and side-to-side, but still had excellent flexibility lengthwise, allowing the heel to rise as with a cable binding. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s. A similar system with a 50 mm [...] "duckbill" [...] once existed for lighter setups, but is obsolete and no longer available. Unlike the 75 mm it was symmetric. It was the binding of choice for racing, before the adoption of skate ski racing, in the early 1970s. The 50 mm was also designated according to {{the thickness of the}} [...] "duckbill" [...] having either 7 mm or 11-13 mm thick soles hence these bindings often had two notches in the bail to clamp boots with different sole thicknesses.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Phthalate esters such as di(2 -ethylhexyl) {{phthalate}} (DEHP), {{which are}} {{commonly found in}} cosmetics and in <b>flexible</b> <b>plastics</b> distributed by the food, construction, and medical products industries, have been classified as anti-androgens. High-dose DEHP exposure in utero is associated with decreased androgen levels. However, when administered after birth, low doses of DEHP (eg, 10 mg/kg body weight) may stimulate androgen production. In the present study, the potential of phthalate exposure to advance or delay the timing of puberty was assessed. Male Long-Evans rat pups were chronically subjected to low or high doses of DEHP, with the androgen-driven process of preputial separation serving as an index of pubertal timing. Rats were treated with 0, 10, 500, or 750 mg/kg body weight DEHP for 28 days starting at day 21 postpartum. The average age at which the animals completed preputial separation was measured in each group. The age of preputial separation wa...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Phthalates, {{widely used}} in <b>flexible</b> <b>plastics</b> and {{consumer}} products, have become ubiquitous contaminants worldwide. This study evaluated the acute toxicity and estrogenic endocrine disrupting activity of butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP), bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) and their mixtures.

The other four phthalates did not cause more than 50 % exposed embryo mortality even at their highest soluble concentrations. The typical toxicity symptoms caused by phthalates were death, tail curvature, necrosis, cardio edema and no touch response.

40|$|The {{development}} of a robust method for integrating high-performance semiconductors on <b>flexible</b> <b>plastics</b> could enable exciting avenues in fundamental research and novel applications. One area of vital relevance is chemical and biological sensing, which if implemented on biocompatible substrates, could yield breakthroughs in implantable or wearable monitoring systems. Semiconducting nanowires (and nanotubes) are particularly sensitive chemical sensors because of their high surface-to-volume ratios. Here, we present a scalable and parallel process for transferring hundreds of pre-aligned silicon nanowires onto plastic to yield highly ordered films for low-power sensor chips. The nanowires are excellent field-effect transistors, and, as sensors, exhibit parts-per-billion sensitivity to NO_ 2, a hazardous pollutant. We also use SiO_ 2 surface chemistries to construct a 'nano-electronic nose' library, which can distinguish acetone and hexane vapours via distributed responses. The excellent sensing performance coupled with bendable plastic could open up opportunities in portable, wearable or even implantable sensors...|$|E
