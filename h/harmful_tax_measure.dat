In {{the course of the}} analysis of the decision, a general analytical framework is proposed for examining fiscal measures suspect of being State aid.

The paper describes and evaluates global and regional developments with respect to tax rates and revenue ratios over the last some 20 years, and discusses selected structural reform initiatives that have been high on the policy agenda over this period. In particular, it focuses on developments relating to experiments with the restructuring of corporate tax, the impact of corporate taxes on FDI, key reform initiatives including dual income taxes and flat taxes, as well as the worldwide spread of the VAT and policy developments associated with climate change and natural resource taxation.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the link between}} FDI, corporate taxation, and corporate tax revenues. We find strong evidence that FDI in (out) flows are affected by tax regimes in the host (home) countries and FDI flows in turn affect the corporate tax base. Simulations of European Union (EU) harmonization (isolating the revenue effect of FDI on the tax base from direct effects through the rate harmonization) suggest that high (low) tax countries would gain (lose) revenue from harmonization; these effects may be substantial. Our results also suggest that EU tax harmonization would significantly affect the net FDI position of some countries.

40|$|The European Union has {{woken up}} to State aid {{possibly}} contained in national direct <b>tax</b> <b>measures.</b> As a result, {{the number of}} Commission actions against Member States {{on the basis of}} fiscal State aid has increased in recent years, with some amazing results. It has also revealed overlap and concurrence, sometimes even contradiction between EU State aid law and other EU law affecting direct taxation. The author discusses four types of interaction/overlap between EU State aid law and other areas of (EU) (soft) law affecting direct taxation: - State aid and free movement rights; - State aid and <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> competition; - State aid and anti-abuse measures; and - State aid in the form of taxation itself. His conclusions are that (i) State aid is marching on the field of taxation; (ii) the Code of Conduct Group is marching on the field of tax disparities and therefore on tax harmonization; and (iii) the criteria for assessing fiscal restrictions on free movement rights, fiscal State aid and <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> competition are converging, resulting in more overlap between the three sets of rules...|$|R

40|$|Recently, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (2 ̆ 2 OECD 2 ̆ 2) {{issued a}} report {{targeting}} 2 ̆ 2 <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> regimes 2 ̆ 2 -preferential, low tax regimes that are primarily tailored to rap into the tax bases of other countries. The report, Towards Global Tax Cooperation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating <b>Harmful</b> <b>Tax</b> Practices, (2 ̆ 2 Towards Global Tax Cooperation 2 ̆ 2), identified a list of tax practices the OECD deemed harmful, such as 2 ̆ 2 ring-fencing 2 ̆ 2 (where foreign customers are subject to rules different than those applied to citizens which encourages the establishment of foreign entities with no substantial activities), a lack of transparency, {{and the absence of}} information exchange regarding tax practices. The OECD then released a second report, Framework for a Collective Memnorandum of Understanding on Eliminating <b>Harmful</b> <b>Tax</b> Practices (2 ̆ 2 Framework 2 ̆ 2). This report listed the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s objections to the policies of <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> regimes and provided a host of scheduled remedies, which presumably would be backed by the threat of sanctions detailed in Towards Global Tax Cooperation. Not surprisingly, the Commonwealth countries were among those identified as having <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> practices. In January 2001, the OECD met with the Commonwealth countries and other tax haven regimes to negotiate a 2 ̆ 2 mutually acceptable 2 ̆ 2 tax policy.

These countries provide a good illustration of contrasting positions: while the OECD deemed the Bahamas 2 ̆ 2 non- cooperating, 2 ̆ 2 Bermuda gave advance commitment to the OECD proposals. Yet both have essentially adopted the core principles of the OECD proposals that eventually emerged from the January 2001 negotiations. Next, the essay will discuss the role of the Bush administration in shaping the accepted OECD proposals. Finally, in considering the future of tax havens, this Development will conclude that the compromised position advanced by the Bush administration was merely an affirmation of the course of reform already begun by the offshore tax haven regimes themselves...|$|R
40|$|On 13 March 2009 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) {{announced}} that Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland {{had agreed to}} introduce laws {{to allow for the}} exchange of information on tax evaders. The OECD has been actively trying to protect the national tax bases of its member states and this has now become an imperative with the global financial crisis and government deficits. The OECD 2 ̆ 7 s <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> competition project has been actively pursued for the past 12 years and appears to be receiving worldwide acceptance. On this basis it can be strongly argued that it now has the status of 2 ̆ 7 soft 2 ̆ 7 international law and appears to have all of the hallmarks of being part of the range of OECD initiatives that have been accepted as constituting international taxation law; such as the transfer pricing rules, Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) rules, and the model double tax agreement, to name just a few.
