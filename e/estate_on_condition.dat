When Mr Vaughan died in 1829, he left father and son his <b>estate,</b> <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> that they took on the Vaughan surname. Thus they became John Edwards-Vaughan and Nash Vaughan Edwards-Vaughan, and acquired properties at Lanelay and at Clase, Llangyfelach, near Swansea.|$|E
60|$|The Squire also suffers {{the gang}} to lurk unmolested about the skirts of his <b>estate,</b> <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> {{that they do}} not come about the house. The {{approaching}} wedding, however, has made a kind of Saturnalia at the Hall, and has caused a suspension of all sober rule. It has produced a great sensation throughout the female part of the household; not a housemaid but dreams of wedding favours, and has a husband running in her head. Such a time is a harvest for the gipsies: there is a public footpath leading across one part of the park, by which they have free ingress, and they are continually hovering about the grounds, telling the servant-girls' fortunes, or getting smuggled in to the young ladies.|$|E

Both cultural and normative fields consider each cultural good such {{as a part of}} the national identity, and require the pursuance of rules aimed to preserve its civil and symbolic function. The Italian law allows the sale of the cultural public real <b>estate,</b> <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> that the buildings are conserved and exploited, and that the new functions, chosen by the private owners, avoid the loss of their cultural value. The evaluation of building adaptability is an indispensable tool, to manage the conflict between existing values and transformations required by the new owners.

40|$|Many {{couples who}} have toiled {{all their lives}} for their worldly goods often wish to make a common {{disposition}} of their property.

5000|$|From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era {{of family}} dynasties, name changes were {{frequently}} demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, {{of members of the}} gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their <b>estates</b> <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by marriage settlements, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's dowry her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private Act of Parliament or by obtaining a Royal Licence. A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname in addition to his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the [...] "double-barrelled", even the [...] "triple-barrelled" [...] name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy [...] "squirearchy" [...] with an embarrassment of inherited estates.|$|R
60|$|Although {{they had}} passed through a ceremony, the {{conviction}} had never taken root in {{her that she had}} been married to Chiltern. The tie that had united her to him had not been sacred, though it had been no less binding; more so, in fact. That tie would have become a shackle. Her perception of this, after his death, had led her to instruct her attorney to send back to his relatives all but a small income from his estate, enough for her to live on during her lifetime. There had been some trouble about this matter; Mrs. Grainger, in particular, had surprised her in making objections, and had finally written a letter which Honora received with a feeling akin to gratitude. Whether her own action had softened this lady's feelings, she never understood; she had cherished the letter for its unexpectedly charitable expressions. Chiltern's family had at last agreed to accept the <b>estate</b> <b>on</b> the <b>condition</b> that the income mentioned should be tripled. And to this Honora had consented. Money had less value than ever in her eyes.|$|R

5000|$|Edwin and Adelaide {{were married}} in 1875. According to Adelaide, it was {{intended}} to be a platonic marriage, but in 1881 she had a stillborn baby by Edwin; Edwin had refused her (female) nurse's advice to call a (male) doctor during a difficult labour because he did not want another man [...] "to interfere with her". Early in 1885, they met Dyson as the local Wesleyan minister and he became a frequent visitor. Edwin made Dyson executor of his will, in which he left his entire <b>estate</b> to Adelaide, <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> that she did not remarry (a common stipulation in those days). Later Edwin redrew the will, four months before he died, removing the bar on Adelaide remarrying.|$|R
5000|$|With {{increasing}} numbers of immigrants moving to the area during {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, several doctors were appointed by the New York State Legislature to investigate housing conditions in tenements, and they spent many days interrogating various residents. On Oct. 27, 1884 they interrogated John F. Attridge, a real <b>estate</b> agent, <b>on</b> living <b>conditions</b> in various kinds of housing in lower Manhattan. At one point Doctor S. Oakley Vanderpoel raised the subject of whether houses built over filled-in ground had proper drainage. To this Attridge responded: [...] "I lived for fifteen years over Minetta Brook, and the people always considered it the most unhealthy place in New York, but there was nobody sick." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Autoroute Décarie is {{a sunken}} highway between the {{northbound}} and southbound lanes of Décarie Boulevard (hence the name); from boulevard Métropolitain at its northern end to Monkland Avenue and the Villa Maria Metro station at its southern end. It {{was built on}} a wide expanse of vacant land, donated to the City by the Décarie <b>estate</b> <b>on</b> the <b>condition</b> that only a streetcar line be established. The decommissioning of the streetcar system in 1959 left the right-of-way as an obvious choice for a highway, and so the Décarie Autoroute was dug there. South of Queen Mary Road, however, were {{a significant number of}} houses that were demolished. In order to avoid demolishing the Notre-Dame-de-Grâces church, the highway makes a slight westerly jog below Côte-Saint-Luc Road and runs through a short tunnel, before emerging between Addington and Botrel Streets and running down to Sherbrooke Street and Saint Jacques Street, where it spectacularly goes from below-ground to well above ground as it intersects with Autoroutes 20 and 720 in the infamous Turcot Interchange (dubbed [...] "Spaghetti Junction" [...] by train crews operating the former CN Rail Turcot Yard). Following the conversion from streetcar line to highway, the Décarie Estate unsuccessfully sued the city but was unable to prevail because they did not document their case well enough for the nevertheless sympathetic court.|$|R
2500|$|Smythe was {{appointed}} by the King to the Office of, Co-Paymaster of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms. He was born James Moore.

[...] His mother's maternal grandfather was George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley and his mother carried the last name Smythe.

50|$|The {{original}} {{proposal for a}} new bridge came from John Learmonth, a former Edinburgh Lord Provost {{and owner of the}} Dean <b>estate</b> <b>on</b> the north bank of the river. Following the successful expansion of the New Town <b>on</b> Lord Moray's <b>estate</b> <b>on</b> the south bank, Learmonth wanted to feu his land on the north side to create a further extension, but needed a more convenient link to the town over the gorge at Randolph Cliff, while also providing an impressive approach to his development. Learmonth was prepared to meet the cost himself, estimated at £18,556, but in 1828 the Cramond Road Trustees, responsible for public roads in the district, agreed to part-fund a new bridge <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> that it would be designed by Britain’s foremost bridge builder and be toll-free.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Pennant {{was educated}} at Newcome's academy in Hackney and Trinity College, Cambridge. [...] He was MP for Petersfield from 1761 to 1767, then {{becoming}} one of Liverpool's members from 1767 to 1780, and again from 1784 until 1790 when he offered his seat to Sir Banastre Tarleton who continued his anti-abolitionist activities. As owner of Penrhyn slate quarry, he was prominent {{in the development of}} the Welsh slate industry. He was created 1st Baron Penrhyn of Penrhyn in the county of Lough, Ireland in 1783, even though he was not Irish. Holding an Irish peerage did not disqualify him from standing for elections to the Westminster House of Commons as, both before and after the Union, Irish peerages were used to create peers who could not sit in the English House of Lords but who could do so in the House of Commons. [...] Pennant owned vast properties in Caernarfonshire and six sugar plantations in Jamaica, where he owned over six hundred enslaved workers. He inherited half of his Welsh estate from his wife, Ann Susannah Pennant nee Warburton, the daughter of General Hugh Warburton; the other half he inherited from his father, John Pennant, who was Warburton's business partner. On his death, Richard's entire estate was inherited by his second cousin, George Hay Dawkins (1763-1840), who subsequently adopted the surname of Dawkins-Pennant. Dawkins' daughter Juliana and her husband were named as co-heirs of the <b>estate</b> <b>on</b> the <b>condition</b> that they also took the surname Pennant (which they duly accepted). Dawkins' son-in-law, Edward Gordon Douglas, was later created 1st Baron Penrhyn of Llandygai.|$|R

50|$|Soon {{after the}} earl's arrival, it was {{reported}} that he {{had been shot in the}} arm by a foot-pad; and, while his wound was healing, he spent his time gambling with John Mowbray, the young laird of St Ronan's, who had borrowed his sister Clara's money to try to improve his luck. Having allowed him to win a considerable sum, his lordship made proposals for Clara's hand, explaining that his grand-uncle had disinherited his only son, and devised his <b>estate</b> to him, <b>on</b> <b>condition</b> that he chose as a wife a lady of the name of Mowbray. In a letter to his friend Jekyl, the earl confessed that he had been winged in a duel with Tyrrel, whom he met on his way to fight Sir Bingo, and that he had also wounded Tyrrel. A few days afterwards the company at the Well assembled at Shaw's Castle to take part in a play, and Mr Touchwood persuaded Rev Mr Cargill to accompany him. While they were walking in the grounds the minister reminded Clara of a secret in his keeping, which made it impossible for her to marry. He also encountered the earl, and, believing him to be Bulmer, attempted to warn him.|$|R
