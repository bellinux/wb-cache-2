This legal requirement led to massive [...] "external restructuring" [...] of <b>kolkhozes</b> and sovkhozes through re-registration in new corporate forms. The number of <b>kolkhozes</b> and sovkhozes declined rapidly after 1992, while other corporate forms gained in prominence.|$|R

The size of the average kolkhoz has increased several times; {{the standards of the}} technical equipment of kolkhoz labor have risen immeasurably, as have also those of worker qualifications and skills; farm administration by management and agricultural specialists has been expanded. During this time, the forms taken by wages have also changed repeatedly. At the present time, an increasing number of <b>kolkhozes</b> are beginning to introduce guaranteed monetary remuneration for kolkhoznik labor. Establishing fixed rates for labor directly in monetary form, the <b>kolkhozes</b> at once credit wages earned to the account of the individual kolkhozniks and pay them out in full each month, without recourse to the trudoden [Work-day: unit of work on <b>kolkhozes.</b> Transl. ]...|$|R
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large {{agricultural}} machines such as combines and tractors, but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the <b>kolkhozes</b> and sovkhozes (state farms). After a successful test involving MTS which served one large kolkhoz each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition—but then ordered that the change take place with great speed. Within three months, {{over half of the}} MTS facilities had been closed, and <b>kolkhozes</b> were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines. MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to <b>kolkhozes</b> and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators. The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many <b>kolkhozes.</b> Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations. Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the <b>kolkhozes</b> now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kolkhozes</b> have {{disappeared}} almost completely in Transcaucasian and Central Asian states. In Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan {{the disappearance of}} the kolkhoz was part of an overall individualization of agriculture, with family farms displacing corporate farms in general. In Central Asian countries, some corporate farms persist, but no <b>kolkhozes</b> remain. Thus, in Turkmenistan, a presidential decree of June 1995 summarily [...] "reorganized" [...] all <b>kolkhozes</b> into [...] "peasant associations" [...] (daikhan berleshik). In Tajikistan, a presidential decree of October 1995 initiated a process of conversion of <b>kolkhozes</b> into share-based farms operating on leased land, agricultural production cooperatives, and dehkan (peasant) farms. However, contrary to the practice in all other CIS countries, one-third of the 30,000 peasant farms in Tajikistan are organized as collective dehkan farms and not family farms. These collective dehkan farms are often referred to as [...] "kolkhozy" [...] in the vernacular, although legally they are a different organizational form and the number of [...] "true" [...] <b>kolkhozes</b> in Tajikistan today is less than 50. Similarly in Uzbekistan the 1998 Land Code renamed all <b>kolkhozes</b> and sovkhozes shirkats (Uzbek for agricultural cooperatives) and just five years later, in October 2003, the government's new strategy for land reform prescribed a sweeping reorientation from shirkats to peasant farms, which since then have virtually replaced all corporate farms.|$|R

50|$|A kolkhoz (колхо́з, Russian plural kolkhozy, anglicized plural <b>kolkhozes)</b> {{was a form}} of {{collective}} farm in the Soviet Union. <b>Kolkhozes</b> existed along with state farms or sovkhoz (plural sovkhozy or sovkhozes). These were the two components of the socialized farm sector that began to emerge in Soviet agriculture after the October Revolution of 1917, as an antithesis both to the feudal structure of impoverished serfdom and aristocratic landlords and to individual or family farming.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924-1926, the Komzet {{helped to}} create several Jewish <b>kolkhozes</b> in various regions, most notably in Crimea, Ukraine and Stavropol region.|$|R

[...] Since the mid-1930s, the <b>kolkhozes</b> {{had been in}} effect {{an offshoot of the}} state sector (although notionally they continued to be owned by their members). Nevertheless, in locations with particularly good land or if it happened to have capable management, some <b>kolkhozes</b> accumulated substantial sums of money in their bank accounts. Subsequently, numerous <b>kolkhozes</b> were formally nationalized by changing their status to sovkhozes. The faint dividing lines between collective and state farms were obliterated almost totally in the late 1960s, when Khrushchev’s administration authorized a guaranteed wage to kolkhoz members, similarly to sovkhoz employees. Essentially, his administration recognized their status as hired hands rather than authentic cooperative members. The guaranteed wage provision was incorporated in the 1969 version of the Standard Charter.|$|R

25|$|After these deportations, {{the pace}} of {{collectivization}} increased as a flood of farmers rushed into <b>kolkhozes.</b> Within two weeks 1740 new <b>kolkhozes</b> were established {{and by the end}} of 1950, just 4.5% of Latvian farmsteads remained outside the collectivized units; about 226,900 farmsteads belonged to collectives, of which there were now around 14,700. Rural life changed as farmers' daily movements were dictated to by plans, decisions and quotas formulated elsewhere and delivered through an intermediate non-farming hierarchy. The new <b>kolkhozes,</b> especially smaller ones, were ill-equipped and poor - at first farmers were paid once a year in kind and then in cash, but salaries were very small and at times farmers went unpaid or even ended up owing money to the kholhoz. Farmers still had small pieces of land (not larger than 0.5 ha) around their houses where they grew food for themselves. Along with collectivization, the government tried to uproot the custom of living in individual farmsteads by resettling people in villages. However this process failed due to lack of money since the Soviets planned to move houses as well.|$|R
50|$|During Soviet times, Khojavand was {{the capital}} of the eponymous {{district}} located in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. The population of the town, grouped into <b>kolkhozes,</b> largely occupied itself with raising livestock, grape growing, wheat cultivation, and gardening.|$|R

2500|$|During World War II, Alfred Rosenberg, in his {{capacity}} as the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories, issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms in areas of the USSR under German occupation. [...] He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming, restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. [...] But decollectivization conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and Hermann Göring demanded that the kolkhoz be retained, save for a change of name. [...] Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as 'stupid.' In the end, the German occupation authorities retained most of the <b>kolkhozes</b> and simply renamed them [...] "community farms" [...] ( [...] , a throwback to the traditional Russian commune). German propaganda described this as a preparatory step toward ultimate dissolution of the <b>kolkhozes</b> into private farms, which would be granted to peasants who had loyally delivered compulsory quotas of farm produce to the Germans. By 1943, the German occupation authorities had converted 30% of the <b>kolkhozes</b> into German-sponsored [...] "agricultural cooperatives", but as yet had made no conversions to private farms.|$|R
