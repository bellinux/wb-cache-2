40|$|Under recent dairy policy reforms, farm-level milk {{prices are}} {{determined}} by a multiple component pricing scheme that derives monthly <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> class prices from weekly NASS survey prices for only {{the first two weeks}} of each month. This pricing rule may provide incentives for strategic behavior by dairy sector participants that could induce <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> price volatility. This paper employs a series of nonparametric approaches to examine evidence of such price manipulation in CME weekly average <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> prices. Empirical evidence suggests that no such week-of-month effects exist in levels of prices, and only very weak evidence of week-of-month effects in price volatility was found. Together, results suggest <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> markets are competitively arbitraged rendering price manipulation infeasible. From these results, no evidence suggests that price manipulation might lie behind recent changes in price volatility observed in dairy markets. Marketing,...|$|R
