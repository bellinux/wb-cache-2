The first and most difficult is a concept known as the digital divide, as discussed by Baird, Zellin and Booker, the authors of Is There A [...] "Digital Divide" [...] In The Provision Of E-Government Services at The County Level In the United States. This {{is the idea that}} some Americans are not involved in the political process and e-government due to lack of access to technology, lack of technical skills, or due to some financial constraint. This is extremely problematic due to the necessity of e-government to have input from all voters and citizens, not just specific groups, for it to be fully effective. It is of critical importance for everyone to be able to voice his or her opinions equally in order to maintain democratic integrity.Another major issue having to do with citizen involvement stems from problems with the actual technology used for e-governance and the potential that it will not always function as it is supposed to. A good example of this was the problems with the healthcare.gov website that was established to help citizens with healthcare information and enrollment during the Obama Administration.

There are several effective social learning theory-based parenting programmes for dealing with behavioural difficulties, including the Incredible Years (IY) parent programmes. However, these programmes typically do not specifically target {{parents of children with}} ASD. Recently, a new addition to the IY suite of programmes known as the IY Autistic Spectrum and Language Delays (IY-ASLD) parent programme was developed. The main aims of the present study are to examine the feasibility of delivering this programme within child health services and to provide <b>initial</b> evidence for <b>effectiveness</b> and economic costs. Methods and analysis The Parenting for Autism, Language, And Communication Evaluation Study (PALACES) trial is a pragmatic, multicentre, pilot randomised controlled trial comparing the IY-ASLD programme with a wait-list control condition. 72 parents of children with ASD (aged 3 – 8  years) will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control condition. Data will be collected prior to randomisation and 6  months postrandomisation for all families. Families in the intervention condition only will also be followed up at 12 and 18  months postrandomisation. This study will provide <b>initial</b> evidence of <b>effectiveness</b> for the newly developed IY-ASLD parenting programme.
