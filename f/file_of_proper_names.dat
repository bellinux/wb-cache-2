40|$|A <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> is a {{vocabulary}} {{element of a}} particular language which also belongs to a respective onymic subsystem, thereby acquiring a binary character. <b>Proper</b> <b>names</b> are formed (as a secondary plan of a language) with the background of appellative vocabulary. However, in their formation and use in communication, {{not only are the}} rules of the appellative language code applied but also the rules specific to <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> Two opposing but interrelated tendencies are typical of the position <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> – a continuous interaction <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> with other vocabulary and the whole language system and, simultaneously, a continuous polarisation of the category <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in relation to appellatives. The interaction <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> with other vocabulary relates to the ongoing processes of onymisation (appellative % proprium) and apellativisation (proprium % appellative) with the openness of onymy (the social, historical, cultural as well as the political dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> present a wide range of possibilities for, e. g. the adoption of exonyms) but, above all, it relates to the social needs of ordinary communication. The polarisation <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in relation to appellatives is, hence, conditioned by the special character of onymic nomination. From this binary interrelationship <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> follows the binary status of the category nomen proprium, i. e. linguistic status and onomastic status. In the analysis <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> and from the methodological standpoint in onomastics, I consider this to be fundamental. That is why, after the older characterisation of onomastics, I have extended the definition of the linguistic status <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> as defined by Kuryłowicz (La position linguistique du nom propre, 1956) to linguistic and onomastic status (Blanár 1976, 1977).

40|$|We {{report the}} results of an {{investigation}} of the spoken word retrieval abilities of a patient, BG, with <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> anomia.

The article is the fist work that gives a view of onomatopoetic component in <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> on the material <b>of</b> English <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> product names, electronic resources, theatre plays and cartoon titles. Onomatopoeia in onomastics is seen form the viewpoint of sociolinguistics. Being an aspect of literary onomastics, onomatopoetic <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are considered to be a functional and semantic word mark (meaning-creating and text-forming) that serves as an individualizing and characteristic device. However examples of onomatopoeia in onomastics are seen not only in imaginative literature but also in advertisements and commercials.

They help to make up brand names. Translation strategies include two techniques: translator often resorts to borrowings, in other words transliterateration or transcription of the original onomatopoeia, or makes situational equivalents like occasionalisms or oral speech equivalents to render the expressive, stylistic and evaluative components of meaning <b>of</b> such <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> This article will give an example of both these techniques and deduce the most affective strategies that can be applied to translation of onomatopoetic component <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R

In Czech linguistics, onomastics is a comparatively developed discipline. In Spanish, it is mostly grammatical manuals that deal with <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> In both languages, authors tend to agree on the definition and classification <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> into anthroponyms, toponyms and chrematonyms; however, Spanish authors usually do not separate chrematonyms as a category under such name. Furthermore, nobody has yet defined or classified the functions <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in Spanish language (an action which has already been done for the Czech language). Opinions on the translation <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> differ to a large degree. Authors recognize <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> as polyfunctional units and agree that their translation (or non-translation) is in large measure conditioned by norms and specific historically conditioned conventions; by the function of the text, text type and genre; by the relationship of the working languages and so on.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the results of psycho- and neurolinguistic examinations into the mental processes involving <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> (i. e. storing, processing, retrieving <b>proper</b> <b>names).</b> We can denote entities of various types with the help <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> and although most of these types are universal, there are in fact some cultural differences. In the fields of science concerned, that is, in psycho- and neurolinguistics and in neuropsychology, attention is given almost exclusively to anthroponyms; mental and neurological features of toponyms and other name types are much less examined. Processing names is generally believed to display more difficulties than processing common nouns, and these difficulties present themselves more and more strongly with age. In connection with the special identifying function and semantic features <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> many researchers assume that we process the two groups of words in different ways. This paper, reflecting also on these assumptions, summarizes and explains the results of research into a) selective anomia affecting monolingual speakers (word-finding disturbances); b) localization; c) reaction time measurement; and d) speech disfluency concerning <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> (especially the “tip of the tongue phenomenon”).
