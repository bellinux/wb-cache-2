40|$|In acute studies <b>guar</b> <b>flour,</b> guar {{powder and}} guar {{granules}} reduced mean post prandial insulin levels in normal subjects following liquid glucose. The flour and powder also reduced mean plasma GIP levels compared to glucose alone. Guar granules {{had no effect}} on the mean plasma glucose, insulin or GIP responses of either normal or non insulin dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects to a solid mixed meal but guar powder reduced mean post prandial plasma glucose, insulin, and GIP levels in both groups. <b>Guar</b> <b>flour</b> was not investigated. The mean glycosylated haemoglobin level of seven NIDDM subjects taking 25 g guar powder in bread daily for eight weeks was reduced after four weeks. Mean total serum cholesterol levels were also reduced whilst subjects were following the regimen but on termination returned to pretrial levels. In addition, the response to a meal immediately before and after supplementation was similar indicating guar powder has no carry over effect. <b>Guar</b> <b>flour</b> prevented the hypoglycaemia caused in two of six subjects by consumption of a drink containing alcohol and sucrose and a high carbohydrate snack. However it also caused higher blood alcohol levels and they appeared more intoxicated for five hours after the meal. When guar gum was given with a fat load it did not affect chylomicronaemia implying it is unlikely to impair bile salt reabsorption as has been suggested. <b>Guar</b> <b>flour</b> incorporation into a predominantly protein meal did not affect the rate of liquid or solid gastric emptying in normal subjects but significantly increased mean post prandial gastrin secretion. This {{may be due to the}} significant reduction in mean post prandial GIP levels also seen or to the buffering capacity of <b>guar</b> <b>flour.</b> None of the subjects enjoyed guar containing foods and it was difficult to prepare acceptable products. Therefore until a better formulation is available guar gum is of limited use in diabetic management...|$|E
40|$|WO 2003017777 A UPAB: 20030505 NOVELTY - Production of {{vegetable}} protein crosslinked with transglutaminase (I) comprises (a) fractionating a protein extract, protein curds, protein concentrate, protein hydrolysate and/or protein isolate by centrifugation, ultrafiltration and/or precipitation and (b) crosslinking with 0. 01 - 10 wt. % (I) at 0 - 60 deg. C. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for protein gel produced by crosslinking fractionated vegetable protein with (I). USE - The protein gel {{is used for}} production and/or processing of food (all claimed), e. g. meat and sausage products, desserts, puddings, confectionery and ice cream. ADVANTAGE - Gelatin is used for giving food a firm texture but its animal origin often makes it undesirable. Polysaccharides and their derivatives, e. g. starch, <b>guar</b> <b>flour,</b> carob bean flour, carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan etc., are used for binding water but must be declared and are undesirable for reasons of consumer acceptance. Transglutaminase is used for crosslinking many proteins, mainly of animal origin. The present products enable the production of dimensionally stable structures with a low fraction of dry substance from proteins of entirely vegetable origin...|$|E
40|$|An {{alpha-galactosidase}} (alpha-D-galactoside galactohydrolase [EC 3. 2. 1. 22]) was purified to homogeneity {{from the}} culture filtrate of Aspergillus niger. The enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 45, 000 {{and was a}} glycoprotein. Radioactive enzyme was prepared by growing cells in [14 C]fructose and this enzyme was used to prepare 14 C-labeled glycopeptides. The glycopeptides emerged from Sephadex G- 50 between stachyose and the glycopeptide from ovalbumin. Based on calibration of the column with various-sized dextran oligosaccharides, the glycopeptides appeared to have a molecular weight of 1, 200 to 1, 400. Analysis of the glycopeptide(s) indicated that it contained mannose and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in an approximate ratio of 3 or 4 to 1. Assuming {{that there are two}} GlcNAc residues in the oligosaccharide and based on the molecular weight of the glycopeptide, the oligosaccharide probably contains eight to nine sugar residues. Alks probably attached to the protein by a GlcNAc leads to asparagine linkage. The purified alpha-galactosidase was most active on raffinose (Km = 5 x 10 [...] 4 M, Vmax = 3 mumol/min per mg of protein), but also showed good activity on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactoside ans somewhat less activity on stachyose and melibitol. The enzyme also hydrolyzed <b>guar</b> <b>flour</b> and locust bean gum, but did not attack the p-nitrophenyl glycosides of beta-galactose, alpha- or beta-glucose, or alpha- or beta-mannose...|$|E
40|$|Copra {{and other}} mannans {{including}} locust bean gum, <b>guar</b> gum, konjac <b>flour,</b> copra and defatted copra {{were used to}} produce extracellular mannanase by shaken flask cultures of Aspergillus niger NCH- 189 in this study. The best carbon source for mannanase production was defatted copra, which provided more nitrogen source and mannan content. The peak mannanase activity at 28 U ml(- 1) was obtained on the day 3 at 30 degreesC, which was four times of those obtained from other carbon sources. Presence of oil in copra depressed the mannanase production of the fungus and the amount should be less than 3 % (w/w). The copra suspension could be sequentially treated by boiling and refrigeration, followed by using n-hexane to remove copra oil. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All riahts reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} hydrocolloids on the gelatinisation behaviour of hard wheat flour were investigated. Influence of guar, xanthan, Arabic, {{carboxy methyl cellulose}} (CMC) and tragacanth gums on wheat flour was studied using micro viscoamylograph. It was found that all hydrocolloids except tragacanth greatly modified the gelatinisation properties of wheat <b>flour.</b> <b>Guar</b> and xanthan significantly lowered the gelatinisation temperature, enhanced peak viscosity, increased the breakdown during cooking, promoted the stability during cooling and thus decreased the tendency to setback. Gum Arabic lowers the peak viscosity, reduces breakdown during heating and thus provides increased stability during cooking. The addition of CMC to the wheat flour resulted in maximum stability during cooling. It also produced large breakdown during heating which provided maximum destabilization and made the cooking easier. These results suggest that by adding gums gelatinisation properties of wheat flour can be greatly modified and this {{could be used for}} the improvement of different wheat products...|$|R
40|$|Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba L.) is a spring-summer legume {{with a high}} drought tolerance, grown {{mainly in}} India, Pakistan, United States and South Africa, whose seeds contain galactomannans. These {{can be used as}} an emollient, {{softening}} or thickening agent, a flocculant, as well as in hydraulic fracturing, and as a stabiliser {{in a wide range of}} other industrial activities: the production of cosmetics, paper, textiles, paints and varnishes, detergents, in construction, and in food products (jams, jellies, yogurt, mayonnaise, ketchup, diet foods, foods for coeliacs, etc.). In the light of a growing industrial demand for <b>guar</b> <b>flour,</b> in May 2012 a trial was carried out in southern Italy. Seeds from South Africa were sown in large plots on two farms with different soil characteristics. The crop showed yields varying between 1. 8 and 2. 2 t ha – 1. Agronomic results were then used to conduct an integrated sustainability analysis using the production cost analysis and the life cycle assessment, in order to assess, respectively, the cost-effectiveness and the environmental impact of the production process of guar in a Mediterranean environment. Compared to other competitive crops, guar, with less than 3000 kg of CO 2 eq. emissions, can be considered as a low-emission crop. Given the above-mentioned yield, guar growing is economically sustainable when the purchase price of seeds is not less than 0. 96 € kg – 1...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus fumigatus secretes {{a number}} of glycosidases into the culture medium when the cells are grown in a mineral salts medium {{containing}} <b>guar</b> <b>flour</b> (a galactomannan) as the carbon source. At least some of these glycosidases {{have been reported to}} be glycoproteins having N-linked oligosaccharides. In this study, we examined the effect of the glycoprotein processing inhibitor, castanospermine, on the structures of the N-linked oligosaccharides and on the secretion of various glycosidases. Cells were grown in the presence of various amounts of castanospermine; at different times of growth, samples of the media were removed for the measurement of enzymatic activity. Of the three glycosidases assayed, beta-hexosaminidase was most sensitive to castanospermine; and its activity was depressed 30 to 40 % at 100 micrograms of alkaloid per ml and even more at higher alkaloid concentrations. On the other hand, beta-galactosidase activity was hardly diminished at castanospermine levels of up to 1 mg/ml, but significant inhibition was observed at 2 mg/ml. beta-Galactosidase was intermediate in sensitivity. Cells were grown in {{the presence or absence of}} castanospermine and labeled with [2 - 3 H]mannose, [6 - 3 H]glucosamine, or [1 - 3 H]galactose to label the sugar portion of the glycoproteins. The secreted glycoproteins were digested with pronase to obtain glycopeptides, and these were identified on Bio-Gel P- 4 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The glycopeptides were then digested with endoglucosaminidase H to release the peptide portion of susceptible structures, and the released oligosaccharides were reisolated and identified on Bio-Gel P- 4. The oligosaccharides from control and castanospermine-grown cells were identified by a combination of enzymatic and chemical studies. In control cells, the oligosaccharide appeared to be mostly Man 8 GlcNAc and Man 9 GlcNAc, whereas in the presence of alkaloid, the major structures were Glc 3 Man 7 GlcNAc and Glc 3 Man 8 GlcNAc. These data fit previous observations that castanospermine inhibits glucosidase I...|$|E
