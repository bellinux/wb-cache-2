5|$|Enforcement of the HOS is {{generally}} handled by DOT officers of each state, and are sometimes checked when CMVs pass through weigh stations. Drivers {{found to be}} {{in violation of the}} HOS can be forced to stop driving <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> period of time, which may negatively affect the motor carrier's safety rating. Requests to change the HOS are a source of contentious debate, and many surveys indicate some drivers get away with routinely violating the HOS. These facts have started another debate on whether motor carriers should be required to use ELDs in their vehicles, instead of relying on paper-based log books.|$|E

5|$|Furniture {{during the}} Baroque era was {{in keeping with}} the style: ornate, gilded and {{frequently}} with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> room, for example to match a silk wall panel within a gilt frame. As in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was always left empty so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned floor tiles.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, {{or physical}} characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, {{they are}} born {{relatively}} immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch {{but there is no}} increase during the egg stage.|$|E

5|$|Once formed, {{proteins}} only exist <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> {{period of}} time and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.|$|E

5|$|The major {{obstacle}} preventing full New London service is the {{bridge over the}} Connecticut River between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme. The drawbridge section is closed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> {{period of time to}} allow trains to pass, which prevents large boats from passing under. The Marine Trades Association opposes additional service, which would mandate more bridge closings. The 2003 agreement with Amtrak limited weekday traffic over the bridge to 2 SLE and 39 Amtrak trains until 2018, although it was revised in 2010 and 2013. Since 2003, New London had been served by cross-honored Amtrak trains plus one or two dedicated SLE roundtrips.|$|E
5|$|Additional game modes are {{available}} to the player in The Age of Kings. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> amount of time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing {{all of the other}} monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Each carving {{receives}} a special name, and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. The image to the left shows an example of Torajan wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, a wish for many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents a knot and a box, a hope {{that all of the}} family's offspring will be happy and live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an aquatic animal, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water. It also represents the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> skill to produce good results.|$|E

5|$|If, {{during their}} {{turn on the}} {{campaign}} map, the player should engage one of their armies in combat with another faction's army, or if their troops should be engaged by another faction during the AI's turn, the player then has the option of fighting a real-time battle or siege. In this gameplay mode, the player directs the troops they had brought {{with them on the}} campaign map to the engagement, ordering them to manoeuvre and attack the enemy's troops on a three-dimensional battlefield. Troops can either be killed outright on the battlefield or made to rout and flee the field if their morale falls below a certain threshold. Reviewers have noted of Rome: Total War that, during a battle, troop numbers do not outweigh all other considerations; other factors such as individual unit types' strengths and soldiers' morale and fatigue at the point of fighting are also taken into account. A battle is won when one side kills or routs the entire enemy army; a siege may be won by the attacking side through either dispatching the opposing forces or gaining control of the besieged city's central plaza <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> number of minutes, and by the defending side either by killing the attackers or by destroying their siege equipment before they have managed to breach the city's defences.|$|E

At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent of these animals were the Apis bull, worshipped at Memphis as a manifestation of the Memphite god Ptah, and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.|$|E

5|$|The aim of Calvin's {{political}} theory was {{to safeguard the}} rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Although {{he was convinced that}} the Bible contained no blueprint <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> form of government, Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. To further minimize the misuse of political power, Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy, lower estates, or magistrates in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be deposed. State and church are separate, though they have to cooperate to the benefit of the people. Christian magistrates {{have to make sure that}} the church can fulfill its duties in freedom. In extreme cases the magistrates have to expel or execute dangerous heretics. But nobody can be forced to become a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{format for}} the World Championship {{features}} 16 {{teams in the}} championship group, 12 teams in Division I and 12 teams in Division II. If {{there are more than}} 40 teams, the rest compete in Division III. The teams in the championship play a preliminary round, then the top eight teams play in the playoff medal round and the winning team is crowned World Champion. Over the years, the tournament has gone through several rule changes. In 1969 body-checking in all three zones in a rink was allowed, helmets and goaltender masks became mandatory in the early 1970s and in 1992 the IIHF began using the shootout. The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL. The World Championships have been open to all players, both professional and amateur, since 1977. The IIHF requires that players are citizens of the country they represent and allow players to switch national teams provided that they play in their new nation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> period of time.|$|E
