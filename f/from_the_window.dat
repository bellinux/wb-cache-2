5|$|After rescuing {{the three}} girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but {{overcome}} by smoke inhalation, fell limply <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> striking the projecting shop sign. She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943 he {{was given}} the job of {{registrar}} in the quarantine section at Birkenau sector BII, which allowed him to speak to deportees selected as slave labour. He had his own office with a desk, chair and bunk bed. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> he could see the lorries driving towards the gas chambers, and estimated that 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 Jews had been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, but which decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E
5|$|Momolo Mortara died in 1871, {{shortly after}} {{spending}} seven {{months in prison}} during his trial {{over the death of}} a servant girl who had fallen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his apartment. He had been found guilty of murdering her by the Florentine court of appeal, but then acquitted by the court of assizes. Pope Pius IX died in 1878. The same year Marianna travelled to Perpignan in south-western France, where she had heard Edgardo was preaching, and enjoyed an emotional reunion with her son, who was pleased to see her, but disappointed when she refused his pleas to convert to Catholicism. Edgardo thereafter attempted to re-establish connections with his family, but not all of his relatives were as receptive to him as his mother.|$|E

5|$|On May 17, 1898, {{the flag}} was {{delivered}} personally by Agoncillo and was packed {{among the things}} Aguinaldo brought back to Manila. This was the flag that was hoisted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of Aguinaldo's house in Kawit, Cavite, during the proclamation of Philippine independence on June 12, 1898 accompanied by the Philippine National Anthem Marcha Filipina. However, she did not witness either this first public display of the flag or {{the time when the}} flag was unfurled during the Malolos Congress because her husband remained in Hong Kong and she remained with him.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} transit camp. Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his office if they appeared to be moving too slowly or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot. He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant fear for their lives, as were all the inmates.|$|E

5|$|The {{commander}} of the Bastille {{at the time was}} Bernard-René de Launay, a conscientious but minor military officer. Tensions surrounding the Bastille had been rising for several weeks. Only eight prisoners remained in the fortress, but one of these, the Marquis de Sade, had stoked the link between the revolution and the Bastille, addressing the public from his walks on top of the towers and, once this was forbidden, shouting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his cell. Sade began to claim that the authorities planned to massacre the prisoners in the castle, which resulted in the governor removing him to an alternative site in early July.|$|E
5|$|Upon his retirement, Butler {{bought a}} home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where {{he lived with his}} wife. In June 1940, he checked himself into the {{hospital}} after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car so he could see it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> He {{never had a chance to}} drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|As {{the story}} begins, {{a woman named}} Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's {{assistant}} at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that the letter was sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in {{putting an end to}} them. Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. As they look out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in their room, they hear the sound of a flute and see a large, shadowy figure emerge from the mist, which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.|$|E

5|$|At the {{succession}} of King Henry I, the new king imprisoned Ranulf in the Tower of London on 15 August 1100 on charges of embezzlement. His custodian, William de Mandeville, allowed the bishop to escape on 3 February 1101. Flambard {{was not only the}} first inmate of the prison, but also the first person to escape from it. A popular legend represents the bishop as descending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his cell by a rope which friends had smuggled to him in a flagon of wine. Ranulf gave the wine to his guards, and after they were drunk and asleep, climbed down the rope to escape. His friends had arranged a ship to transport Ranulf, some of the bishop's treasure, and the bishop's elderly mother to Normandy. He took refuge across the English Channel with Henry's brother Robert Curthose, where {{he became one of the}} duke's principal advisors. King Henry dispossessed Ranulf of his lands at Whitsun in 1101, and the new Archbishop of York Gerard deposed him from his bishopric. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm arranged for Flambard's trial in a papal court for simony, and a papal decree was issued against Ranulf.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E
5|$|In the foreground, {{a drunken}} freemason, {{identified}} by his apron and set square medallion as the Worshipful Master of a lodge, is being helped home by his Tyler, as {{the contents of}} a chamber pot are emptied onto his head from a window. In some of the prints, a woman standing back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> looks down on him, suggesting that his soaking is not accidental. The freemason is traditionally identified as Sir Thomas de Veil, {{who was a member of}} Hogarth's first Lodge, Henry Fielding's predecessor as the Bow Street magistrate, and the model for Fielding's character Justice Squeezum in The Coffee-House Politician (1730). He was unpopular for his stiff sentencing of gin-sellers, which was deemed to be hypocritical as he was known to be an enthusiastic drinker. He is supported by his Tyler, a servant equipped with sword and candle-snuffer, who may be Brother Montgomerie, the Grand Tyler.|$|E

5|$|Louis then targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is {{charmed by}} his wife, Edith. He {{substitutes}} petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's darkroom, with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is {{fit to be}} his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne is the next victim. Posing as the Anglican Bishop of Matabeleland, Louis poisons his port. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his flat, Louis then uses a bow to shoot down the balloon from which the suffragette Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne a jar of caviar which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, he insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision at sea.|$|E
5|$|The film {{concerns}} a middle-aged railway pointsman, Maloin (Miroslav Krobot), {{who lives in}} a decrepit apartment in a port town with his highly-strung wife Camélia (Tilda Swinton) and his daughter Henriette (Erika Bók). One night while in his viewing tower at the port's rail terminus, Maloin witnesses a fight on the dockside. One of the shady combatants is knocked into the water along with the briefcase he carries; when the other flees the dark quayside, Maloin makes a clandestine descent from the tower and retrieves the briefcase, which he finds full of sodden English banknotes. Maloin conceals the money and tells no-one of what he has seen. The next morning, he visits a tavern where he plays chess with the barkeep (Gyula Pauer). On his way home, he stops by the butcher's where his daughter works, and finds to his indignation that they have her washing the floor. Later, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his apartment, he notices Brown (János Derzsi) watching him from below. At dinner, Maloin is increasingly irascible, addressing Henriette brusquely and arguing with Camélia. Meanwhile, Brown searches the water at the dock's edge without success before noticing the watchtower overlooking the quayside, and Maloin within.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Parma's artillery pounded at {{the walls}} for 3hours with iron cannonballs weighing 30–50 pounds; in total, his artillery fired more than 2700rounds. The Spanish made several attempts to storm the city, each repelled by Cloedt's 1600soldiers. The ninth assault breached the outer wall. The Spanish and Italian forces entered the town from opposite ends and met in the middle. Cloedt, gravely injured (his leg was reportedly almost ripped off and he had five other serious wounds), had been carried into the town. Parma's troops discovered Cloedt, being nursed by {{his wife and his}} sister. Although Parma was inclined to honor the garrison commander with a soldier's death by sword, Ernst demanded his immediate execution. The dying man was hanged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> with several other officers in his force.|$|E

5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E
