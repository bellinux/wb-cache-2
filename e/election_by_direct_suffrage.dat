40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the new Italian local electoral law (81 / 93) on local {{politics}} and gouvernement. Naples and left-wing mayor Antonio Bassolino have been chosen as our case-study because he has been the most popular mayor of this new local experiment and his terms in office have been analysed as "exemplary experience" which can have general conclusions for the whole of the local government debate. We study, in particular, {{the impact of}} his <b>election</b> <b>by</b> <b>direct</b> <b>suffrage</b> in 1993 and 1997 on two areas of political life: the relationship between the Mayor and the traditional political parties and the public policy-making process. We {{come to the conclusion that}} even if this reform has not introduced any real change in terms of quality and efficiency in decision-making, it has produced in Naples a new form of personnalisation of politics, of political behaviour and of public policy-making "symbolic politics".

25|$|Consequently, Portuguese {{politics}} {{entered a}} period of tacit coexistence between the parties. While the Constitutional Charter did not change, the processes of government were modified: <b>elections</b> were made <b>by</b> <b>direct</b> <b>suffrage,</b> while Parliament could appoint commissions of inquiry into governmental acts.

50|$|Following the Revolution in February 1848, France and its {{legislature}} {{entered a}} turbulent period. The enormous painting of Louis Philippe taking his oath to the nation, over the tribune in the Chamber of Deputies was taken down, {{and replaced by}} a Gobelin tapestry of the painting of Raphael, The School of Athens, made between 1683 and 1688. The Chamber of Deputies elected in 1846 was abruptly disbanded by the February Revolution. A new <b>election</b> <b>by</b> <b>direct</b> universal <b>suffrage</b> chose a Constituent Assembly, The Constituent Assembly {{met for the first}} time in the temporary chamber which had been constructed in the garden of the Palais Bourbon, and the on 4 May the Second French Republic was proclaimed at the Palais Bourbon. On May 15 a mob with red flags invaded the chamber, demanding a much more radical government. Another unsuccessful attempt to seize the government was launched by in June 1848. A new National Assembly was elected, and a new President, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, the nephew of the Emperor, who had lived most of his life in exile. On December 2, 1851, when the Assembly to refused to change the Constitution to allow him to run for a second term, Louis Napoleon organized a coup d'état, took power, and had himself proclaimed Emperor Napoleon III, bringing an end to the Second Republic. Opposition deputies were arrested and exiled. The Assembly continued to meet in the Palais Bourbon, but had little influence over the Emperor or the government. They were not allowed to speak from the Tribune, but only from the floor of the Chamber.|$|R
40|$|The {{choice to}} focus on the actual {{organization}} of the governmental organs of the Comune and their political-institutional relationships, origins from the consideration that the general organization of the Republic is aimed to give full dignity and expression to the concept of the local autonomies, on which puts the basis the political dimension of the Comune. In this scenario, the Comune is considered as both the local government and the political subject that represents its Community. The core of the self-government in the Italian Republic bases on the significance of both the art. 1 and 5 taken together. Taking together these findings, the Italian Constitution consider the people as the resultant of all the local Communities, guarantied by the Constitution and constructs a complex form of Government made up of a central government and of local governments. The link between local government, local communities and the structure of the Republic, constitutes the fundament of the interpretation of the art. 1 and 5 of the Italian Constitution in that it attributes a major role to the individual Comuni. Following this interpretation, we link the art. 5 to the fifth title, second part, of the Italian constitution in which the attention focuses on the structure of local government and on the three needed elements: the existence of multiple local subjects, the regulation and the government organization. The Comune has been the first level of Government to test the <b>election</b> <b>by</b> universal and <b>direct</b> <b>suffrage</b> of the mayor as a proof-of-principle for the direct election of the prime minister. The <b>election</b> <b>by</b> universal and <b>direct</b> <b>suffrage</b> of the mayor, puts in severe crisis the central position of the town council. At this point it is interesting to establish whether the coexistence of a mayor and of a town council both elected <b>by</b> universal and <b>direct</b> <b>suffrage</b> is a confusing element or, otherwise, it represents an innovative point of the local government. 	The relation between the mayor and the town council is regulated both by rules regarding their <b>election</b> that <b>by</b> rules that take care of the power organization. In the relationships between mayor and town council exists a constant represented <b>by</b> the <b>election</b> <b>by</b> universal and <b>direct</b> <b>suffrage</b> {{but there is also a}} variable that is represented <b>by</b> the council <b>election</b> that could brings to a council majority more or less supporting the mayor or a majority adverse to the last one. 	It is possible that the majority of which the council is constituted could be the expression of a unique electoral list – this will be the case in the minor Comuni as an obligate condition – or, alternatively it could be the result of a coalition of different electoral lists. In both the cases this majority which is born homogeneous and that supports the mayor, not necessary could persists in the future. On the opposite, when the majority of which the council is constituted is the result of more than one connected lists, the same lists are in competition on two levels: the electoral level, in that each list competes for the election at the council; and the institutional level, for which in the body of the council, each list can form a proper group so that each political part of the majority can participate to the government assessment. The relationships between the political parties of the coalition of the majority, are the political predominant variable with which the major has to face. The major, for his side, can be more or less expression of a political part. If the electoral results produce not homogeneous majorities between council and mayor, the political variables become crucial and the politic mandate can start on the basis of an agreement of “not-no confidence” but with a political programme strongly affected by the choices of the majority of the council that not supports the mayor. In this scenario, the mayor has a vantage: if the town council will force the mayor to the resign, the council well knows that the fall of the mayor is followed by that of the council and as a consequence this so leads to the election again of both the mayor and the town council. The cohabitation of mayor and town council bases on flexible models of consensual type. The complexity and flexibility of this model, is the outcome on the political and institutional level of the complexity of the plural societies of which the Comuni represent an expression. In conclusion, to solve the problems of the local government, it is not needed to simplify the system but it will be better, to introduce different and multiple government systems on the basis of the complex realities of the reference communities...|$|R
5|$|The 1866 North German Constitution became (with some {{semantic}} adjustments) the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire. With this constitution, the new Germany acquired some democratic features: {{notably the}} Imperial Diet, which—in {{contrast to the}} parliament of Prussia—gave citizens representation {{on the basis of}} <b>elections</b> <b>by</b> <b>direct</b> and equal <b>suffrage</b> of all males who had reached the age of 25. Furthermore, elections were generally free of chicanery, engendering pride in the national parliament. However, legislation required the consent of the Bundesrat, the federal council of deputies from the states, in and over which Prussia had a powerful influence; Prussia could appoint 17 of 58 delegates with only 14 votes needed for a veto. Prussia thus exercised influence in both bodies, with executive power vested in the Prussian King as Kaiser, who appointed the federal chancellor. The chancellor was accountable solely to, and served entirely at the discretion of, the Emperor. Officially, the chancellor functioned as a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers. With the exception of the years 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the imperial chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of the imperial dynasty's hegemonic home-kingdom, Prussia. The Imperial Diet had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills, but it could not initiate legislation. (The power of initiating legislation rested with the chancellor.) The other states retained their own governments, but the military forces of the smaller states came under Prussian control. The militaries of the larger states (such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony) retained some autonomy, but they underwent major reforms to coordinate with Prussian military principles and came under federal government control in wartime.|$|R
