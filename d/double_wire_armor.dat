40|$|Risers are {{flexible}} multilayered pipes {{formed by}} an inner flexible metal structure surrounded by polymer layers and spiral wound steel ligaments, {{also known as}} <b>armor</b> <b>wires.</b> Since these risers are used to link subsea pipelines to floating {{oil and gas production}} installations, and their failure could produce catastrophic consequences, some methods have been proposed to monitor the armor integrity. However, until now there is no practical method that allows the automatic non-destructive detection of individual <b>armor</b> <b>wire</b> rupture.

In order not to exclude or jail the left subclavian artery with a stent, a <b>double</b> <b>wire</b> technique was used. From a femoral approach, two guide wires were positioned, one in the aortic arch and another in the subclavian artery. A stent crimped over a 16 -mm balloon and a 4 -Fr catheter was advanced over the two wires within a 14 -Fr long introducer sheath. The stent was successfully deployed and molded within the bifurcation by a kissing balloon technique, relieving the obstruction and leaving a guaranteed passage to the subclavian artery.

40|$|Sternal {{instability}} after CABG via median sternotomy is {{a relatively}} rare but serious complication accompanied by a considerable rate of mortality. Obese patients {{are at high risk}} for sternal instability after CABG. The optimal method of sternal closure is subject of a controversial debate. This study was conducted to examine the impact of double-wire sternal closure and other possible risk factors on sternal instability. We performed a single-center prospective randomized study at the Heart Center Brandenburg, Bernau, comparing a newly invented method of sternal closure by the use of <b>double</b> <b>wires</b> to the conventional closure by eight single wires. 200 obese patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m² undergoing isolated CABG with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft were randomly assigned to sternal closure either by <b>double</b> <b>wires</b> DW (n[*]=[*] 100) or by single wires SW (n[*]=[*] 100). Patients´ characteristics were similar in both groups. Postoperatively, we focused on the incidence of sternal instability. The follow-up period was 6 weeks. During follow-up, there was a total of 21 cases with sternal instability: 5 patients in the DW group (5  %) and 16 patients in the SW group (16  %) (p[*]=[*] 0. 019). Hence, the incidence of sternal instability proofed to be 68. 75  % lower in the DW group, compared to the SW group. Logistic regression analysis showed sternal closure via <b>double</b> <b>wires</b> as an independent protection factor (OR: 0. 276; p= 0. 029). Smoking (OR: 5. 5; p= 0. 006) and postoperative delirium (OR: 3. 5; p= 0. 033) turned out to be independent risk factors for the development of sternal instability. In our experience, the use of double-wire sternal closure significantly reduces postoperative sternal instability in obese patients (BMI [*]≥ 30 kg/m²) undergoing isolated CABG with LIMA graft, compared to the use of eight single wires...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Double</b> <b>wire,</b> twin loop, or Wire-O binding {{is a type}} of binding that is {{used for}} books that will be viewed or read in an office or home type environment. The binding {{involves}} the use of a [...] "C" [...] shaped wire spine that is squeezed into a round shape using a <b>wire</b> closing device. <b>Double</b> <b>wire</b> binding allows books to have smooth crossover and is affordable in many colors. This binding is great for annual reports, owners manuals and software manuals. Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the binding edge. This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch hole pattern with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch hole pattern with two holes per inch. The three to one hole pattern is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" [...] in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the <b>wire</b> binding elements (<b>double</b> loop <b>wire)</b> to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a [...] "closer" [...] which is basically a vise that crimps the wire closed and into its round shape. The back page can then be turned back to its correct position, thus hiding the spine of the book.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flame {{stability}} of gaseous fuel inside meso-scale combustor with <b>double</b> <b>wire</b> mesh was investigated experimentally. Combustor {{was made from}} quartz glass tube with an inner diameter of 3, 5 mm and an outer diameter of 5 mm. Two pieces of wire meshes were made from stainless steel inserted at 10 and 13 mm {{from the end of}} combustor. Propane was used as fuel in this research. Flame was stabilized in the region between two wire meshes. The flame has a blue luminosity, indicate no soot formation condition. However, the second wire mesh and combustor wall has red luminousity at high velocity reactant, indicate that they have high temperature and emmited heat radiation. Meso-scale combustor with <b>double</b> <b>wire</b> mesh has broader flame stability area if compared to combustor with single wire mesh. Extention of this region occured toward lower equivalence ratio for lean fuel mixture, as well as toward higher equivalence ratio for rich fuel mixture. The most important extention region of flame stability area is toward higher reactant flow rate. It was caused by existing of second wire mesh which has function to prevent occurence of blow–off at relatively high reactant flow rate, as well as to increase heat recirculation to unburnt reactant as a results of higher wall temperature...|$|R

The calculations are usually {{performed in a}} 2 -D frame using the finite-element method or alternative approaches, such as MoM-SO, thereby losing the 3 -D effects imposed by twisting <b>wire</b> screens and <b>armors.</b> One {{of the implications of}} using 2 -D modeling for three-core and closely packed single-core cables is that currents will always circulate among the individual wires of each <b>wire</b> screen or <b>armor.</b> However, in the case of twisted screens/armors where the wires are insulated from each other, such current circulation will in reality not exist. As a result, the calculated impedances become incorrect as well as the induced currents and losses on individual conductors. A procedure is introduced for preventing such false current circulations in a 2 -D calculation frame by simple manipulation of the system impedance matrix. The approach is demonstrated for the modeling of single-core and three-core cables, with and without external armor. It is shown that the representation of the <b>wire</b> screen/armor <b>armor</b> with respect to current circulations can substantially influence the calculated result, both for the 50 / 60 Hz impedance and the cable transient behavior.
