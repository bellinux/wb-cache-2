40|$|MASTERS OF SCIENCE IN MEDIA ARTS AND SCIENCES PAN is a {{wireless}} communication {{system that allows}} electronic devices on and near the human body to exchange digital information through near-field electrostatic coupling. Information is transmitted by modulating electric fields and electrostatically (capactively) coupling picoamp currents into the body. The body conducts the tiny current (e. g., 50 pA) to body mounted receivers. The environment (“room ground”) provides a return path for the transmitted signal. A low frequency carrier (e. g., 330 kHz) is used so no energy is propagated, minimizing remote eavesdropping and interference by neighboring PANs. Digital information is transferred using on-off keying with quadrature detection to reduce stray interference and increase receiver sensitivity. A low cost (<$ 20) <b>half-duplex</b> <b>modem</b> is implemented using an analog bipolar chopper and integrator as a quadrature detector, and a microcontroller for signal acquisition. The technology used in the PAN can b...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a CMOS 0. 8 μm mixed-signal <b>half-duplex</b> <b>Modem</b> ASIC for data transmission on the low-voltage power line. It includes all the analog circuitry needed for input interfacing and modulation/demodulation (low-noise amplifier, PLL-based frequency synthesis, tunable filter banks, and decision circuitry), logic circuitry for control purposes, and an output amplifier used as front-end for an off-chip line driver. The chip demodulates signals down to 283 μVrms (these are worst case values among 30 randomly-selected samples used as vehicles for detailed electrical characterization; {{most of the}} samples featured 200 μVrms sensitivity; bit error rate (BER) is below 0. 5 × 10 - 5) at 10 kbps, and operates correctly in the whole industrial temperature range, from - 45 °C to 80 °C, under 5 % variations of the 5 V supply voltage. This ASIC is now in commercial production. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{multihop}} underwater acoustic line network, {{which consists}} {{of a series of}} equal-distance hops connected by relay transceivers in a tandem, is considered. Messages are originated as coded packets from a source node at one end, relayed sequentially hop by hop (decoded and re-encoded), and finally received by a destination node {{at the other end of}} the network. Several key characteristics of underwater acoustic channels, namely, frequency-dependent signal attenuation and noise, interhop interference, <b>half-duplex</b> <b>modem</b> constraint, and large propagation delay, are taken into account in the analysis. Simple transmission protocols with spatial reuse and periodic transmit/receive schedule are considered. Performance bounds and scheduling design are developed to satisfy the half-duplex constraint on relay transceivers in the presence of long propagation delay. To efficiently cope with frequency-dependent channel characteristic and interhop interference, the power spectral density (PSD) of the signaling is analytically optimized in a way analogous to water filling. Furthermore, the problem of determining the minimum number of hops to support a prespecified rate and reliability with and without a maximum coded packet length constraint is examined. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate the analysis.

5000|$|In this scheme, {{commonly}} called [...] "RTS/CTS flow control" [...] or [...] "RTS/CTS handshaking" [...] (though the technically correct name would be [...] "RTR/CTS"), the DTE asserts RTR whenever {{it is ready}} to receive data from the DCE, and the DCE asserts CTS whenever it is ready to receive data from the DTE. Unlike the original use of RTS and CTS with <b>half-duplex</b> <b>modems,</b> these two signals operate independently from one another. This {{is an example of}} hardware flow control. However, [...] "hardware flow control" [...] in the description of the options available on an RS-232-equipped device does not always mean RTS/CTS handshaking.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} {{hardware}} flow {{control is a}} <b>Half-duplex</b> radio <b>modem</b> to computer interface. In this case, the controlling software in the modem and computer may be written to give priority to incoming radio signals such that outgoing data from the computer is paused by lowering CTS if the modem detects a reception.|$|R
50|$|On board {{control is}} {{provided}} by a Pumpkin FM430 flight control module containing a Texas Instruments MPS430 microcontroller. Communications are provided by a <b>half-duplex</b> UHF <b>modem</b> with a 1.5 Mbit/s downlink (465 MHz) and 19.2 kbit/s uplink (450 MHz). The satellites carry four Electric Field Probe sensors on telescopic booms, two DC Langmuir probes for detection of ions and a three-axis magnetometer for measuring magnetic fields.|$|R
50|$|Ways {{to achieve}} higher speeds than 1,200 bits/s, include using {{telephone}} modem chips via {{the microphone and}} audio out connectors. This has been proven to work at speeds up to 4,800 bit/s using fax V.27 <b>modems</b> in <b>half-duplex</b> mode. These <b>modems</b> use phase shift keying which works fine {{when there is no}} amplitude shift keying, but at faster speeds such as 9,600 bit/s, signal levels become critical and they are extremely sensitive to group delay in the radio. These systems were pioneered by Simon Taylor (G1NTX) and Jerry Sandys (G8DXZ) in the 1980s. Other systems which involved small modification of the radio were developed by James Miller (G3RUH) and operated at 9,600 bit/s.|$|R
