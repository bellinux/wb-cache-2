5000|$|Modeled after APCs, aAPCs {{need to have}} {{at least}} two signals to stimulate antigen {{specific}} T cells. The first signal is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which in humans is also called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA). This is the molecule which is loaded with the specific antigen. MHC class I are found on all cells and stimulate cytotoxic T cells (CD8 cells), and MHC class II are found on APCs and stimulate <b>helper</b> T <b>cells</b> (<b>CD4</b> <b>cells).</b> It is the specific antigen or epitope that is loaded into the MHC determines the antigen-specificity. The peptide-loaded MHC engages with the cognate T cell receptor (TCR) found on the T cells.|$|R
50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the HIN-200 (hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear antigens with 200 amino acid repeats) family of cytokines. The encoded protein {{contains}} domains involved in DNA binding, transcriptional regulation, and protein-protein interactions. The protein localizes to the nucleoplasm and nucleoli, and interacts with p53, retinoblastoma-1 and BRCA1. It modulates p53 function, and inhibits cell growth in the Ras/Raf signaling pathway. IFI16 has been shown {{to play a role in}} the sensing of intracellular DNA - a hallmark of virally infected cells - and has also been linked to the death of HIV-infected <b>helper</b> <b>CD4</b> T <b>cells</b> by proptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death.|$|R
25|$|Arsenic {{exposure}} in small children distorts {{the ratio of}} T <b>helper</b> <b>cells</b> (<b>CD4)</b> to cytotoxic T cells (CD8), which are responsible for immunodepression. In addition, arsenic also increases the number of inflammatory molecules being secreted through macrophages. The excess amount of granulocytes and monocytes lead to a chronic state of inflammation, which might result in cancer development.|$|R
5000|$|Allergy and {{hypersensitivity}} {{reactions in}} general are traditionally thought of as misguided or excessive reactions by the immune system, possibly due to broken or underdeveloped mechanisms of peripheral tolerance. Usually, Treg cells, TR1, and Th3 cells at mucosal surfaces suppress type 2 <b>CD4</b> <b>helper</b> <b>cells,</b> mast cells, and eosinophils, which mediate allergic response. Deficits in Treg cells or their localization to mucosa have been implicated in asthma and atopic dermatitis. [...] Attempts {{have been made to}} reduce hypersensitivity reactions by oral tolerance and other means of repeated exposure. Repeated administration of the allergen in slowly increasing doses, subcutaneously or sublingually appears to be effective for allergic rhinitis. Repeated administration of antibiotics, which can form haptens to cause allergic reactions, can also reduce antibiotic allergies in children.|$|R
2500|$|On {{surfaces}} of <b>helper</b> T <b>cells</b> are <b>CD4</b> receptors, {{as well as}} T cell receptors (TCRs). [...] When a naive <b>helper</b> T <b>cell's</b> <b>CD4</b> molecule docks to an APC's MHC class II molecule, its TCR can meet and be imprinted by the epitope coupled within the MHC class II. [...] This event primes the naive helper T cell. [...] According to the local milieu, that is, the balance of cytokines secreted by APCs in the microenvironment, the naive helper T cell (Th0) polarizes into either a memory Th cell or an effector Th cell of phenotype either type 1 (Th1), type 2 (Th2), type 17 (Th17), or regulatory/suppressor (Treg), as so far identified, the Th cell's terminal differentiation.|$|R
50|$|CD4 {{testing is}} a normal {{practice}} in the clinical laboratory, and is accomplished {{through the use of}} flow cytometry. Flow cytometry is a standard technique used in virtually every hospital and research institution around the world. While flow cytometry techniques are straightforward, they are not necessarily simple, particularly when applied to clinical practice. A great deal of automated technology is employed to gather measurements, analyze data, and produce reports. Consequently, the cost of performing these tests is relatively high. CD4 testing is generally performed by a flow cytometer. In this process, a small tube of blood cells is treated with a reagent which is specific to the CD4 lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell).The reagents used for identification are called monoclonal antibodies (MABs). These antibodies can specifically attach to a certain type of cell. In this case, the antibody will attach to a <b>CD4</b> T <b>cell.</b> Certain molecules (called fluorochromes) areattached to the antibody to aid in the identification process. When a laser beam is fired at the cells, those cells with the attached molecules emit a signal identifying themselves. This signal is called fluorescence and can easily be measured with sensitive detectors. If hundreds or thousands of cells are forced past the laser very quickly, an accurate count can be obtained of all cells that are present. <b>CD4</b> <b>cells</b> are measured in this manner. CD is an acronym for “cluster of differentiation,” and that simply means that this molecule can be classified into a well-defined group of cells. In this case, it is cluster of differentiation 4, or a <b>CD4</b> <b>helper</b> T-lymphocyte <b>cell.</b>|$|R
5|$|Helper T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} <b>helper</b> <b>cell's</b> <b>CD4</b> co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|R

50|$|The {{function}} {{of the immune system}} depends in a large part on interleukins, and rare deficiencies of a number of them have been described, all featuring autoimmune diseases or immune deficiency. The majority of interleukins are synthesized by <b>helper</b> <b>CD4</b> T lymphocytes, as well as through monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. They promote the development and differentiation of T and B lymphocytes, and hematopoietic cells.|$|R

50|$|CD4+ T {{helper cells}} are {{white blood cells}} that are an {{essential}} part of the human immune system. They are often referred to as <b>CD4</b> <b>cells,</b> T-helper cells or T4 cells. They are called helper cells because one of their main roles is to send signals to other types of immune cells, including CD8 killer cells, which then destroy the infectious particle. If <b>CD4</b> <b>cells</b> become depleted, for example in untreated HIV infection, or following immune suppression prior to a transplant, the body is left vulnerable to a wide range of infections that it would otherwise have been able to fight.|$|R

25|$|Nevirapine {{may cause}} severe or {{life-threatening}} liver toxicity, usually {{emerging in the}} first six weeks of treatment. In 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning on nevirapine, warning that it could cause life-threatening liver toxicity and skin reactions. Unacceptably high risk of serious liver symptoms in certain patient groups (women with CD4 count >250 and men >400) has led the U.S. DHHS to recommend the restriction of nevirapine use to those at lower risk, unless the benefit to the patient clearly outweighs the risk; although in the 2NN study which found these CD4 limits, the effect was seen only in patients recruited from Thailand. More recent studies on the use of Nevirapine in people with higher <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> counts have come to the following conclusion: Treatment-experienced patients who start NVP-based combination therapy with low pre–ART and high current <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> counts and an undetectable VL have a similar likelihood for discontinuing NVP therapy because of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), compared with treatment-naive patients with low <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> counts. This suggests that NVP-based combination therapy may be safely initiated in such patients. However, in similar patients with a detectable VL, it is prudent to continue to adhere to current <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> count thresholds. The U.S. Public Health Service Task Force advocates caution in the use of nevirapine in pregnancy due to toxicity issues, which may be exacerbated during pregnancy.|$|R

50|$|The {{youngest}} of Hasso von Boehmer's three children, Harald obtained an M.D. from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (1968) and a Ph.D. from Melbourne University, Australia (1974). He {{was a member}} of the Basel Institute for Immunology in Switzerland (1973-1996), director of Unité INSERM 373 at the René Descartes University in Paris, France and is Professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Harvard University, Cambridge and Chief of the Laboratory for Lymphocyte Biology at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. He is also currently an adjunct professor at the University of Florida. Harald von Boehmer has studied the role of T lymphocytes in the immune system. In particular he has addressed the contribution of the T cell receptor (TCR) to recognition by T cells of peptide-MHC complexes by transfer of TCR alpha and beta genes from one T cell clone to another. Questions concerned with the role of positive and negative selection of developing T cells by peptide-MHC complexes in the thymus in generating an effective and self-tolerant immune system were analyzed in TCR transgenic mice. The same experimental system served the purpose to study the impact of TCR-ligation on developing T cells by MHC class I and MHC class II ligands on the intrathymic generation of CD8 killer and <b>CD4</b> <b>helper</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively. Further studies were concerned with the structure and function of the pre-T cell receptor and its role in controlling survival and differentiation of developing T cells that have succeeded in productive TCR beta rearrangement. Presently Harald von Boehmer studies the generation and function of regulatory T cells that have an essential role in preventing autoimmunity with the goal to exploit these cells in the prevention of and interference with unwanted immune reactions.|$|R

50|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus is a viral infection that targets the lymph nodes. HIV binds to the immune <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> and reverse transcriptase alters the host cell genome to allow {{integration of the}} viral DNA via integrase. The virus replicates using the host cell's machinery and then leaves the cell to infect additional cells via budding.|$|R
50|$|PPSV is {{important}} for those with HIV/AIDS. In Canadian HIV patients, the vaccine {{has been reported to}} decrease the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease from 768/100,000 person-years to 244/100,000 patient-years. Current WHO guidelines recommend immunization with PPV-23 for HIV patients in clinical stage 1, while the CDC recommends immunization in those with a <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> count greater than 200/μL.|$|R
50|$|<b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> counts {{are another}} key measure of immune status and ART effectiveness. CD4 counts should rise 50 to 100 cells per ml {{in the first}} year of therapy. There can be {{substantial}} fluctuation in CD4 counts of up to 25% based on the time of day or concominant infections. In one long term study, the majority of increase in <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> counts was in the first two years after starting ART with little increase afterwards. This study also found that patients who began ART at lower CD4 counts continued to have lower CD4 counts than those who started at higher CD4 counts. When viral suppression on ART is achieved but without a corresponding increase in CD4 counts it can be termed immunologic nonresponse or immunologic failure. While this is predictive of worse outcomes, there is no consensus on how to adjust therapy to immunologic failure and whether switching therapy is beneficial. DHHS guidelines do not recommend switching an otherwise suppressive regimen.|$|R
50|$|Rifabutin is well tolerated in {{patients}} with HIV-related tuberculosis (TB), but new findings suggest that patients with low <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> counts have {{a high risk of}} treatment failure or relapse due to acquired rifamycin resistance. Since patients co-infected with TB and HIV/AIDS are likely to get TB treated first, when the CD4 is suppressed at the time TB treatment begins, doctors and patients should be aware of a possible rifamycin resistance.|$|R
50|$|They {{are used}} in combination; {{typically}} 3 or more drugs from 2 or more different classes, a form of therapy known as {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} or HAART. The aim of therapy is suppression of the virus to very low, ideally undetectable, levels in the blood this prevents the virus from depleting the immune cells that it preferentially attacks (<b>CD4</b> <b>cells)</b> and prevents or delays illness and death.|$|R
50|$|Disulfiram is {{also being}} studied as a {{treatment}} for cocaine dependence, as it prevents the breakdown of dopamine (a neurotransmitter whose release is stimulated by cocaine); the excess dopamine results in increased anxiety, elevated blood pressure, restlessness, and other unpleasant symptoms.

50|$|The co-epidemic of {{tuberculosis}} (TB) and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) {{is one of the}} major global health challenges in the present time. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports 9.2 million new cases of TB in 2006 of whom 7.7% were HIV-infected. Tuberculosis is the most common contagious infection in HIV-Immunocompromised patients leading to death. These both diseases become dreadful in combination as HIV declines the human immunity while tuberculosis becomes progressive due to defective immune system.This condition becomes more severe in case of multi-drug (MDRTB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB), which are difficult to treat and contribute to increased mortality. See Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can occur at any stage of HIV infection. The risk and severity {{of tuberculosis}} increases soon after infection with HIV. A study on gold miners of South Africa revealed that the risk of TB was doubled during the first year after HIV seroconversion. Although tuberculosis can be a relatively early manifestation of HIV infection, it is important to note that the risk of tuberculosis progresses as the <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> count decreases along with the progression of HIV infection. The risk of TB generally remains high in HIV-infected patients above the background risk of the general population even with effective immune reconstitution with ART maintaining high <b>CD4</b> <b>cell</b> counts.|$|R
