5|$|Crush {{contains}} ten levels <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> locations, {{all based}} on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many tall buildings and the occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E

In two matches for Victoria between the Third and Fourth Tests, Hassett hit 200 against Queensland and 190 against NSW; in both innings he scored {{at a rate}} of almost 50 runs per hour. Victoria won both their matches against arch-rivals NSW convincingly, by an innings and 288 runs respectively, and won the Sheffield Shield, having secured victory <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> matches that Hassett played in. Hassett was highly {{productive}} throughout the whole season, ending with 1,213 runs at 71.35.|$|E

5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask {{is set in}} Termina, a land {{parallel}} to Hyrule, the latter being the main setting of most games in the series. According to legend, Termina was split into four areas by four magical giants that live in four regions of the land. At the center of Termina lies Clock Town, which features a large clock tower that counts down {{the days before the}} Carnival of Time—a major festival where the people of Termina pray for good luck and harvests.

5|$|The site can be visited, {{although}} little restoration {{work has}} been done to it. Various temple pyramids, the remains of palaces (mostly reduced to mounds of rubble) and a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame {{can be seen in the}} site core. In the Greater Q'umarkaj area there were four ballcourts, one <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> major political divisions of the city, testifying to the central role of the ballgame ritual in the sociopolitical organisation of the city.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the first round; Somerset faced first-class opposition <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> rounds prior to the final. In their semi-final match against Essex, Somerset only progressed as they had lost fewer wickets in a tied match. Sussex played against minor counties {{in each of the}} first two rounds, but only beat Staffordshire by two runs to advance from the second round, before more straightforward victories against first-class opposition in the later stages. Somerset batted first, but with the exception of Ian Botham, the batsmen struggled to score runs fluently. They scored 207 runs for 7 wickets, of which Botham scored 80 and Viv Richards 44. Sussex began their run-chase well, with a first-wicket partnership of 93, before losing four wickets in quick succession. A second partnership, between Paul Parker and Paul Phillipson led Sussex to victory by five wickets, chasing down Somerset's total with more than six overs to spare. Parker was named as the man of the match for his score of 62 not out.|$|E

Professor Sidney Ruffleberg and his three companions were transported to Evermore, but are unable to leave. The boy quickly learns that the regions are manifestations of those citizens' personal utopias. Each of the three companions act as the ruler {{of his or her}} world: Elizabeth, the Professor's niece, is the tribal chief of Prehistoria; Horace Highwater, curator of the Podunk Museum, oversees Antiqua; Camellia Bluegarden, a portly librarian, is the Queen of Gothica; and Professor Ruffleberg monitors everything from Omnitopia, with his android butler, Carltron, alongside him. Within Prehistoria, Antiqua, and Gothica, the boy and his canine companion aid Elizabeth, Horace, and Camellia in thwarting attempts by robotic clones of the Podunk citizens from ruling their respective areas.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{retained}} {{his place}} for the 1964 tour to England, and scored a century against Western Australia for the touring squad before departing for the northern hemisphere. After failing to pass 16 {{in his first two}} outings, he struck form against Glamorgan, scoring 65 and an unbeaten 109. He then added 151 and 17 not out, leading the way as the Australians defeated the MCC by nine wickets in a dress rehearsal for the Tests. However, O'Neill scored 98 in the first four innings of the opening two Tests and was forced out of the Third Test with a knee injury, the only non-draw of the series, which Australia won. Nevertheless, he passed 50 <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> tour matches during this period, including a 134 against Yorkshire and 90 against Northamptonshire.|$|E
5|$|The 1932 NFL season {{resulted}} in a tie for first place between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, {{and could not be}} resolved by the typical winloss system. To settle the tie, a playoff game was played; Chicago won the game and the championship. The following year, the NFL split into two divisions, and the winner of each division would play in the NFL Championship Game. In 1967, the NFL and the rival AFL agreed to merge, effective following the 1969 season; as part of this deal, the NFL champion from 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL–NFL World Championship Game <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> seasons before the completed merger. The NFL Championship Game was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC Championship Game. The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion.|$|E

5|$|The temple is {{surrounded}} by a tall stone boundary wall with minarets at each of the four corners, suggesting a Muslim influence on the architecture. A Muslim chieftain was patron of the temple at one time. The temple has four gates, each facing a cardinal direction and with an image of Ganesha, each gate depicting him in the form that he appeared <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> ages (yugas). Each of the four Ganesha forms is associated with a Puruṣārtha (aim of life) and accompanied by two attendants. The image of Ballalvinayaka at the eastern gate, accompanied by god Rama (Vishnu's Avatar) and his consort Sita, symbolises Dharma (righteousness, duty, ethnics) and embodies the preserver-god Vishnu. Vignesha at the southern gate, flanked by Ganesha's parents Shiva and Parvati (Uma) symbolises Artha (wealth and fame) and embodies the dissolver – Shiva. Cintamani at the western gate – representing Kama (desire, love and sensual pleasure) – is attended by the love god Kamadeva and his wife Rati and embodies the formless (asat) Brahman. Mahaganapati at the northern gate standing for moksha (salvation), is accompanied by Varaha (Vishnu's boar avatar) and his wife the earth goddess Mahi embodies Sat Brahman.|$|E
