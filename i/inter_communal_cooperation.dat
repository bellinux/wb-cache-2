But his 70 rounds of talks over two years with Demetris Christofias, the Greek Cypriot leader and President of the Republic of Cyprus, did not produce a comprehensive settlement.

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{economic and}} social importance {{of water on the}} Mediterranean coast adds significance to the theoretical frameworks employed in explaining water uses. It is rewarding to compare monographs on mills in feudal Valencia with the proposal drawn up by Miquel Barceló (and followed by the “agrarian archaeology” group). Their statement of general approach has helped to conceptualise data, yet case studies published since 1988 suggest the need for a new appraisal of this topic. Water use in feudal societies cannot be analysed with no theoretical framework to guide it, using empiricism alone, nor can its foundations be a mere appendage of Andalusian water systems. Institutional features, such as local control based on <b>communal</b> <b>cooperation,</b> flexible operating mechanisms used to distribute water flows, consensual rules for irrigators, and the formulas employed to limit the enormous potential for conflict over water are important when examining the social strategies adopted. It is therefore imperative to launch a discussion of the challenge of building a family of models that shed light on the features of feudal water systems in the Mediterranean. Given its usefulness in attracting the interest of researchers to the critical study of constant institutional adjustments, the proposal by Arthur Maass and T. E Glick should {{play an important role in}} addressing this complicated matter...|$|R
5000|$|Her last {{paragraph}} {{is titled}} a [...] "Social Contract between Men and Women." [...] Taking a leaf from Rousseau’s book, the contract asks for <b>communal</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The wealth {{of a husband}} and wife should be distributed equally. Property should belong to both and to the children, whatever bed they come from. If the husband and wife are divorced, their land should be divided equally. She called this the [...] "marriage contract." [...] Gouges also proposed allowing a poor man’s wife to have her children adopted by a wealthy family; this would advance the community’s wealth and reduce disorder. Near the end of the contract, Gouges requests creation of a law to protect widows and girls from men who make false promises. This, perhaps, is the most important issue she deals with in France. In the postscript section, Gouges describes the consequences for women who are left by an unfaithful husband or who are widowed with no fortune to their name, and those of young, inexperienced girls who are seduced by men who leave them with no money and no title for their children. Gouges demands a law that will force an unfaithful or unscrupulous man to fulfill his obligations to such a woman, or to at least to pay a reimbursement equal to his wealth.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is an Investigation {{into the}} Tuareg involvement in violent {{conflict in the}} Sahara and the Sahel of North Africa from a sociological psychological perspective of unmet human needs. The research begins by establishing the structure and texture of the sociological, psychological, and emotional life patterns of their existence when not involved in violent conflict. This is followed by {{an examination of the}} pathology of Tuareg social structures that are engaged in intra and <b>inter</b> <b>communal</b> violence as perpetrators, victims, and bystanders. The first part of the research establishes normal conditions of the sociological life cycle and highlights natural areas of conflict that arise from exposure to rapid and/or external changes to their physical and social environment. The second part establishes parameters of expected damage from trauma, extended conflict, and failure to adapt to rapid environmental, social and political changes. The research methodology relies on a case study format that uses collaborative ethnography and phenomenological inquiry to answer the research questions and validate propositions made from existing literature and pre]existing research. The research questions focus on aspects of the sociological structure and failing psychological and emotional needs that are relevant to the subjectfs involvement in violent conflict. The research propositions are in part shaped from existing knowledge of tribal sociological structures that are related to the Tuareg by ethnicity, environment, and shared psycho]cultural attributes. The expected contribution of this research is the development of an alternative praxis for tribal engagement and village stability operations conducted by the United States Special Operations Command...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{and development}} of complex societies in the Amazonian lowlands has been historically debated {{as a function of}} the relationships between human populations and the natural environment. Culture ecology on one hand, and historical ecology, on the other hand, have offered different views on cultural development, without providing compelling archaeological testing. The present study proposes an ecological-economic model to account for the emergence of social complexity on Marajó Island. This model predicts that in areas of abundant aquatic resources, <b>communal</b> <b>cooperation</b> for the construction of river dams and ponds allowed for the development of a highly productive fishing economy with low labor investment. The production of surpluses created opportunities for kin group leaders to compete for the administration of the water-management systems, leading to control over resources and surplus flow. The differential access to resources created social stratification, and the development of a complex religious-ideological system in order to legitimize the political economy. Focusing on one of the Marajoara chiefdoms, a group of 34 mounds located along the Camutins River, the study demonstrates that the location of ceremonial mounds in highly productive areas was related to control over aquaculture systems. The study suggests that the existence of similar ecological conditions in several other locations on the Island led to the multiplication of small chiefdoms, which, once in place, competed for labor, prestige, and power. Based also on data provided by other researchers, this study proposes a chronology for the emergence and demise of complex societies on Marajó Island, as well as defining the main periods within Marajoara phase...|$|R
40|$|As a continent, Africa {{has been}} explored, exploited, and largely {{abandoned}} by the West. During the colonial era of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, foreign powers encountered diverse cultures, superstitions and disease before promptly labeling the entire continent a dangerous and primitive place. For early explorers and colonialists, disease {{and the threat of}} ill health is what defined Africa. They overlooked the pre-existing strategies and practices that Africans had adapted to guard against certain diseases, either ignoring them or labeling the misunderstood safety nets as primitive. Also overlooked was the importance of societal organization and <b>communal</b> <b>cooperation</b> among kin groups in the realms of health and economy. A false assumption of the continent as backwards and diseased spread among those living in the first world, and this legacy of thought is still in existence today. The history of health and healing in Africa is one of social ties and family economics, emphasizing the importance of kinship and community cooperation. While much of this essay focuses on the 19 th and 20 th centuries, it is of note that in certain areas, such as the Cape Town colony of South Africa, colonial interference extends back as early as the 16 th century. During and after the colonial period, many of the important values and safety nets that had previously upheld the health and healing processes of Africans were renegotiated or abandoned, leaving behind the continued yet misperceived notion of Africa as a continent continuously riddled with disease...|$|R

40|$|In 1922, a {{group of}} eastern European Jewish {{immigrants}} joined together to form the Jewish Community council of Montreal (Vaad Ha’ir) to coordinate and organize the growing Jewish population’s communal needs. Merging Orthodox and secular elements, the Vaad Ha’ir of Montreal was founded to manage the basics of Jewish life in Canada: reliable kosher food, Jewish education, <b>communal</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and mutual aid. Beset by struggle, competition, recalcitrant butchers, wayward kosher slaughterers, and conniving wholesalers, the Vaad’s history has been an active one. Centering this study on {{the archives of the}} Vaad Ha’ir of Montreal in the 1950 s and 60 s, I have identified the challenges faced by voluntary Jewish communal bodies in North America. Although the archives are mostly limited to the mid-century period, the analysis takes us beyond that point into the twenty-first century to examine how these changes have affected Orthodoxy in the long term. Questions of ethnic identity, Orthodox adaptability, and communal boundaries are reflected within the records of this community, and form the basis of my analysis. Although the Vaad Ha’ir aspired to recreate a European-style communal council that would dictate virtually every aspect of Jewish life, {{as was the case in}} Europe, the new North American reality would not permit such authority. Faced with new social and legal circumstances, the history of the Vaad Ha’ir illuminates the struggle of traditional Jewish communities in North America to address the challenges of voluntary societies and personal freedom. By the end of the century, the agenda of the Vaad Ha’ir of Montreal was decidedly narrower than previously. This winnowing of communal power and influence provides evidence that that European-style communal councils were not easily amenable to the new reality of individual liberties in the new world. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} two dams {{excavated}} in the Merovingian settlement Oegstgeest-Rijnfrontare discussed. This settlement is located along a former river {{branch of the}} Old Rhine river {{at the place where}} tributaries enter the river. Water management which is crucial for the continuity of the habitation is discussed. Dam A is located at the mouth of a side creek that flowed out into the Old Rhine river. This dam measured about 45 x 10 meters and was constructed of about 1000 wooden poles and about 900 cubic meters of sods. The dam could be dated to {{the first half of the}} sixth century. Dam B was located 100 meters further to the east and measured about 25 x 5 meters. It was constructed of about 500 wooden poles and contained at least 125 cubic meters of sods. Both dams were probably constructed in the early Autumn. The construction of the dams implies that it was not an ad hoc construction, some planning had to be involved, because it would have taken some time to fell all trees necessary and to gather all sods needed for the dam body. In addition to the dams more structures related to water management that were dug up in this settlement. Some of them like a bridge are also discussed in this thesis. All these structures show that the people inhabiting the settlement were capable to deal with problems caused by water. The construction of these structures implies that there would have been some sort of <b>communal</b> <b>cooperation</b> within the settlement, since it is impossible for a single family or household to construct, for example, dam A. It is likely that the settlement was divided in ‘districts’ that all put in some effort. Also the future research is discussed, since it is likely that more dams will be discovered in the future...|$|R
