40|$|Human has {{the ability}} to learn and decide their action based on {{experiences}} when confronting a problem. Human decision often involves multi-functionality, where multiple control functions are applied for achieving a single goal. Conventional control often involves human in providing commands which mostly depends on the human decision. However, these decisions commonly involve single control function where multi-functionality can not be provided without human assistance. Learning Control helps a machine constructs its own control knowledge autonomously through operation experiences. The development of Control Knowledge through Learning Control would require a period of training that could involve a number of failures among successful attempts. The Control Knowledge obtained is usually limited to single control function based on the training environment with less flexibility in varying environment. Learning Control Systems with multiple functions could provide a wider range of control options against any environment. In this research, Learning Control System <b>with</b> <b>multi-functionality</b> is designed and developed. Here, application of Learning Control <b>with</b> <b>multi-functionality</b> provides a more human-like control operation with ability to adapt and consider the surrounding environment during control operation. The designs were evaluated through experiments and simulations where results confirm the effectiveness of the designed system. Through these results, the designs of multi-functions Learning Control may provide a safer and reliable control on control devices including complex non-linear control device...|$|R

40|$|International audienceInorganic micro- and {{nanoparticles}} have promising {{applications in}} various domains including nanomedicine. However, those fabricated by top-down approach, which has potential for production of size and shape-specific particles, {{have not been}} sufficiently exploited in the domain. In this study, we intend to demonstrate the feasibility of integration of multi-functionalities into one non-spherical microparticle by combining photolithography with self-assembled monolayers. Formation of self-assembled monolayers provides versatile chemical functionalities by tailoring the interfaces between the micro- and nanoparticles of any geometry or size and their environment with molecular precision. Herein, square plate-like gold microparticles were region-selectively functionalized by self-assembled monolayers with two different active terminal moieties such as amine and biotin. Further modification allowed integrating multi-functionalities including fluorescent probes and biomolecules into one particle, which has been confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. These results suggest a potential use of such non-spherical micro- and nanoparticles <b>with</b> <b>multi-functionalities</b> for target-specific diagnostics and therapeutics...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 68 - 74. Incorporating nanoparticles into nanocomposite thin-films enables coatings <b>with</b> <b>multi-functionality</b> {{depending on}} the particle type and size, and the film morphology. These multiple functions may include, for example, combinations of photocatalysis, hydrophobicity, scratch resistance, and antibacterial property. Here we proposed and demonstrated a new encapsulation nanocomposite with controllable refractive index and potentially additional functional properties for coating photonic devices, for instance, light-emitting diodes (LEDs). To design and implement this nanocomposite coating with tunable refractive index, we employed TiO 2 nanoparticles of various diameters because of their relatively high refractive index. We embedded these nanoparticles in our encapsulation sol-gel material during synthesis. In addition, we incorporated several polymerforming chemicals during synthesis to control additional functions such as hydrophobicity and scratch resistance. We used characterization tools of atomic force microscopy, refractometry, contact angle measurement, and scanning electron microscopy to study material properties. Toru, Refik SinaM. S...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a heteroatom-containing luminogen (TPE-Py) <b>with</b> <b>multi-functionalities</b> was {{synthesized}} in {{a reasonable}} yield by melding a pyridinium unit with tetraphenylethene through vinyl functionality. TPE-Py is weakly emissive in solution but becomes a strong emitter when aggregated as nanoparticle suspensions in poor solvents or in the solid state, displaying a phenomenon of aggregation-induced emission. Crystallization generally weakens and red-shifts the light emission. The crystalline aggregates of TPE-Py, however, emit stronger and bluer light than their amorphous counterparts. The solid-state emission of TPE-Py can be reversibly switched between green and yellow color by grinding–fuming and grinding–heating processes with a high contrast due to the transformation from the crystalline to the amorphous state and vice versa. The large Stokes shift and well-ordered molecular arrangement of the crystalline microrods of TPE-Py make it promising as an optical waveguide material with a low optical loss coefficient of ∼ 0. 032 dB μm− 1. TPE-Py works as a good fluorescent visualizer for specific staining of mitochondria in living cells with a high photostability, thanks to its hydrophobic and cationic features...|$|R
