5000|$|Although The Bonzos {{had started}} out playing and parodying trad jazz and 1920s-style popular music, by 1967 they were contemplating {{embracing}} a more contemporary style of rock music, in order to counter claims that they sounded too much like The Temperance Seven or the fictional, studio-concocted New Vaudeville Band. In fact although they were now exclusively managed by Gerry Bron, The Bonzos were invited to perform live as the New Vaudeville Band in order to capitalise on the fictional group's recent chart success with [...] "Winchester Cathedral" [...] - an offer The Bonzos immediately declined in favour of retaining their own artistic control. However Bob Kerr happily agreed to help form a real New Vaudeville Band, allegedly taking {{the bulk of his}} former band-mates' stage act with him, a move which finally forced The Bonzos' hand over the change of direction (Kerr later went on to create his own long-standing early Bonzos/Vaudevilles-style band, Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band, which included other ex-Bonzos Sam Spoons and Vernon Nowell in its future line-ups). According to Neil Innes, The Bonzos had learned a salutary lesson about the pitfalls of show business: [...] Our trumpeter then was Bob Kerr, great player, and a fun guy. But he was friends with (songwriter and producer) Geoff Stephens, who'd made [...] "Winchester Cathedral" [...] with session men. And he knew Bob, so he rang Bob up saying: 'What am I going to do? [...] "Winchester Cathedral"'s a hit, and I've got no band to promote it.' So Bob came, flushed with excitement, {{to the rest of us}} at our digs, saying, 'We can be The New Vaudeville Band!' and we said, 'Certainly not, no way!' So, Bob couldn't understand this, so we said, 'Well, go, you go and do it then, if you want to. Go, never darken our towels again!', kind of thing. But the next thing, on Top of the Pops, was the New Vaudeville Band, with the singer looking exactly like Viv, in a sort of lamé suit, all the musicians wearing the kind of suits we were wearing, with two-tone shoes. They'd even nicked the cutout comic speaking balloons, which we made out of hardboard, with a <b>fret</b> <b>saw,</b> and painted white, and then wrote, 'Wow, I'm really expressing myself!' to hold over somebody's head while they did a saxophone solo. There was the entire image, and for the next few weeks people were saying to us, 'Hey, you're like that New Vaudeville Band!' And that's when I think Legs Larry Smith said, [...] "Well, look ...' - he'd always been arguing for doing some more modern material, so we all said, 'Right, now we start writing our own stuff.' [...] " [...] The situation proved fortuitous, however, as they were able to capitalise on the burgeoning spirit of the times by combining their jazz stylings with increasingly fashionable psychedelic touches. As their popularity increased (especially among other musicians), they were asked by Paul McCartney to appear in The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour film at the end of 1967, performing [...] "Death Cab For Cutie".|$|E
40|$|In the sawing {{processes}} of solid woods and wood based materials with a <b>fret</b> <b>saw</b> blade, {{in order to}} make clear the sawing characteristics which are related to sawing-force components, saw-blade wear, machinability of the materials, sawing efficiency and so forth, a more fundamental research under the actual sawing conditions should be carried out. For that purpose, it is important and necessary to make clear the sawing-force components and the sawing phenomena. But few studies have dealt with the exact measurements of them, and so, the main objective {{of this study is to}} obtain quantitative information on them. In this study. the basic sawing tests of solid woods and wood based materials were performed, using an experimental apparatus designed for sawing with a <b>fret</b> <b>saw</b> blade. The main (Fp) and thrust (Fq) components of the sawing force were measured, And in addition to measurement of these components, the several sawing phenomena were observed and measured. Based on these results the sawing characteristics were discussed...|$|E
50|$|On hacksaws, as {{with most}} frame saws, the blade can be mounted with the teeth facing toward or away from the handle, {{resulting}} in cutting action on either the push or pull stroke. In normal use, cutting vertically downwards with work held in a bench vice, hacksaw blades should be set to be facing forwards. Some frame <b>saws,</b> including <b>Fret</b> <b>Saws</b> and Piercing Saws, have their blades set to be facing the handle because {{they are used to}} cut by being pulled down against a horizontal surface.|$|R

[...] He turned to the others, as if for support. [...] "What can {{you do with a}} girl who talks in this way? How'm I to make her understand?" ...|$|R
50|$|Marquetry as {{a modern}} craft most {{commonly}} uses knife-cut veneers. However, the knife-cutting technique usually {{requires a lot of}} time. For that reason, many marquetarians have switched to <b>fret</b> or scroll <b>saw</b> techniques. Other requirements are a pattern of some kind, some brown gummed tape (IE as the moistened glue dries it causes the tape to shrink and so the veneer pieces are pulled closer together), PVA glue and a base-board with balancing veneers on the alternate face to compensate stresses. Finishing the piece will require fine abrasive paper always backed by a sanding block. Either ordinary varnish, special varnishes, modern polyurethane -oil or water based- good waxes and even the technique of french polish are different methods used to seal and finish the piece.|$|R
40|$|CD 4 {{interactions}} with class II {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) molecules are essen-tial for CD 4 + T cell development, activation, and effector functions. While its association with p 56 lck (Lck), a Src kinase, is important for these functions CD 4 also has an Lck-inde-pendent role in TCR signaling that is incompletely understood. Here, we identify a con-served GGxxG motif in the CD 4 transmembrane domain that {{is related to the}} previously described GxxxG motifs of other proteins and predicted to form a flat glycine patch in a transmembrane helix. In other proteins, these patches have been reported to mediate dimerization of transmembrane domains. Here we show that introducing bulky side-chains into this patch (GGxxG to GVxxL) impairs the Lck-independent role of CD 4 in T cell activa-tion upon TCR engagement of agonist and weak agonist stimulation. However, using For-ster’s Resonance Energy Transfer (<b>FRET),</b> we <b>saw</b> no evidence that these mutations decreased CD 4 dimerization either in the unliganded state or upon engagement of pMHC concomitantly with the TCR. This suggests that the CD 4 transmembrane domain is either mediating {{interactions with}} an unidentified partner, or mediating some other function such as membrane domain localization that is important for its role in T cell activation...|$|R
