5|$|In September 2007, Peace {{acquired}} additional {{shares in}} West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited, taking his total {{stake in the}} company to 50.56%. This triggered a requirement, under the Takeover Code, <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares in both WBA Holdings Ltd and WBA Ltd. Later that year, Michelle Davies became Albion's first female director. She, however, has since stepped down from this position. Jeremy Peace announced in June 2008 that {{he was looking for a}} major new investor for the club, but no firm proposals were received by 31 July deadline.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} seven people, and took ten months to make. It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Atsushi Inaba, with music by Masakazu Sugimori, character design by Kumiko Suekane, and art by Tatsuro Iwamoto. In 2000, after Takumi had finished his work on Dino Crisis 2, his boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to. Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and felt that this was a big chance <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a mark as a creator.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it hard <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased {{to be able to}} support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and {{felt that this was}} a big chance <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1987 Cleveland Browns season, Junkin was {{projected}} to be the starting outside linebacker opposite Clay Matthews, Jr. despite playing inside linebacker in college, which generated criticism around the league as a transition that would be difficult <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> After a 16-day , the Browns and Junkin agreed to a four-year deal worth nearly two million dollars. After missing the first preseason game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he made his debut against the New York Giants. In that game, he played the second half and failed to record a tackle. By the end of training camp, due to struggles learning the outside linebacker position, he made the roster, but lost the starting job to Anthony Griggs. After the Browns moved to a 4-3 defense for the second game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Junkin made his debut, and the plan was for him to gradually see more playing time each week. In early November, due {{to a combination of}} a players' strike and an injured wrist, Junkin was placed on the injured reserve list and replaced on the active roster by David Grayson.|$|E

5000|$|Here, then, is {{the most}} titillating part of the Washington Times story: [...] "At about noon {{on the day of}} the fight, (Barnett Magids) reached Resnick again by phone, and at this time, Resnick said <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> not <b>make</b> any bets, but just go watch the fight on pay TV, and he would know why..." ...|$|R

25|$|Jennings {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket debut for Kent in August 1909 in a County Championship match against Surrey at The Oval. This {{was his only}} appearance in the Kent Championship winning side of 1909 and it took until 1912 <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> more than three appearances in a season for Kent, a County with a particularly strong batting lineup at the time.|$|E
25|$|With his {{soldiers}} {{he moved to}} Chantaburi, and being rebuffed by the Governor of the town for his friendly overtures, he made a surprise night attack on it and captured it on June 15, 1767, only two months of after the sack of Ayutthaya. His army was rapidly increasing in numbers, as men of Chantaburi and Trat, which had not been plundered and depopulated by the Burmese, naturally constituted a suitable base <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> preparations for the liberation of his motherland.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} the story was published, detectives arrested Brooklyn Eagle {{reporter}} Francis A. Mallison who quickly confessed to {{his involvement in the}} hoax and implicated his editor as having organized the deception. Howard was arrested at his Brooklyn home and later made a full confession. Having an intimate knowledge of the newspaper industry, he knew that the price of gold would skyrocket if word got out of a delay in the war effort. He invested heavily in gold and, when he and Mallison used various couriers to plant the false information in the press the following morning, it was a simple matter for him to sell his shares once the price had risen enough <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a huge profit.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish royal Council of State sent to King Philip IV on March 7, 1625 {{a report}} on the {{appointment}} of a governor for the Philippines to replace Alonso Fajardo y Tenza. In 1623 Fajardo had sought permission to return to Spain, asking for a better office as a reward for his services and those of his father and other ancestors. Before he could leave the Philippines, he died (July 1624). The Council's report listed eleven candidates, with the merits and services of each and the number of votes each received in the Council. The report was submitted directly to the king, <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his choice. Juan Niño de Tabora received the appointment, but in the meantime the death of Fajardo necessitated the appointment of an interim governor. This was Fernándo de Silva.|$|E
25|$|The {{unconventional}} {{music of}} Berlioz irritated the established concert and opera scene. Berlioz {{often had to}} arrange for his own performances as well as pay for them himself. This took a heavy toll on him financially and emotionally. The nature of his large works– sometimes involving hundreds of performers– made financial success difficult. His journalistic abilities became essential <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a living and he survived as a witty critic, emphasizing the importance of drama and expressiveness in musical entertainment. It was perhaps this expense which prevented Berlioz from composing more opera than he did. His talent in the genre is obvious, but opera {{is the most expensive}} of all classical forms, and Berlioz in particular struggled to arrange stagings of his operas, {{due in part to the}} unwillingness of conservative Paris opera companies to perform his work.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, he {{held two}} sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York. In March 2017, Yoshiki {{performed}} with a 4-piece string quartet at Hong Kong’s Asia Film Awards. In April 2017, Yoshiki debuted a special collaboration T-Shirt with rock group KISS titled “YOSHIKISS”. During these performances, he lost sensation {{in his left}} hand and was rediagnosed with cervical foraminal stenosis. In May 2017, it was announced that Yoshiki would undergo emergency cervical artificial disc replacement surgery in Los Angeles on May 16, resulting in the cancelling of his schedule for May, and future events being possibly cancelled or rescheduled based on discussions after his surgery. The surgery was successful, with his surgical wound expected to take six weeks to heal, and <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a 90% recovery in six months. However, the recovery period for the pain in his hand is unknown.|$|E

25|$|The replay (the last semi-final replay in {{the history}} of the FA Cup) went down as one of the {{greatest}} games ever played. David Beckham opened the scoring with a curving shot past Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman from 22 yards, but Dennis Bergkamp equalised halfway through the second half, his shot deflecting off the knee of Jaap Stam. Nicolas Anelka had the ball in the back of the net for Arsenal again shortly afterwards, and the celebrations were well underway before anyone realised that the linesman had flagged Anelka offside before the goal was scored. Roy Keane then received a second booking and was sent off for a cynical foul on Marc Overmars, leaving Manchester United to play out the match with 10 men. The match was heading for extra time when Phil Neville made a tired challenge on Ray Parlour inside the penalty area; Bergkamp stepped up to take the penalty, but Peter Schmeichel guessed the direction of his kick correctly and it was at a good height <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the save. The first half of extra time passed without incident, before Patrick Vieira gave the ball away to Giggs at the start of the second; Giggs ran from just inside his own half, taking on four Arsenal defenders as he drove into the penalty area, then shot from a narrow angle over the head of Seaman into the roof of the Arsenal net. Manchester United hung on for the remaining 10 minutes to secure their place in the final.|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of ten visits to Britain during his life, totalling about 20 months, Mendelssohn won a strong following, {{sufficient}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a deep impression on British musical life. He composed and performed, and he edited for British publishers the first critical editions of oratorios of Handel and of the organ music of J. S. Bach. Scotland inspired two of his most famous works: the overture The Hebrides (also known as Fingal's Cave); and the Scottish Symphony (Symphony No. 3).|$|E
500|$|In mid-September (around {{the time}} he wrote the letter to Burgoyne), Sir Henry Clinton had around 7,000 men, {{including}} around 3,000 poorly trained Loyalists, to defend New York City.

[...] On September 29, he {{received a letter from}} Burgoyne (written after Freeman's Farm) in response to his that was a direct plea for action.|$|E
50|$|Eventually it was {{determined}} that the code base for the game had to be scrapped and the off-site programmer terminated. Because of speed considerations, the programmer had developed the game in assembly from the beginning. However, the complexity of the assembly language code eventually overwhelmed him and he was unable to determine the cause of bugs, nor how to fix them. It was evident that it would be impossible <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>make</b> significant progress on the game, much less finish it.|$|R

No longer does the business man thank the better classes <b>for</b> permitting <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> and distribute bread and motor-cars and books. No longer does he crawl to the church to buy pardon for usury. Business is being recognized--and is recognizing itself--as ruler of the world.|$|R
500|$|Luna {{said that}} the episode was the most {{challenging}} of the show <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> with the production involving [...] "nightshoots, stunts, driving, blood and squibs". To create the car crash that leads to Reyes becoming Ghost Rider, FuseFX created a CG double {{of the car to}} flip, with a lookalike car also used to drag along the ground. A digital double of Luna was created to show him come flying out of the car, which was merged with footage of Luna hanging from wires. FuseFX also created Reyes' transformations into and from Ghost Rider, CoSAFX handled the energy blasts in the episode, and Pixomondo created the visual of carbon ore materializing.|$|E
500|$|Much of Connor's {{development}} in season {{three and four}} is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists; {{he is unable to}} find his place or his purpose for being. Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break, which he thinks [...] "makes him empathetic in midst of making all wrong choices". Steven S. DeKnight says: [...] We really wanted to highlight [...] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance. He never had a childhood, he's been lied to and manipulated and in this episode we find out his whole reason for being was to bring this other thing into this world, so he's been played his entire life. You really root <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the right decision in this one, but you know tragic figure he doesn't.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{process was}} tough for both musicians, and their breakup was almost certain considering {{the deterioration of}} their relationship. [...] "At that point, I just wanted out," [...] Simon later said. Their breakup {{was not intended to}} be semi-permanent: Garfunkel hoped for a two-year break from Simon & Garfunkel and did not intend to pursue a film career. Likewise, Simon did not intend to begin a solo career. A brief British tour followed the album release, and the duo's last concert as Simon & Garfunkel occurred at Forest Hills Stadium. In 1971, the album took home six awards at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Simon's wife, Peggy Harper, pushed <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the split official, and he placed a call to Davis to confirm the duo's breakup: [...] "I want you to know I’ve decided to split with Artie. I don’t think we’ll be recording together again." [...] For the next several years, the duo would only speak [...] "two or three" [...] times a year.|$|E
