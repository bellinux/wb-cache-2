5|$|Wonka announces {{a contest}} whereby {{children}} that find Golden Tickets hidden in five Wonka bars {{will be given}} a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate, and one a chance to be presented with an unknown grand prize. Four tickets are quickly found: the greedy and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) from Düsseldorf; the spoiled and rotten Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) from Buckinghamshire; the competitive and boastful Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) from Atlanta; and the arrogant and aggressive Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) from Denver. Charlie hopes to find a ticket but his chances are small as money <b>is</b> <b>tight,</b> and the best has to be made of his annual birthday present of one Wonka bar and a bar bought by Grandpa Joe's money, both of which yield no tickets. All hope is seemingly crushed when the last ticket is apparently claimed in Russia. Charlie, on finding some money in the street, just intends to enjoy one chocolate bar when news breaks that the Russian ticket was fake. To Charlie's surprise, he finds the bar he just bought has the real last Golden Ticket. Bystanders attempt to separate him from it, only for the shopkeeper (Oscar James) to see that he keeps the ticket and gets back home with it.|$|E

25|$|The graph {{is named}} after Percy John Heawood, who in 1890 proved that in every {{subdivision}} of the torus into polygons, the polygonal regions can be colored by at most seven colors. The Heawood graph forms a subdivision of the torus with seven mutually adjacent regions, showing that this bound <b>is</b> <b>tight.</b>|$|E

25|$|The annual Founder's Day {{celebration of}} the school is an event of three or four-days in the Autumn Term, usually {{in the last week}} of October. Many ex-pupils come {{from all parts of the}} world to {{celebrate}} the event. Security on campus <b>is</b> <b>tight,</b> since alumni attending the event often include senior politicians and government officials, and the chief guest is usually a very prominent person. The event includes productions of English dramas followed by an orchestral concert given by members of the school's Music Society.|$|E
25|$|Haredi {{women wear}} blouses {{covering}} the elbow and collarbone, and skirts {{that cover the}} knees while standing and sitting. The ideal sleeve and skirt length varies by community. Some women try not to follow fashion, while others wear fashionable, but modest, clothing. Haredi women avoid skirts with slits, preferring instead kick-pleats. They also avoid overly eye-catching colors, especially bright red, as well as clothing that <b>is</b> <b>tight.</b> Many will only wear closed-toe shoes, and always wear stockings, the thickness of which varies by community.|$|E
25|$|The spindle, carved {{to reduce}} {{friction}} {{at one end}} and maximize it at the other, is held in a hole {{in the bottom of the}} bearing block, and at the other by the base board (which also is known variously as the hearth, hearth board, or fireboard). The string of the bow is wrapped once around it, so that it <b>is</b> <b>tight</b> enough not to slip during operation. A variation on this is called the Egyptian Bow Drill. It attaches the string by wrapping it around multiple times, or actually tying it to the drill or through a hole through the drill shaft, then wrapping it.|$|E

25|$|As Paul Erdős observed, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem {{immediately}} {{implies that}} any set of n points {{that are not}} collinear determines at least n different lines. As a base case, the result is clearly true for n=3. For any larger value of n, {{the result can be}} reduced from n points to n1 points, by deleting an ordinary line and one of the two points on it. Thus, it follows by mathematical induction. The example of a near-pencil (a set of n1 collinear points together with one additional point that is not on the same line as the other points) shows that this bound <b>is</b> <b>tight.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} {{function of the}} correct lead is for balance. While they are unimportant on a straight line, they can greatly influence the athletic ability of a horse on turns, especially if the turn <b>is</b> <b>tight</b> or performed at speed. Horses naturally lean in to the direction they are turning. Since they extend their lead-side legs further out, they may use them to balance themselves as they lean into that direction. So, if on the right lead while taking a right turn, the right hind will be positioned more under the body, and the right foreleg more {{in front of the}} body, to act as a stabilizer as the horse turns.|$|E
25|$|A small flip tap {{and a short}} spout is the {{standard}} neck for dispensing cask ale. An alternative is a long spout with a tight 180° turn, called a swan-neck, {{which is designed to}} force the beer into the glass, agitating it so that a fuller head is created. Some drinkers disapprove of swan-necks, believing that flavour is reduced. In some pubs a small device or cap, known as a sparkler, is fitted {{to the end of the}} spout and acts like a sprinkler at the end of a hose pipe. This can be twisted to regulate the flow of the beer. When the sparkler <b>is</b> <b>tight,</b> the beer is severely agitated resulting in a creamy head; it is softer and creamier with less bitterness.|$|E

25|$|Chan {{created his}} screen persona as a {{response}} to the late Bruce Lee and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after Lee's death. Lee's characters were typically stern, morally upright heroes. In contrast, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular men, often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends, or families, who always triumph in the end despite the odds. Additionally, he has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee's: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his tight to the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan <b>is</b> <b>tight</b> and choppy. Despite the success of the Rush Hour series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it, since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie nor understands American humour.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{separator}} theorem of {{this type}} is shown, {{it can be used}} to produce a separator hierarchy for n-vertex planar graphs that again does not depend on the graph structure: the tree-decomposition formed from this hierarchy has width O(√n) and can be used for any planar graph. The set of all pairs of vertices in this tree-decomposition that both belong to a common node of the tree-decomposition forms a trivially perfect graph with O(n3/2) vertices that contains every n-vertex planar graph as a subgraph. A similar construction shows that bounded-degree planar graphs have universal graphs with O(nnbsp&lognbsp&n) edges, where the constant hidden in the O notation depends on the degree bound. Any universal graph for planar graphs (or even for trees of unbounded degree) must have Ω(nnbsp&lognbsp&n) edges, but it remains unknown whether this lower bound or the O(n3/2) upper bound <b>is</b> <b>tight</b> for universal graphs for arbitrary planar graphs.|$|E
25|$|The planned date of {{commissioning}} {{has been}} postponed several times. Thus, in July 1997, the commissioning {{of the new}} line was still expected in 2004. In December 2006, the Federal Government and Deutsche Bahn AG announced that the new line would be completed in 2016. In May 2006, the opening year was given as 2020 in {{a response to a}} parliamentary question from the Green Party, although the Federal Minister of Transport Wolfgang Tiefensee indicated {{at the opening of the}} Nürnberg-Ingolstadt high-speed line, that the line would be opened in 2016/2017. At the end of 2007 the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that the line would not be completed until 2041. Later, it became known that 2041 had been used in a meeting of the board of directors to refer to the completion date of the upgraded line between Fürth and Ebensfeld. The new line is still planned to be completed by 2017 at the latest. Commissioning is now scheduled for the timetable change on 8December 2017. According to information from mid-2015, this date <b>is</b> <b>tight,</b> but it can be kept. €29million were provided for the new line from the KonjunkturpaketI ("stimulus package I"). In December 2006, a parliamentary support group was founded called Vollendung des Verkehrsprojektes Deutsche Einheit Nr.8 ("Completion of German Unity transport project No. 8"), comprising over twenty Bundestag deputies. The parliamentarians were keen to accelerate the completion of the line. In April 2007, Transport Minister Tiefensee confirmed with the support group that the line would be completied by 2016, but in May 2008 the parliamentarians announced 2017 as the completion date in a press release.|$|E

[...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story."

Reflecting on the situation Queen stated: [...] "Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which <b>is</b> <b>tight,</b> and mine too, we could not do it again. We have no idea who hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did." [...] The collaboration stemmed from Queen's previous collaboration with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album La Revolución (2009) on [...] "Perfecto" [...] which also featured Yaviah.|$|E
