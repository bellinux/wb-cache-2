40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} {{operating}} limit measurements are presented for one self-fabricated and one commercial solar heat pipe at horizontal and small inclination angles. While for the self-fabricated test sample heat transfer {{is limited by}} entrainment, <b>dry-out</b> <b>limit</b> is observed for the commercial solar heat pipe. Operating limit measurements of the commercial solar heat pipe show good reproducibility, whereas the detected operating limit of the self-fabricated heat pipe varies drastically. When tested at slight inclination, high temperature oscillations indicating geyser boiling effects are observed for the commercial test sample. Finally, operating limit definitions given by the literature are discussed regarding their applicability for solar thermal applications...|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 7, the {{calculated}} and experimental values keep good agreement at low and medium heat flux. Then the deviation gradually increases. This {{is because the}} heat transfer mode in the evaporator of the thermosyphon {{is similar to the}} pool boiling heat transfer at low and medium heat flux, but dry-out area on the heated surface will appear and it increases gradually with increasing the heat flux, leading to the deviation of the present study with the pool boiling heat transfer. With the increase of the dry-out area, the HTC flattens and finally decreases till the <b>dry-out</b> <b>limit</b> happens. Therefore, Equation 6 fails to predict the HTC at high heat flux.|$|E
40|$|Heat {{pipes and}} other phase change devices have vast {{application}} to thermal management systems {{due to their}} efficient heat transfer capabilities. Current trends for improving the thermal performance of heat pipes have been focused on optimization of different wick geometries, to give the most efficient liquid transport while lowering the overall thermal resistance of the device. Advances in manufacturing have opened research to high capillarity micro- and nano-structured wicks. The choice of working fluid has been limited in the past. However, recently discovered advanced working fluids can offer several advantages. A novel working fluid for phase change heat transfer devices was investigated at UCLA. The Inorganic Aqueous Solution (IAS) has shown significant thermal performance enhancement due to surface augmentation but the deposition mechanisms of the IAS surface coating havenâ€™t been fully observed or understood. The goal of this work was to observe the deposition and wetting dynamics of the fluid during operation in a heat pipe and use information from those experiments to develop a predictive thermal and hydrodynamic model of flow in a heat pipe. In this work, a background in phase change heat transfer and advanced working fluids is first presented. Three tasks, coating characterization, heat pipe experiment, and heat pipe modeling are outlined. Deposition mechanisms of a new working fluid were examined through accurate flat heat pipe experiments. Surprising observations of the deposition patterns in a grooved wick yielded valuable insight into the fundamental heat transfer concepts in which the fluid enhances heat pipe thermal performance. The role of interesting dynamics of the fluid, including the role of advective flow in a heat pipe, or the creeping nature of salt deposits, in enhancing heat transfer were identified. These observations were then utilized to develop a heat pipe model to {{study the effects of}} the deposition on heat pipe thermal resistance and <b>dry-out</b> <b>limit</b> theoretically. Strategic application of experimental closure to the model lead to even more interesting findings. Important information regarding the dry-out dynamics of flows with and without coatings was learned that will help develop the fluids...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Multiphase flow and heat transfer in mini/microspaces are of significant interest for thermal management applications, where the latent heat of phase change offers an efficient method to dissipate large heat fluxes in a compact device, such as a heat spreader or a heat pipe. However, a significant challenge {{for the implementation of}} microscale phase change heat spreader is associated with micro/nano flow instabilities due to insufficient micro/nano bubble removal, leading to local liquid <b>dry-out</b> which severely <b>limits</b> the heat removal efficiency. This work will conduct a review on the challenges and opportunities that surfaces with micro/nanostructure patterned wettabilities. Bubble dynamics, fluid flow and heat transfer caused by the micro/nanostructure patterned surfaces will be reported and discussed. The effects of micro/nanostructure patterned surfaces on flow generation under a vapor bubble in a microchannel under very low Reynolds number will be demonstrated. The effects of wettability patterned surfaces on nucleation pool boiling and flow boiling heat transfer processes will be described. Bubble formation, breakup and departure are visualized and measured. Wettability patterned micro/nanostructure surfaces are manufactured on glass wafers and copper surfaces, respectively. Different surface hexagonal pattern size will be used. Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), Fluoroalkylsilanes (FAS) and Copper Oxide (CuO) will be used for glass and copper surfaces, respectively. It is found that bubble dynamics and pool boiling performance are enhanced significantly on smooth and flat surfaces combining hydrophilic and hydrophobic patterns in comparison with a hydrophilic surface. A micro/nanostructured heat spreader with asymmetrical wettability patterns will be demonstrated. dc 201...|$|R
