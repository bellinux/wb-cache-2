50|$|While it {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} that many cognitive abilities, such as general intelligence, have genetic bases, evidence for the genetic basis of facial recognition abilities specifically is fairly recent. Some of the earliest published research {{on the relationship between}} facial recognition and genetics focused on the genetic bases of facial recognition in the context of genetic disorders which impair facial recognition abilities, such as Turner syndrome. In a study by Lawrence, K. et al. in 2003 the authors found significantly poorer facial recognition abilities in individuals with Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder which results in impaired amygdala functioning, suggesting that amygdala functioning may <b>impact</b> <b>face</b> perception. Evidence for the genetic basis of facial recognition abilities in the general population, however, comes from studies on face perception in twin participants by Wilmer, J. B. et al. in 2009, in which the facial recognition scores on the Cambridge Face Memory test were twice as similar for monozygotic twins in comparison to dizygotic twins. This finding was supported by a twin study on the genetic bases of facial recognition by Zhu, Q. et al. in (2009) which found a similar difference in facial recognition scores when comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins and Shakeshaft, N. G. & Plomin, R. (2015), which determined the heritability of facial recognition to be approximately 61%, using a similar set of twin studies. There was also no significant relationship identified between facial recognition scores and measures of any other cognitive abilities, most notably the lack of a correlation with general object recognition abilities. This suggests that facial recognition abilities are not only heritable, but that their genetic basis is independent from the bases of other cognitive abilities and are specialized for face perception. Research by Cattaneo, Z. et al. (2016) and suggest that the more extreme examples of facial recognition abilities, specifically hereditary prosopagnosics, are also highly genetically correlated. For hereditary prosopagnosics, an autosomal dominant model of inheritance has been proposed by Kennerknecht, I. et al. (2006). Research by Cattaneo, Z. et al. (2016) also correlated the probability of hereditary prosopagnosia with the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms along the Oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), specifically at nucleotides rs2254298 and rs53576 on OXTR intron three, suggesting that these alleles may serve a critical role in normal face perception. Mutation from the wild type allele at these loci has also been found to result in other disorders in which social and facial recognition deficits are common, such as autism spectrum disorder, which may imply that the genetic bases for general facial recognition are complex and polygenic. This relationship between the OXTR gene and facial recognition abilities is also supported by studies of individuals who do not suffer from hereditary prosopagnosia by Melchers, M. et al. (2013) and Westberg, L. et al. (2016) which correlated general facial recognition abilities with different polymorphisms of the OXTR gene, specifically rs7632287 and rs2268498. Further research is needed to confirm the specific mechanisms of these genetic components on face perception; however, current evidence does suggest that facial recognition abilities are highly linked to genetic, rather than environmental, bases.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{two methods}} for predicting the in-plane compression strength of impact damaged sandwich structures. For developing these methods uniaxial in-plane compression tests of impact damaged unsymmetrical sandwich coupons are conducted. The specimens {{were made of}} two CFRP face sheets of different thickness and an embedded honeycomb core. Low velocity impacts from 1 J up to 15 J caused varying amounts of core and face sheet damage and {{a dent in the}} <b>impacted</b> <b>face</b> sheet. While increasing the in-plane compression in the residual strength tests, the dent grew in depth and transverse to the loading direction until final failure of the <b>impacted</b> <b>face</b> sheet occurred. This phenomenological observation is reproduced in computational simulations. The simulations use either an efficient finite element model or a semi-analytical Ritz approach including non-linear displacement-strain relations and progressive damage growth in the core. For the latter stress-based failure criteria and stiffness degradation models are applied. Residual strength criteria are developed depending on the numerical solver. The comparison of simulation and test results demonstrates that the presented methods are able to predict the damage tolerance of unsymmetrical sandwich structures. For damages due a high-energy impact the simulations show that the face sheet damage has {{to be included in the}} model. Including the face sheet damage into the semi-analytical model increases the computational time tremendously. Therefore, the semi-analytical model should be used only for impact damages with negligible face sheet damage. ...|$|R

This study set out to: (a) investigate physical and mental health outcomes of adults caring for children in Umlazi, a high HIV prevalence township in South Africa; (b) assess whether AIDS-orphan carers face worse outcomes compared to other carers; and, (c) identify risk and protective factors for health. Using a cross-sectional survey, data was gathered from a representative community sample from August 2008 to March 2009 resulting in the largest known study conducted on AIDS-orphan carers to date (n= 1599). The majority of carers looked after non-orphaned children (66. 85 %) followed by AIDS-orphan (22. 45 %) and other-orphan children (10. 69 %). Orphan carers had significantly worse general health and functioning, depression, and post-traumatic stress than non-orphan carers but patterns were less clear when orphan carers were disaggregated into AIDS-orphan and other-orphan carers for comparison. This suggests that health interventions might target orphan carers, rather than singling out AIDS-orphan carers. Differences in age, gender, education, economic assets, and source of household income fully accounted for the association between being an orphan carer and poor health. Social policy grants reduced negative health disparities between orphan carers and non-orphan carers. Social support, education, economic assets, food, access to water, and housing were iii also identified as risk and protective co-factors that might reduce orphan carer disparities in health.
