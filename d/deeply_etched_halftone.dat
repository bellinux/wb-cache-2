40|$|A tunable Mach-Zehnder {{wavelength}} duplexer {{has been}} realized based on P-i-n-N InGaAsP/InP. It {{has been made}} polarization insensitive by proper wafer layer stack and proper waveguide geometry. The layer stack for the duplexer was tested first with a waveguide phase shifter, which resulted in up to 36 °/(V•mm) phase shifting efficiency for TE polarization, which is slightly more efficient than the most efficient phase shifter reported to date in bulk InP at 1. 55 µm, and with much lower transmission loss[1]. The transmission loss {{was measured to be}} 4 dB/cm (5 dB/cm) for TE (TM) polarized light, for 2 µm wide shallowly etched waveguides, which is rather low compared to other reported high efficiency phase shifters for this material system. With this layerstack, we designed a Mach-Zehnder (MZ) duplexer with narrow, 1. 5 µm wide, <b>deeply</b> <b>etched</b> phase shifters that meet the polarization insensitivity requirement. The measurement results showed that the phase shifting efficiency of this narrow and <b>deeply</b> <b>etched</b> duplexer is up to 34 °/(V•mm) for both TE and TM polarization, and the transmission loss of this 1. 5 µm wide waveguide is about 10 dB/cm for both TE and TM polarization.

40|$|In this work, we {{show that}} high aspect-ratio silicon microstructures can play, at the same time, the roles of a cell-selective {{three-dimensional}} microincubator for cell culture and optical label-free transducer of cell morphology mapping. Silicon microincubators, integrating a periodic array of narrow (5 -μm-wide), <b>deeply</b> <b>etched</b> (50 -μm-deep) gaps separated by 3 -μm-thick silicon walls, are fabricated by electrochemical micromachining (ECM) technology [1], and used for culturing several both epithelial and mesenchymal cell lines. Fluorescence microscopy analyses highlight that the microincubator shows cell-selective capabilities, being mostly cells with mesenchymal phenotype able to actively colonize the <b>deeply</b> <b>etched</b> gaps and grow attached to the vertical silicon walls [2]. The microincubator also features reflectivity spectral properties typical of one-dimensional (1 D) photonic crystals (PhCs) structures in the near infrared range, with high reflectivity regions separated by deep reflectivity notches. According to 1 DPhC optical properties, the presence of cells inside the gaps of the microincubator strongly affects the reflectivity signal, which can be measured in-situ with a fiber-optic setup orthogonally to the silicon wall surface (x-y plane). By spatially mapping the reflected power spectrum in the vertical x-y plane, it is thus possible to infer on the extension of cells growing into the microincubator attached to silicon walls. In particular, the intensity ratio between reflectivity maximum and minimum at two different wavelengths around 1. 55 μm {{is closely related to}} the cell spreading on the silicon wall inside the <b>deeply</b> <b>etched</b> gaps of the microincubator. These results clearly envisage future in-situ label-free analyses of cellular activities involving changes in cell morphology and/or adhesion (e. g. apoptosis), in a three-dimensional environment.
