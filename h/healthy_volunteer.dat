40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the quality and}} characteristics of notifications on clinical drug trials to be conducted in children and adult <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> in Finland. Methods: All clinical drug trials involving children and <b>healthy</b> adult <b>volunteers</b> reviewed by the regulatory agency in Finland during the years 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2000 were analysed. The notifications were classified into the following categories: trials with no objection to commencement, number and type of questions raised, profile, phase and type of study, and trial design. Results: Altogether 352 trial notifications were analysed. Children were involved in 27 % of the trials and <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> in 73 %. Most of the trials in children were phase III (53 %), placebo-controlled studies with/without active controls (34 %) while most trials involving <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> were phase I studies (70 %) with a cross over, placebo-controlled design with/without active controls (42 %). Investigations on new chemical entities (34 % children; 23 % <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers)</b> and products {{that did not have}} marketing authorisation (55 % children; 63 % <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers)</b> were most common. The regulatory agency had no objections or questions about 47 % (children) and 74 % (<b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers)</b> of the notifications. Respectively, 49 % (children) and 24 % (<b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers)</b> of the trials were permitted to begin after further clarification, while 3 % and 2 % were rejected. Most questions concerning the trials involving children dealt with the information provided to the study subjects (80 %), while safety issues (47 %) were most important in the trials involving <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers.</b> Only a few of the trials (8 % children; 5 % <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers)</b> were later cancelled or discontinued...|$|R
40|$|International audienceT-cell {{functions}} are currently used as biomarkers for the pharmacodynamic monitoring of immunosuppressive drugs or as disease biomarkers of inflammation/sepsis and organ rejection. In order to evaluate co-factors potentially influencing {{the expression of}} the immunological biomarkers, we explored T-cell proliferation, T-cell activation (CD 25 and CD 71 expressions) and intra-lymphocyte cytokine production (interleukin (IL) - 2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha) in <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers,</b> dialysis patients and stable kidney-transplant patients treated with standard immunosuppressive therapy, i. e. tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid with or without steroids. Age was positively correlated with TNF-alpha expression in all three patient populations, and with IL- 2 expression in <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> and kidney-transplant patients. Further age was correlated with inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation in <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> and with the T-cell activation marker CD 25 in kidney-transplant patients. In <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> lymphocyte proliferation was higher in woman as compared to men. Other biomarkers of T-cell function were independent of the gender. In the kidney-transplant patient group a significantly lower expression of all biomarkers of T-cell functions compared to <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> and dialysis patients. In dialysis patients we found significant increased IL- 2 expression compared to <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers,</b> while the other T-cell functions were not significantly different. Further time on dialysis had no effect on the level of biomarker expression. In conclusion we found decreased T-cell functions in kidney-transplant patients compared to <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> and dialysis patients, increased IL- 2 expression in dialysis patients compared to <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> and in all three populations we found a correlation of age and intra-T-lymphocyte TNF-alpha expression...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} {{distinctive}} pathological characteristics in the spectrums of spontaneous infrared radiation at the Taiyuan (LU 9) acupoint {{in patients with}} asthma. MethodsA highly sensitive infrared spectrum detecting device was used to detect the spectrums of spontaneous infrared radiation at Taiyuan (LU 9) in 37 asthma patients and 34 <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers.</b> ResultsAsthma patients had significantly lower infrared intensity {{than that of the}} <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> (P> 0. 01). Asthma patients had significantly lower overall infrared radiation intensity at the left Taiyuan (LU 9) than that of <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> (P> 0. 05), but {{there was no significant difference}} between <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> and asthma patients at the right Taiyuan (LU 9) (P> 0. 05). The infrared radiation intensity of 17 wavelength spots at the left Taiyuan (LU 9) and 4 wavelength spots at the right Taiyuan (LU 9) in asthma patients were significantly lower than those of <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> (P> 0. 05). At 2 µm, the infrared radiation intensity of asthma patients was significantly stronger than that of <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> (P> 0. 05). At 19 wavelength spots in the <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> and at 4 wavelength spots in the asthma patients, the left Taiyuan (LU 9) showed a significantly stronger intensity than that of the right Taiyuan (LU 9) (P> 0. 05). By Pearson's X 2 test, <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> had more wavelength spots that were significantly different between the left and right Taiyuan (LU 9) than the asthma patients (P> 0. 01). ConclusionChanges in the infrared spectrum at the Taiyuan (LU 9) acupoint in asthma patients may reflect distinct pathological changes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} effect of hyperammonaemia on the wake {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) of patients with cirrhosis and <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers.</b> METHODS: Wake EEGs were recorded prior to and after the induction of controlled hyperammonaemia in 10 patients with cirrhosis and 10 matched <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers.</b> RESULTS: At baseline, patients had higher ammonaemia than <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> and their dominant EEG rhythm was slower and of higher amplitude.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) raises serum gastrin but it {{is unclear}} whether this stimulates {{increased}} acid secretion. Gastrin mediated acid secretion and plasma gastrin after the intravenous infusion of gastrin releasing peptide was studied in nine H pylori negative and nine H pylori positive <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers,</b> and in 11 duodenal ulcer patients. Nine of the last group were re-examined one month after eradication of H pylori. The median acid output (mmol/h) to gastrin releasing peptide (40 pmol/kg/h) in the H pylori positive <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> was 15. 1 (range 3. 3 - 38. 3), which was three times that of the H pylori negative <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> (median = 5. 5, range 1. 0 - 9. 0) (p six times that of the H pylori negative <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers.</b> Eradication of H pylori in the duodenal ulcer patients lowered their acid secretion by a median of 66 % (range 30 %- 80 %) (p < 0. 01) and to values equivalent to the H pylori positive <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers.</b> The pepsin output in response to gastrin releasing peptide followed the same pattern as the acid output. The median plasma gastrin concentrations during gastrin releasing peptide were similar in the H pylori positive duodenal ulcer patients (150 ng/l, range 95 - 400) and H pylori positive <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> (129 ng/l, range 23 - 420) and both were appreciably higher than H pylori negative <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> (60 ng/l, range 28 - 135) (p < 0. 005 for each). Eradication of H pylori lowered the plasma gastrin in the duodenal ulcer patients to values equivalent to the H pylori negative <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers.</b> These findings show a threefold increase in acid secretion in H pylori positive <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> that is explained by H pylori induced hypergastrinaemia and a sixfold increase in acid secretion in the duodenal ulcer patients that is explained by the combination of H pylori induced hypergastrinaemia and an exaggerated acid response to stimulation by gastrin. Eradicating H pylori lowers gastrin mediated acid secretion by 66 % in duodenal ulcer patients {{as a result of the}} resolution of the hypergastrinaemia. Increased gastrin mediated acid secretion seems to be the key factor in the pathophysiology of duodenal ulceration and explains the role of H pylori infection in the disorder...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} improve our {{understanding}} of social functioning in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by: (1) identifying differences in stress among adults with ASD and healthy volunteers; and (2) examining the relationship between stress and social functioning in adults with ASD. This study hypothesized that adults with ASD would experience greater stress than <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> and {{that there would be}} a significant, negative relationship between stress and social functioning in adults with ASD. Data were collected from 40 adults with ASD and 25 <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> during a single session in the laboratory. Repeated measures of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) were taken during a social stress challenge task, while salivary cortisol was collected before and after the task. Measures also assessed psychosocial stress (perceived stress and stressful life events), global functioning, social disability, daily living skills, and social impairment. Analyses examined group differences between adults with ASD and <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> on biological stress response and psychosocial stress using analysis of variance procedures. The relationship between stress and social functioning was analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression procedures separately for biological stress response and psychosocial stress. This research found that adults with ASD and <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> exhibit remarkably similar patterns of biological stress response, yet the ASD group reported more psychosocial stress than <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers.</b> In addition, findings indicated that psychosocial stress was a pertinent predictor of social disability in adults with ASD, but that biological stress response did not predict social functioning in this group. These results suggest that, while adults with ASD experience greater psychosocial stress than <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers,</b> they do not differ significantly from <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> in their biological stress response. In addition, the lived experience of stress may have a greater influence on social disability than biological stress response in this population, although a lack of biological stress response difference between adults with ASD and <b>healthy</b> <b>volunteers</b> may be explained by burnout. Future research should examine interventions that might improve social functioning by helping adults with ASD perceive and cope with stress differently...|$|R
