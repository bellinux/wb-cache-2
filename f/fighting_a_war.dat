5|$|The Tube Alloys {{programme}} in Britain and Canada was {{the first}} nuclear weapons project. Due to the high costs, {{and the fact that}} Britain was <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> within bombing range of its enemies, Tube Alloys was ultimately subsumed into the Manhattan Project. Despite reaching an agreement with the United States to share nuclear weapons technology, and to refrain from using it against each other, or against other countries without mutual consent, the United States failed to provide complete details {{of the results of the}} Manhattan Project to the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union gained valuable information through its atomic spies, who had infiltrated both the British and American projects.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{consequent}} Roman efforts to subjugate all of Germania, the member tribes of the Suebi alliance became displaced, moved east, conquered the Celtic tribes that stood in their way and settled, the Quadi in Moravia, and the Marcomanni in Bohemia. The latter tribe, under Marbod, formed a quasi-state with a huge army and was able to conquer the Lugii tribal association among others. What archeologists see as the Przeworsk culture, by this period (early 1st century AD) is believed to consist first of all of the Lugii tribes. A Roman defeat in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (9 AD) stabilized the situation at the periphery of the Empire to some degree. The Lugii and other tribes on Polish lands increasingly became involved in trade and other contacts, through the Marcomanni and Quadi intermediaries, with the Danubian provinces of Rome. The Lugii, according to Tacitus, was a very large union of tribes. In 50 AD they invaded and pillaged the Quadi state created by Vannius, contributing to its fall. The motivation for the expedition were the rumours of the enormous riches that Vannius had accumulated by plunder and charging duties. In 93 AD the Lugii, <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> with the Suebi, asked Emperor Domitian for help, and received one hundred mounted soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Since 1640, Portugal {{had been}} <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> against Spain to restore its {{independence}} after a dynastic union of sixty {{years between the}} crowns of Spain and Portugal. Portugal had been helped by France, but in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 Portugal was abandoned by its French ally. Negotiations with Portugal for Charles's marriage to Catherine of Braganza began during his father's reign and upon the restoration, Queen Luísa of Portugal, acting as regent, reopened negotiations with England that resulted in an alliance. On 23 June 1661, a marriage treaty was signed; England acquired Catherine's dowry of Tangier (in North Africa) and the Seven islands of Bombay (the latter having {{a major influence on}} the development of the British Empire in India), together with trading privileges in Brazil and the East Indies, religious and commercial freedom in Portugal and two million Portuguese crowns (about £300,000); while Portugal obtained military and naval support against Spain and liberty of worship for Catherine. Catherine journeyed from Portugal to Portsmouth on 13–14 May 1662, but was not visited by Charles there until 20 May. The next day the couple were married at Portsmouth in two ceremonies—a Catholic one conducted in secret, followed by a public Anglican service.|$|E

5|$|One {{reason for}} the change of {{strategy}} towards Scotland was {{a growing concern for}} the relationship between England and France. As long as Scotland and France were in an alliance, the English were {{faced with the prospect of}} <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> on two fronts. The French carried out raids on English coastal towns, leading to rumours in England of a full-scale French invasion. In 1337, Philip VI confiscated the English king's Duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu. Instead of seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict by paying homage to the French king, as his father had done, Edward responded by laying claim to the French crown as the grandson of Philip IV. The French rejected this based on the precedents for agnatic succession set in 1316 and 1322. Instead, they upheld the rights of PhilipIV's nephew, King Philip VI (an agnatic descendant of the House of France), thereby setting the stage for the Hundred Years' War (see family tree below). In the early stages of the war, Edward's strategy was to build alliances with other Continental princes. In 1338, LouisIV named Edward vicar-general of the Holy Roman Empire and promised his support. As late as 1373, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 established an Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. These measures produced few results; the only major military victory in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at Sluys on 24 June 1340, which secured English control of the Channel.|$|E

25|$|The future scholar {{also had}} a younger sister, Elena (Eliana). According to Gane, she and Udriște were the most educated of Radu's children, being taught {{to read and write}} in Church Slavonic and Koine Greek, and being {{introduced}} to art and history. Their father also displayed an interest in Renaissance literature; he had confiscated or bought a copy of Thomas à Kempis' The Imitation of Christ, in the Latin, while <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> in Moldavia. Helped by a private tutor, Udriște used that same book to learn Latin, which he could speak to perfection. In addition to Latin, Slavonic and Greek, Udriște was fluent in Russian. Some authors have suggested that Năsturel also attended school in Kiev Voivodeship, but this is not attested by any contemporary source.|$|E
25|$|Westmoreland was {{convinced}} that the Vietnamese communists could be destroyed by <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of attrition that, theoretically, would render the Vietnam People's Army unable to fight. His war strategy was marked by heavy use of artillery and airpower and repeated attempts to engage the communists in large-unit battles, and thereby exploit the US's vastly superior firepower and technology. However, the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF) were able to dictate the pace of attrition to fit their own goals: by continuing to fight a guerrilla war and avoiding large-unit battles, they denied the Americans the chance to fight the kind of war they were best at, and they ensured that attrition would wear down the American public's support for the war faster than they.|$|E

25|$|In its {{battle to}} {{maintain}} Catholic {{control of the}} Low Countries, Spain was severely hampered because it was also <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> against the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean. Even so, by 1570 the Spanish had mostly suppressed the rebellion throughout the Netherlands. However, on April 1, 1572, Dutch Calvinist raiders, known as Sea Beggars, forced from sanctuary in England, unexpectedly captured the almost undefended northern Netherlands town of Brielle. Most of the important cities in the provinces of Holland and Zeeland immediately declared loyalty to the rebels. Notable exceptions were Amsterdam and Middelburg, which remained loyal to the Catholic cause until capture in 1578. William of Orange was put {{at the head of}} the revolt, entering the Netherlands with an army 20,000 strong, and with forces of French Huguenots in support.|$|E
25|$|According to Russian historiography {{the first}} ruler to start uniting East Slavic lands into {{what has become}} known as Kievan Rus' was Prince Oleg (882–912). He {{extended}} his control from Novgorod south along the Dnieper river valley to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east, and he moved his capital to the more strategic Kiev. Sviatoslav I (died 972) achieved the first major expansion of Kievan Rus' territorial control, <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of conquest against the Khazars. Vladimir the Great (980–1015) introduced Christianity with his own baptism and, by decree, extended it to all inhabitants of Kiev and beyond. Kievan Rus' reached its greatest extent under Yaroslav the Wise (1019–1054); his sons assembled and issued its first written legal code, the Rus' Justice, shortly after his death.|$|E
25|$|Trouble {{was also}} {{plentiful}} {{on the southern}} border, where Poland was drawn into the wars of local nobles and the Austrian Habsburgs against the Muslim Tatars and Ottoman Turks. King Sigismund was anxious to help Austria and was promised territorial gains for Poland in return for his assistance. He sent in an army consisting of mercenaries from the wars in Russia to the Principality of Moldavia, but in 1620 the Polish forces were defeated and Sigismund was forced to renounce his claim to the principality. It was a setback but resulted in a negotiated peace and was no stunning victory for the Muslims, who had vowed to destroy the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and in this aim they certainly failed. Almost {{at the same time}} as these troubles, and those with Sweden, Sigismund was <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> with the Grand Duchy of Muscovy.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon's defeat {{was also}} {{somewhat}} mirrored by Hitler's failed invasion of Russia during World War II in 1941. Although, ironically, Hitler had studied Napoleon's battle tactics, he decided, against {{the advice of}} many of his top advisers, to invade Russia and break his pact with Stalin. He knew the invasion would have only one chance and if he failed, he would be <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> on two fronts (the Western Front consisting of the Western Allies and the Eastern Front which would consist of the Soviet Union) which also proved fatal in Napoleon's situation. In 1812, Napoleon had been campaigning in Spain as well as Russia and had failed in both. In 1941, Hitler had to split his army in order to conquer Russia and in doing so, perhaps lost the war solely on that point. After Stalin found out what had happened, he orchestrated the Battle of Moscow which, along with the notoriously cold Russian winter, stopped the German troops and finally pushed them back. Hitler would now be fighting on two fronts.|$|E
25|$|In 1595, the Spanish, {{frustrated}} by the 20-year rebellion of their Dutch subjects, closed their home ports to rebel shipping from the Netherlands, cutting them off from the critical salt supplies necessary for their herring industry. The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were {{more than happy to}} trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren trading on the remote coasts of Hispaniola. In 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish settlements on the northern and western coasts of the island persisted in carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of independence against Spain in Europe and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer to the city of Santo Domingo. This action, known as the Devastaciones de Osorio, proved disastrous; {{more than half of the}} resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped. Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops including the two settlements on the territory of present-day Haiti, La Yaguana, and Bayaja. Many of the inhabitants fought, escaped to the jungle, or fled to the safety of passing Dutch ships This Spanish action was counterproductive as English, Dutch, and French pirates were now free to establish bases on the island's abandoned northern and western coasts, where wild cattle were now plentiful and free.|$|E
25|$|Led by a Varangian dynasty, the Kievan Rus' {{controlled}} the routes connecting Northern Europe to Byzantium {{and to the}} Orient (for example: the Volga trade route). The Kievan state began with the rule (882–912) of Prince Oleg, who extended his control from Novgorod southwards along the Dnieper river valley {{in order to protect}} trade from Khazar incursions from the east and moved his capital to the more strategic Kiev. Sviatoslav I (died 972) achieved the first major expansion of Kievan Rus' territorial control, <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of conquest against the Khazar Empire and inflicting a serious blow on Bulgaria. A Rus' attack (967 or 968), instigated by the Byzantines, led to the collapse of the Bulgarian state and the occupation of the east of the country by the Rus'. An ensuing direct military confrontation between the Rus' and Byzantium (970-971) ended with a Byzantine victory (971). The Rus' withdrew and the Byzantine Empire incorporated eastern Bulgaria. Both before and after their conversion to Christianity (conventionally dated 988 under Vladimir I of Kiev—known as Vladimir the Great), the Rus' also embarked on predatory military campaigns against the Byzantine Empire, some of which resulted in trade treaties. The importance of Russo-Byzantine relations to Constantinople was highlighted by the fact that Vladimir I of Kiev, son of Svyatoslav I, became the only foreigner to marry (989) a Byzantine princess of the Macedonian dynasty (which ruled the Eastern Roman Empire from 867 to 1056), a singular honour sought in vain by many other rulers.|$|E

500|$|On {{his way to}} Australia in October 1973, Lamb stopped off in South Africa and Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe), {{where he}} cut his travels short to enlist in the Rhodesian Army. According to Barker, Lamb {{travelled}} to Africa with this intention all along. Rhodesia's unrecognised and predominantly white government {{was at that time}} <b>fighting</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> against communist-backed black nationalist guerrillas who were attempting to forcibly introduce majority rule. Like most of the foreign volunteers in the Rhodesian forces, Lamb mustered into the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), an all-white heliborne commando battalion engaged largely in counter-insurgency operations. He and the other foreign soldiers received the same pay and conditions of service as the Rhodesians they served alongside. [...] "In many respects the RLI was a mirror of the French Foreign Legion, in that recruiters paid little heed as to a man's past and asked no questions," [...] writes Chris Cocks, a veteran of the unit, [...] "and like the Foreign Legion, once in the ranks, a man's past was irrelevant." [...] So it proved for Lamb; keeping his past a secret, he became a highly regarded and popular member of 3 Commando, RLI, noted for his professionalism and physical fitness. [...] "The Rhodesians thought he was a first-class soldier," [...] Barker later told the Globe and Mail.|$|E
