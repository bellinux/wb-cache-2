40|$|Introduction: Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is a steroidal {{drug that}} has been widely {{administered}} intravitreally for retinal and choroidal conditions. Safety of steroidal products for <b>intraocular</b> <b>use</b> is essential because of their risk of ocular adverse events. This review comprehensively discusses the safety of intravitreal administration of TA.

The safety of intravitreal TA is evaluated through a search of the Medline database from 1980 to 2011. The most relevant literature on the safety of intravitreal TA is also discussed. Expert opinion: The complications of intravitreal TA therapy include secondary ocular hypertension in about 20 40 % of eyes, steroid-induced cataract in about 15 20 % of cases and postinjection infectious endophthalmitis and pseudoendophthalmitis in less than 1 %. TA is an effective drug for various retinal and choroidal diseases when delivered intravitreally. It may imply an off-label use and it may be associated with ocular adverse events.

40|$|Abstract: Age-related macular {{degeneration}} {{is a leading}} cause of severe visual loss and reading disability in the population > 60 years of age. The incidence is high and increasing as the elderly population expands. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, and the disease affects the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), Bruchs membrane and choriocapillaries. There are two different types, or stages, of AMD: dry (atrophic) and wet (neovascular) form of AMD. About 80 % of the patients affected by AMD have the dry form, for which there is currently no effective treatment. The development of choroidal neovascularizations (CNV) inducing macular oedema is specific to wet AMD, and is the current target for treatment. Wet AMD is currently treated with intravitreal anti-angiogenic injections, first of all anti-VEGF. Despite the fact that Avastin (bevacizumab) is unlicensed for <b>intraocular</b> <b>use,</b> it has a good marketshare worldwide used off-label, because of the huge difference in price compared to Lucentis (ranibizumab) which has approval for the treatment of wet AMD.

40|$|Although {{diabetic}} retinopathy (DR) remains a {{leading cause of}} vision loss, the last decade has brought significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of this common complication of diabetes mellitus. First, optical coherence tomography allows for noninvasive imaging of the retina, in particular, the macula, with very high resolution, thus facilitating the management of diabetic macular edema. In addition, recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of DR, in particular, the key role of cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), have {{led to the development of}} anti-VEGF antibodies for <b>intraocular</b> <b>use.</b> Anti-VEGF therapies have largely replaced laser photocoagulation for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. The benefit of intravitreal anti-VEGF in diabetic macular edema has been proven in numerous large randomized controlled trials. Moreover, a role of inflammation in DR has been recognized, and several mainly steroid-based, anti-inflammatory agents for intravitreal treatment have been shown to be effective. Despite these recent advances, strict systemic control of glycemia remains the cornerstone of the management of DR, significantly reducing ocular complications. This chapter will provide an overview of current and novel concepts of DR and will allude to promising novel therapeutic options for this sight-threatening disease...|$|E

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) was first {{described}} as a molecule that could increase the permeability of blood vessels. Additionally, VEGF promotes the prolifera-tion of new blood vessels, and is essential for normal embry-onic development and wound healing. There is an obvious correlation between intensity of VEGF and tumor prognosis [1]. VEGF encompasses a family of proteins that include placenta growth factor (PIGF), VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF-E. The VEGF receptor (VEGFR) family in mammals contains three members, namely VEGFR 1, VEGFR 2, and VEGFR 3. These factors directly participate in the genesis of blood capillaries and lymphatic vessels [2 - 7]. Three anti-VEGF agents—pegaptanib, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab [8]—have been used {{for the treatment of}} patients with neovascularization pathology.

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) is a chronic disease affecting the retina {{and is the}} most common cause of blindness in the ageing population in the developed world. Correct and timely diagnosis and classification allows physicians to estimate which patients are at high risk of progressing to more advanced stages of the disease In February 2012, 23 Latin American experts met in Cartagena, Colombia, to develop a Consensus on AMD. This paper summarizes the main points of the discussions including definitions, diagnosis, antiangiogenic treatments, and hopes for the future. Dry AMD remains untreatable but results from promising Phase II trials are awaited eagerly. Antiangiogenics, such as the licensed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, aflibercept and ranibizumab, have revolutionized the treatment of wet AMD in recent years. These drugs work by inhibiting the choroidal neovascularization that causes the rapid vision loss in wet AMD. Another antiangiogenic, bevacizumab, is also commonly used off-label, but is not approved currently for <b>intraocular</b> <b>use.</b> However, barriers to treatment compliance, due to the frequency of monthly injections, can also affect the efficacy of these antiangiogenic therapies. Aflibercept has a longer duration of action compared with other treatments and thereby offers reduced injection frequency.

Methods: Measurements were performed on 96 first-degree relatives recruited from Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal. Corneal hysteresis was determined using the Reichert Ocular Response Analyser. Central corneal thickness was measured with an ultrasound pachymeter. Three measures of intraocular pressure were obtained: Goldmann-correlated and corneal compensated <b>intraocular</b> pressure <b>using</b> the Ocular Response Analyser, and Pascal <b>intraocular</b> pressure <b>using</b> the Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer.

40|$|Lola Elizabeth Lawuyi, Avinash Gurbaxani Moorfields Eye Hospital Dubai, Dubai, UAE Abstract: The {{maintenance}} of mydriasis throughout cataract extraction surgery {{and the control}} of ocular inflammation are crucial for successful surgical outcomes. The development of miosis during cataract surgery compromises the visualization of the surgical field and working space for surgeons. This may lead to complications that include posterior capsular tear and associated vitreous loss, longer surgical time, and postoperative inflammation. Postoperative inflammation is often uncomfortable and frustrating for patients. It causes pain, redness, and photophobia. This compromises the best-uncorrected vision following surgery and often leads to multiple clinic visits. This article examines the literature published on the current treatments used to manage mydriasis, pain, and inflammation in cataract extraction surgery. Combination phenylephrine/ketorolac injection offers an exciting new class of medication for use in cataract surgery. With the recent approval of Omidria™ (combination of phenylephrine 1 % and ketorolac 0. 3 %) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for <b>intraocular</b> <b>use,</b> we review the clinical utility of this new combination injection in cataract surgery.

To evaluate the ocular toxicity of MNPs, we asked if either 50 nm or 4 µm magnetic particles affect intraocular pressure, corneal endothelial cell count, retinal morphology including both cell counts and glial activation, or photoreceptor function at different time points after injection. Sprague-Dawley rats (n =  44) were injected in the left eye with either 50 nm (3 µl, 1. 65 mg) or 4 µm (3 µl, 1. 69 mg) magnetic particles, and an equal volume of PBS into the right eye. Electroretinograms (ERG) were used to determine if MNPs induce functional changes to the photoreceptor layers. Enucleated eyes were sectioned for histology and immunofluorescence. Compared to control-injected eyes, MNPs did not alter IOP measurements. ERG amplitudes for a-waves were in the 100 - 250 µV range and b-waves were in the 500 - 600 µV range, with no significant differences between injected and non-injected eyes. Histological sectioning and immunofluorescence staining showed little difference in MNP-injected animals compared to control eyes. In contrast, at 1 week, corneal endothelial cell numbers were significantly lower in the 4 µm magnetic particle-injected eyes compared to either 50 nm MNP- or PBS-injected eyes. Furthermore, iron deposition was detected after 4 µm magnetic particle but not 50 nm MNP injection. Intravitreal or anterior chamber injections of MNPs showed little to no signs of toxicity on retinal structure, photoreceptor function or aqueous drainage in the eye.

40|$|The {{adverse effects}} of drugs in the eye are not easily detected, and the {{underlying}} pathogenesis not fully understood. The effects of four different kinds of drugs have been investigated in the rabbit eye, using electroretinography, ocular examination and histochemical methods. Rifabutin is a broad spectrum antibiotic with known ocular adverse effects (corneal opacities, uveitis and vascular retinopathy) in the human eye. In the rabbit eye rifabutin causes lens discoloration and it significantly reduces both total rod-cone function and isolated cone function, {{but it does not}} affect retinal morphology. Ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and pegaptanib are inhibitors of the cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor. Pegaptanib and ranibizumab are approved for injection into the vitreous. Bevacizumab is a cancer drug injected off-label intravitreally. In rabbit rod-mediated function was found depressed 8 weeks after a single injection of all three VEGF inhibitors. Rod bipolar cells were affected in the groups injected with pegaptanib and ranibizumab, but not with bevacizumab. Triamcinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid with depot properties, used for intramuscular and intraarticular injections. In Europe, triamcinolone is commercially available only in combination with the preservative benzyl alcohol, and is not approved for <b>intraocular</b> <b>use.</b> Triamcinolone has been and is extensively used off-label for injections into the vitreous body. Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone and benzyl alcohol, separately and in combination, affected both retinal function and histology. Adalimumab, a monoclonal antibody against the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α is approved for subcutaneous injection in autoimmune diseases. The level of TNFα is raised in ocular inflammatory conditions. No functional disturbances were found on examination with ffERG after injection into the vitreous body of rabbits. Retinal histology was found to be intact. These studies have shown that drugs may affect both retinal function and histology in the rabbit eye, and that retinal electrophysiology combined with histochemistry can detect the retinal level and the cell type involved in these processes, or exclude retinal damage by the drug. This knowledge should alert ophthalmologists to perform extensive investigations in patients on medication who present with unaccountable visual symptoms...|$|E
