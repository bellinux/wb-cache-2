40|$|In the <b>germinated</b> <b>cereal</b> {{aleurone}} layer, gibberellic acids (GA) induce {{expression of}} a number of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes that participate in the mobilization of stored molecules. Previous analyses suggest that the key events controlling the GA-regulated gene expression in the aleurone are formation of active transcription machinery referred to as the GA responsive complex, followed by recruiting GAMYB. In general, bipartite promoter contexts composed of the GA-responsive element and the pyrimidine box are observed within the regulatory regions of cereal GA-responsive genes. Protein factors that recognize each promoter sequence were identified and distinct effects on the GA-mediated activation of gene expression have been also investigated; however, the connection and intercalation between two promoter motifs remain obscure. In this study, I have evaluated cooperative function of GAMYB and a pyrimidine box-binding protein OsDOF 3 that influenced the promoter activity of the most predominant GA-responsive gene (RAmy 1 A) of rice (Oryza sativa). Transient expression of OsDOF 3 in the germinated aleurone prolonged GAMYB function on the reporter expression in the absence of GA. The synergistic effect required a set of DNA bindings of two proteins on the RAmy 1 A promoter region. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed the physical interaction of GAMYB and OsDOF 3 in yeast cells, indicating that the association of GAMYB and OsDOF 3 may be a functional unit in transcription regulation. The results showed the accessory function of OsDOF 3 responsible for a dosage-dependent mediation of GA signaling that leads to high-level expression of physiological target genes...|$|E

The differences between the quantities consumed were statistically significant (p R. rattus were categorized into three subsets.

It is concluded that by considering the cost of all the four grains (in a subset one) {{any one of the}} cheapest among them in the germinated form could be recommended or used as a bait base for any of the two rodenticides for the management of R. rattus.

A powder formulation of bromadiolone (0. 005 %) treated bait yielded 100 % mortality of rats in no-choice tests, but only 60 % mortality in two-choice tests.

40|$|The bifunctional {{alpha-amylase}} subtilisin inhibitor (BASI) from barley is a bifunctional protein with {{roles in}} inhibition of proteases and of endogenous alpha-amylase.

The specific inhibition of barley alpha-amylases by this protein has been previously explained as a role associated with the control of starch mobilisation in <b>germinating</b> <b>cereals.</b> It has long been assumed that this protein was expressed in aleurone and endosperm of barley. We recently isolated the promoter of the asi gene and demonstrated pericarp specific expression of GFP with this promoter. Expression of this gene specifically in the pericarp of developing barley suggests that the protein is primarily associated with defence of the seed against pathogens.

40|$|Starch may be {{determined}} by hydrolysis with α-amylase and amyloglucosidase followed by specific measurement of glucose using glucose oxidase. However biological samples to be analysed for starch often also contain glucose, maltose and higher oligosaccharides derived from the hydrolysis of starch. These sugars {{may be difficult to}} remove quantitatively by solvent extraction. We have found that reduction with sodium borohydride followed by evaporation with 2, 2 dimethoxypropane removed interference from glucose, maltose and the two reducing terminal residues from higher oligosaccharides. The specific glucose test was not sensitive to glucitol produced by reduction of free glucose. Maltitol was not hydrolysed significantly by the amyloglucosidase, removing interference from maltose and the two reducing terminal residues from higher polymers. The method has potential for monitoring the hydrolysis of starch especially in the mobilisation of starch reserves in plant tissues such as in the endosperm of <b>germinating</b> <b>cereal</b> grains.

40|$|The {{production}} of hydrolytic enzymes in the <b>germinating</b> <b>cereal</b> grain is {{considered as a}} model for plant cell differentiation. Recent literature is reviewed which suggests that gibberellins are involved in this process, but in a less straightforward manner than considered previously. It seems likely that only a subfraction of gibberellin is active and that {{production of}} this gibberellin is actually in the hydrolase-producing cells. These include aleurone cells and also the scutellar epithelial cells. At the intracellular level the action of gibberellin results in the accumulation of alpha-amylase mRNA and also mRNA for other unidentified proteins, referred to as gibb-ons. The alpha-amylase mRNAs are transcribed from two distinct gene families. The pattern of expression of alpha-amylase and gibb-on mRNAs is consistent with a common gibberellin-stimulated mechanism of control of for all of these genes. However it seems likely from experiments with ABA and from observations on gibb-on gene expression in non-aleurone cells that gibberellin does not have a role determining the specificity of gene expression, but rather acts as a general stimulator of mRNA accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{the only}} {{treatment}} for coeliac {{disease is a}} lifelong gluten-free diet excluding food products containing wheat, rye and barley. There is, however, only scarce evidence as to harmful effects of rye in coeliac disease. To confirm the assumption that rye should be excluded from the coeliac patient's diet, we now sought to establish whether rye secalin activates toxic reactions in vitro in intestinal epithelial cell models as extensively as wheat gliadin. Further, we investigated the efficacy of <b>germinating</b> <b>cereal</b> enzymes from oat, wheat and barley to hydrolyse secalin into short fragments and whether secalin-induced harmful effects can be reduced by such pretreatment. In the current study, secalin elicited toxic reactions in intestinal Caco- 2 epithelial cells similarly to gliadin: it induced epithelial cell layer permeability, tight junctional protein occludin and ZO- 1 distortion and actin reorganization. In high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS), germinating barley enzymes provided the most efficient degradation of secalin and gliadin peptides and was thus selected for further in vitro analysis. After germinating barley enzyme pretreatment, all toxic reactions induced by secalin were ameliorated. We conclude that germinating enzymes from barley are particularly efficient in the degradation of rye secalin. In future, these enzymes might be utilized as a novel medical treatment for coeliac disease or in food processing {{in order to develop}} high-quality coeliac-safe food products...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effects of soaking time (6, 12 and 24 hr) and steeping temperature (25, 30 and 35 oC) on germination time, germination percentage and weight loss of wheat and barley. Changes in chemical composition (such as protein, fat, and ash), reducing sugar content, enzyme activity and pasting profile and GABA (γ-animobutyric acid) content of germinated wheat and barley were also evaluated. The results clearly suggest that the short soaking time and lower steeping temperature significantly decreased germination time and weight loss, while germination percentage increased. Regarding the chemical composition, the protein content of wheat and barley was slightly increased after germination but {{there was no significant difference}} in content of crude fat and ash of both <b>germinated</b> <b>cereals.</b> The reducing sugar content of both germi-nated cereals decreased as the steeping temperature increased from 25 oC to 35 oC. Increasing soaking time and steeping temperature led to increased amylase activity, and also corresponded to reduced paste viscosity. The highest GABA content that occurred with soaking times of 6 and 12 hr and a steeping temperature of 35 oC was 1, 467. 74 and 1, 474. 70 µg/g for germinated wheat and 2, 108. 13 and 1, 691. 85 µg/g for germinated barley.

40|$|Abstract Background Soluble {{sugar levels}} must be closely {{regulated}} in germinating seeds to ensure an adequate {{supply of energy}} and building materials for the developing seedling. Studies on <b>germinating</b> <b>cereal</b> seeds indicate that production of sugars from starch is inhibited by increasing sugar levels. Although numerous {{studies have focused on}} the regulation of starch metabolism, very few studies have addressed the control of storage lipid metabolism by germinating oilseeds. Results Mobilization of storage lipid by germinating seeds of the model oilseed plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. occurs at a greatly reduced rate in the presence of exogenous glucose or mannose, but not in the presence of equi-molar 3 - O -methylglucose or sorbitol. The sugar-insensitive 5 - 1 /abscisic acid-insensitive 4 - 101 (sis 5 - 1 /abi 4 - 101) mutant is resistant to glucose inhibition of seed storage lipid mobilization. Wild-type seedlings become insensitive to glucose inhibition of storage lipid breakdown within 3 days of the start of imbibition. Conclusions Growth in the presence of exogenous glucose significantly retards mobilization of seed storage lipid in germinating seeds from wild-type Arabidopsis. This effect is not solely due to the osmotic potential of the media, as substantially higher concentrations of sorbitol than of glucose are required to exert significant effects on lipid breakdown. The inhibitory effect of glucose on lipid breakdown is limited to a narrow developmental window, suggesting that completion of some critical metabolic transition results in loss of sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of glucose on lipid breakdown. </p...|$|R
40|$|The most {{significant}} damage inflicted by birds in Australia is to <b>germinating</b> <b>cereal</b> and to ripening sunflower and fruit crops. The main pests are several native psittacine and corvid species, silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). The economic cost of damage is largely unquantified. While losses to industries {{as a whole}} are often low, losses to individual growers may be severe, and losses are distributed patchily in space and time. Shooting is the most widely practiced and most ineffective bird control technique used in Australia. Despite the high numbers of birds killed, damage persists, and disturbance caused by shooting and scare devices may actually increase damage. Trapping and export of native birds is frequently suggested as a solution but would be ineffective for damage control. Illegal poisoning {{is thought to have}} caused significant reductions in some parrot populations, but has not prevented crop damage. Decoy feeding shows promise for damage control in winter cereals. One site attracted 4, 000 cockatoos for most of the seeding and germination phase. For sunflower, the main problem is rendering the main crop less attractive than the decoy. Netting is cost-effective even at moderate to low levels of bird damage for intensive growing systems with new varieties of high-yielding stonefruit. Research is needed on techniques to assess the cost of damage. The cost-effectiveness of damage control techniques can then be assessed.

40|$|The initial {{hydrolysis}} {{of native}} (unboiled) starch granules in <b>germinating</b> <b>cereal</b> kernels {{is considered to}} be due to α-amylases. We report that barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seed α-glucosidases (EC 3. 2. 1. 20) can hydrolyze native starch granules isolated from barley kernels and can do so at rates comparable to those of the predominant α-amylase isozymes. Two α-glucosidase charge isoforms were used individually and in combination with purified barley α-amylases to study in vitro starch digestion. Dramatic synergism, as much as 10. 7 -fold, of native starch granule hydrolysis, as determined by reducing sugar production, occurred when high pl α-glucosidase was combined with either high or low pl α-amylase. Synergism was also found when low pl α-glucosidase was combined with α-amylases. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that starch granule degradation by α-amylases alone occurred specifically at the equatorial grooves of lenticular granules. Granules hydrolyzed by combinations of α-glucosidases and α-amylases exhibited larger and more numerous holes on granule surfaces than did those granules attacked by α-amylase alone. As the presence of α-glucosidases resulted in more areas being susceptible to hydrolysis, we propose that this synergism is due, in part, to the ability of the α-glucosidases to hydrolyze glucosidic bonds other than α- 1, 4 - and α- 1, 6 - that are present at the granule surface, thereby eliminating bonds which were barriers to hydrolysis by α-amylases. Since both α-glucosidase and α-amylase are synthesized in aleurone cells during germination and secreted to the endosperm, the synergism documented here may function in vivo as well as in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Published online 16 May 2017 Isolated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{aleurone}} layers {{have been}} widely used as a model system for studying gene expression and hormonal regulation in <b>germinating</b> <b>cereal</b> grains. A serious technological limitation of this approach has been the inability to confidently extrapolate conclusions obtained from isolated tissues back to the whole grain, where the co-location of several living and non-living tissues results in complex tissue-tissue interactions and regulatory pathways coordinated across the multiple tissues. Here we have developed methods for isolating fragments of aleurone, starchy endosperm, embryo, scutellum, pericarp-testa, husk and crushed cell layers from germinated grain. An important step in the procedure involves the rapid fixation of the intact grain to freeze the transcriptional activity of individual tissues while dissection is effected for subsequent transcriptomic analyses. The developmental profiles of 19   611 gene transcripts were precisely defined in the purified tissues and in whole grain during the first 24  h of germination by RNA sequencing. Spatial and temporal patterns of transcription were validated against well-defined data on enzyme activities in both whole grain and isolated tissues. Transcript profiles of genes involved in mitochondrial assembly and function were used to validate the very early stages of germination, while the profiles of genes involved in starch and cell wall mobilisation matched existing data on activities of corresponding enzymes.

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of cereal seeds {{can be divided into}} two phases, {{development}} and germination, separated by a quiescent period. Seed development and germination require the growth and differentiation of new tissues, but also the ordered disappearance of cells, which takes place by a process of programmed cell death (PCD). For this reason, cereal seeds have become excellent model systems for the study of developmental PCD in plants. At early stages of seed development, maternal tissues such as the nucellus, the pericarp and the nucellar projections undergo a progressive degeneration by PCD, which allows the remobilization of their cellular contents for nourishing new filial tissues such as the embryo and the endosperm. At a later stage, during seed maturation, the endosperm undergoes PCD, but these cells remain intact in the mature grain and their contents will not be remobilized until germination. Thus, the only tissues that remain alive when seed development is completed are the embryo axis, the scutellum and the aleurone layer. In germinating seeds, both the scutellum and the aleurone layer play essential roles in producing the hydrolytic enzymes for the mobilization of the storage compounds of the starchy endosperm, which serve to support early seedling growth. Once this function is completed, scutellum and aleurone cells undergo PCD; their contents being used to support the growth of the germinated embryo. PCD occurs with tightly controlled spatial-temporal patterns allowing coordinated fluxes of nutrients between the different seed tissues. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the tissues undergoing PCD in developing and <b>germinating</b> <b>cereal</b> seeds, focussing on the biochemical features of the process. The effect of hormones and redox regulation on PCD control will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{measurement of}} α-amylase activity in crude plant extracts {{is difficult because}} of the presence of β-amylases which directly interfere with most assay methods. Methods compared in this study include heat treatment at 70 °C for 20 min, HgCl 2 treatment, and the use of the α-amylase specific substrate starch azure. In comparing alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), soybeans (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.), and malted barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), the starch azure assay was the only satisfactory method for all tissues. While β-amylase can liberate no color alone, over 10 International units per milliliter β-amylase activity has a stimulatory effect on the rate of color release. This stimulation becomes constant (about 4 -fold) at β-amylase activities over 1, 000 International units per milliliter. Two starch azure procedures were developed to eliminate β-amylase interference: (a) the dilution procedure, the serial dilution of samples until β-amylase levels are below levels that interfere; (b) the β-amylase saturation procedure, addition of exogenous β-amylase to increase endogenous β-amylase activity to saturating levels. Both procedures yield linear calibrations up to 0. 3 International units per milliliter. These two procedures produced statistically identical results with most tissues, but not for all tissues. Differences between the two methods with some plant tissues was attributed to inaccuracy with the dilution procedure in tissues high in β-amylase activity or inhibitory effects of the commercial β-amylase. The β-amylase saturation procedure was found to be preferable with most species. The heat treatment was satisfactory only for malted barley, as α-amylases in alfalfa and soybeans are heat labile. Whereas HgCl 2 proved to be a potent inhibitor of β-amylase activity at concentrations of 10 to 100 micromolar, these concentrations also partially inhibited α-amylase in barley malt.
