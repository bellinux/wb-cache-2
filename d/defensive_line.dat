Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a <b>defensive</b> <b>line</b> along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E
