Jonathan Harris, who played Dr. Smith in the series, declined an offer to cameo as a Global Sedition representative who deals with Dr. Smith in the film, declaring [...] "I've never played a bit part in my life and I'm not going to start now!". Billy Mumy was likewise offered a cameo, but turned it down after being told he would not be considered for the part he wanted—the role of the older Will Robinson—because he was told that would [...] "confuse the audience." ...|$|E

Various technologies are used, ranging from <b>holograms,</b> hidden <b>marks,</b> special inks to cryptography-based component authentication. Typical cryptography-based mechanisms employ a challenge-response-based component authentication mechanism. These mechanisms have been designed originally for a local verification, i. e., for an authentication performed in direct vicinity of the product to be verified.

5000|$|Mr. Motion {{brings the}} Zeppelin above a theme park, [...] "Panoramaland 2000" [...] (not unlike Las Vegas in 2008) that {{features}} full-size holograms of world-famous buildings and monuments, and {{he begins to}} show <b>Mark's</b> <b>holograms</b> to the public. <b>Mark's</b> <b>holograms</b> combine with the theme park holograms, and the squid-like creatures of Planet X appear to cavort around the theme park. Mark escapes from the Zeppelin and is interviewed by the media, only to be interrupted by an emergency bulletin that announces that a black hole is approaching the Earth. The emergency announcer, however, portrays the upcoming catastrophe as just another interesting news event, albeit one that may finally provide an answer to [...] "the question of infinity". Mark suddenly finds himself back in his rocketship, approaching Earth again; the black hole has put him into a time loop. It appears he will forever have to re-experience the day's events.|$|R
40|$|ASEAN Eonomic Community aims at {{creating}} a single, production-based market which is stable, prosperous, highly competitive, and economically integrated by an effective facilitation {{of the traffic}} flows {{of goods and services}} as stated on both ASEAN Charter and ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint. Moreover, in a framework of liberalization, particularly in intellectual property right, the ASEAN member states have agreed ASEAN Intellectual Property Right Action Plan (ASEAN IPR Action Plan) of years 2011 - 2015. The three instruments come to be legal bases of protecting and regulating intellectual property rights in ASEAN, one of which is trademark. The attention paid to trademarks is one of ASEAN’s measures of protecting the trademarks existing in ASEAN member states. Disputes in intellectual property rights, particularly trademarks-related, have a significant inclination to happen among ASEAN member states. Therefore, it needs a legal instrument for resolving them. Indonesia has participated in the three ASEAN agreements. As a consequence, Indonesia has amended an old law to enact Law No. 20 of 2016 on Trademark and Geographic Indications. The new law has stipulated some new provisions on trademark, e. g., by including non-conventional trademarks, that is, three-dimensional, audio, and <b>hologram</b> <b>marks</b> to the new law, as well as containing special provisions on geographic indication. These were intended to be in conformity with the provisions of relevant international communities, particularly ASEAN. For Indonesia, this is certainly a challenge as well as an opportunity to implement the new Trademark Law and in the same time to use the Agreement properly and to harmonize the new trademark provisions with ones in ASEAN...|$|R
40|$|A {{watermarking}} technique, with a Computer Generated Hologram (CGH) {{coding system}} of the mark, is introduced and tested. The CGH watermarking {{can be used to}} authenticate parts of the original image. The <b>hologram</b> of the <b>mark</b> is embedded in the spatial domain by a blind additive embedding technique. The use of holography allows authenticating cuts of the original image, is the major novelty of this paper. The proposed methodology is characterized as an authentication technique, since it does not rely on the original image to decide whether the watermarked image has been altered or not {{and at the same time}} it is able to detect and localize any possible malicious change. Asymmetric cryptography is used to hide the hash information in an unambiguous way (non-repudiation property) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Component {{authentication}} allows verifying the originality {{of various}} components {{being part of}} a machine or a system, or being connected to control equipment. Various technologies are available, ranging from <b>holograms,</b> hidden <b>marks,</b> special inks to cryptography-based component authentication. Typical applied cryptography-based mechanisms employ a challenge-response-based component authentication mechanism. These component authentication mechanisms have been designed originally for local genuineness verification, i. e., for an authentication performed in direct vicinity of the component to be verified. However, it may be useful to support also a remote component authentication, e. g., to verify the integrity of the control system including its periphery from a central monitoring station. This paper describes an attack on a challenge-response component authentication protocol when using it in addition for a remote component authentication. A new security measure, that binds a challenge value to a specific remote verifier, is described to prevent this attack. The challenge value for which the response is calculated by the component authentication mechanism can therefore not be selected by the remote verifier. This has the advantage on one hand that a potential remote adversary cannot use the component as oracle to collect challenge response pairs. On the other hand, the response value can be provided to the verifier directly. Keywords-device authentication, counterfeiting, tunneled authentication I...|$|R
5000|$|After {{arranging}} to {{meet with}} Mark for help with homework, Luke arrives at the appointed time and place. Walking into Mark's office Luke clearly sees Mark at his desk; Luke immediately forms the belief [...] "Mark is in the room. He can help me with my logic homework". Luke is justified in his belief; he clearly sees Mark at his desk. In fact, it's not Mark that Luke saw; it was a marvelous hologram, perfect in every respect, giving the appearance of Mark diligently grading papers at his desk. Nevertheless, Mark is in the room; he is crouched under his desk reading Frege. Luke's belief that Mark is {{in the room is}} true (he is in the room, under his desk) and justified (<b>Mark's</b> <b>hologram</b> is giving the appearance of Mark hard at work).|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, the {{trademark}} manual for examination requires under 1202.14 that a hologram used in varying forms does not {{function as a}} mark {{in the absence of}} evidence that consumers would perceive it as a trademark. See In re Upper Deck Co., 59 USPQ2d 1688 (TTAB 2001), where the Board held that a hologram used on trading cards in varying shapes, sizes, and positions did not function as a mark, because the record showed that other companies used holograms on trading cards and other products as anti-counterfeiting devices, and {{there was no evidence that}} the public would perceive applicant's hologram as an indicator of source. The Board noted that [...] "the common use of holograms for non-trademark purposes means that consumers would be less likely to perceive applicant's uses of holograms as trademarks." [...] 59 USPQ2d at 1693. Therefore, in the absence of evidence of consumer recognition as a mark, the examining attorney should refuse registration on the ground that the hologram does not function as a mark, under §§1, 2 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052 and 1127. Generally, if a hologram has two or more views, the examining attorney should also refuse registration under §§1 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051 and 1127, on the ground that the application seeks registration of more than one mark. In re Upper Deck, supra. See TMEP §807.01. Provided the applicant can demonstrate that the use of a hologram or moving image both serves as a mark and is not functional, an application for such a mark may be made to either register. That being said, Examining Attorneys are instructed to refuse an application for registration of a hologram if the applicant does not provide evidence of consumer recognition of the <b>hologram</b> as a <b>mark.</b> the applicant seeking registration of a hologram must submit a drawing of the mark that captures the dimensions thereof. Further, Examiners are instructed to refuse registration of any holograms that show two different images on the grounds that the application is seeking protection for two separate marks. Further, the application must include detailed written description of the mark. During publication the drawing pages for these marks are published and thereafter the drawing page is incorporated into the registration certificate which is made available at the USPTO as well as the USPTO website, see first external link.|$|R
