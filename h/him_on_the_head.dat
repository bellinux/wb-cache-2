5|$|In December 1923, {{while visiting}} the Winchester {{residence}} of W. A. Baker, a fellow {{director of the}} Winchester and Western Railroad, Cornwell was rendered unconscious after a large longcase clock in a hallway toppled over, striking <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and knocking him down. The longcase clock inflicted a severe wound {{to the back of}} Cornwell's head. He received first aid treatment from a physician present at the residence and was taken to his Winchester home where he regained consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The {{first game}} was close at the halfway point, Ottawa leading Dawson three to one. In the second half, the play became violent. Norman Watt of Dawson tripped Ottawa's Art Moore, who retaliated {{with a stick}} {{to the mouth of}} Watt. Watt {{promptly}} knocked Moore out, hitting <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with his stick. The game ended 9–2 for Ottawa. The game left a poor taste in the mouth for the Yukoners, who complained that several goals were offside.|$|E
5|$|Charles did not detain Mary and {{her mother}} who {{continued}} {{to live in the}} royal palace in Buda. Queen Elizabeth and Nicholas Garai decided to get rid of Charles. They persuaded Blaise Forgách, the master of the cupbearers, to join them, promising him the domain of Gimes (now Jelenec in Slovakia) if he murdered the king. Upon Queen Elizabeth's request, Charles visited her and her daughter on 7February 1386. During the meeting, Blaise Forgách attacked the king, seriously injuring <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> The wounded King Charles was carried to Visegrád where he died on 24February.|$|E

60|$|Luigi's {{southern}} blood {{leaped to}} {{the boiling point}} in a moment under the sharp humiliation of this insult delivered {{in the presence of}} four hundred strangers. It was not in the young man's nature to let the matter pass, or to delay the squaring of the account. He took a couple of strides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker. Then he drew back and delivered a kick of such titanic vigor that it lifted Tom clear over the footlights and landed <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> of <b>the</b> front row of the Sons of Liberty.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the St. Cloud Times took <b>him</b> <b>on</b> as <b>the</b> <b>head</b> {{of their}} {{meteorological}} team and Conservation Minnesota partnered {{with him to}} create MNWeatherCenter, a hub for Minnesota weather.|$|R
5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she is not just a sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bennett grew up {{listening}} to Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Judy Garland, and Bing Crosby as well as jazz artists such as Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, and Joe Venuti. His Uncle Dick was a tap dancer in vaudeville, giving him an early window into show business, and his Uncle Frank was the Queens borough library commissioner. By age 10 he was already singing, and performed {{at the opening of the}} Triborough Bridge, standing next to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia who patted <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Drawing was another early passion of his; he became known as the class caricaturist at P.S. 141 and anticipated a career in commercial art. He began singing for money at age 13, performing as a singing waiter in several Italian restaurants around his native Queens.|$|E
5|$|Keith and Vinnie {{debate on}} Piz’s radio show, and Vinnie gathers some support about his lax underage {{drinking}} policy. Wallace notices someone following him, {{and the student}} wants to recruit him for a secret society. Vinnie insults Keith’s handling of his home life, and Veronica hits <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> lightly. She helps Weevil retrace his steps and notices one of her criminology classmates, Jenny (Dianna Agron), involved with one of Weevil’s clients. Veronica deduces that Jenny and her circle of friends are responsible for creating the fake student IDs, disseminating them, and implicating Weevil. Logan and Dick (Ryan Hansen) go surfing, and they run into Veronica, Piz, and Mac helping Wallace (Percy Daggs III) with his final project for a class. Veronica learns that one of Jenny’s group lives in the same town in Georgia where the student ID machines are made.|$|E
60|$|Armand fought like a madman; {{he wanted}} to reach that gate. He shouted, he laughed, and he cried, until one of the {{soldiers}} in a fit of rage struck <b>him</b> heavily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|Here {{the contest}} was renewed with {{increased}} violence; {{and the horse}} being troubled with a fly <b>on</b> his nose, <b>the</b> cabman humanely employed his leisure in lashing <b>him</b> about <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> counter-irritation principle.|$|R
60|$|On his return, Wapoota {{tried to}} enter into {{conversation}} with his host but Zeppa only smiled, patted <b>him</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and shoulder, and paid no further attention to him. The savage was somewhat overawed by such treatment.|$|R
25|$|On 21 August 1906 Joseph Hunter, a Greymouth wharf labourer, {{was badly}} injured working No. 2 hold. A heavy chain sling was thrown down, {{striking}} <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and knocking him senseless. He sustained nasty cuts {{on the head}} and face.|$|E
25|$|The murders continued, {{indicating}} that Babu {{was not the}} killer. On 16 August 1998, three months before Satish was caught and after spending thirty months in prison, 32-year-old Ram Babu was killed in prison. Om Prakash, another prisoner in the mental ward, hit <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with a brick and killed him.|$|E
25|$|After {{this tour}} and the {{subsequent}} fallout, Carr was subjected to Bodyline bowling by other English county teams, and was severely shaken by several balls that nearly hit <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> He denounced the tactic he had helped develop as unfair. Dissension within the Nottinghamshire club over his role in Bodyline led him being sacked as captain in 1934, and he never played first-class cricket again.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, {{he starts}} primary {{school at the}} Catholic Mission of Bosobolo (Mission catholique de Bosobolo) where he reports having {{experienced}} {{a lot of trouble}} with the Italian Director, father Albert, who often gave <b>him</b> knocks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with a large bunch of keys.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, Indian cricketer Raman Lamba {{died when}} a cricket ball hit {{his head in}} a club match in Dhaka.

25|$|On 11 February 1842, {{with the}} {{principal}} officers of the schooner on shore, a number of seamen who had been drinking demanded they {{be allowed to go}} ashore. The Officer of the Watch, Lieutenant Charles Fuller, ordered the marine guard to defend the ship, only to have the sergeant of marines, Seymour Oswald, strike <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with a tomahawk. Fuller drew his Colt revolver, and in the melee that followed, Fuller was shot dead and his body was beaten with muskets and cutlasses. Two midshipmen were also injured, and another lieutenant was locked below deck. The mutineers fled from the ship, but they soon were apprehended by the United States revenue cutter Jackson and placed in the New Orleans jail. Two of the mutinous sailors were returned to the ship, while the rest remained in New Orleans, pending extradition.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of October 14, 1880, Bull, now partnered with gambler Jim Moon, became {{involved}} in an altercation with two city policemen. Moon's wife and another {{woman who had been}} dating Bull also became involved, throwing chinaware at the officers, causing them to retreat. Bull and Moon met the officers, who returned with more policemen, at the front door, pistols drawn, but after seeing that they could not win, both Bull and Moon surrendered. Less than a month later, Moon killed a man named Sam Hall by beating <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with his pistol. He was acquitted on the grounds of self defense in the trial that followed. Seven months later, Moon, a jealous man, attacked a gambler named Clay Wilson, believing Wilson was paying too much attention to his (Moon's) wife. Wilson shot Moon twice, killing him.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{testified that}} he then endured five days of {{derogatory}} comments about himself, his beliefs, his girlfriend and his pastor, and diatribes by Ross {{about the ways in}} which Christianity and conservative Protestantism were wrong. He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was just the same. He said he was watched 24 hours a day. On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving him a chance to say anything in return, often tapping him or hitting <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.|$|E
60|$|Gillinger {{wandered around}} under {{the ball for}} what seemed an age. It dropped as swiftly as a rocket shoots upward. Gillinger went forward in a circle, then sidestepped, and threw up his broad hands. He misjudged the ball, and it hit <b>him</b> fairly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and bounced almost to where Doran stood at second.|$|R

60|$|Unfortunately for the fisherman, {{instead of}} pulling away he raised an oar with the {{intention}} of striking Flaggan when he should rise. It was a fatal mistake. He did indeed strike <b>him,</b> and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> too; but that was the most invulnerable part of the Irishman's body. Ted grasped the oar, caught the gunwale of the boat, and in a moment overturned it and its occupant on his shoulders.|$|R
25|$|In {{the final}} scene, Rosie is {{waiting in the}} flat ready. She has been {{reassured}} {{that she will be}} watched on camera, and help will come if there's any trouble. She is in the company of Tommy Angel, an ex-SAS bodyguard who makes wildly optimistic passes at Rosie, such as suggesting that many people find this sort of danger arousing. Tommy then asks Rosie to hit <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> to show how tough he is. Rosie does so, and Tommy instantly falls unconscious, out of view. Seconds later, Edna calls at the door. Rosie plays the part of Joanna well, and hands over the case of money from a hidden compartment in a table as soon as she sees the drugs. Unfortunately, when Edna inspects the briefcase, it is full of cut newspaper instead of money. Even though Rosie knows nothing about it, Edna tries to punish Rosie by spraying acid in her eyes. After a struggle, Edna catches her and is about to do the deed when Tracy comes in and brutally incapacitates her.|$|E
25|$|Law {{decided that}} the November party conference was {{the perfect time to}} {{announce}} the withdrawal of the Referendum Pledge, and that Lord Lansdowne should do it, because he had been leader in the House of Lords when the pledge was made and because of his relatively low profile during the original tariff reform dispute. When the conference opened the British political world was febrile; on 12 November the opposition had narrowly defeated the government on an amendment to the Home Rule Bill, and the next evening, amidst hysterical shouting from the opposition, Asquith attempted to introduce a motion reversing the previous vote. As the MPs filed {{out at the end of}} the day Winston Churchill began taunting the opposition, and in his anger Ronald McNeil hurled a copy of Standing Orders of the House at Churchill, hitting <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Law refused to condemn the events, and it seems apparent that while he had played no part in organising them they had been planned by the party Whips. As party leader, he was most likely aware of the plans even if he did not actively participate.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, {{passing through}} the Hall of Abraham, Goldstein entered the Hall of Isaac, where some 800 Muslims were at prayer. He was dressed in his army uniform and carried an IMI Galil assault rifle and four {{magazines}} of ammunition, which held a total of 140 rounds in 35 rounds per magazine. He was not stopped by the guards, who assumed {{that he was an}} officer entering the tomb to pray in an adjacent chamber reserved for Jews. Standing in front of the only exit from the hall and positioned {{to the rear of the}} Muslim worshippers, is reported as having thrown a grenade into the middle of the hall, and then opened fire, killing 29 people and wounding another 125, among them children. Several people were left with paralyzing wounds. According to survivors, Goldstein bided his time until sujūd, the part of the prayer where worshippers prostrate themselves with their heads on the floor. After someone in the crowd hurled a fire extinguisher, which struck <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> he was overcome, disarmed and then beaten to death. No criminal charges were filed in connection with his killing.|$|E
60|$|A stab from Saduko's spear, {{which he}} {{partially}} parried, wounded <b>him</b> slightly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and cut loose the fillet of his ostrich plume, that same plume which I had seen blown {{off in the}} morning, so that it fell to the ground. Another stab pierced his right arm, making it helpless. He snatched the assegai with his left hand, striving to continue the fight, and just at that moment we came up.|$|R
60|$|He {{had just}} finished, when, taking one step further, he tumbled headlong into the pit, and Jack struck <b>him</b> a blow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with his pickaxe which killed him. Jack then {{returned}} home to cheer his friends with the news.|$|R
60|$|Seeing in {{a moment}} {{that he would be}} surrounded, Desmond made a last effort. The vicomte's weapon shivered at the stroke, but it {{somewhat}} diverted the direction of the blow, and instead of striking <b>him</b> full <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> <b>the</b> sword shore down his cheek, inflicting a ghastly wound, carrying away an ear as well as the cheek from the eye to the chin. Then, wheeling his horse, he dashed at two men who were riding at him.|$|R
25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a denim jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle {{that there is a}} badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E
25|$|Sam teams up with Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) and Den's wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman) to get {{revenge on}} Den, each humiliated by Den in differing ways. However, the women's {{confrontation}} leads to violence: Den attacks Chrissie and Zoe hits {{him over the}} head with an iron doorstop in defence. This is thought to have killed him; however, when Zoe and Sam leave the room, Den grabs Chrissie's ankle. She responds by hitting <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> a second time, killing him. Unbeknown to Chrissie, Sam witnesses this, but Chrissie allows Zoe to believe that her blow killed Den. As Chrissie has possession of The Vic following Den's death, Sam blackmails her, threatening to unveil her as Den's killer unless she gives her the pub. When Sam realises that Chrissie is attempting to sell the pub and leave Walford, she begins drinking heavily; she smashes up Den's grave and digs him up, hoping Chrissie will be arrested. The plan backfires; all evidence points to Sam, who is charged with murder and remanded in custody. Phil and Grant return to Walford to secure her release by proving Chrissie killed Den. Chrissie is arrested on a murder charge, while Sam is released from custody; however, she still faces a charge of perverting the course of justice and faces a prison sentence up to four years. This prospect is too daunting for Sam, and she flees to Brazil while on bail in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{forestall}} the likely death sentences, the Irgun kidnapped two British military policemen, a sergeant and a private, at a swimming pool in Ramat Gan on June 9. However, the attempt to use them as hostages failed, as 19 hours later British troops found the hiding place and rescued them. Two days later the three Irgun militants were sentenced to death. All that was needed for the sentences {{to be carried out}} was approval from the Commander in Chief. Irgun resumed, with increased urgency, its kidnapping attempts, which proved difficult due to British precautions against abductions: British soldiers were largely confined to heavily-guarded security zones that had been established throughout Palestine, and standing orders required troops to move around in groups of at least four. Matters were further complicated by Lehi's actions in retaliation to the killing of one of their members, Alexander Rubowitz, who was allegedly murdered in captivity by Major Roy Farran. Lehi decided to carry out revenge attacks. and the Irgun was concerned over the fact that it would be even more difficult to find hostages if Lehi began gun battles in the streets. Lehi agreed to hold off its attacks for a week, and Irgun carried out two unsuccessful abduction attempts. The first, on June 22, saw Assistant Superintendent of Police C.J.C. Pound escape from his would-be captors in Jerusalem. On June 25, an abduction squad in Jerusalem attempted to seize administrative officer Alan Major and hit <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with a hammer, but Major managed to struggle free. After the week passed, Lehi carried out two attacks in Tel Aviv and Haifa which killed two British soldiers and wounded five. These attacks resulted in even tighter security precautions.|$|E
50|$|Diggs, who has {{completely}} forgotten {{who he is}} and now believes himself to be a colonel in the Long Patrol, wanders away from the Abbey, but returns in company with Mumzy and the freed captives. After having his memory restored by a friend's hitting <b>him</b> hard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> Diggs, in company with Buckler and Ambrevina, returns to Salamandastron. The two young hares then report to Lord Brang the adventurous outcome of their 'little visit' to Redwall.|$|R
60|$|So {{saying he}} shook his hand from the bridle, struck <b>him</b> roughly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> with <b>the</b> butt end of his whip, and galloped away; dashing through the mud and {{darkness}} with a headlong speed, which few badly mounted horsemen would have cared to venture, even had they been thoroughly acquainted with the country; and which, to one who knew nothing {{of the way he}} rode, was attended at every step with great hazard and danger.|$|R
50|$|The yogi {{instructed}} Sathyaraju {{to sit in}} a cross-legged {{position and}} close his eyes.
