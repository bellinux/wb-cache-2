50|$|Knut Fladmark, a {{professor}} in the Archaeology Department at Simon Fraser University, believes argillite was known to the Haida pre-European contact, and that it had been used for more utilitarian purposes such as the creation of labrets. Fladmark excavated at the Richardson Ranch site on Graham Island, located near the mouth of the Tlell River. During the summers of 1969 and 1970 he found the first major archaeological assemblage of argillite. Fladmark’s analysis of the assemblage led him to believe that the creation of argillite pieces for the purpose of trade followed its use within the Haida community as a pipestone. The <b>elbow</b> <b>pipes</b> Fladmark discovered at the site may predate the generally accepted 1820 start date for the production of argillite as a saleable commodity. These <b>elbow</b> <b>pipes</b> have little to no decoration and seemingly serve a utilitarian purpose only, characteristics which separate them from the later non-functional panel pipes, and other solely aesthetic argillite pieces. Also, Fladmark notes the discovery of a labret in the archaeological record which appears to be made from argillite.|$|R
40|$|The {{process piping}} in the {{refinery}} plant {{does not always}} have straight pipe geometry. The configuration of these pipelines are usually zigzag or snake-like. The pipe fittings or joints including elbow pipes, blind-tee pipes, T-pipes, Y-pipes {{are found to be}} common in a refinery. One of the reasons why the pipelines are layed in zigzag or snake-like configuration is because of the limited space for the piping equipment even in the largest refineries. The aim of the thesis is to study the physical flow inside a pipe with focus on blind-tee and elbow pipes. Laminar flow regime with Reynolds number equals to 1000 is investigated in this study. The analysis utilizes CFD numerical simulations by using OpenFOAM to investigate the physical flow inside the studied pipes. The geometry of the pipes which are used in this study have a diameter (D) of 1 m, and the blind-tee length varied from 1 D to 5 D. In order to achieve the main objective, there are sub-objectives which need to be carried out. First, the laminar flow analysis of the straight pipe with a length 10 D is investigated as the base case of the study. Since the straight pipe is installed before and after the pipe joints in order to attain the fully developed desirable flow profile. Second, the geometry and mesh setup of the studied pipes are created by using Autodesk Inventor, GMSH and SALOME Software, starting with the straight pipe, and then followed by the blind-tee and <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe.</b> Third, the numerical analysis is carried out by performing OpenFOAM CFD simulations. Fourth, the sensitivity studies of different mesh elements, timesteps, and Reynolds number are carried out. Last, the results of the velocity profiles obtained from the numerical simulations are validated with the velocity profiles of laminar flow derived from the analytical solution of classical formula. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of fluid flow in the straight pipe, blind-tee, and <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> are presented. In addition, the streamline, velocity contour, and pressure contour of the blind-tee and <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> cases are shown. For the straight pipe case, the velocity profile in the pipe agrees well with the analytical solution of classical formula. For the blind-tee and <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> cases, the velocity profile at the 5 D from the inlet and 5 D from the outlet have been checked for grid convergence studies. It is found that there are flow circulations, which occurs inside the blind-tee.

The crack on the external {{surface of the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> was revealed. Macrodelamination was occurred in the steel being influenced by the joined action of working loads and hydrogen absorbed by metal during long-term operation.

40|$|Gasses and fluids are transported via an {{extensive}} infrastructure of steel pipelines. In {{the design of}} pipeline systems the use of <b>elbows</b> (<b>pipe</b> bends) is important because their flexibility makes them able to sustain significant deformations. These bends can be subjected to permanent deformations due to various load combinations {{which can lead to}} progressive material damage. There are three stages commonly observed in ductile damage: void nucleation, growth and coalescence. When subjected to varying bending loads low cycle fatigue damage may occur. Within this research project Finite Element Analysis is used to simulate the response of pipeline bends. Two element types are implemented to model a pipe bend, the classical shell element and an efficient tube element (<b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> element), respectively. To predict the structural response when subjected to monotonic loading a damage model is implemented for both elements. When subjected to cyclic loading three phases can be identified. During the first few cycles the permanent deformation increases rapidly. After some cycles, the rate of permanent deformation stabilizes until the point of response degradation. In order to capture this response a new material model, based upon the afore mentioned model, is proposed.

40|$|AbstractThermal {{stratification}} {{can cause}} thermal fatigue of the piping system {{of a nuclear}} power plant. One of the regions most at risk of suffering from thermal fatigue is a small <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> branching off from the main pipe of the coolant loop for the drain or letdown system in the chemical and volume control system (CVCS). This work focuses on a fundamental description of the thermal stratification caused by turbulent penetration and buoyancy effects in the elbow branch pipe using large-eddy simulations (LESs). The LES results for the normalized temperature, mean temperature, and root-mean square (RMS) temperature {{were found to be}} in good agreement with the available experimental data which confirms that LES can predict the thermal stratification in a closed elbow branch pipe where cold fluids are stagnant. Subsequently, the flow and heat transfer were numerically predicted using LES when leakage occurred in the elbow branch pipe. The numerical results show that the thermal stratification region is pushed towards the horizontal part and may remain {{there for a long time}} for a leakage ratio of 1 %. However, thermal stratification is quickly eliminated for a leakage ratio of 5 %, although there is a higher power spectrum density (PSD) of the temperature in the early stages of the leakage. It may be concluded that a small leakage ratio can result in the elbow branch pipe being at high risk of thermal fatigue caused by thermal stratification...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} found through {{experiments}} at Southwest Research Institute that temperature differences between the gas and wall of the pipe through which the gas is flowing can greatly influence the gas flow in the pipe line and give different velocity magnitudes {{at the top and}} bottom half of the pipe. The effect on the flow is observed to worsen at low fluid flow and high temperature differences. This effect has been observed by ultrasonic flow meters which measure the chord average gas velocity at four heights across the pipe. A significant variance in chord averaged velocities is apparent at these conditions. CFD analysis was performed. Low flow velocities of 0. 1524 m/sec, 0. 3048 m/sec and 0. 6096 m/sec and temperature differences of 5. 5 oK, 13. 8 oK and 27. 7 oK were considered. When these conditions were imposed onto the three different geometries, it was seen that the heating caused increased errors in the ultrasonic meter response. For the single elbow and double <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> configurations, the errors were below 0. 5 % for constant wall temperature conditions but rose to 1 % for sinusoid varying wall temperature conditions. The error was seen to increase as the axial velocity became more stratified due to momentum or temperature effects. The case of maximum error was noted for the double elbow geometry with sinusoid wall temperature condition where a swirl type of flow was noted to create localized velocity maxima {{at the center of the}} pipe. This part of the pipe was barely touched by the ultrasonic meter acoustic path giving maximum error of 1. 4 %. A thermal well was placed in the path of the gas flow in the pipe to observe the temperature response on the surface of the thermal well. It was noted that the thermal well surface temperature differed by 1. 4 % for most cases with gas velocity below 0. 6096 m/sec...|$|E

40|$|In the {{district}} heating industry, heat meters, consisting {{among other things}} of a flow meter, are used for billing purpose. The district heating industry desires accurate and low cost flow measurements. There are mainly two reasons. An under estimation of the flow rate leads {{to a loss of}} income for {{the district}} heating industry. Further, the total cost for measuring, including the cost for the heat meter, the reading and the maintenance, represents a relatively large part of the total energy cost. Therefore a project concerning measurement quality assurance in district heating systems is in progress at Luleå University of Technology. As a part of this project the possibility of self diagnostic techniques for flow meters is investigated. It is well known that installation effects greatly impair the flow measurement involved in heat metering. Thus this thesis focus on self diagnostics of different installation effects. The basic assumption is that the flow meter noise level is correlated to turbulence intensity. Since the turbulence intensity is effected by installation effects, the noise level can be used to detect conditions for which the flow meter shows erroneous results. In district heating applications the use of ultrasonic flow meters {{are becoming more and more}} frequent. The self diagnostic approach has therefore been investigated for a small size prototype ultrasonic flow meter. Single and double <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> bends and pipe diameter reductions mounted in front of the meter and pulsating flow give rise to small but reproducible errors. The magnitude of the maximum errors were in the range of 2 to 4 % of flow rate. At low flow rates with pulsating flow the errors were larger. Also small commercial ultrasonic flow meters were investigated. These commercial meters are commonly used in heat meters in small district heating subscriber stations. The results demonstrate that both temperature changes and installation effects introduce errors in the flow measurements. By studying the noise level of the signal from the prototype ultrasonic flow meter it is clear that all installation effects tested caused a clear increase in the flow signal noise level. It is clear that no tested disturbance causing measurement errors, larger than 1 % of the flow rate, will pass undetected. Neither will normal conditions with a varying flow rate or single measurement outliers cause false alarms. It is anticipated that this increase in the future can be detected on-line by the flow meter itself giving it a self diagnostic capability. Godkänd; 2001; 20061115 (haneit) </p...|$|E
