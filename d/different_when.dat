5|$|The {{final scene}} {{took a long}} time to write. The writing staff found it {{difficult}} to come up with a resolution that would end on positive terms for Bart and Homer, and was originally <b>different</b> <b>when</b> it was read at the writing table.|$|E
5|$|At Production I.G, Hiroyuki Kitakubo {{directed}} the animation scenes, wrote the screenplay {{and did the}} storyboards; Toshihiro Kawamoto was animation supervisor and a character designer. The scenes are noticeably <b>different</b> <b>when</b> compared to the film namesake directed by Mamoru Oshii, because the game is colored using a full digital technique. The scenes are a combination of cel animation and backgrounds that were rendered in three dimensions to ensure smooth transitions for the camera movement. Adobe Photoshop was used to add the finishing details to the scenes.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly <b>different,</b> <b>when</b> referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E

5|$|The legal code {{distinguished}} {{different levels}} of severity in meted punishments when different members {{of the social and}} political hierarchy committed the same crime. For example, the severity of punishment was <b>different</b> <b>when</b> a servant or nephew killed a master or an uncle than when a master or uncle killed a servant or nephew.|$|E
5|$|Kukunoor had not visited Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh before, but he {{felt that}} he would find great {{locations}} there. Salooni in Chamba district is considered for shooting in Himachal Pradesh. In spite of this geographical inexperience, all went as per the plans while shooting in Rajasthan. However, minor modifications in the script were allowed for the surroundings. Though Panag had been in Rajasthan, she felt the scorching summer heat unbearable at times. She liked the only continuous shooting schedule and said that it provided consistency in look and performance. In Himachal, it was slightly <b>different</b> <b>when</b> the crew had hard time framing the mountains correctly. On seeing the captured frames, they shifted all the interior shots to outside.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, Natasha blames Andrew for the crash. She learns Ed has a {{fractured}} collarbone and sits with {{him until he}} wakes up. When he does, Natasha kisses him. They begin dating, but Natasha worries {{that they do not}} have much in common. Natasha helps organise a ball for the university and takes an immediate dislike to Ed's vintage suit. She spills coffee on it and then lends Ed a nicer one that she found. Ed realises what she has done and they fight. After apologising to each other, Natasha decides to break up with Ed, as they are too <b>different.</b> <b>When</b> Natasha finds Andrew having a fit in Charlie's, she learns that he has epilepsy. She agrees to keep it a secret. After he collapses, Natasha encourages Andrew to go to the hospital for tests. Before he can leave, he suffers a fit in front of Paul. Andrew initially blames Natasha for causing the fit when Paul takes Charlie's away from him. She then helps him to convince Paul to change his mind. Natasha and Andrew begin dating again in secret. They later decide to tell everyone and Summer reveals that she already knew and does not mind. Natasha later finds an old email from Andrew proclaiming his love for Summer and she begins to worry about her relationship with him. However, Andrew reassures her that he loves her and their relationship is different this time around. Natasha asks Andrew to take a month of celibacy, but they end up breaking it early. Natasha quits university and tells Andrew that she is leaving Erinsborough to travel around Europe. She asks Andrew to come with her and he agrees. They leave the following day with Paul's blessing.|$|E

30|$|The {{diffusion}} of financial innovations can have different patterns and <b>different</b> speeds <b>when</b> <b>different</b> types of innovations are examined. For example, ATMs took several decades to diffuse. Other financial innovations such as microfinance and inflation-indexed bonds also took longer to diffuse.|$|R
5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly <b>different</b> <b>when</b> seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E

25|$|When Eileen Letchworth, who portrayed Margo Flax Martin, {{contemplated}} a facelift, {{she talked}} {{it over with}} Nixon. Not only was Letchworth going to need time off, {{she was going to}} look significantly <b>different</b> <b>when</b> she returned to the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin (William Mooney). Margo's facelift in 1974 {{became one of the first}} major storylines on television discussing plastic surgery and its psychological effects.|$|E
25|$|UCLA's two big streaks {{came to an}} end {{during the}} 1973–1974 season. In January, the winning streak stopped at 88 games when Digger Phelps's Notre Dame squad upended the Bruins 71–70 in South Bend. Two months later, Norm Sloan's North Carolina State team {{defeated}} UCLA 80–77 in double overtime in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament. David Thompson was NC State's All-American, and Tom Burleson did an excellent job on defense against Bill Walton. UCLA had beaten the Wolfpack by 18 points early in the season, but things were <b>different</b> <b>when</b> they met in March.|$|E
25|$|By the early/mid-1990s, some of McTavish's {{storytelling}} received {{criticism for}} being gimmick-driven (i.e. multiple dual roles, bomb plots). Reports soon surfaced that Behr and McTavish were having conflicts about storylines {{and the direction}} of the series. After the O.J. Simpson trial preempted daytime television programs throughout late 1994 and into 1995, many soaps saw their ratings decline, and All My Children was no <b>different.</b> <b>When</b> Megan McTavish was fired from her head writing post in the spring, former head writer Lorraine Broderick was tapped by Behr to lead the team once again.|$|E

25|$|In {{areas of}} {{language}} modeling, there are {{limitations on the}} applicability of any language model as the statistics for different types of text will be <b>different.</b> <b>When</b> a language technology application is put into use (applied to a new text type), it is not certain that the language model will fare {{in the same way}} as how it would when applied to the training corpus. It is found that there are substantial variations in model performance when the training corpus changes. This lack of theory types limits the assessment of the usefulness of language-modeling work.|$|E
25|$|Some skills {{also have}} a Tech Level (TL) rating {{attached}} to them, to differentiate between Skills that concern similar concepts, but whose tasks are accomplished in different ways when used with differing levels of technology. This helps during time traveling scenarios, or when characters are forced to deal with particularly outdated or advanced equipment. For instance, a modern boat builder's skills will be of less use if he is stuck on a desert island and forced to work with primitive tools and techniques. Thus, the skills he uses are <b>different</b> <b>when</b> in his shop (Shipbuilding/TL8) and when {{he is on the}} island (Shipbuilding/TL0).|$|E
25|$|The {{expectations}} were also plentiful as Red Star, Serbia-Montenegro league champion, {{was getting ready}} to start Champions League qualifying. After easily progressing from the initial stage versus Irish champions Cork City, they were drawn against powerhouse AC Milan in the final qualifying round, putting up decent resistance en route to 1–3 aggregate loss. Despite the failure to get into the Champions League, many still took some positives from the Milan clash, however things were <b>different</b> <b>when</b> Bajević's squad got eliminated from UEFA Cup in first round by Slovan Liberec with embarrassing ease (1–4 on aggregate, including the 1–2 loss at home) thus failing to reach the group stage.|$|E

25|$|In 2009 Melissa {{published}} a book titled, Shattered Silence: The Untold Story of a Serial Killer's Daughter. Moore lived with her father until her parents' divorce in 1990. Moore noticed her father was <b>different</b> <b>when</b> she was in elementary school. Their house bordered an apple orchard, and her dad killed stray cats and gophers that wandered nearby. One day she watched, horrified, as he hung stray kittens from the family's clothesline. She ran to get her mother, and when they returned, the kittens {{lay on the ground}} dead. He had watched and laughed as the kittens clawed each other to escape, then he killed them.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was said}} to have had a special liking for {{training}} football players and bodybuilders since he enjoyed testing their strength. Some have described his training as torture and have accused Hart of being a sadist who enjoyed inflicting pain on people and was more interested in doing so than teach them pro wrestling.}}}}}}}} Many who were close to Hart in his life have denied these claims. Stu's son Ross has said that his father was always generous and compassionate with his children and others in person but added that he was <b>different</b> <b>when</b> training people, believing that there was no easy way to teach wrestling.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{cellular}} receptors {{have been}} {{thought to be}} activated when bound to their ligand, and are relatively inactive when no ligand is present. A number of receptors have been found that do not fit into this conceptual mould, and DCC is one of them. These receptors are active both with ligand bound and unbound, but the signals transmitted are <b>different</b> <b>when</b> the receptors are ligand bound. Collectively, this type of receptor {{is known as a}} dependence receptor because the unbound pathway is usually apoptotic, meaning that cell survival depends on ligand presence. Other receptors also show this functional profile, including p75NTR, the androgen receptor, RET, several integrins and Patched.|$|E
