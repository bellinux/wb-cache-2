5|$|In 2007, New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{officials}} announced their long-term plan {{to prevent further}} traffic jams. They will create a series of loops and overpasses allowing traffic to go directly from southbound Route32 to the Thruway and remove some traffic lights {{in front of the}} mall. The changes were expected to be complete by 2011, as part of improvements to convert the Route17 expressway into I-86. However, in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints. Work was slated to begin in 2013, but <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> could start Governor Andrew Cuomo redirected the money to repair projects elsewhere in the state.

5|$|The Battle of Hampton Roads, often {{referred}} to as either the Battle of the Monitor and Merrimack (or Virginia) or the Battle of Ironclads, was the most noted and arguably most important naval battle of the American Civil War {{from the standpoint of the}} development of navies. It was fought over two days, March 8–9, 1862, in Hampton Roads, a roadstead in Virginia where the Elizabeth and Nansemond rivers meet the James River <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> enters Chesapeake Bay adjacent to the city of Norfolk. The battle was a part of the effort of the Confederacy to break the Union blockade, which had cut off Virginia's largest cities, Norfolk and Richmond, from international trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} was registered G-ALVG <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> was publicly {{displayed at}} the 1949 Farnborough Airshow {{prior to the start}} of flight trials. A year later, the second prototype G-5-2 made its maiden flight. The second prototype was registered G-ALZK in July 1950 and it was used by the BOAC Comet Unit at Hurn from April 1951 to carry out 500 flying hours of crew training and route proving. Australian airline Qantas also sent its own technical experts to observe the performance of the prototypes, seeking to quell internal uncertainty about its prospective Comet purchase. Both prototypes could be externally distinguished from later Comets by the large single-wheeled main landing gear, which was replaced on production models starting with G-ALYP by four-wheeled bogies.|$|E

5|$|By September 2, the storm's {{convective}} thunderstorms warmed slightly, indicating weakening to {{just below}} Category5. An eyewall replacement cycle took place, and two eye structures formed as gradual weakening continued. By September 2, {{the storm was}} downgraded to Category3 <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> turned slightly to the west. The storm underwent another eyewall replacement cycle as winds decreased further. As the storm entered cooler waters, winds decreased to 100mph (160km/h), below major hurricane intensity. Soon Hernan was downgraded to Category1, and the eye became cloud-filled. On September 5, Hernan was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds rapidly weakened to 45mph (72km/h) despite developing a new band of convection. That same day, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression as it began to lose tropical characteristics. Strong wind shear developed, further dissipating the depression. On September 6, the system degenerated into a remnant low-pressure system which spawned a remnant plume of moisture that meandered {{off the coast of}} California, producing light showers.|$|E
5|$|Continuing east-{{southeast}}erly along Washtenaw Avenue, M-17 {{meets the}} southeast corner of the EMU campus at Oakwood Avenue. The highway follows the southern edge of campus to Cross Street, where the highway splits to follow a one-way pairing of streets. Eastbound M-17 continues along Washtenaw Avenue while westbound traffic follows Cross Street. Eastbound traffic turns southward at Hamilton Street for two blocks before turning east along Michigan Avenue, meeting westbound Bus. US12. The two highway designations merge, running concurrently through downtown Ypsilanti. The section of Michigan Avenue between Hamilton and Huron streets is actually a wrong-way concurrency because although it is a two-way boulevard, the eastbound direction is M-17 and the westbound direction is Bus. US 12. Both directions of traffic for both highways rejoin at Huron Street, as the westbound M-17 traffic uses Huron Street north to Cross Street and westbound Bus. US 12 turns south along Huron Street. Northeast of the Huron Street intersection is Riverside Park. Michigan Avenue forms the extreme southern park boundary <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> crosses the Huron River. At Ecorse Road, M-17 turns south in Ypsilanti Township through a residential area, separating from Bus. US12. Ecorse Road turns east four blocks north of I-94/US12 and runs parallel to the freeway. Past Harris Road, US12 turns northeasterly on a separate expressway. Where it meets Ecorse Road, US12 follows Ecorse Road, replacing M-17. This junction marks the eastern terminus of M-17 west of Willow Run Airport.|$|E
5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E

5|$|K-383 and US-36 {{intersect}} K-261, a spur serving Prairie Dog State Park, {{before reaching}} the city of Norton. The highways curve northeast and back east and pass through {{the northern part of}} the city as Holme Street, a four-lane undivided road. K-383 and US-36 intersect US-283 (State Street) north of the downtown area. The highways become a two-lane road again as they leave Norton. K-383 and US-36 cross over the Kyle Railroad and begin to parallel the railroad and Prairie Dog Creek. The highways meet the southern end of K-67, a spur serving the Norton Correctional Facility, before they diverge. US-36 continues east and K-383 heads northeast parallel to the Kyle Railroad through the hamlet of Calvert. The state highway meets the northern end of K-60 <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> crosses over the Kyle Railroad on the edge of the city of Almena. K-383 continues east parallel to the Nebraska Kansas Colorado Railway into Phillips County. After they pass through the city of Long Island, that railroad splits to the north into Nebraska. K-383 passes through the village of Woodruff shortly before it reaches its northern terminus at US-183 about one half-mile south of the Nebraska state line.|$|E
5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched down near the rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier. Near {{the beginning of the}} path, a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were tossed, and significant damage to large trees was observed before the tornado crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. The tornado then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, the tornado crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church bus was tossed several hundred feet and flipped upside down. The tornado then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by the tornado in this area. One car was tossed 75 yards into a farm field. A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before the tornado began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>it</b> would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E
