50|$|When offered, golden {{handcuffs}} {{are extremely}} tempting as they usually are {{of great value}} compared to the employee's annual salary. The experience that follows an agreement of this sort may be draining and abhorrent, {{which is why the}} contract must be thoroughly analysed and thought about until an intelligent conclusion or compensation, that benefits both the company and the employee, is agreed upon. Often employees feel the urge to remain within the company they've been working with, even though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> the smartest choice, objectively, because of tradition, relationships or a simple feeling of belonging. When different opportunities are offered to an employee, generally the choice is made by a mix of objective and subjective views, where he or she must prioritise every aspect of their opportunities in order to result with a beneficial solution.These sort of agreements might potentially impose penalties if the employee decides to leave the company before the contracted date, such as the repayment of bonuses. Often included in these contracts are non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), where the employee is prohibited to communicate sensitive corporate information, and non-compete clauses, where working for competitors is forbidden for the leaving employee.|$|R

40|$|Two {{concepts}} that cannot be separated are public {{drinking water and}} public health protection. In fact, an entire industry {{was built on the}} bond between these two notions. Drinking water systems, drinking water organizations, and, yes, even the dreaded drinking water regulations exist because safe drinking water and public health have an alliance that cannot be divided. U. S. drinking water suppliers demonstrate their awareness of this tie everyday. The water they distribute to their customers is among the cleanest and safest in the world. But the country’s sta-tus as a public health leader did-n’t happen by accident. Extensive regulations, guidelines, and water quality testing were the drive to the destination. After years of complying with new regulations, however, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> more <b>like</b> the regulations are a burden than a blessing. Believe it or not, the U. S.

30|$|A {{frequent}} {{response of}} those on the losing side of boundaries is to reverse, or invert, the order by claiming their attributes are, in fact, superior to those with whom they have been unfavorably compared (Wimmer 2008 a). The steady stream of offenses lobbed at migrants by colleagues and customers created cynicism about urban norms and values, leading migrants to reverse the urban ethos projecting all things rural as culturally impoverished (Wimmer 2008 a, b). To wit, migrants highlighted the value of their labor by pointing to the inadequacies of urbanites. One expressive vehicle for the representational reversal was pity. During a break one morning, a few kitchen workers shared concern about their front-of-the-house, urban colleagues, who never carried lunch from home, instead buying it from the kitchen. It seemed obvious that these colleagues lacked basic cooking skills. One quipped that CS worker Xue might fail to find a husband since, as she herself confessed, could not cook rice. The discussion elevates the worth of kitchen workers’ labor by underscoring the tangible use values produced in the form of food. On the face of <b>it,</b> this <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a slight on Xue’s gender, but in fact, it expressed migrant workers’ sense that urban workers who grew up under the single child policy (which was not enforced for rural people) were overindulged by their parents and therefore lacked practical skills.|$|R

40|$|Art {{has always}} {{been one of the most}} indeterminable notions. All the {{different}} art forms make it even harder to define and comprehend. But at the same time it is something that often gives and rarely takes, evokes emotions, gives structure and meaning to our world. Art of public spaces usually means works on sites with open public access. The term ‘site-specific’ is often mentioned in this paper and refers to both – art installations on given sites and art that is also the design of the site itself, which is one of the main aspects of land art and is often applied to landscape architecture. Landscape architecture is technical work and a form of art on its own, but this cannot always be seen in practice and sometimes <b>it</b> <b>may</b> even <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> there is a big gap between the two fields. However, some artists have a way of bridging this gap and uniting them into one whole. With focus on Maya Lin’s Eleven Minute Line, Lars Vilks’s Nimis and Arx, Monika Gora’s and Martha Schwartz’s work, this paper attempts to contribute to uncovering of what lies behind those ideas and how this bridge is built. Mentioned landscape architects have a special relation to art; this leaves a big impact on their work, which is imbued with modernity, humour and magic...|$|R
30|$|Workers {{and firms}} can only {{respond to the}} subsidy if they know about <b>it.</b> This <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> {{a simple matter of}} sending a letter to each employer, but in {{practice}} {{it is likely to be}} much more complex. Such communications may be ignored, may not be understood by the recipient, or may go to the wrong person altogether. These possibilities are particularly salient in countries in which communications with the business sector are not highly developed. Even in developed countries, knowledge of tax policy can be surprisingly limited. The experience of the U.S. with the New Jobs Tax Credit in the late 1970 s is instructive. In a Department of Labor survey conducted just after the end of the first tax year in which the credit applied, only 34 percent of the firms interviewed said that they knew about the new tax credit (which was scheduled to expire at the end of that year) (Perloff and Wachter 1979). Although nearly 90 percent of firms with more than 500 employees had heard of the tax credit, only 27 percent of small firms (those with 0 – 9 employees) had heard of it. Similar results were found by Lamberts (1993) in Belgium and by van Nes et al. (1998) in the Netherlands. Developing countries are likely to be dealing with firms more like the latter than the former. Moreover, many of the workers one would like to reach in developing countries are in the informal sector, where the government has little or no communication with workers.|$|R

40|$|TCD-CS- 2004 - 05 [Introduction] Virtually all {{pervasive}} computing systems use {{some form of}} location for affecting the system 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour. Location-based services are available commercially, albeit in a primitive form, from many mobile telecommunications providers. Despite this, location is a remarkably subtle concept to reason with. There are {{a huge number of}} possible answers to what is superficially a simple question: each kind of answer reveals something about {{the way in which we}} conceptualise location and any services based upon <b>it.</b> This <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a trivial observation, but it cuts to the heart of the development of programming environments for {{pervasive computing}}. Software design is the process of mapping concepts to programming structures, whether one is developing object models or complete programming languages. A system is easy to program when the developer can express his concepts directly or with minimal mental gymnastics; conversely, the developer takes on a considerable load when using a system without the requisite concepts. Handling location is a basic requirement for many pervasive computing systems: but what kind of location will we provide in a programming environment? If we choose the "wrong" representation we will end up with an awkward (or unusable) environment. In this paper we try to exhaust the ways one may answer a simple location question in a pervasive computing system, to develop a taxonomy of answers that an application might want to receive. We deliberately stray beyond the bounds of traditional location systems and the information typically at hand in order to see how a "really pervasive" computing system might view location. We analyse the space of answers to see what conclusions can be drawn for the development of semantic models and programming environments...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] For {{those workers}} who {{participate}} in a traditional pension plan— 15 percent of private sector workers and 75 percent State and local government workers—the math exercise doesn’t end once you figure out your monthly benefit (often based on earnings and years of service). No matter how the plan calculates your benefit, retirees must {{have the opportunity to}} receive periodic payments for life and may be offered alternative forms of payment. Sound confusing? It gets worse. To really understand the options, you need to remember those “time value of money” calculations if you’ve ever taken a finance class. In a nutshell, the plan is required to have sufficient assets to be able to pay you the required benefits for your lifetime. The various forms of payment in most cases simply distribute those funds differently. In its simplest form, a plan might have $ 200, 000 in assets designated for your pension. You might be offered a lump sum of $ 200, 000 or monthly payments of $ 1, 050 for life. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> not <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> but these two payments are equivalent. Investing $ 200, 000 at 4 percent interest provides a $ 1, 050 monthly payment for about 25 years. Because the options are designed to be roughly equivalent (more formally, the “actuarial equivalent”), your decision to choose one form of payment over another is not about the monetary value; other factors come into play, such as the need to provide benefits for survivors. This issue of Beyond the Numbers looks at the various payment options and what factors you need to take into account when making a decision. The accompanying charts provide a visual representation of different payment options...|$|R
