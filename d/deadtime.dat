40|$|Rapid freeze-quench (RFQ) {{trapping}} of short-lived reaction intermediates for spectroscopic study {{plays an}} important role in the characterization of biological reactions. Recently there has been considerable effort to achieve submillisecond reaction <b>deadtimes.</b> We present here a new, robust, high-velocity microfluidic mixer that enables such rapid freeze-quenching. It is a based on the mixing method of two impinging jets commonly used in reaction injection molding (RIM) of plastics. This method achieves efficient mixing by inducing chaotic flow at relatively low Reynolds numbers (Re = 140). We present the first mathematical simulation and microscopic visualization of mixing in such RFQ micromixers, the results of which show that the impinging solutions efficiently mix within the mixing chamber. These tests, along with a practical demonstration in a RFQ setup that involves copper wheels, show this new mixer can in practice provide reaction <b>deadtimes</b> as low as 100 microseconds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] This article {{concerns}} non-linear {{control of}} single-input-single-output processes with input constraints and <b>deadtimes.</b> The problem of input-output linearization i continuous time is formulated as a model-predictive control problem, for processes with full-state measurements and for processes with incomplete state measurements and <b>deadtimes.</b> This model-predictive control formulation allows one (i) {{to establish the}} connections between model-predictive and input-output linearizing control methods; and (ii) to solve directly the problems of constraint handling and windup in input output linearizing control. The derived model-predictive control laws have the shortest possible prediction horizon and explicit analytical form, and thus their implementation does not require on-line optimization. Necessary conditions for stability of the closed-loop system under the constrained ynamic control laws are given. The connections between (a) the developed control laws and (b) the model state feedback control and the modified internal model control are established. The application and performance of the derived controllers are demonstrated by numerical simulations of chemical and biochemica...|$|R

30|$|We have {{developed}} large linear arrays of SPADs with {{a diameter of}} several microns that exhibit a single photon timing resolution better than 100  ps and a dead time, individually, of several tens of nanoseconds [59]. The arrays are coupled with digital hardware including time-to-digital converters (TDCs) capable of resolutions better than 25  ps and recharge periods shorter than 7.5  ns. With these devices, {{it is possible to}} achieve overall <b>deadtimes</b> of several tens of picoseconds, while dissipating less than 100  mW. Thanks to parallelism of SPADs and TDCs, large throughputs of up to 34  Gb/s can thus be achieved, while generally only several Mb/s are exploited in single-photon communication.|$|R

40|$|Efficient optical readout of a single, {{solid-state}} electronic spin at {{room temperature}} is a key challenge for nanoscale quantum sensing. Here we apply the technique of spin-to-charge conversion to enhance the optical spin-state readout of a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) color center in room temperature diamond, with no degradation in the NV spin coherence time. We demonstrate an order-of-magnitude improvement in spin readout noise per shot and about a factor of five improvement in AC magnetometry sensitivity, compared to the conventional NV spin-state optical readout method. This improvement is realized in a widely-applicable bulk diamond system. We show that selecting for successful charge state initialization leads to possible further improvement in sensitivity. This technique is well suited to sensing applications involving low duty cycle pulsed signals, e. g., in biomagnetometry, where long <b>deadtimes</b> demand optimized sensitivity per shot.

5000|$|The signal {{induced by}} a {{potential}} gravitational wave is thus [...] "embedded" [...] {{in the light}} intensity variations detected at the interferometer output. Yet, several external causes—globally denoted as noises—changes the interference pattern perpetually and significantly. Should nothing be done to remove or mitigate them, the expected physical signals would be buried in noise and would then remain undetectable. The design of detectors like Virgo and LIGO thus requires a detailed inventory of all noise sources which could impact the measurement, allowing a strong and continuing effort to reduce {{them as much as}} possible. During the data taking periods, dedicated software monitor in real time the noise levels in the interferometer and deep studies are carried out to identify the loudest noises and mitigate them. Each period during which a detector is found to be [...] "too noisy" [...] is excluded from the data analysis: these <b>deadtimes</b> thus need to be reduced as much as possible.|$|R

40|$|Digital pulse {{processing}} is {{a signal}} processing technique in which detector (preamplifier output) signals are directly digitized and processed to extract quantities of interest. This approach has several significant advantages compared to tra-ditional analog signal shaping. First, analyses {{can be developed}} which take pulse-by-pulse differences into account, as in making ballistic deficit compensations. Second, transient induced charge signals which deposit no net charge on an electrode can be analyzed to give, for example, information on the position of interaction within the detector. Third, <b>deadtimes</b> from transient overload signals are greatly reduced, from 10 's of ms to 100 's of ns. Fourth, signals are easily captured, so that more complex analyses can be postponed until the source event has been deemed "interesting". Fifth, signal capture and processing may easily be based on coincidence criteria between different detectors or {{different parts of the}} same detector. XIA's recently introduced CAMAC module, the DGF- 4 C, provides many of these features for four input channels, includ-ing two levels of digital processing and a FIFO for signal capture for each signal channel. The first level of digital processing is "immediate", taking place in a gate array at the 40 MHz digitization rate, and implements pulse detection, pileup inspection, trapezoidal energy filtering, and control of an external 25. 6 ms long FIFO. The second level of digital processing is provided by a digital signal processor (DSP), where more complex algorithms can be implemented. To illustrate digital pulse processing's possibilities, we describe the application of the DGF- 4 C to a series of experiments...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{new methods}} for process modelling, parameter estimation, and constrained multivariable predictive control for adaptive control systems. We {{have developed a}} new model applicable to open-loop stable systems which eliminates the problem of unstable pole-zero cancellations, which often cause instabilities in the closed-loop adaptive system. The new model is well suited for systems with large <b>deadtimes,</b> {{as well as for}} multivariable systems with large dispersions in the time constants. Simulation studies are presented which demonstrate the performance of an adaptive, predictive controller which uses the new model. ^ We have also designed an adaptive deadzone which can be used to regulate the adaptation mechanism. This algorithm is able to eliminate 2 ̆ 2 bursting 2 ̆ 2 phenomena which result from lack of excitation to the system. Global stability results have been obtained for pole-placement control of an adaptive system which uses a least squares estimator with an adaptive deadzone. Simulation studies show that the adaptive deadzone performs well, even in the presence of unmodelled dynamics and unmeasured disturbances. ^ A modification to the recursive least squares algorithm is presented which guarantees that the condition number of the covariance matrix remains bounded. Also, a linear programming approach to parameter estimation is presented. The estimation problem is cast as a constrained minimization problem, which allows us to restrict the parameter estimates to a bounded solution space. ^ In order to handle process constraints in an optimal fashion, one can treat the control objective as a constrained optimization problem. We implement a control algorithm which is based on a constrained minimization of a linear objective function. The control objective is then formulated as a linear programming problem, and is solved using the simplex method. Several control objectives are considered, and the algorithm is demonstrated using simulations of a constrained multivariable fractionation process. ...|$|R
