5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{about one}} percent of the total {{vegetation}} in the park consisted of grasses, bracken, thistle, and <b>fireweed</b> in sections of the forest cleared two to five years earlier. Another two percent had reached the shrub stage, between three and thirty years old, with small trees dominated by such plants as thimbleberry, salmonberry, and blackberry. Forest areas 10 to 30years old that contained tall alder and maple trees and smaller conifers accounted for about 20percent of the park.|$|E
5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, <b>fireweed,</b> saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as <b>fireweed</b> appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E

50|$|This bee {{occurs in}} {{maritime}} Canada, temperate forest, the Canadian Prairies, tundra, and taiga. It lives {{in and around}} wooded areas. It feeds on several types of plants, including cohosh, <b>fireweeds,</b> kalmia, honeysuckles, bergamot, blackberries, and bilberries. It nests underground.|$|R
25|$|Chamaenerion is {{native to}} the {{northern}} hemisphere. Six of the eight species are native to Eurasia; the two more widespread species, C.angustifolium and C.latifolium, are also found in North America. This contrasts with {{most members of the}} family Onagraceae, which are native only to the western hemisphere. Most species are found at high elevations, in moist, rocky areas. C.angustifolium is the exception, being widespread in disturbed habitats. Its English name, <b>fireweed,</b> reflects its regular occurrence in areas recovering from wildfires, to which it may be adapted.|$|E
25|$|Monofloral honey is made {{primarily}} from the nectar of one type of flower. Different monofloral honeys have a distinctive flavor and color because of differences between their principal nectar sources. To produce monofloral honey, beekeepers keep beehives {{in an area where}} the bees have access to only one type of flower. In practice, because of the difficulties in containing bees, a small proportion of any honey will be from additional nectar from other flower types. Typical examples of North American monofloral honeys are clover, orange blossom, blueberry, sage, tupelo, buckwheat, <b>fireweed,</b> mesquite, and sourwood. Some typical European examples include thyme, thistle, heather, acacia, dandelion, sunflower, lavender, honeysuckle, and varieties from lime and chestnut trees. In North Africa (e.g. Egypt), examples include clover, cotton, and citrus (mainly orange blossoms). The unique flora of Australia yields a number of distinctive honeys, {{with some of the most}} popular being yellow box, blue gum, ironbark, bush mallee, Tasmanian leatherwood, and macadamia.|$|E
25|$|The bluff's {{nature as}} a solitary outlier of the range gives it a greater range, in one place, of {{habitats}} and flora than elsewhere in the Great Western Tiers. The plants and trees found on the bluff are common {{to the rest of}} the range however, unlike the rest of the range, Quamby Bluff's summit does not show evidence of burning or grazing damage. The mountain has a mixture of habitats including eucalypt forest, rainforest and subalpine vegetation. On the mountain's southern half there are some patches of callidendrous rainforest which are dominated by myrtle (Nothofagus cunninghamii) and sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum) trees with mother shield ferns (Polystichum proliferum), and tree ferns in the gullies. There are scattered king billy pines (Athrotaxis selaginoides) on southern slopes, indicating long periods between bushfires. Other rainforest sections contain some Stringybark trees (Eucalyptus delegatensis). These forests on the mountain were formerly of mixed eucalyptus. High altitude and loggingevidenced by remaining stumpshave changed its character. Other sections contain mixed forest containing stringybark, myrtle, sassafras and dogwood (Pomaderris apetala), with a silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) understorey. Sections have some treeferns, mother shield fern, bat's wing fern (Histiopteris incisa) and kangaroo fern (Microsorum pustulatum). In other areas there is a dryer forest dominated by eucalypts. Messmate Stringybark (eucalyptus obliqua) and stringybark grow over an understorey of silver wattle, dogwood, bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and <b>fireweed.</b> In these sections there is evidence in the flora's pattern of repeated burnings. Eucalyptus dalrympleana and some Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon) occur higher up, with a mixed understorey. The summit is exposed and wind-swept. Here there are mostly low and wind-pruned shrubs including: Narrow-Leaf Orites (Orites revolutus), Baeckea gunniana, Common Shaggy-pea (Oxylobium ellipticum, Leptospermum rupestre, Richea sprengelioides, Richea scoparia and Kerosine Bush (Ozothamnus hookeri).|$|E
50|$|Most {{species are}} {{known by the}} common name willowherbs for their willow-like leaves. Those that were once {{separated}} in Boisduvalia are called spike-primroses or boisduvalias. Those Epilobium species previously placed in the Chamaenerion group and known as <b>fireweeds</b> are now segregated into the genus Chamaenerion.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a common}} species. It is a bee of alpine and subarctic climates. It lives in open, grassy habitat such as {{mountain}} meadows. It nests underground, or sometimes on the surface. Its food plants include sandworts, rabbitbrush, <b>fireweeds,</b> lupines, coyote mints, butterburs, mountain heathers, and groundsels.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} species of {{original}} vegetation of Williams Landing that have been present for thousands of years. The red coloured patches are either kangaroo grass or red-leg grass. In spring, common everlastings, blue devils, lemon beauty-heads and spur velleia come up and are also original flora to the area. The area also has some threatened species such as spiny rice-flowers, large-fruit <b>fireweeds,</b> and basalt podolepis.|$|R
500|$|A {{total of}} over 1,132 plant {{species have been}} {{identified}} parkwide. The predominantly coniferous forest is home to various species of trees such as the Engelmann spruce, Douglas fir, subalpine fir, limber pine and western larch, which is a deciduous conifer, producing cones but losing its needles each fall. Cottonwood and aspen are the more common deciduous trees and are found at lower elevations, usually along lakes and streams. The timberline {{on the eastern side}} of the park is almost [...] lower than on the western side of the Continental Divide, due to exposure to the colder winds and weather of the Great Plains. West of the Continental Divide, the forest receives more moisture and is more protected from the winter, resulting in a more densely populated forest with taller trees. Above the forested valleys and mountain slopes, alpine tundra conditions prevail, with grasses and small plants eking out an existence in a region that enjoys as little as three months without snow cover. Thirty species of plants are found only in the park and surrounding national forests. Beargrass, a tall flowering plant, is commonly found near moisture sources, and is relatively widespread during July and August. Wildflowers such as monkeyflower, glacier lily, <b>fireweed,</b> balsamroot and Indian paintbrush are also common.|$|E

25|$|Chamaenerion is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Onagraceae (the willowherb family). It is sometimes included in the genus Epilobium. Members of the genus may be called willowherbs (along with Epilobium), or <b>fireweeds,</b> based on a common name used for C.angustifolium. They are upright herbaceous perennials, growing from a woody base or from rhizomes, with racemes of usually purple to pink flowers. All species {{are found in the}} northern hemisphere. Most occur in moist habitats; C.angustifolium is the exception, favouring disturbed ground.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAll 14 {{species of}} the type section of the genus Lebeckia Thunb. are endemic to the Cape Floristic Region and are easily {{recognized}} by their phyllodinous, acicular (needle-shaped) leaves. Ten of the 14 species, comprising the L. sepiaria and L. plukenetiana groups, have already been revised. The last two groups are formally treated in this paper: 1. the L. pauciflora group (two virgate perennials with terete to semi-terete, stipitate fruits) and 2. the L. wrightii group (two trailing <b>fireweeds</b> with flat, sessile fruits). One of these, L. uniflora B-E. van Wyk and M. M. le Roux sp. nov., is here described as new. The new species was previously confused with L. wrightii (Harv.) Bolus but differs in the single-flowered inflorescences, larger flowers and black seeds. The nomenclature, typification, morphological and diagnostic characters are presented as well as distribution maps. A comprehensive key to all 14 species of section Lebeckia is provided...|$|R
40|$|Indigenous {{landscape}} burning {{is practiced}} around remote {{communities in the}} Kimberleys but {{has been replaced by}} wildfires across uninhabited areas. A landscape-scale natural experiment was established to investigate the effects of these different fire histories (derived from a 10 -year Landsat remote-sensing sequence) on the floristic structure and composition of woody vegetation within and among three of the major vegetation types on three landscape types (sandplain, sandstone and volcanics) near Kalumburu in the North Kimberley bioregion. Substrate factors determine vegetation and associated fire patterns within the landscape such that each landscape type needs to be examined independently. Basalt soils are dominated by an open savanna and tend to have very high fire frequencies. Basalt vegetation showed few significant response variables to fire-history parameters. The total density of woody stems showed no significant relationship to fire-history variables, regardless of size class. The 0 - 2. 0 -m size class of Erythrophleum chlorostachys (F. Muell.) Baillon showed significant (P < 0. 005) responses to the various interactions involving all three fire-history variables, indicating that seedling density is sensitive to fire. Sandplain is dominated by open woodland, with relatively low fire frequency. Total stem density, shrub density and the densities of Grevillea agrifolia Cunn. Ex R. Br., Canthium sp. A and Stenocarpus cunninghamii R. Br. showed strong positive (P < 0. 005) relationships with the total number of fire-free months. In sandstone, the density of all woody stems, acacias and a range of mid-storey trees showed significant positive relationships with the total number of fire-free months. Other species showed strong relationships with the number of late dry season fires. Vegetation thickening was evident in sand environments through the accumulation of woody stems in fire-free years and in sandstone through the promotion of 2 ̆ 7 <b>fireweeds</b> 2 ̆ 7 such as Acacia gonocarpa F. Muell. after fire events. Mid-storey tree species capable of resprouting after fire showed some evidence of structural suppression in response to frequent fire events, including Planchonia careya (F. Muell.) Knuth, Persoonia falcata R. Br. and Buchanania obovata Engl. Results are discussed in the context of indigenous landscape burning and biodiversity conservation...|$|R

60|$|Before we came {{together}} I noticed where a moose, which possibly I had scared by my shouting, had apparently just run along a large rotten {{trunk of a}} pine, which made a bridge thirty or forty feet long over a hollow, as convenient for him as for me. The tracks were as large as those of an ox, but an ox could not have crossed there. This burnt land was an exceedingly wild and desolate region. Judging by the weeds and sprouts, it {{appeared to have been}} burnt about two years before. It was covered with charred trunks, either prostrate or standing, which crocked our clothes and hands. Great shells of trees, sometimes unburnt without, or burnt on one side only, but black within, stood twenty or forty feet high. The fire had run up inside, as in a chimney, leaving the sapwood. There were great fields of <b>fireweed,</b> which presented masses of pink. Intermixed with these were blueberry and raspberry bushes.|$|E

Autumn came to the Laurentians. In the morning the lake lay like a quicksilver pool under the rising mists, through which the sun struck blinding flashes of light. A little later, when the veil had lifted, it became a mirror for the hills and crags, the blue reaches of the sky. The stinging air was spiced with balsam. Revealed was the incredible brilliance of another day,--the arsenic-green of the spruce, the red and gold of the maples, the yellow of the alders bathing in the shallows, of the birches, whose white limbs could be seen gleaming in the twilight of the thickets. Early, too early, the sun fell down behind the serrated forest-edge of the western hill, a ball of orange fire.... One evening Delphin and Herve, followed by two other canoes, paddled up to the landing.

60|$|Let us take as {{examples}} a single little set of instances, familiar to everybody, but far commoner {{in the world}} at large than the inhabitants of towns are at all aware of: I mean, the winged seeds, that fly about freely in the air by means of feathery hairs or gossamer, like thistle-down and dandelion. Of these winged types we have many hundred varieties in England alone. All the willow-herbs, for example, have such feathery seeds (or rather fruits) to help them on their way through life; and one kind, the beautiful pink rose-bay, flies about so readily, and over such wide spaces of open country, that the plant is known to farmers in America as <b>fireweed,</b> because it always springs up at once over whole square miles of charred and smoking soil after every devastating forest fire. It travels fast, for it travels like Ariel. In much the same way, the coltsfoot grows on all new English railway banks, because its winged seeds are wafted everywhere in myriads on the winds of March. All the willows and poplars have also winged seeds: so have the whole vast tribe of hawkweeds, groundsels, ragworts, thistles, fleabanes, cat's-ears, dandelions, and lettuces. Indeed, one may say roughly, there are very few plants of any size or importance in the economy of nature which don't deliberately provide, in one way or another, for the dispersal and dissemination of their fruits or seedlings.|$|E
