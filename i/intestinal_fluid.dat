50|$|The {{idea that}} a SIBO test should be several hours long and that distal {{overgrowth}} is important is wrong and is {{not supported by the}} scientific literature. The optimal testing is 1 hour. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) occurs as a result of excessive numbers of bacteria inhabiting the proximal small intestine. Bacterial concentrations greater than 105 organisms per milliliter is diagnostic for SIBO. We know bacteria are colonizing the proximal and not the distal small intestine for several reasons. First, the gold standard method for detection of SIBO is jejunal aspirates. <b>Intestinal</b> <b>fluid</b> of the proximal intestine is sampled, not distal <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid.</b> Secondly, the consequences of SIBO are the result of competition between bacteria and the human host for ingested nutrients in the intestine. Various functional consequences of bacterial infiltration cause enterocyte damage in the jejunum such as diminished disaccharidase activity, fat malabsorption, decreased amino acid transport and decreased vitamin B12 absorption. Thus, detection of proximal bacterial overgrowth is critical.|$|E

Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is an immunogenic protein that assembles into 30 or 34 nm diameter VLPs. Here, the stabilities of both the HBcAg polypeptide itself and the three-dimensional structure of the VLPs upon exposure to in vitro and ex vivo simulated gastric and <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> were investigated.

50|$|Linaclotide, {{like the}} {{endogenous}} guanylin and uroguanylin it mimics, is an agonist that activates the cell surface receptor of guanylate cyclase 2C (GC-C). The medication binds {{to the surface}} of the intestinal epithelial cells. Linaclotide is minimally absorbed and it is undetectable in the systemic circulation at therapeutic doses. Activation of GC-C increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Elevated cGMP stimulates secretion of chloride and bicarbonate and water into the intestinal lumen, mainly by way of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel activation. This results in increased <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid</b> and accelerated transit. By elevating cGMP, linaclotide is also considered to reduce activation of colonic sensory neurons, reducing pain; and activates colonic motor neurons, which increases smooth muscle contraction and thus promotes bowel movements.|$|E

The degradation rate of G 17 in the gastric fluids of all animals was less than 10 %, while the degradation of G 34 was less than 15 % in the gastric fluids of suckling and adult pigs and about 25 % in the gastric fluids of weanling pigs. The degradation rates of G 17 and G 34 in the small <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> of suckling pigs were between 18 and 30 %, and were significantly lower than the corresponding rates in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> of weanling and adult pigs, the latter were between 35 and 67 %.

50|$|Pathogens like Salmonella, {{which is}} a food borne pathogen, are able {{to adapt to the}} host {{environment}} and maintain virulence via several pathways. In a paper by Baumler et al 1998, characters of Salmonella, such as its ability to cause intestinal infection were attributed to virulence factors like its ability to invade intestinal epithelial cells, induce neutrophil recruitment and interfere with the secretion of <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid.</b> Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that many strains or lineages of Salmonella exist, {{which is a}}dvantageous for the pathogen because its genetic diversity can acts as fodder for natural selection to tinder with. For instance, if a particular Salmonella strain is more fit in the host stomach environment, compared to other Salmonella strains, then the former will be positively selected for and increase in prevalence. Eventually this strain will colonize and infect the stomach. The other less fit strains will be selected against and will thus not persist. Another major host adaptation on the part of Salmonella was its adaptation to host blood temperatures. Because Salmonella can thrive at the human host temperature, 98.6 degrees F, it is fit for the host environment and hence survive well in it. Adaptations like these are simple yet very effective ways of infecting hosts because they use the host's body and important feature of its body as a stepping stone in the infection process.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of developing second generation biorelevant dissolution/solubility media, {{the effect of the}} nutritional state on the solubilizing properties of human <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> was explored on a time-after-food administration basis. Human duodenal fluids from 5 volunteers were collected in the fasted, fed and fat-enriched fed state. The fed conditions were obtained after the administration of commercial drinks with equal caloric content but different fat percentage (30 % and 46 %). Ten 30 min fractions were collected from each volunteer. Upon collection, Orlistat (1 µM) was added to arrest further lipolysis. In vitro solubility tests were performed for 5 poorly water soluble drugs (danazol, diazepam, indomethacin, ketoconazole, nifedipine) in aqueous buffer, FaSSIF, FeSSIF, administered drinks and the collected <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids.</b> As the solubilizing properties of <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> depend on various parameters including pH, bile salts, phospholipids and fat degradation products, complex profiles were obtained; however, a few trends could be observed. For the non-ionized compounds danazol, nifedipine and diazepam, solubility was generally higher in the fed state as compared to the fasted state aspirates, the highest solubility being observed in the early collected fractions. The solubility of the ionizable compounds indomethacin and ketoconazole was affected by pH, the effect being more pronounced for indomethacin. For all drugs, time-dependent changes in solubilizing properties were observed without significant differences between both fed states. With respect to the media and drinks used, the solubility increased in the following order: buffer, FaSSIF, FeSSIF, administered drinks (except for indomethacin and ketoconazole which showed a decreased or increased solubility in FeSSIF, respectively). The most important increase in solubility in the commercial drinks as compared to the buffer was observed for danazol and ketoconazole, drugs with a relatively high logP value and lower aqueous solubility. In the fed state, time-dependent changes in solubilizing properties were observed for the poorly water soluble drugs, suggesting that the use of pooled <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> for solubility determination is questionable. This time-dependency also suggests important changes in dissolution depending on the arrival time in the duodenum, possibly creating an important source for variability in intestinal absorption under fed state conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the intestinal disposition of abiraterone acetate, an ester prodrug of the anticancer agent abiraterone. Stability of the prodrug and solubility and dissolution characteristics of both abiraterone and abiraterone acetate were monitored in vitro. Moreover, the in vivo intraluminal concentrations of abiraterone and abiraterone acetate upon intake of one tablet of 250 mg abiraterone acetate were assessed in healthy volunteers. The intestinal absorption resulting from the intraluminal behavior of the ester prodrug was determined using the rat in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling. Simulated and aspirated human <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> of the fasted state were used as solvent systems. Upon incubation of abiraterone acetate in human <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> in vitro, rapid hydrolysis of the prodrug was observed, generating abiraterone concentrations largely exceeding the apparent solubility of abiraterone, suggesting the existence of intestinal supersaturation. These findings were confirmed in vivo, by intraluminal sampling of duodenal fluids upon oral intake of an abiraterone acetate tablet by healthy volunteers. Rat in situ intestinal perfusion experiments performed with suspensions of abiraterone and abiraterone acetate in human <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> of the fasted state revealed significantly higher flux values upon perfusion with the prodrug than with abiraterone. Moreover, rat in situ intestinal perfusion with abiraterone acetate suspensions in simulated fluids of the fasted state in presence or absence of esterases demonstrated that increased hydrolytic activity of the perfusion medium was beneficial to the intestinal absorption of abiraterone. In conclusion, the rapid hydrolysis of abiraterone acetate in the intraluminal environment appears to result in fast and extensive generation of abiraterone supersaturation, creating a strong driving force for abiraterone absorption. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Investigating {{the risk}} {{on human health}} arising from {{exposure}} to As-polluted drinking water {{is a very important}} task since many area of the world has to face with this problem. Actually, chronic poisoning by arsenic carried by water has been well documented in many European and extra-European countries. Pollution of water with arsenic develops generalized symptoms of poisoning and carcinogenesis. It is well known that inorganic As is rapidly absorbed after oral exposure, but little information is still available about the fate of arsenic after oral ingestion. In particular, the mechanism which affects the speciation of this element in the gastrointestinal tract is not clear, especially when other trace elements are present. In this paper we present an estimate of the health risk due to the ingestion of water containing micro-pollutants, such as As and B, using two computational codes: PHREEQC, which allowed us to determine the effect of boron on arsenic speciation in equilibrium with the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract; SADA software for assessing the risk of exposure to contaminated matrices. The use of software in the present case study is mandatory since it is quite impossible to obtain experimental data. We focused on a sample area, the geothermal field of Larderello (Italy), where anomalous concentrations of arsenic and boron were found in the drinking water. The results obtained in this study prove that the risk to human health depends on the speciation of As, which is strictly related to the pH values reached at equilibrium with <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids.</b> The pH values change {{as a function of the}} concentration of boric acid in drinking water. In waters characterized by high contents of B, the risk factor is amplified by the increase of the species As 3 + in <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids.</b> Specifically, this study suggests that interactions between two elements in solution, such as boric acid and arsenic, both in solution in drinking water, can have a negative impact on human health when balanced with <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids,</b> since the effects of one may magnify the toxicity of the other...|$|R

The olfactory system was extremely sensitive to body fluids of sexually mature conspecifics: thresholds of detection were 1 : 10 (7. 4) (<b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid),</b> 1 : 10 (6. 1) (gametes), and 1 : 10 (4. 2) (urine). The olfactory system was also sensitive to amino acids with thresholds of detection from 10 (- 8. 1) M (L-leucine) to 10 (- 6. 1) M (L-phenylalanine). However, a range of other known fish odorants (steroids, bile acids, and prostaglandins) failed to evoke significant responses. Given the high olfactory sensitivity to <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid</b> and the low urine release rates of marine compared with freshwater fish, we suggest that chemical communication {{is likely to be}} mediated via compounds present in the <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid</b> rather than urine. Furthermore, the types of chemicals involved are likely to be different from those of freshwater fish. Their exact chemical identity and biological roles remain to be established...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{gastrointestinal}} stability of lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) was studied in different media. The size of LNCs was determined in simulated gastric and intestinal media. In updated fasted state simulated <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid</b> (FaSSIF-V 2) and updated fed state simulated <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid</b> (FeSSIF-V 2) media, the encapsulation ratio of paclitaxel-loaded LNCs was also measured. The size of LNCs was not modified after 3 h in simulated gastric fluid and simulated <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid</b> {{described by the}} United States Pharmacopeia, in FaSSIF, FaSSIF-V 2, and in FeSSIF. Moreover, {{in the presence of}} pancreatin in FeSSIF-V 2, a decreased above 30 % of the loading of paclitaxel was observed. This was attributed to the presence of lipase in pancreatin that could interact with Lipoid (a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine), present on the shell of LNC. As a conclusion, LNCs were stable on gastric medium and fasted state intestinal medium...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the diarrheogenic activity, gastrointestinal transit (GIT), and <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid</b> content and the possible role of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in gastrointestinal functions of endotoxin-treated mice. METHODS: Diarrheogic activity, GIT, and <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluid</b> content as well as nitric oxide and PGE 2 products were measured after intraperitoneal administration of LPS in mice. RESULTS: LPS dose-dependently accumulated abundant fluid into the small intestine, induced diarrhea, but decreased the GIT. Both nitric oxide and PGE 2 were found to increas...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Postoperative {{recurrence}} of Crohn's disease may {{be triggered by}} agents in the fecal stream. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine intestinal mucosal inflammation induced by contact with <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> in surgically excluded ileum. METHODS: The effects of infusion of intestinal luminal contents into excluded ileum in 3 patients with Crohn's disease who had undergone a curative ileocolonic resection with ileocolonic anastomosis and temporary protective proximal loop ileostomy were studied by histopathology and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Contact with <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> for 8 days induced focal infiltration of mononuclear cells, eosinophils, and polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria, small vessels, and epithelium in the excluded neoterminal ileum that was previously normal. Epithelial HLA-DR expression increased, and mononuclear cells expressed the KP- 1 antigen associated with activation. Marked up-regulation of RFD- 7, RFD- 9, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 was observed after infusion, reflecting epithelioid transformation and transendothelial lymphocyte recruitment. At the ultrastructural level, dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus occurred in epithelial cells, where also basally located transport vesicles were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal contents trigger postoperative {{recurrence of}} Crohn's disease in the terminal ileum proximal to the ileocolonic anastomosis in the first days after surgery. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Simulated <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> (SIFs) are {{described}} in the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) and the International Pharmacopoeia (IntPh) as recommended dissolution media for the characterization of solid drugs. This study was carried out to compare their wettability, properties. Six different model substrates were used as surrogates for solid drugs. These surrogate solid substrates were characterized by the Lifshitz-van der Waals, electron donor and electron acceptor terms, which are the three components of the total surface energy obtained by the van Oss model, which is based upon Young's equation. Contact angles of the SIFs on the surrogate solid-substrates were determined dynamically by image analysis up to five minutes after applying a drop of the fluid on the solid surface. Observed time-dependent spreading behavior was accounted for by a linear extrapolation of the experimental data to zero contact time to obtain the apparent equilibrium contact angle at zero time. Additionally, the pH, osmolality and buffer capacity of the SIFs were experimentally determined. Although some differences in osmolality and buffer capacity were observed, {{no statistically significant differences}} in the wetting properties of the three SIFs were detected. This confirms recent findings that there are no observed differences in dissolution behavior among these simulated <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids.</b> Harmonization of these SIFs is thus recommended...|$|R
40|$|Simulated <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> (SIFs) used {{to assay}} the {{solubility}} of orally administered drugs are typically {{based on a}} single bile salt; sodium taurocholate (STC). The {{aim of this study}} was to develop mimetic <b>intestinal</b> <b>fluids</b> with a closer similarity to physiological fluids than those reported to date by developing a mixed bile salt (MBS) system (STC, sodium glycodeoxycholate, sodium deoxycholate; 60 : 39 : 1) with different concentrations of lecithin, the preponderant intestinal phospholipid. Hydrocortisone and progesterone were used as model drugs to evaluate systematically the influence of SIF composition on solubility. Increasing total bile salt concentration from 0 to 30 mM increased hydrocortisone and progesterone solubility by 2 - and ∼ 25 -fold, respectively. Accordingly, higher solubilities were measured in the fed-state compared to the fasted-state SIFs. Progesterone showed the greatest increases in solubility in STC and MBS systems (2 - 7 -fold) compared to hydrocortisone (no significant change; P> 0. 05) as lecithin concentration was increased. Overall, MBS systems gave similar solubility profiles to STC. In conclusion, the addenda of MBS and lecithin were found to be secondary to the influence of BS concentration. These data provide a foundation for the design of more bio-similar media for pivotal decision-guiding assays in drug development and quality control settings...|$|R
