40|$|Long-term climate {{records from}} {{satellites}} are often constructed from the measurements of {{a sequence of}} instruments launched at different times. Each of these instruments is calibrated prior to launch. After launch they are subjected to potential offsets and slow drifts in calibration. We illustrate these issues {{in the construction of}} a merged total ozone record from two TOMS and three SBUV instruments. This record extends from late 1978 through the present. The question is "How good are these records?". We have examined the uncertainty in determining the relative calibration of two instruments during an overlap period in their measurements. When comparing a TOMS instrument, such as that on Nimbus 7, with an SBUV instrument, also on Nimbus 7, we find systematic differences and random differences. We have combined these findings with estimates of individual <b>instrument</b> <b>drift</b> into a monte- carlo uncertainty propagation model. We estimate an <b>instrument</b> <b>drift</b> uncertainty of a little larger than 1 percent per decade over the 25 -year history of the TOMS/SBUV measurements.

40|$|A central {{problem in}} the {{detection}} of long-term trends in the upper stratospheric ozone from orbiting remote sensors involves the separation of <b>instrument</b> <b>drifts</b> from true geophysical changes. Periodic flights of a Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet radiometer (SSBUV) on the Space Shuttle will allow the detection of drifts in optically identical sensors (SBUV/ 2) carried on operational satellites. A detailed simulation of the SSBUV and SBUV/ 2 datasets defines the accuracy that can be attained by the in-orbit calibration procedure. The repeatability of the SSBUV calibration from one flight to the next is the most critical variable in the analysis. A repeatability near + or - 1. 0 percent is essential for detection and correction of drifts in the SBUV/ 2 radiance measurements.
