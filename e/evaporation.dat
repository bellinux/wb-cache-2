5|$|Elsewhere, salt is {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the <b>evaporation</b> of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical <b>evaporation</b> of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of <b>evaporation.</b> More recently, the process is performed in pans under vacuum. The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of <b>evaporation</b> are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan <b>evaporation</b> combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|E

30|$|The morphologies {{of samples}} were {{characterized}} by a commercial SEM system (JEOL JCM- 5700, Tokyo, Japan). We used an X-ray diffraction system (PANanalytical, X`Pert-Pro MPD PW 3040 / 60 XRD with Cu-Kα 1 radiation, the Netherlands) to do material analysis. The dark and illuminated I-V measurements of the solar cells were done with the solar simulator (Oriel Newport, USA). Both <b>evaporations</b> were done in thermal vacuum <b>evaporations</b> system (SKY Vacuum Technology Company, China). The reflectance was measured by employing the fiber optic spectrometer (Ocean Optics, USB 4000) and the integration sphere (Ocean Optics, FOIS- 1). Silver NP area coverage was calculated by analyzing the SEM images via Photoshop CS 5 software.|$|R
25|$|Water is {{evaporated}} {{and separated}} from sea water through multi-stage flash distillation, {{which is a}} series of flash <b>evaporations.</b> Each subsequent flash process utilizes energy released from the condensation of the water vapor from the previous step and so on.|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} a {{detailed study of}} the time stability and reproducibility of sub-micron $Al/AlO_{x}/Al$ tunnel junctions, fabricated using standard double angle shadow <b>evaporations.</b> We have found that by aggressively cleaning the substrate before the <b>evaporations,</b> thus preventing any contamination of the junction, we obtained perfectly stable oxide barriers. We also present measurements on large ensembles of junctions which prove the reproducibility of the fabrication process. The measured tunnel resistance variance in large ensembles of identically fabricated junctions is {{in the range of}} only a few percents. Finally, we have studied the effect of different thermal treatments on the junction barrier. This is especially important for multiple step fabrication processes which imply annealing the junction.

5|$|This pumping {{project was}} {{designed}} to increase the surface area of the Great Salt Lake, and thus increase the rate of water <b>evaporation.</b> The pumps drove some of {{the water of the}} Great Salt Lake into the 320,000-acre (1300-square kilometer) Newfoundland <b>Evaporation</b> Basin in the desert west of the lake. A weir in the dike {{at the southern end of}} the Newfoundland Mountains regulated the level of water in the basin, and it sometimes returned salty water from the <b>evaporation</b> basin into the main body of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|If the solvent {{is water}} {{in either the}} <b>evaporation</b> or {{precipitation}} method of formation, {{in many cases the}} ionic crystal formed also includes water of crystallization, so the product is known as a hydrate, and can have very different chemical properties.|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{increasing}} the sugars concentration in dilute-acid ligno-cellulosic hydrolyzate to more than 100 g/l for industrial applications, the hydrolyzate from spruce was concentrated about threefold by high-pressure or vacuum <b>evaporations.</b> It was then fermented by repeated fed-batch cultivation using flocculating Saccharomyces cerevisiae with no prior detoxification. The sugars and inhibitors concentrations in the hydrolyzates were compared after the <b>evaporations</b> and also fermenta-tion. The <b>evaporations</b> were carried out either under vacuum (VEH) at 0. 5 bar and 80 °C or with 1. 3 bar pressure (HPEH) at 107. 5 °C, which resulted in 153. 3 and 164. 6 g/l total sugars, respectively. No sugar decomposition occurred during either of the <b>evaporations,</b> while more than 96 % of furfural {{and to a lesser}} extent formic and acetic acids disappeared from the hydrolyzates. However, HMF and levulinic acid remained in the hydrolyzates and were concentrated proportionally. The concentrated hydrolyzates were then fermented in a 4 l bioreactor with 12 - 22 g/l yeast and 0. 14 - 0. 22 h- 1 initial dilute rates (ID). More than 84 % of the fermentable sugars present in the VEH were fermented by fed-batch cultivation using 12 g/l yeast and initial dilution rate (ID) of 0. 22 h- 1, and resulted in 0. 40 ± 0. 01 g/g ethanol from the fermentable sugars in one cycle of fermentation. Fermentation of HPEH was as successful as VEH and resulted in more than 86 % of the sugar consumption under the corresponding conditions. By lowering the initial dilution rate to 0. 14 h- 1, more than 97 % of the total fermentable sugars were consumed, and ethanol yield was 0. 44 ± 0. 01 g/g in one cycle of fermentation. The yeast was able to convert or assimilate HMF, levulinic, acetic, and formic acids by 96, 30, 43, and 74 %, respectively...|$|R

5|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} tend {{to increase}} <b>evaporation</b> {{which can lead}} to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been {{an increase in the number}} of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and <b>evaporation</b> over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more <b>evaporation).</b> Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25percent).|$|E
5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global warming and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause <b>evaporation</b> and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by <b>evaporation</b> and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|It has {{interfered}} with the hydrological cycle by reducing <b>evaporation</b> and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a cooling effect that may have partially counteracted the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E

25|$|The {{lifetime}} of electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes {{depends on the}} <b>evaporations</b> rate and therefore on the core temperature of the capacitor. This core temperature {{on the other hand}} depends on the ripple current load. Using the 10-degree-rule with the capacitor case temperature gives a good approach to operational conditions.

5|$|The {{results of}} N-body {{simulations}} {{have shown that}} the stars can follow unusual paths through the cluster, often forming loops and often falling more directly toward the core than would a single star orbiting a central mass. In addition, due to interactions with other stars that result in an increase in velocity, some of the stars gain sufficient energy to escape the cluster. Over long periods of time this will result in a dissipation of the cluster, a process termed <b>evaporation.</b> The typical time scale for the <b>evaporation</b> of a globular cluster is 1010 years. In 2010 it became possible to directly compute, star by star, N-body simulations of a globular cluster over the course of its lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Actinium metal {{has been}} {{prepared}} by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300°C.

5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for <b>evaporation.</b> Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the <b>evaporation</b> process.|$|E

5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically {{have a high}} affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by <b>evaporation</b> or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol.
