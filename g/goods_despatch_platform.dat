Shortly after the exit of the line to Kusel, a siding from the municipal refinery warehouse, which was a large building, remained until the 1990s. Meanwhile, local freight transport has become less important.|$|R
60|$|At {{crossing}} of the Eger, Friedrich's Column had some chasing of poor D'Ahremberg; attempting to cut him off from his Bridges, Bridge of Koschlitz, Bridge of Budin; but he made <b>good</b> <b>despatch,</b> Browne and he; and, except a few prisoners of Ziethen's gathering, {{and most of his}} Magazines unburnt, they did him no damage. The chase was close enough; more than once, the Austrian head-quarter of to-night was that of the Prussians to-morrow. Monday, May 2d, Friedrich's Column was on the Weissenberg of Prag; Browne, D'Ahremberg, and Prince Karl, who is now come up to take command, having hastily filed through the City, leaving a fit garrison, the day before. Except his Magazines, nothing the least essential went wrong with Browne; but Konigseck, who had not a Friedrich on his heels,--Konigseck, trying more, as his opportunities were more,--was not quite so lucky.|$|R
50|$|On 8 November 1912, {{the council}} {{complained about the}} {{entrance}} building, the size of which, in their opinion, was no longer sufficient. Its deficiencies were mainly in the loading of luggage and goods. At this time, agriculture was still important to Metzingen. Farmers mainly loaded fruit, vegetables, wine, beef, pork and lumber. But even leather and iron <b>goods</b> were <b>despatched</b> at the station.|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that international trade transactions carry inherently more risk than domestic trade transactions, because {{of differences in}} culture, business processes, laws and regulations. It is therefore important for traders to ensure that payment is received for <b>goods</b> <b>despatched</b> and that the goods received and paid for comply with the contract of sale. One effective way of managing these risks has been for traders {{to rely on the}} letter of credit as a payment method. However for exporters in particular, the letter of credit has presented difficulties in meeting the compliance requirements necessary for the payment to be triggered. The current rules that govern letter of credit transactions (UCP 500) have been under review {{for the past three years}} and an updated set of rules (UCP 600) is expected to be introduced on 1 July 2007. This paper focuses on the changes mooted for 2007 and compares these main issues with the existing rules and other associated guidelines and regulations governing this method of payment. The conclusion is that the UCP 600 have not paid enough consideration to traders and service providers and are likely to engender an environment of uncertainty for exporters in particular...|$|R

60|$|There was {{no great}} harm in the Mother Agnes, only {{she was a}} maiden whom nothing but family {{difficulties}} could have forced into a monastic life--a lively, high-spirited, out-of-door creature, whom the close conventionalities of castle life and even whipping could not tame, and {{who had been the}} despair of her mother and of the discreet dames to whom her first childhood had been committed, to say nothing of a Lady Abbess or two.

50|$|The working goods yard at {{the station}} was {{a crucial part of}} a country station's {{existence}} and two surviving memos sent in 1874 to Bromley Cross refer to the delivery of cheese and tins of lard etc. to the local Co-op stores and also that <b>goods</b> <b>despatched</b> could have problems; 'all in this truck very wet when received here.'Plans were drawn up around 1891 for an extension to the warehouse, with new goods offices and other track and signalling works.Apart from the main station building, with waiting room built in, there was a 'waiting shed' recorded on both platforms in L&YR days. After the take over by the LMSR in 1923, plans were drawn up for improved General Waiting Rooms (GWRs) on both platforms, complete with internal stove heating. The free-standing timber GWR positioned along the platform from the main station building has its full specifications revealed in surviving design plans held on County Archives and its dimensions are given as approx 27ft in length by 10ft deep, which means it had approx 70 per cent of the length of the original building. It may have been at the time of adding this sizeable additional timber waiting room that the decision was taken to block off the central doorway on the main 1859 building. This originally led into a large waiting area and booking hall, complete with benches around the sides of the room and use of the second smaller internal wall clock face to aid timekeeping. After the change, this original waiting hall became the staff ticket office seen today, which swapped over from the end part of the building where the public now buy tickets. There is a boarded over rear corner fireplace just under the modern train time display screen, hence the chimney seen on the outside rear corner of the building. The GWR on the Manchester platform can be seen in late 1960s photos but must have been removed by around 1970 and by the 1980s a new waiting room extension in stone was added on {{to the end of the}} 1859 station building, in place of the gentlemen's lean-to toilets. A small waiting room provided in the station's central section was then closed and reserved for staff use (storage).There was also a detailed LMSR design plan for the proposed reconstruction of the LYR waiting shed into a GWR on the Blackburn platform, measuring approx 25ft by 7ft 6in, complete with a 'Princess May No. 1 Stove' and also several 'Littleton Lamps'. This GWR, if built, had become a small closed brick waiting shed as seen on a mid-1960s photo and by the 1970s this appeared to be replaced with the very basic open fronted brick shed that exists today, a reduction in facilities to what had been provided in LYR and LMSR days.There was a road level crossing {{at the station}} which closed in 1966/7, with the pedestrian crossing remaining. In the early 1970s, the former goods yard with its shed, to the north of the station, whose sidings were recovered in September 1967, was redeveloped as a housing estate.|$|R

50|$|There {{were about}} 24 crew aboard, {{consisting}} of the captain, two mates, a steward and stewardess, carpenter, boatswain, 18 engineers, stokers and sailors. The number of passengers was unclear. Several missed the ship's departure due to its late exit from Liverpool. One man had a fortunate escape when he spent too long drinking ashore with a friend and missed the ship's departure. He hurried on to Bristol via another steamer and travelled overland to Hayle {{to catch up with}} the Nile so that he could be reunited with his luggage, which was still aboard, but found on arriving that he had lost his luggage but saved his life. Another man arrived at the ship just as the bridge to the deck was being removed and offered a shilling to a porter to replace it, but was refused; he thus missed the departure and unknowingly escaped the shipwreck. The value of the Nile was estimated at around £40,000 to £50,000 (around £3.2 million to £4 million in 2013 prices) and was almost fully insured, but much of the cargo - mainly <b>goods</b> from Manchester <b>despatched</b> to drapers at Penzance, Truro and Falmouth - was uninsured and the consignees suffered heavy losses as a result of the sinking.|$|R
60|$|Aunt and niece went {{as soon as}} the mid-day {{meal was}} over to inquire for poor Mrs. White, and see what could be done. She was {{sleeping}} under an opiate, and Kalliope came down, pale as marble, but tearless. She knew nothing of her brother since she had given him his breakfast that morning. He had looked white and haggard, and had not slept, neither did he eat. She caught at the theory that had occurred to Miss Mohun, that he did not like to accuse Fergus, for even to her he had not mentioned who had removed the stone. In that case he might return at night. Yet it was possible {{that he did not know}} even now whence the stone had come, and it was certain that he had been at his office that morning, and opened the letter announcing his dismissal. Kalliope, going later, had found the like notice, but had had little time to dwell on it before she had been summoned home to her mother. Poor Mrs. White had been much shaken by the first reports of yesterday's accident, which had been so told to her as to alarm her for both her children; and when her little maid rushed in to say that 'the pelis was come after Mr. Alec,' it was no wonder that her terror threw her into a most alarming state, which made <b>good</b> Mrs. Lee <b>despatch</b> her husband to bring home Kalliope; and as the attack would not yield to the soothing of the women or to their domestic remedies, but became more and more delirious and convulsive, the nearest doctor was sent for, and Dr. Dagger, otherwise a higher flight than would have been attempted, was caught on his way and brought in to discover how serious her condition already was.|$|R
40|$|In Western Samoa, {{programmes}} {{for farmers}} are relayed from island to island by two telecommunications satellites. In Senegal, rural radio has been transmitting in seven languages {{for the last}} 20 years, while in the Central African Republic rural radio is just starting and in Djibouti, a project should begin soon. In Mauritania, an important rural radio project {{is coming to an}} end for lack of funds and in Burkina Faso, the decentralization of radio services is making progress despite some difficulties. With so many different circumstances, is it possible to find a common denominator for Rural Radio in ACP countries? Rural radio services, sensu stricto, that are decentralized, financially and technically self-sufficient, that transmit only for farmers in their own language and that provide for all their information and entertainment needs, are almost unheard of in ACP countries. One common problem is the lack of resources: both the material means to record and broadcast, as well as the logistic means to obtain information from the rural environment where enthusiastic reporters need and wish to work. In collaboration with CIERRO (Centre Interaficain d'etudes en radio rurale de Ougadougou) and GRET (Groupe de recherches et d'echanges technologiques) in Paris, CTA gathered rural broadcasters from 18 ACP countries in the capital city of Burkina Faso from May 15 to 18 1989. The aim of the workshop was to identify more clearly the constraints to radio broadcasting of scientific and technical information (STI) and at setting up a programme of action. According to the reports by the broadcasters during the workshop, people working in rural radio lack access to scientific and technical information despite all the meetings and reports that are published and that should be available. National documentation centres are inaccessible, communication with the national scientific and technical community is inefficient and specialized books and magazines are rare in the libraries. The main sources of scientific and technical information for rural radio are the rural areas. Frequently, broadcasters are left to work as best they can without assistance or encouragement; too often they are disregarded and, more seriously, they feel and become isolated. Those who still have the means to go to the field have at least the possibility of gathering firsthand information and knowledge from the farmers. But even if their audience is their chief source of information, rural radio broadcasters are eager for contact with the outside world. But here again they often meet with silence. At the workshop, the representatives of 18 countries unanimously indicated that, despite the existence of several international information services, their needs are far from being satisfied. Improved access to sources of information is in fact at the top of the list in the final resolutions. With limited access to the field, and cut off from the world of research, rural radio services are reduced to play one role: to act as a conveyor belt to transmit agricultural services to farmers. This task, on its own, seems insufficient to them. Reporters are ready to participate in campaigns to raise public awareness of major issues - environment, hygiene, training, etc - and even to contribute to the dissemination of technical information produced by agricultural services. Militant in the cause of the people they serve and that of development, they would like to be complete reporters, and to provide true, up-to-date, current and useful information. Refresher courses, to keep rural broadcasters up to date, would be very beneficial. Even though in one of the resolutions participants asked for radios to be provided more cheaply to farmers to improve their impact, reporters know that it is the content of their programmes that will attract listeners. However, to improve the content of their broadcasts, they have to break out of their isolation. This is why they have overwhelmingly requested to be kept in touch with current scientific, technical and economic progress in the world. They would like to receive in <b>good</b> time <b>despatches</b> on product prices and markets, weather forecasts and warnings about pests and to exchange their reports and their experience with colleagues in other countries. Among the important final resolutions, the participants asked for a system for the exchange of programmes between rural radio services to be set up. South-South and North-South, the information circuits on 'Field', 'Lab', 'Magnetic discs' end 'Hard Copy' should be multiplied and operate more freely. In industrial countries, journalism is the art of making choices. In developing countries, it is the art of making do. Before the meeting, CTA believed a need existed. It is now aware that this is a priority and will tackle it in collaboration with ail concerned by this problem.
