30|$|<b>The</b> <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{gelatinous}} layer (G-layer), often {{observed on}} microtome cross sections, {{has led some}} authors {{to believe that the}} G-layer cannot act as <b>the</b> driving force <b>of</b> longitudinal shrinkage in tension wood. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to observe <b>the</b> <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G-layer along fibers. Green wood blocks were cut transversely into two samples. One sample was kept in water and the other was oven-dried. With one face being common to both samples, <b>the</b> <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G-layer was studied on the same fibers. Observations were performed after blocking deformation by embedding. This revealed that <b>the</b> <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G-layer is an effect produced by <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> cutting <b>the</b> transverse face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood block to be embedded. At distances greater than 100 [*]µm from this primary surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample, no <b>detachment</b> was observed. Drying shrinkage shows little or no effect on this detachment. The result seems to explain well why <b>the</b> <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G-layer occurs during sectioning using conventional sliding microtomy. These observations prove <b>the</b> adhesion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G-layer in massive wood and confirm <b>the</b> active role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G-layer in tension wood properties.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Detachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{posterior}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lumbar vertebral ring apophysis {{has been}} reported by many authors, associated or not with disc prolapse, and has been ascribed to various mechanisms, although {{the relationship between the}} two pathologies remains unclear. METHODS: We studied 26 patients (17 males and 9 females; mean age, 34. 3 years) suffering from a lumbar disc herniation with nontraumatic <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring apophysis. Investigations included standard X ray, computed tomography (CT), tridimensional CT, and magnetic resonance imaging. Nineteen patients were operated on by microsurgical discectomy and removal of bone fragments. RESULTS: Clinical and neuroradiologic features of herniated disc associated with <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring apophysis have been recognized and have led to <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> posterior retroextramarginal disc herniations. A further classification is suggested, considering two morphological types that imply clinically distinctive features and a different surgical approach. In all operated cases, removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bone fragments was necessary and the results were good. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations led us to postulate a common mechanism in <b>the</b> pathogenesis <b>of</b> disc herniation with nontraumatic <b>detachment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring apophysis. They should be distinguished from other calcifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc because a proper surgical technique, including removal of apophyseal fragments, is required...|$|R
