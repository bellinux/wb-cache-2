50|$|DAQ cards often contain {{multiple}} components (multiplexer, ADC, DAC, TTL-IO, {{high speed}} timers, RAM). These are accessible via a bus by a microcontroller, which can run small programs. A controller is more flexible than a <b>hard</b> <b>wired</b> <b>logic,</b> yet cheaper than a CPU {{so that it}} is permissible to block it with simple polling loops. For example:Waiting for a trigger, starting the ADC, looking up the time, waiting for the ADC to finish, move value to RAM, switch multiplexer, get TTL input, let DAC proceed with voltage ramp.|$|R
40|$|The Landsat Spacecraft Project (formerly {{known as}} ERTS) was based {{essentially}} {{on the use}} of Nimbus spacecraft hardware. It was soon recognized that the availability of only 30 stored command locations (which were sufficient for the Nimbus mission) would limit the operation of the Landsat 1 mission with much higher power sensors, recorders, and wideband communications being cycled on and off throughout the orbit. The solution described is a simple memory with <b>hard</b> <b>wired</b> <b>logic,</b> of a design that can interface with the existing hardware, without modifications. The design was implemented using an existing APO (Advanced Onboard Processor) and a 4096 word X 18 bit plated wire memory.

[...] "It seems that he has finally {{figured out how to}} make all of those divergent elements come together and work seamlessly", wrote Spencer, recognizing the musical influences of past albums. He concluded: [...] "Improvised Electronic Device is the first album since <b>Hard</b> <b>Wired</b> in 1996 that could truly be considered a great Front Line Assembly release, and we can only hope that {{this is the beginning of}} a new trend." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} is {{that more than one}} open-collector output can be connected to a single line. If all outputs attached to the line are in the high-impedance state, the pull-up resistor will hold the wire in a high voltage (logic 1) state. If one or more device outputs are in the logic 0 (ground) state, they will sink current and pull the line voltage toward ground. This <b>wired</b> <b>logic</b> connection has several uses.|$|R
