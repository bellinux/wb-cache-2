40|$|DOI: [URL]   The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{correlate}} two specific kimono grip strength tests (KGST) with elbow flexors and extensors isokinetic parameters in Jiu Jitsu (JJ) athletes.  Fifteen male JJ athletes, from blue to black belt, participated in the study. The two KGST were: maximum static lift (MSL), and maximum number of repetitions (MNR), both gripping a kimono wrapped around a bar. Isokinetic tests consisted of three sets of  5 <b>s</b> <b>elbow</b> flexion-extension maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in three different elbow angles (45, 90 and 120 °), and two sets of five concentric-eccentric elbow flexion-extension maximum dynamic contractions at 60 °·s- 1, to determine peak torque (PT). Absolute values of MSL and MNR were 41. 4 ± 16. 2 s and 10 ± 5 reps, respectively, and tests presented a nearly perfect correlation among them (r= 0. 91; p< 0. 001). Significant correlations were reported between MNR and PT during MVIC for elbow flexors at 45 ° and 90 °, elbow extensors at 120 °, and during concentric and eccentric dynamic contractions for both flexors and extensors. Therefore, KGST were highly correlated with isokinetic parameters, and were nearly perfect correlated among them, supporting that one of the tests could be chosen to evaluate strength in JJ athletes. The MNR test presented apparently higher levels of relation than MSL, and provided significant information about muscle strength endurance in JJ athlete...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of six months of training with three different number of sets of resistance training on flexibility in young men. Forty-seven men (mean ± SD age = 24 ± 1 yrs; body mass = 79. 39 ± 9. 12 kg; height = 174. 5 ± 5. 6 cm) were randomly divided into three training groups performing either one set (G 1 S), three sets (G 3 S), or five sets (G 5 S) of all exercises in a resistance training session or a control group (CG). All groups were assessed pre- and post-training for Sit-and-Reach test and range of motion of 10 joints using goniometry. The training protocol included three weekly sessions and was composed of nine exercises performed at a moderate intensity (eight to 12 RM). The results demonstrated significant differences pre- to post-training for the Sit-and-Reach test for all training groups; however, only the G 5 S showed significant differences when compared to the CG (31. 04 ± 5. 94 cm vs. 23. 56 ± 6. 76 cm, respectively; p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Of the ten joint movements measured, there were range of motion increases only to shoulder flexion (G 1 S), shoulder extension (G 3 <b>S),</b> <b>elbow</b> flexion (G 3 S), and knee flexion (G 3 S) when comparing pre- to post-training (p 3 ̆c 0. 05).

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{following}} questions: (1) How precisely are movement properties matched for the two arms? (2) Is matching of movements of the two arms affected by visual information? (3) Are movements of one arm affected by kinesthetic information arising from the contralateral arm? (4) Does alteration in the motor performance of one arm affect movement performance in the other arm?;During experiments, subjects grasped a vertical rod attached to a horizontal manipulandum bar. The subject 2 ̆ 7 s shoulder was abducted to 90 deg. The manipulandum bar was pivoted above the subject 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>elbow.</b> Subjects made step-tracking flexion/extension movements about the elbow. Both simultaneously and independently made movements of the two arms, performed at the subject 2 ̆ 7 s own speed, were studied.;During simultaneous arm movements, movements of the two arms were initiated at the same times. The degree of matching of movement parameters was dependent on visual information. In the absence of visual information, these parameters were exactly matched in simultaneous movements of the two arms. When visual information was provided by displaying the position of right or left arm to the subject, {{the movements of the}} 2 ̆ 2 non-displayed 2 ̆ 2 arm were consistently of greater amplitudes and velocities than those of the 2 ̆ 2 displayed 2 ̆ 2 arm. The relation between movement peak velocity and amplitude was linear for each arm and was the same (matched) for both arms under all visual conditions. This matching was also seen for the independently made movements.;In some experiments the left arm was loaded. Loading altered the slope of the peak velocity-amplitude relation in movements of the left arm. Similar changes occurred in the velocity-amplitude relation of the right (non-loaded) arm.;To test interlimb responses to kinesthetic information, high frequency (120 Hz) mechanical vibration of muscle tendons was used to stimulate muscle spindles of the elbow movers. Vibration of the triceps muscle of one arm produced overshooting of the intended flexion end-position by the opposite arm.;It is concluded that the motor actions of the two arms are functionally linked. Matching of movements made by the two arms may reflect the operation of a common motor program which can be modified by visual and kinesthetic information...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: Muscle {{weakness}} often complicates critical {{illness and}} {{is associated with}} increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and limiting functional outcome even years later. To assess the presence of muscle weakness and {{to examine the effects}} of interventions, objective and reliable muscle strength measurements are required. The first objective of this study is to determine interobserver reliability of handheld dynamometry. Secondary objectives are to quantify muscle weakness, to evaluate distribution of muscle weakness, and to evaluate gender-related differences in muscle strength. DESIGN:: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING:: The surgical and medical intensive care units of a large, tertiary referral, university hospital. PATIENTS:: A cross-sectional, randomly selected sample of awake and cooperative critically ill patients. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Handheld dynamometry was performed in critically ill patients who had at least a score of 3 (movement against gravity) on the Medical Research Council scale. Three upper limb and three lower limb muscle groups were tested at the right-hand side. Patients were tested twice daily by two independent raters. Fifty-one test-retests were performed in 39 critically ill patients. Handheld dynamometry demonstrated good interobserver agreement with intraclass correlation coefficients > 0. 90 in four of the muscle groups tested (range, 0. 91 - 0. 96) and somewhat less for hip flexion (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0. 80) and ankle dorsiflexion (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0. 76). Limb muscle strength was considerably reduced in all muscle groups as shown by the median z-score (range, - 1. 08 to - 3. 48 <b>sd</b> units). <b>Elbow</b> flexors, knee extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors were the most affected muscle groups. Loss of muscle strength was comparable between men and women. CONCLUSIONS:: Handheld dynamometry is a tool with a very good interobserver reliability to assess limb muscle strength in awake and cooperative critically ill patients. Future studies should focus on the sensitivity of handheld dynamometry in longitudinal studies to evaluate predictive values toward patients' functional outcome. status: publishe...|$|R

However, very few studies have directly compared the two stimulation techniques for assessing VA of the elbow flexors. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare TMS and motor point stimulation for assessing VA in non-fatigued and fatigued elbow flexors. Participants performed a fatigue protocol that included twelve, 15 <b>s</b> isometric <b>elbow</b> flexor contractions. Participants completed a set of isometric elbow flexion contractions at 100, 75, 50, and 25 % of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) prior to and following fatigue contractions 3, 6, 9, and 12 and 5 and 10 min post-fatigue. Force and EMG of the bicep and triceps brachii were measured for each contraction. Force responses to TMS and motor point stimulation and EMG responses to TMS (motor evoked potentials, MEPs) and Erb's point stimulation (maximal M-waves, Mmax) were also recorded. VA was estimated using the equation: VA% = (1 −SITforce/PTforce) × 100. The resting twitch was measured directly for motor point stimulation and estimated for both motor point stimulation and TMS by extrapolation of the linear regression between the superimposed twitch force and voluntary force. MVC force, potentiated twitch force and VA significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased throughout the elbow flexor fatigue protocol and partially recovered 10 min post fatigue. VA was significantly (p < 0. 05) underestimated when using TMS compared to motor point stimulation in non-fatigued and fatigued elbow flexors. Motor point stimulation compared to TMS superimposed twitch forces were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher at 50 % MVC but similar at 75 and 100 % MVC. The linear relationship between TMS superimposed twitch force and voluntary force significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased with fatigue. There was no change in triceps/biceps electromyography, biceps/triceps MEP amplitudes, or bicep MEP amplitudes throughout the fatigue protocol at 100 % MVC. In conclusion, motor point stimulation as opposed to TMS led to a higher estimation of VA in non-fatigued and fatigued elbow flexors. The decreased linear relationship between TMS superimposed twitch force and voluntary force led to an underestimation of the estimated resting twitch force and thus, a reduced VA...|$|R

Using DHM and simulations of static movements, investigators analyzed predictions of joint moment and joint force effects on virtual operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> right wrist, <b>elbow</b> and shoulder and compared them to different body dimensions and work postures. This study exemplifies the ease of estimating upper extremity loads on equipment operators using virtual operators and computer models of equipment and work environment. As expected, comparing results of percentage of joint force and moment reduction using the electronic control and of the mechanical control showed that the electronic control had lower joint forces and joint moments over the mechanical control. The average predicted value of the joint moment on the wrist was 1. 84 Nm, elbow 7. 85 Nm and shoulder 14. 55 Nm and of the joint force on the wrist was 5. 06 N, elbow 4. 56 N, and shoulder 3. 67 N. Because the data illustrates low-level forces to move a joystick, inadvertent actuation of the control is addressed. Regardless of the findings, research {{is still needed on}} joysticks in real world situations such as an epidemiological assessment of equipment operators in the field before final recommendations and conclusions can be drawn...|$|R
