5|$|The Mansion of Happiness was {{considered}} the first mass-produced board game in the United States for almost 100 years. In 1886, George S. Parker purchased some of Ives' inventory from Henry P.

5|$|During its {{brief time}} in operation, the Pony Express {{delivered}} approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. Although the Pony Express {{proved that the}} central/northern mail route was viable, Russell, Majors and Waddell {{did not get the}} contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southern Congressionally favored Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', Ben Holladay, acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 November 1991, just over 24 hours after issuing that statement, Mercury {{died at the age}} of 45 at his home in Kensington. The {{official}} cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS. Mercury's close friend, Dave Clark of The Dave Clark Five, <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bedside vigil when he died. Austin phoned Mercury's parents and sister to break the news of his death, which reached newspaper and television crews by the early hours of 25 November.|$|E
5|$|The first {{fighting}} between US troops and Yavapai came in early 1837, when the Tolkepaya joined with their Quechan neighbors {{to defend against}} Major Samuel Heintzelman over a Quechan ferry crossing on the Colorado River. The Quechan used the ferry to transport settlers over the river, into California. After they killed a group led by John Glanton, who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> crossing, the US government retaliated by burning the fields of the Quechans, and {{taking control of the}} crossing.|$|E
5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric {{is said to have}} done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E

5|$|By 1071, Robert, {{together}} with his brother Roger, <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert's daughter Helena. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War on 4 August 1914, Palace had three players called up as Reservists before the season started. Former Palace players Ginger Williams and Joe Bulcock were amongst those killed in the conflict. In March 1915, The Admiralty, who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Palace and its grounds {{at the start of the}} war, ordered the club to leave. Palace chose to move to Herne Hill Stadium, but the 1918–19 season found Palace at a new ground. Croydon Common failed to return to business after the war, and it was to their ground, The Nest opposite Selhurst Station, that Crystal Palace now moved. Palace finished the season without a win in the last nine games, ending in seventh place, building on that position to finish third the following year.|$|E
5|$|Hill and his {{brothers}} <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> management of their father's school in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was {{on the principle that}} the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E

5|$|In 1872, {{some time}} after they <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sikhs' territory, the British {{developed}} the mine further. They found the mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the mine was poor, {{and there was no}} storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the mine was over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the entrances and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, media {{coverage}} focused on the achievements of the Buffalo Bulls. Buffalo had been one of the least-successful programs in college football from their transition to Division I-A in 1999 to 2006, during which they had a cumulative record of 12–79. In 2008, the Bulls had their first winning season since 1996, won five games in a row for the first time since 1986, beat a ranked team for the first time in program history with their upset victory over Ball State in the MAC Championship Game, and would be making the first bowl appearance in school history. The turnaround of the Buffalo program brought acclaim to Bulls head coach Turner Gill, who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> team in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series in 1999, Doug Naylor has been {{attempting}} to make a feature-length version of the show. A final draft of the script was written, by Naylor, and flyers began circulating around certain websites. The flyer was genuine and had been distributed by Winchester Films to market the film overseas. Plot details were included as part of the teaser. It was set in the distant future where Homo sapienoids - a race of cyborgs— <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> solar system and were wiping out the human race. Spaceships that tried to escape Earth were hunted down until only one remained... Red Dwarf.|$|E

5|$|The MSC Railway {{was able}} to receive and {{despatch}} goods trains to and from all the UK's main line railway systems, using connecting junctions at three points in the terminal docks. Two were {{to the north of}} the canal, operated by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the London and North Western Railway. The third was to the south, operated by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), where by the MSC Railway <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> old and abandoned route of the CLC, giving them a monopoly on traffic to the new soap works and steel mill.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{became the}} District line of London Transport. From 23 October 1933 a Piccadilly line service {{replaced}} the Harrow to Uxbridge District shuttle. In 1923 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> L railway's outer circle service from Earl's Court {{and by the}} Second World War this had been cut back to an electrified Earl's Court to Willesden Junction shuttle. Following bombing of the West London Line in 1940 the LMS and the Metropolitan line services to Addison Road were both suspended. After the war, to serve the Kensington exhibition halls a District line shuttle service started from Earl's Court to Addison Road, now renamed Kensington Olympia.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and his men}} {{rested in}} Texas for several months before {{returning}} to Missouri. Although he learned that Union General Egbert B. Brown had devoted significant attention to the border area, Anderson led raids in Cooper and Johnson County, Missouri, robbing local residents. On June 12, Anderson and 50 of his men engaged 15 members of the Missouri State Militia, killing and robbing 12. After the attack, one of Anderson's guerrillas scalped a dead militiaman. The next day, in Southeast Jackson County, Anderson's group ambushed a wagon train carrying members of the Union 1st Northeast Missouri Cavalry, killing nine. The attacks prompted the Kansas City Daily Journal of Commerce to declare that rebels <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> area. Anderson and his men dressed as Union soldiers, wearing uniforms taken from those they killed. In response, Union militias developed hand signals to verify that approaching men in Union uniforms were not guerrillas. The guerrillas, however, quickly learned the signals, and local citizens became wary of Union troops, fearing that they were disguised guerrillas.|$|E

5|$|At the League's Fourth Conference in May 1888, {{factional}} divisions {{became increasingly}} apparent between Morris' anti-parliamentary socialists, the parliamentary socialists, and the anarchists; the Bloomsbury Branch were expelled for supporting parliamentary action. Under {{the leadership of}} Charles Mowbray, the League's anarchist wing were growing and called on the League to embrace violent action in trying to overthrow the capitalist system. By autumn 1889 the anarchists <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> League's executive committee and Morris was stripped of the editorship of Commonweal in favour of the anarchist Frank Kitz. This alienated Morris from the League, which had also become a financial burden for him; he had been subsidising its activities with £500 a year, a very large sum of money at the time. By the autumn of 1890, Morris left the Socialist League, with his Hammersmith branch seceding to become the independent Hammersmith Socialist Society in November 1890.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{brought his}} {{opposition}} to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos {{in his first two}} months in office. The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust—Gould <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons. After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.|$|E
5|$|During {{the wars}} of the Diadochi that {{followed}} the death of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy, who had seized control of Egypt, <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> island of Cyprus and {{used it as a}} base of operations against his rival Antigonus I Monophthalmus. From Cyprus, Ptolemy's forces were able to raid the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor. In early 306 BC, Antigonus resolved to remove this threat, and ordered his son, Demetrius, to capture the island. Demetrius at the time was in Greece, where he had in the previous year overthrown the garrison installed in Athens by the ruler of Macedon, Cassander. The city, along with neighbouring Megara, was restored to democratic rule, and allied itself with Demetrius. As a result, when Demetrius sailed from Athens in spring 306 to capture Cyprus, he was accompanied by 30 Athenian quadriremes.|$|E
