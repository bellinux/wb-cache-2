5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars.</b> The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E

All of the stores attacked were speciality stores and were usually only robbed of a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars.</b> He is also suspected of shooting three more store clerks in Texas during 1993 and 1994, one of whom survived.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, Dee Dee {{teamed up}} with Paul Kostabi, leader of the {{hardcore}} punk band Youth Gone Mad and former guitarist for White Zombie. An established artist, Kostabi was instrumental in getting Dee Dee's new career as a painter off the ground. Together with Barbara, the trio collaborated on several hundred works that sold quickly for a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> each. In 2012, the tenth anniversary of Dee Dee's death was observed by a show at a prominent art gallery in California.|$|E

In the police report that TSG uncovered, Frey was held at a police station for no more than five hours before posting a bond of a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> for some minor offenses. The arresting officer, according to TSG, recalled Frey as having been polite and cooperative.|$|E

Both had striker tips on their sleeves. When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head would light the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars.</b> Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family's garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs. Harris purchased more propane tanks {{on the morning of}} the attack.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the Big Three could enjoy profit margins of $10,000 per SUV, while losing a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> on a compact car. Consequently, these {{companies}} focused resources and design on SUVs over small cars (compact cars were sold mainly to attract young buyers with inexpensive options {{and to increase}} their fleet average fuel economies to meet federal standards). As {{a result of the}} shift in the Big Three's strategy, many long-running compact and midsize cars like the Ford Taurus, Buick Century, and Pontiac Grand Prix eventually fell behind their Japanese competition in features and image (relying more upon fleet sales instead of retail and/or heavy incentive discounts), some eventually being discontinued.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{traveling}} over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing to a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing {{one to make}} the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the Midwest and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 per person for food and other items. Families planned the trip months in advance and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between $150–$200 per person. As the trail matured, additional costs for ferries and toll roads were thought to have been about $30 per wagon.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Ting {{announced}} {{his support for}} a $100 million property tax-break for large corporations in San Francisco's Mid-Market District. Just a few months later, he used his position as Chairman of the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee to deny a vote on a popular tax-break for veterans organizations despite it costing only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> thousand <b>dollars.</b> The tax-break was killed due to Ting's actions drawing the anger of veteran organizations.|$|R

500|$|The highest {{price paid}} at auction for a Thoroughbred {{was set in}} 2006 at $16,000,000 for a two-year-old colt named The Green Monkey. [...] Record prices at auction often grab headlines, though they do not {{necessarily}} reflect the animal's future success; in the case of The Green Monkey, injuries limited him to only three career starts before being retired to stud in 2008, and he never won a race. Conversely, even a highly successful Thoroughbred may be sold by the pound for a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> to become horsemeat. The best-known example of this was the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, exported to Japan to stand at stud, but was ultimately slaughtered in 2002, presumably for pet food.|$|E

His parents were Quakers. He was the {{youngest}} of three brothers and was a [...] "mixture of Scottish, Irish, English and German" [...] descent. The firstborn, Roscoe Jr., lived only a few hours. Lacey Van Buren was four years old and Dewey Roscoe was two years old when Murrow was born. His home was a log cabin without electricity or plumbing, on a farm bringing in only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> a year from corn and hay.|$|E
2500|$|Understanding {{the problem}} in 2003, Colin Powell remarked that there was [...] "no threat more serious to aviation" [...] than the missiles, {{which can be used}} to shoot down {{helicopters}} and commercial airliners, and are sold illegally for as little as a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars.</b> The U.S. has led a global effort to dismantle these weapons, with over 30,000 voluntarily destroyed since 2003, but probably hundreds of thousands are still in the hands of insurgents, especially in Iraq, where they were looted from the military arsenals of the former dictator Saddam Hussein, and in Afghanistan as well. In August 2010, a report by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) confirmed that [...] "only a handful" [...] of illicit MANPADS were recovered from national resistance caches in Iraq in 2009, according to media reports and interviews with military sources.|$|E
50|$|With {{the goals}} of Postmodernism in giving a fuller, more sociological and pluralistic account of history, {{academic}} art has been brought back into history books and discussion. Nevertheless, since the early 1990s, academic art has experienced a limited resurgence through the Classical Realist atelier movement. Still, the art is gaining a broader appreciation by the public at large, and whereas academic paintings once would only fetch a <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> of <b>dollars</b> in auctions, some now fetch millions.|$|R

5000|$|According to the California Attorney General, {{the measure}} would [...] "increase annual state costs ranging from a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> {{thousand}} <b>dollars</b> to over $1 million to regulate the labeling of genetically engineered foods". It would also incur [...] "Potential, but likely not significant, costs {{to state and local}} governments due to litigation resulting from possible violations of the requirements of this measure. Some of these costs would be supported by court filing fees that the parties involved in each legal case would be required to pay under existing law." ...|$|R
2500|$|Personal {{luxury cars}} are mass-produced, not coach built, and {{typically}} share {{all of their}} chassis, power train and all other major mechanical components with high volume sedans to reduce production costs, {{and to ensure that}} their per unit profitability is extremely high; to both the manufacturer and the selling dealer. [...] Typically, the per unit profit of the sale of a new personal luxury vehicle is measured in thousands of dollars to both the manufacturer and the dealer, while the sale of a new compact or intermediate sedan yields only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> in profit per unit. [...] However, they have additional styling elements and sometimes [...] "baroque" [...] designs. They are typically equipped with as many additional features as possible, including power accessories such as windows, locks, seats, antenna, as well as special trim packages, leather upholstery, and heated seats.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the purest}} Coasian {{solutions}} {{today is the}} new phenomenon of Internet crowdfunding. Here rules are enforced by computer algorithms and legal contracts {{as well as social}} pressure. [...] For example, on the Kickstarter site, each funder authorizes a credit card purchase to buy a new product or receive other promised benefits, but no money changes hands until the funding goal is met. [...] Because automation and the Internet so reduce the transaction costs for pooling resources, project goals of only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> are frequently crowdfunded, far below the costs of soliciting traditional investors. [...] Other crowdfunded projects have raised over a million dollars, like the Arkyd-100 space satellite telescope funded on Kickstarter in June 2013. [...] It {{would seem to be a}} clear instance of a Coase solution when a public good that always required government sponsorship in the 20th century can be efficiently organized from 18,000 individuals' self-interest (including rewards such as an orbital [...] "selfie", and five minutes of observation time donated in their name to find potential killer asteroids).|$|E
2500|$|Early in the Global War on Terror, Fontes {{served at}} US Central Command J5 {{overseeing}} issues of political-military cooperation in Afghanistan. In June 2004, she {{was moved to}} Combined Forces Command - Afghanistan headquarters in Kabul and served under David Barno {{as the head of}} the CJ5 staff for political-military coordination. Her staff was responsible for keeping General Barno [...] "on message", overseeing the policies impacting military operations, and performing liaison work with both the Afghan Ministry of Defense and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. At the end of her first year in Afghanistan and following Karl Eikenberry's assumption of command from Barno, Fontes volunteered to lead the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Tarinkot. Daniel Green, the political adviser for the PRT, reported that though some Soldiers at the PRT had initial concerns due to her gender, those worries were shortly put to rest. She had been active in engaging with the Afghan people. Green said that Fontes, then a Lieutenant Colonel, pitched in a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> of her own money to host a lunch on the PRT for local Afghan leaders. An article in Vanity Fair relates a story that she once refused to depart a meeting with Afghan elders in Chora District under threat of small arms fire, for fear of appearing weak in the face of the Taliban. Green asserts that in early 2006, she survived the first suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack in Urozgan Province due in part to the device's failure to detonate all of the mortar shells of which it was comprised. She departed Afghanistan in May 2006 to attend the US War College, graduating in 2007. She had been promoted that year to colonel. She was subsequently assigned as the chief of the American Security Assistance Office in Pakistan.|$|E

5000|$|Sales of {{bicalutamide}} (as Casodex) worldwide {{peaked at}} US$1.3 billion in 2007, {{and it has}} been described as a [...] "billion-dollar-a-year" [...] drug prior to losing its patent protection starting in 2007. In 2014, despite the introduction of abiraterone acetate in 2011 and enzalutamide in 2012, bicalutamide was still the most commonly prescribed drug in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Moreover, in spite of being off-patent, bicalutamide was said to still generate a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> million <b>dollars</b> in sales per year for AstraZeneca.

40|$|The {{creation}} of a cricket batsman robot {{is part of a}} larger research project within collaborative robotic behaviour. The ultimate goals are complete robot cricket teams working and playing together in a simplified form of cricket. The demands of such robotic units are not only the limitation in resource availability but also the need of being simple, robust and easy to duplicate. It is a journey into the world of microcontrollers, where mechanics, electronics and software come together forming a miniature robotic cricket player. Presented with a basic circuit for microcontroller programming, a plastic gearbox from Taima and a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollar</b> budget the voyage starts.
