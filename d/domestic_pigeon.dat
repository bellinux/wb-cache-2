500|$|Common {{starlings}} may be kept as pets or as laboratory animals.

They adapt well to captivity, and thrive on a diet of standard bird feed and mealworms. Several birds may be kept in the same cage, and their inquisitiveness makes them easy to train or study. The only disadvantages are their messy and indiscriminate defecation habits {{and the need to}} take precautions against diseases that may be transmitted to humans.

2500|$|In culinary terminology, squab {{is a young}} <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeon,</b> {{typically}} under {{four weeks}} old, or its meat. The meat is widely described as tasting like dark chicken. The term is probably of Scandinavian origin; the Swedish word skvabb means [...] "loose, fat flesh". It formerly applied to all dove and pigeon species, such as the wood pigeon, the mourning dove, the extinct-in-the-wild socorro dove, and the now-extinct passenger pigeon, and their meat. More recently, squab meat comes almost entirely from domesticated pigeons. The meat of dove and pigeon gamebirds hunted primarily for sport is rarely called squab.|$|E

60|$|The {{cause of}} widely {{different}} sounds being uttered under different emotions and sensations {{is a very}} obscure subject. Nor does the rule always hold good {{that there is any}} marked difference. For instance with the dog, the bark of anger and that of joy do not differ much, though they can be distinguished. It is not probable that any precise explanation of the cause or source of each particular sound, under different states of the mind, will ever be given. We now that some animals, after being domesticated, have acquired the habit of uttering sounds which were not natural to them.[1] Thus domestic dogs, and even tamed jackals, have learnt to bark, which is a noise not proper to any species of the genus, {{with the exception of the}} Canis latrans of North America, which is said to bark. Some breeds, also, of the <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeon</b> have learnt to coo in a new and quite peculiar manner.|$|E

60|$|One {{spring day}} an immense number of doves {{appeared}} {{and settled in}} the plantation.

This dove was a resident with us all the year round, but occasionally in spring and autumn they were to be seen travelling in immense flocks, and these were evidently strangers in the land and came from some sub-tropical country in the north where they had no fear of the human form. At all events, on going out into the plantation I found them all about on the ground, diligently searching for seeds, and so tame and heedless of my presence that I actually attempted to capture them with my hands. But they wouldn't be caught: the bird when I stooped and put out my hands slipped away, and flying a yard or two would settle down {{in front of me and}} go on looking for and picking up invisible seeds.|$|E

60|$|We {{can clearly}} {{understand}} why a species when once lost should never reappear, {{even if the}} very same conditions of life, organic and inorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one species might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to fill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their distinct progenitors. For instance, it is just possible, if our fantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by striving during long ages for the same object, might make a new breed hardly distinguishable from our present fantail; but if the parent rock-pigeon were also destroyed, and in nature we {{have every reason to}} believe that the parent-form will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved offspring, it is quite incredible that a fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even from the other well-established races of the <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeon,</b> for the newly-formed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic differences.|$|E

60|$|As far as I can {{discover}} {{there are few}} large groups of birds {{in which all the}} species have both sexes alike and brilliantly coloured, but I hear from Mr. Sclater, that this appears to be the case with the Musophagae or plantain-eaters. Nor do I believe that any large group exists in which the sexes of all the species are widely dissimilar in colour: Mr. Wallace informs me that the chatterers of S. America (Cotingidae) offer one of the best instances; but with some of the species, in which the male has a splendid red breast, the female exhibits some red on her breast; and the females of other species shew traces of the green and other colours of the males. Nevertheless we have a near approach to close sexual similarity or dissimilarity throughout several groups: and this, from what has just been said of the fluctuating nature of inheritance, is a somewhat surprising circumstance. But that the same laws should largely prevail with allied animals is not surprising. The domestic fowl has produced a great number of breeds and sub-breeds, and in these the sexes generally differ in plumage; so that it has been noticed as an unusual circumstance when in certain sub-breeds they resemble each other. On the other hand, the <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeon</b> has likewise produced a vast number of distinct breeds and sub-breeds, and in these, with rare exceptions, the two sexes are identically alike.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} free-living <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons</b> (Columba livia) as a reservoir of arboviruses {{in the city of}} Belém, state of Pará, Brazil. We investigated the presence of antibodies against the most prevalent arboviruses. OBJECTIVES This study was aimed at evaluating some clinical and physical parameters of <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons,</b> including the presence of antibodies to Amazon-endemic arboviruses. METHODS Eighty-five healthy pigeons were captured in Mangal das Garças Park, in Belém, and were bled. Upon capture, the birds were subjected to a clinical examination in search of alterations that could indicate the presence of arboviruses. Blood samples were converted to serum and tested using the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) technique with a panel of 19 antigens of arboviruses circulating in the Amazon. The confirmation assay for the positive reactions to the viral species tested by HI was a neutralisation test in new-born Swiss albino mice (Mus musculus) [mouse neutralisation test (MNT) ]. FINDINGS A total of 10 (11. 8 %) serum samples tested positive for antiflavivirus antibodies by HI. All the samples positive for the HI test were subjected to MNT for detection of viruses and yielded negative results (logarithmic neutralisation index < 1. 7). MAIN CONCLUSION The results represent the first serological detection of antiarbovirus antibodies in <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons</b> as potential hosts of arboviruses in Brazil. The detection of haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against genus Flavivirus indicated that there was recent contact between the analysed <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons</b> and these arboviruses. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of free-living pigeons in the maintenance cycle and spread of arboviruses in the Amazon...|$|R

The present investigation was concentrated on the prevalence of H. columbae and rate of parasitemia in <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons</b> in southwest of Iran. Pigeons regimented in three groups, {{less than six months}} old, between six and twenty four months old and more than twenty four months old. Then stained blood smears were studied for presence of H. columbae and finally rate of parasitemia in every group calculated. Mature and immature stages of H. columbae gametocytes were found in 24 % of blood smears prepared from 100 healthy <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons.</b> Mean of parasitemia in infected pigeons was 9. 58 %. Mean size of macrogametocytes was 4 μm× 15 μm and mean size of microgametocytes was 3 μm× 12 μm. Mean of parasitemia in infected females was more than males and pipers. Mean of parasitemia in infected old pigeons (pigeons with more than twenty four months old) was more than pigeons with less than six months old and pigeons between six and twenty four months old. This study show the prevalence and rate of parasitemia in <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeons</b> in southwest of Iran.

60|$|Before {{discussing}} {{the means and}} steps by which the chief races have been formed, it will be advisable to give some historical details, for more is known {{of the history of}} the pigeon, little though this is, than of any other domesticated animal. Some of the cases are interesting as proving how long domestic varieties may be propagated with exactly the same or nearly the same characters; and other cases are still more interesting as showing how slowly but steadily races have been greatly modified during successive generations. In the last chapter I stated that Trumpeters and Laughers, both so remarkable for their voices, seem to have been perfectly characterised in 1735; and Laughers were apparently known in India before the year 1600. Spots in 1676, and Nuns in the time of Aldrovandi, before 1600, were coloured exactly as they now are. Common Tumblers and Ground Tumblers displayed in India, before the year 1600, the same extraordinary peculiarities of flight as at the present day, for they are well described in the 'Ayeen Akbery.' These breeds may all have existed for a much longer period; we know only that they were perfectly characterised at the dates above given. The AVERAGE length of life of the <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeon</b> is probably about five or six years; if so, some of these races have retained their character perfectly for at least forty or fifty generations.|$|E
60|$|It {{is no real}} {{objection}} {{to the truth of}} the statement, that the fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions to the rule. For instance, mastodons and elephants, when arranged by Dr. Falconer in two series, first according to their mutual affinities and then according to their periods of existence, do not accord in arrangement. The species extreme in character are not the oldest, or the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in character, intermediate in age. But supposing for an instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first appearance and disappearance of the species was perfect, {{we have no reason to}} believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time: a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts. To compare small things with great: if the principal living and extinct races of the <b>domestic</b> <b>pigeon</b> were arranged as well as they could be in serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of their production, and still less with the order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon now lives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series in this same respect.|$|E
