When the two policies are both implemented simultaneously, the LNG <b>import</b> <b>volume</b> of LI is more than twice the LT’s trading volume.

40|$|The risk of {{non-indigenous}} plant pests {{entering the}} UK via {{international trade in}} fresh produce is increasing. The objective {{of this article is}} to identify existing and emerging supply sources for UK fresh produce importers and examine the extent to which they could provide invasion pathways. We tested the hypothesis that increased imports of fresh produce from new sources outside the European Union could increase the risks of non-indigenous insect pests. We use a bio-economic model approach in which the number of species arrivals is a function of the <b>volume</b> of <b>imports,</b> whereas the <b>volume</b> of <b>imports</b> itself is a function of gross domestic product, relative import prices and seasonality. The study has identified clear trends, which show <b>import</b> <b>volumes</b> of fresh produce and species detections increasing from new supply sources. If this trend continues in the future, then the UK inspection agency should expect to confront species from new suppliers in much greater numbers, given that <b>import</b> <b>volumes</b> of fresh produce are income elastic.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of Taiwan’s import changes and the underlying factors of the decreasing Swedish export to Taiwan between 1994 and 2005. The empirical study includes 36 countries from both the Pacific Rim and OECD. Based on a modified gravity model of trade, the regression model aims to examine how GDP growth in the exporting country, exchange rate changes, common language, and membership in APEC affect Taiwan’s <b>import</b> <b>volume.</b> The result shows estimates with expected signs, with 49. 8 percent of the vari-ance in Taiwan’s changed <b>import</b> <b>volume</b> explained by the exogenous variables. Exchange rate change and language are statistically significant. Data on commodity groups of importance for Sweden and Taiwan are also ex-amined, and they show that Taiwan has changed its import demand and has started to import goods other than those Sweden in previous years strongly exported to Taiwan. Taiwan’s regional trading partners have also gained export shares {{at the expense of}} Swedish exports. The results are in line with theory and it will be hard for Sweden in the future to compete with the increasing regional trade of East Asia where common lan-guage and culture are of big importance...|$|R

Empirical applications to international cross section and time-series comparisons of trade policy confirm our theoretical results: Trade-weighted average tariffs generally underestimate the true height of tariffs as measured by the trade-volume-equivalent index; this in turn always underestimates the welfare-equivalent index...|$|R
