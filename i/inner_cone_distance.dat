30|$|From Fig.  7, {{it can be}} seen that: {{when the}} radius of {{gyration}} r <  40  mm, per revolution-specific rock-breaking work decreases with the increase of <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> angle; when <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> angle increases form 10 ° to 40 °, per revolution-specific rock-breaking work decreases from 7.45 to 1.44  J/m 3 in {{the central part of the}} bit, and the drop rate reached to 80  %; when the radius of gyration r >  40  mm, the change of per revolution-specific rock-breaking work of different <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> angles is not obvious. This shows that, it is beneficial to reduce rock-breaking energy consumption and improve rock-breaking effect by increasing <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> angle.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> is not solid, {{but has a}} slot {{cut through}} the center to form another section of waveguide.

As the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> rotates, the total signal length changes, more at the wide end than the narrow. When sent to the antenna, this causes the wavefront to scan across the area between the two horizontal plates, [...] "snapping" [...] to the initial position when the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> rotates back to the original point.|$|R
30|$|Generally, PDC bit’s crown shape {{consists}} of <b>inner</b> <b>cone,</b> cone apex, and outer <b>cone.</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>cone</b> takes {{effect on the}} stability and guiding of the bit; cone apex is the part which penetrates into the formation first, {{the design of the}} structure is related to the formation characteristics, the length of outer cone is determined by cutter density, and the outer cone affects the wear of the bit (Kerr 1988; Cerkovnik 1982). This paper analyzes the relation of <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> angle and outer cone arc radius to per revolution-specific rock-breaking work, and lays the foundation for the optimization design of PDC drill bit’s crown shape.|$|R

2500|$|The welder {{can adjust}} the {{oxy-acetylene}} flame to be carbonizing (aka reducing), neutral, or oxidizing. Adjustment {{is made by}} adding more or less oxygen to the acetylene flame. The neutral flame is the flame most generally used when welding or cutting. The welder uses the neutral flame {{as the starting point}} for all other flame adjustments because it is so easily defined. This flame is attained when welders, as they slowly open the oxygen valve on the torch body, first see only two flame zones. At that point, the acetylene is being completely burned in the welding oxygen and surrounding air. The flame is chemically neutral. The two parts of this flame are the light blue <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> and the darker blue to colorless outer <b>cone.</b> The <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> is where the acetylene and the oxygen combine. The tip of this <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> is the hottest part of the flame. It is approximately [...] and provides enough heat to easily melt steel. In the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> the acetylene breaks down and partly burns to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which in the outer cone combine with more oxygen from the surrounding air and burn.|$|R

40|$|A methane-air {{premixed}} flame {{with and}} equivalence ratio of 1. 25 was simulated {{with a model}} including 91 pairs of elementary reactions occurring among 29 species. In this second part, the flame structures {{at the base of}} the flame and at <b>inner</b> and outer <b>cone</b> tips are discussed. Around the burner rim, the entrainment of air from the surroundings is seen to be the main reason for the activation of chemical reactions by promoting large production of O atoms and OH radicals. As a consequence, the rate of heat release there is very large, allowing the flame temperature to increase steeply and the flame to be held on the burner. At the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> tip, also, chemical reactions proceed with large rates, due to flame stretch and to preferential diffusion of H 2. H 2 is consumed there, so that the fuel burning at the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> tip is composed of a mixture of CH 4 +H 2. CH 3 radicals remain above the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> tip and, around the tip of the outer cone, oxidation via C 1 route leads to formation of CO, which is oxidized into CO 2, as in any other point of the outer cone. H 2, however, is formed by reduction of water above the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> tip. This H 2 formation continues even within and above the outer cone tip, so that respect to H 2 the outer cone is found to have no tip...|$|R

Chosen LIF excitation strategies minimize the temperature dependent partition function variation for CH 2 O, and maintain CH signal strength while eliminating Rayleigh scattering background. The formaldehyde structure appears inside CH in the <b>inner</b> flame <b>cone</b> for moderately fuel rich stoichiometries typical of appliance flames. CH LIF becomes too weak to distinguish from background at richer stoichiometries (Phi= 2. 7).

For the soft formation, whether the channel is unobstructed should be considered firstly.

As for the hard formation, the wear of the cutters should be considered. So, a smaller value of the outer cone arc radius and a larger value of the <b>inner</b> <b>cone</b> angel are suggested to choose {{in order to reduce the}} rock-breaking energy consumption in the cone apex area.|$|R

In this first work, {{the structure of a}} representative transversal section of the flame is presented and the mechanisms of combustion at the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>cones</b> are discussed in detail. CH_ 4 and O_ 2 in the mixture both react with H atoms, but the reaction between CH_ 4 and H occurs preferentially to that between O_ 2 and H at the fuel side of the <b>inner</b> <b>cone.</b> This results in a lack of oxygen atoms at the position where CH_ 4 breaks into CH_ 3 radicals and the reactions belonging to the C_ 2 route proceed with higher velocities than those belonging to the C_ 1 route.
