40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the way that}} different agents, organisations and institutions intervene in the cinema practice of South America. Using Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru as case studies, the thesis outlines the way state and institutional organisations, commercial bodies, international interests and alternative practices have converged, even with individual discrepancies, to develop a national and regional cinematic culture {{at the beginning of}} the twenty-first century. Practices from funding and production through to distribution and exhibition are investigated in order to provide an overview of the most significant factors shaping the way cinematic culture currently operates in the region. I argue that on the one hand, state-run initiatives (heritage drives, film councils, cinematecas, anti-piracy enforcement) attempt to reterritorialize cinema practice and create a national context for films. On the other hand, commercial bodies, international organisations and alternative practices frequently complicate or deterritorialize cinematic culture. Their various actions have an effect on the types of films that are circulated and disseminated amongst publics on the continent and in the global sphere. The complex relations between these <b>intervening</b> <b>interests</b> mean that cinematic culture is determined by various conflicting ownership claims. Furthermore, the way in which which some organisations and practices gain strength over others determines the type of access that local publics have to films and that which filmmakers have to audiences. The findings in this thesis are drawn from extensive field-work in the region and are supported by theoretical frameworks and paradigms that are relevant to the study of cinematic culture. I have made use of published literature from text books, press articles, and official websites documenting various aspects of cinematic culture in South America to literature documenting a global film context that has relevance to my field of study. Participant-observation techniques and interviews with practitioners in the region have provided me with grounded, primary-research material, while trade reports citing statistical evidence such as production figures, box office data and investments in funding have strengthened my findings. ...|$|R

Using original data to test the Stafford and Warr model, five key findings emerge. First, both personal and vicarious avoidance experiences relate positively to offending.

Third, the combination of low per-sonal and vicarious punishment avoidance strongly dissuades offending. Fourth, prior offending conditions the influence of punishment and avoidance experiences {{in a manner consistent with}} Stafford and Warr. Fifth, while impulsive individuals are influenced primarily by their own experiences, individuals who are not as impulsive tend to attend more to the experiences of others.

This study offers the first UK investigation into how the news media are framing the current debate around the harms of SHS exposure to children in cars and what role they may be playing in presenting ideas about the need for further smoke-free laws to protect children. Methods: Qualitative content analysis was conducted on six UK and three Scottish national newspapers between 1 st Jan 2004 to 31 st Dec 2013. Findings: Exposure to SHS was increasingly identified as being harmful to the health of children, with cars being described as one of the main places of exposure for children following the smoke-free laws. Legislative action was deemed necessary, as well as enforceable, and growing public support highlighted a change in public attitudes towards smoking and willingness for further legislation on SHS to protect children. There were a wide range of advocates in comparison to a narrow number of critics. Conclusions: Over a decade there was increased reporting on the harms of SHS exposure to children while traveling in cars. This may indicate that there is growing public and policy appetite for further smoke-free legislation to protect children. Previous private vehicle laws suggest that further smoke-free legislation could be successful. Advocates would do well to consider whether there are current opportunities for playing a greater role in the wider debate surrounding the harms of SHS exposure to children in cars...|$|R

In the case where country fundamentals are strong, intervention while reducing short positions in equity markets actually increases short positions in the money market and induces higher interest rates.

40|$|The thesis {{evaluates the}} {{importance}} of the Kemalist movement to the Republic of Turkey both during its earlytwentieth-century establishment and today, as Turkey pursues its overall goal, modernization, and its more specific goal, membership in the European Union. The thesis assesses Kemalism's original effect on the state-building process before and after the War of Independence; its continuing effect on Turkey's modernization process; and its potential to effect Turkey's acceptance into the European Union. The thesis argues that the Kemalist social and political ideology is still the best choice for Turkey and thus must be revitalized. Despite the many <b>intervening</b> powers <b>interested</b> in the Ottoman territories {{after the collapse of the}} Ottoman Empire, Turkey, the so-called "sick man of Europe," emerged as a newly established republic. Led by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey adopted Western norms to create a new society and nation-state. Kemalism, an essentially continuous, systematic process of national renovation, modernization, and renewal, has one overriding goal: to raise Turkish society, politics, education, and institutions to the level of Western civilizations. To accomplish this, Turkey's nongovernment organizations must act, in keeping with Kemalism, to turn the country into "one big school. " The military, as designated by the constitution, is the "protector" of Kemalism and has the power, under certain conditions, to intervene in the political arena. In Kemalism, the dominant religion, Islam, is a private matter, a matter of one's "conscience.

The results of the negotiation process were approved at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), in the form of a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). This paper analyzes the climate policy of 24 states or groups of states. In order to structure the interests in the climate issue area, the theorem of the 'environmental policy interest triangle' is here referred to: environmental policy agents are described in relation to the environmental pollution process and an interest distribution pattern is thus obtained. This relation of interests between agents comprises the conflictive originator or polluter and affected interests as well as the <b>intervening</b> helper <b>interests.</b> In a theoretical discussion, typical contents will first be allocated to all three interests in order to determine the presence and influence of these interests and of other factors on the climate policy of the states under investigation as revealed by the INC discussions. The other variables influencing climate policy, i. e. structural (capability of action) and specific (political, economic, constitutional etc.) variables, are also included in the analysis. Based on such a structuring of interests within and above all between the states, proposals will be made to build up an effective and dynamic climate regime, capable of consensus, and the foreseeable limits of climate protection policy will be defined against the background of results from other negotiation processes and environmental protection agreements.

Regulatory decisions are reconstructed along semi-structured interviews with Commission officials from different DGs and hierarchical levels conducted 2006 - 2009. In both cases the Commission went beyond mere market-efficiency and changed the quality of the financial market by favouring disadvantaged societal groups in its regulatory proposals. Our process analyses suggest that there is a scope for a regulatory equality enhancing policy which depends on pro-active agents within the Commission, the possibility to frame regulatory beneficiaries as market participants, and the re-distribution of rights instead of resources...|$|R

50|$|The work of John Snow {{is notable}} {{for helping to}} make the {{connection}} between cholera and typhoid epidemics and contaminated water sources, which contributed to the eventual demise of miasma theory. During the cholera epidemic of 1854, Snow traced high mortality rates among the citizens of Soho to a water pump in Broad Street. Snow convinced the local government to remove the pump handle, {{which resulted in a}} marked decrease in cases of cholera in the area. In 1857, Snow submitted a paper to the British Medical Journal which attributed high numbers of cholera cases to water sources that were contaminated with human waste. Snow used statistical data to show that citizens who received their water from upstream sources were considerably less likely to develop cholera than those who received their water from downstream sources. Though his research supported his hypothesis that contaminated water, not foul air, was the source of choleraepidemics, a review committee concluded that Snow’s findings were not significant enough to warrant change, and they were summarily dismissed. Additionally, other <b>interests</b> <b>intervened</b> in the process of reform. Many water companies and civic authorities pumped water directly from contaminated sources such as the Thames to public wells, and the idea of changing sources or implementing filtration techniques was an unattractive economic prospect. In the face of such economic interests, reform was slow to be adopted.|$|R
40|$|Background: Media content {{has been}} shown to {{influence}} public understandings of second-hand smoke. Since 2007 there has been legislation prohibiting smoking in all enclosed public places throughout the United Kingdom (UK). In the <b>intervening</b> period, <b>interest</b> has grown in considering other policy interventions to further reduce the harms of second-hand smoke exposure. This study offers the first investigation into how the UK newsprint media are framing the current policy debate about the need for smoke-free laws to protect children from the harms of second-hand smoke exposure whilst in vehicles. Methods: Qualitative content analysis was conducted on relevant articles from six UK and three Scottish national newspapers. Articles published between 1 st January 2004 and 16 th February 2014 were identified using the electronic database Nexis UK. A total of 116 articles were eligible for detailed coding and analysis that focused on the harms of second-hand smoke exposure to children in vehicles. Results: Comparing the period of 2004 ? 2007 and 2008 ? 2014 there has been an approximately ten-fold {{increase in the number of}} articles reporting on the harms to children of second-hand smoke exposure in vehicles. Legislative action to prohibit smoking in vehicles carrying children was largely reported as necessary, enforceable and presented as having public support. It was commonly reported that whilst people were aware of the general harms associated with second-hand smoke, drivers were not sufficiently aware of how harmful smoking around children in the confined space of the vehicle could be. Conclusions: The increased news reporting on the harms of second-hand smoke exposure to children in vehicles and recent policy debates indicate that scientific and public interest in this issue has grown over the past decade. Further, advocacy efforts might draw greater attention to the success of public-space smoke-free legislation which has promoted a change in attitudes, behaviours and social norms. Efforts might also specifically highlight the particular issue of children?s developmental vulnerability to second-hand smoke exposure, the dangers posed by smoking in confined spaces such as vehicles, and the appropriate measures that should be taken to reduce the risk of harm...|$|R

At times the message was tightly managed, and at others that control was loosened. As various <b>interests</b> <b>intervened</b> and encroached, new discourses developed and struggled for influence. Contained within the messages around the park and its wildlife were ulterior strands and ideologies that impacted in various ways on the idea of the national park. Nationalism, race, gender, class and status all became constituent parts of a heterogeneous construction. My thesis interrogates those strands within the discourse on the Kruger National Park. In 1967 the Manyeleti game reserve, on the western borders of the Kruger Park, {{became the first}} segregated game reserve for the exclusive use of black South Africans. Through this parallel project African visitors, who had been generally ignored in the Kruger Park setting, became the focus of propaganda efforts intended for a black audience. Race, gender, and class merged with the environmental messages in this unique setting to create new directions in conservationist rhetoric. My thesis sets these diverse messages communicated at Manyeleti alongside those transmitted through and about the Kruger Park. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{successes of}} HIV {{treatment}} scale-up {{and the availability}} of new prevention tools have raised hopes that the epidemic can finally be controlled and ended. Reduction in HIV incidence and control of the epidemic requires high testing rates at population levels, followed by linkage to treatment or prevention. As effective linkage strategies are identified, it becomes important to understand how these strategies work. We use qualitative data from The Linkages Study, a recent community intervention trial of community-based testing with linkage interventions in sub-Saharan Africa, to show how lay counsellor home HIV testing and counselling (home HTC) with follow-up support leads to linkage to clinic-based HIV treatment and medical male circumcision services. Methods: We conducted 99 semi-structured individual interviews with study participants and three focus groups with 16 lay counsellors in Kabwohe, Sheema District, Uganda. The participant sample included both HIV+ men and women (N= 47) and HIV-uncircumcised men (N= 52). Interview and focus group audio-recordings were translated and transcribed. Each transcript was summarized. The summaries were analyzed inductively to identify emergent themes. Thematic concepts were grouped to develop general constructs and framing propositional statements. Results: Trial participants expressed interest in linking to clinic-based services at testing, but faced obstacles that eroded their initial enthusiasm. Follow-up support by lay counsellors <b>intervened</b> to restore <b>interest</b> and inspire action. Together, home HTC and follow-up support improved morale, created a desire to reciprocate, and provided reassurance that services were trustworthy. In different ways, these functions built links to the health service system. They worked to strengthen individuals’ general sense of capability, while making the idea of accessing services more manageable and familiar, thus reducing linkage barriers. Conclusions: Home HTC with follow-up support leads to linkage by building “social bridges,” interpersonal connections established and developed through repeated face-to-face contact between counsellors and prospective users of HIV treatment and male circumcision services. Social bridges link communities to the service system, inspiring individuals to overcome obstacles and access care...|$|R
40|$|Since {{about the}} mid- 19602 ̆ 7 s {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in diffusion research among consumer researchers, especially that focused on innovations. Most consumer researchers have considered time of adoption as directly related to innovativeness as a personality trait. However, Midgley and Dowling (1978) suggested communication and complex situational effects intervene in the individual 2 ̆ 7 s innovativeness, and concluded that it was meaningless to ascribe any meaning to empirical correlations without {{a model of the}} processes intervening between trait innovativeness and innovative behavior. ^ The {{purpose of the study was}} to construct an operational model of innovativeness and compare it to the Midgley and Dowling (1978) hypothetical model. Four hypotheses were formulated for the present study. ^ One hundred and sixty nine Lafayette area residents contacted by means of a mailed survey served as subjects for the study. ^ LISREL analysis was used to test the hypotheses of the study. The results suggested that: (1) there was no significant direct relationship between trait innovativeness and innovative behavior as predicted; (2) there was a significant indirect relationship between trait innovativeness and innovative behavior; (3) the significant intervening variables between trait innovativeness and innovative behavior were interest in product category, media exposure, and word of mouth; and (4) the sequence of <b>intervening</b> variables was <b>interest</b> in product category, media exposure, and word of mouth. ^ The present investigation supports the theory which implies that innovative behavior as evidenced by the adoption of new products by an individual is exhibited through a process rather than as a direct effect of trait innovativeness. A model which includes intervening variables might help to provide a better means of prediction of innovative behavior. Therefore, it might be more desirable to consider intervening variables as a part of a multi-stage process in innovativeness research. Even though intervening variables were important for the process of innovativeness, most of the variables, except interest in product category, did not show significant effects on innovative behavior at the. 05 probability level. ...|$|R
