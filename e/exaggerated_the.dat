5|$|The {{numbers of}} troops that Xerxes mustered {{for the second}} {{invasion}} of Greece {{have been the subject}} of endless dispute. Most modern scholars reject as unrealistic the figures of 2.5 million given by Herodotus and other ancient sources because the victors likely miscalculated or <b>exaggerated.</b> <b>The</b> topic has been hotly debated, but the consensus revolves around the figure of 200,000.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the fortifications in 1942. Almost a million French workers were drafted to build it. The wall was frequently mentioned in Nazi propaganda, where its size and strength were usually <b>exaggerated.</b> <b>The</b> fortifications included colossal coastal guns, batteries, mortars, and artillery, and thousands of German troops were stationed in its defences. When the Allies eventually invaded the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours. Today, ruins of the wall exist in all of the nations where it was built, although many structures have fallen into the ocean or have been demolished over the years.|$|E

Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or <b>exaggerated</b> <b>the</b> threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.|$|E

King Faisal observed the battle unfold from the village of al-Hamah, and as it became apparent that the Syrians had been routed, he and his cabinet, with the exception of Interior Minister 'Ala al-Din al-Durubi, who had quietly secured a deal with the French, departed for al-Kiswah, a town located at the southern approaches of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|This {{letter was}} one of several that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo. Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army had invaded Texas, the Alamo was surrounded, and the Texians needed more men and {{ammunition}} to wage a successful defense. No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective, and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government. Most of the delegates believed that Travis <b>exaggerated</b> <b>the</b> difficulties he faced.|$|E

Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Ang Lee was selected as director, both due to his work in the 1993 film The Wedding Banquet and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.|$|E

5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided {{to skip the}} {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his left elbow and a stress fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia.

5|$|After {{the assault}} on his deputies, El Paso County Sheriff M.F.

Waite, a 67-year-old Populist, dispatched 300 troops to the area on March 18 under the command of Adjutant General T.J. Tarsney. Tarsney found the area tense but quiet. Union president Calderwood assured him that union members would cooperate with his operations, even surrendering for arrest if requested. Convinced that Bowers had <b>exaggerated</b> <b>the</b> extent of the chaos in the region, Tarsney recommended the withdrawal of troops; Waite concurred. The state militia left Cripple Creek on March 20.|$|E
5|$|Lejoille's {{published}} {{account of}} the action greatly <b>exaggerated</b> <b>the</b> scale of his success, and, although he was highly praised in the French press, he was castigated in Britain for his conduct. Thompson, Berry {{and most of the}} British officers were exchanged and acquitted at court martial, and the captains were knighted for their services, while Leander and many of the crew were recaptured in March 1799 by a Russian squadron that seized Corfu, and returned to British control by order of Tsar Paul. Généreux survived another year in the Mediterranean, but was eventually captured off Malta in 1800 by a British squadron under Lord Nelson.|$|E

5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} {{demonstrated by the}} election of their candidate the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, his Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment {{for those who did}} not comply. Public anger at the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James and fears of an Irish invasion. These factors <b>exaggerated</b> <b>the</b> Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief {{of the invasion}} force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly <b>exaggerated.</b> (<b>The</b> chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{image of}} the dodo is of a very fat and clumsy bird, but this view may be <b>exaggerated.</b> <b>The</b> general opinion of scientists today is that many old European depictions were based on overfed captive birds or crudely stuffed specimens. It has also been suggested that the images might show dodos with puffed feathers, as part of display behaviour. The Dutch painter Roelant Savery was the most prolific and influential illustrator of the dodo, having made at least ten depictions, often showing it in the lower corners. A famous painting of his from 1626, now called Edwards's Dodo as it was once owned by the ornithologist George Edwards, has since become the standard image of a dodo. It is housed in the Natural History Museum, London. The image shows a particularly fat bird and is the source for many other dodo illustrations.|$|E

5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts tried the technique and found that it helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and <b>exaggerated</b> <b>the</b> body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{with the}} finds from the {{salvaged}} Mary Rose itself have {{provided an opportunity}} to compare {{the accuracy of the}} records provided in the Roll. The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly <b>exaggerated.</b> <b>The</b> heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the orlop deck, just about the waterline, would not have been feasible {{because of the lack of}} an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the Mary Rose has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Expensive and {{elaborate}} ornamentation {{was an important}} part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of Kronan, but according to common practice it was most lavish on the transom, the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of Kronan shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of Vasa, a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally <b>exaggerated</b> <b>the</b> size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows Kronan as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.|$|E

5|$|The American press <b>exaggerated</b> <b>the</b> {{encounter}} between Irene and the American ships, which prompted Diederichs {{to decide to}} send Irene away from the area to deflate tensions between the two countries. After returning to Manila and debarking the non-combatants, Irene was ordered to depart the Philippines. Irene relieved Arcona in Kiaochou, which was in turn ordered to steam to the Caroline and Mariana Islands to observe the American capture of Guam. Irene coaled in Mariveles before departing for Kiaochou on 9 July. While in Kiaochou, Irene conducted crew training. She returned to Manila in November, but remained there only briefly, before she was replaced by Kaiserin Augusta. Irene returned to Germany after 1901; in 1903 she went into drydock at the Imperial Shipyard in Wilhelmshaven for modernization, which was completed by 1905. She was stricken on 17 February 1914 and used as a submarine tender, based in Kiel. In 1916, she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven. She remained there until 26 November 1921, when she was sold for scrapping for 909,000Marks. She was broken up the following year in Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
5|$|This {{reinforcement}} of the aristocracy {{must be seen}} {{in conjunction with the}} war in France, as must the emerging sense of national identity. Just as the war with Scotland had done, the fear of a French invasion helped strengthen a sense of national unity, and nationalise the aristocracy that had been largely Anglo-Norman since the Norman conquest. Since the time of Edward I, popular myth suggested that the French planned to extinguish the English language, and as his grandfather had done, Edward III made the most of this scare. As a result, the English language experienced a strong revival; in 1362, a Statute of Pleading ordered the English language to be used in law courts, and the year after, Parliament was for the first time opened in English. At the same time, the vernacular saw a revival as a literary language, through the works of William Langland, John Gower and especially The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. Yet the extent of this Anglicisation must not be <b>exaggerated.</b> <b>The</b> statute of 1362 was in fact written in the French language and had little immediate effect, and parliament was opened in that language as late as 1377. The Order of the Garter, though a distinctly English institution, included also foreign members such as John IV, Duke of Brittany and Sir Robert of Namur. Edward III – himself bilingual – viewed himself as legitimate king of both England and France, and could not show preferential treatment for one part of his domains over another.|$|E
