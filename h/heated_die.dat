Heat sealing is used for many applications, including heat seal connectors, thermally activated adhesives and film or foil sealing.Common applications for the heat sealing process: Heat seal connectors are used to join LCDs to PCBs in many consumer electronics, as well as in medical and telecommunication devices. Heat sealing of products with thermal adhesives is used to hold clear display screens onto consumer electronic products and for other sealed thermo-plastic assemblies or devices where heat staking or ultrasonic welding is not an option due to part design requirements or other assembly considerations. Heat sealing also is used in the manufacturing of bloodtest film and filter media for the blood, virus and many other test strip devices used in the medical field today. Laminate foils and films often are heat sealed over the top of thermoplastic medical trays, Microtiter (microwell) plates, bottles and containers to seal and/or prevent contamination for medical test devices, sample collection trays and containers used for food products. Medical and the Food Industries manufacturing Bag or flexible containers use heat sealing for either perimeter welding of the plastic material of the bags and/or for sealing ports and tubes into the bags.A variety of heat sealers are available to join thermoplastic materials such as plastic films: Hot bar sealer, Impulse sealer, etc.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{fabricating}} composite structures at a low-cost, moderate-to-high production rate is disclosed. A first {{embodiment of the}} method includes employing a continuous press forming fabrication process. A second embodiment of the method includes employing a pultrusion process for obtaining composite structures. The methods include coating yarns with matrix material, weaving the yarn into fabric to produce a continuous fabric supply, and feeding multiple layers of net-shaped fabrics having optimally oriented fibers into a debulking tool to form an undebulked preform. The continuous press forming fabrication process includes partially debulking the preform, cutting the partially debulked preform, and debulking the partially debulked preform to form a netshape. An electron-beam or similar technique then cures the structure. The pultrusion fabric process includes feeding the undebulked preform into a <b>heated</b> <b>die</b> and gradually debulking the undebulked preform. The undebulked preform in the <b>heated</b> <b>die</b> changes dimension until a desired cross-sectional dimension is achieved. This process further includes obtaining a net-shaped infiltrated uncured preform, cutting the uncured preform to a desired length, and electron-beam curing (or similar technique) the uncured preform. These fabrication methods produce superior structures formed at higher production rates, resulting in lower cost and high structural performance...|$|E
40|$|Hot {{stamping}} of quenchenable ultra {{high strength}} steels currently represents a promising forming {{technology for the}} manufacturing of safety and crash relevant parts. For some applications, such as B-pillars which may undergo impact loading, it may be desirable to create regions of the part with softer and more ductile microstructure. In the article, a laboratory-scale hot stamped U-channel was produced with segmented die, which was heated by cartridge heaters and cooled by chilled water recirculation independently. It can be concluded {{that in order to}} satisfy tailored mechanical properties by introducing regions, which have an increased elongation for improved energy absorption, the minimum die temperature should be no less than 450 C. Optical micrographs were used to verify the microstructure of the as-quenched phases with respect to the <b>heated</b> <b>die</b> temperatures. For the cooled die region, the microstructure was predominantly martensite for all the die temperatures interested. With the increase of <b>heated</b> <b>die</b> temperature, there was a decrease of Vickers hardness in the heated region due to the increasing volume fractions of bainite. The finite element (FE) model was developed to capture the overall hardness trends that were observed in the experiments.

40|$|The {{pultrusion}} {{process is}} well-known as a versatile, cost-effective composites manufacturing process, and {{the utilization of}} photocure techniques with the pultrusion process offers an area for additional development. Photoinitiated resins offer the potential for increased process efficiency {{because they are not}} limited by the rate of heat transfer from the <b>heated</b> <b>die</b> to the resin. However, the use of photoinitiated resins with the pultru-sion process is complicated by the need to reach a level of cure as the fiber/resin mass moves through the en-closed pultrusion die. Reaching a proper level of cure while inside the die is necessary since the pressure de-veloped within the die influences the consolidation of the fiber/resin mass. However, the closed pultrusion die makes it difficult to expose the photoinitiated resin to UV energy as it travels through the pultrusion die...|$|E

The more conventional processes involve hand lay-up, vacuum bagging, autoclaving or oven curing techniques such that lengths of structural elements produced are limited by the lengths of autoclaves or curing ovens. Several types of developmental structural elements are described in which fiberglass, aramid, graphite, and hybrid fiber systems have been used as reinforcements in an epoxy matrix and their flexural properties compared. Reinforcement fibers having tailor-made orientations which achieve tailor-made strength in the pultrusions are described.

40|$|Pultrusion is a {{composite}} manufacturing process in which fibers are pulled continuously through a resin bath for resin impregnation before entering into a <b>heated</b> <b>die,</b> where an exothermic cure reaction occurs. The energy needed to provide the cure reaction depends on many aspects such as cure kinetics and pulling speed. Generally, the pultrusion forming is divided in heat zones that can be heated at different temperature levels. The temperature distribution on the die surface can greatly affect material quality and energy cost. In the present work, through a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) algorithm, {{it was possible to}} verify that the energy requirements can be reduced by changing the heating configuration of the pultrusion die. For this, an alternative configuration with internal heaters inside the die body was simulated. The heating rate was considered as the objective function.

40|$|Pultrusion is an emerging, {{economical}} {{manufacturing process}} for composite structures. In a pultrusion system, the composite tapes and fabrics are loaded onto a creel, and {{the materials are}} fed into a preform (or shaper), along with any fillers that may be needed. If the fiber is not yet preimpregnated with resin, it is run through a resin bath or resin is injected into the die the material is about to enter. The composite is pulled through the <b>heated</b> <b>die</b> and then cut from the system to produce either a fully or partially cured product. This handleable part is then placed in an autoclave for final cure.

Destructive testing, such as shear testing of small sections, is the normal method for assessing {{the quality of the}} pultrusion manufacturing product.

40|$|Variously {{known as}} "Bent {{pultrusion}}", " 3 D pultrusion", or "Post-Die Manipulation", {{this is a}} method of pultrusion where the cure process takes place outside the die. This results in very low pulling forces {{and the ability to}} manipulate the shape of the pultrudate during formation. In the normal pultrusion process continuous thermoset resin coated fibres are pulled through a long <b>heated</b> <b>die.</b> Since the resin is cured within the die the pulling force required could be significant, consequently current process machines are large and expensive. The finished pultrudate is also limited to continuous straight profiles of constant cross-section. In the feasibility study work described in this paper, the process of curing relies primarily on irradiating the resin-coated fibres with ultraviolet (UV) light, as the profile exits the die. The die therefore, is only required to impart a profile, and strip excess resin from the fibre/resin bundle. The pulling force is thus very much reduced lowering the capital cost of the plant. The pultrudate can be manipulated after it exits the die and before the resin matrix has fully cured to produce a product with controlled variation in curvature. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

25|$|There {{are a few}} {{disadvantages}} to this process, most {{stemming from}} the workpiece being {{in contact with the}} dies for such an extended period of time. The operation is a time-consuming process due to the amount and length of steps. The workpiece will cool faster because the dies are in contact with workpiece; the dies facilitate drastically more heat transfer than the surrounding atmosphere. As the workpiece cools it becomes stronger and less ductile, which may induce cracking if deformation continues. Therefore, <b>heated</b> <b>dies</b> are usually used to reduce heat loss, promote surface flow, and enable the production of finer details and closer tolerances.
