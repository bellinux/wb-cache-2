Cats also engage in play fighting, with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> humans. This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.|$|E

It was hoped that a complete agent architecture (like Newell's SOAR) would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents.|$|E

25|$|As mentioned, in a vector space, {{such as that}} {{modelling}} the spacetime {{of special}} relativity, tangent vectors can be canonically identified with vectors in the space itself, and vice versa. This means that the tangent spaces at each point are canonically identified with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> the vector space itself. This explains how the right hand side of the above equation can be employed directly, without regard to spacetime point the metric is to be evaluated and from where (which tangent space) the vectors come from.|$|E
