5|$|Cardigan {{was one of}} {{the major}} ports of {{southern}} Wales until its harbour silted in the mid-19th century. The Industrial Revolution passed by, not much affecting the area. In the uplands, wheeled vehicles were rare in the 18th century, and horses and sleds were still being used for transport. On the coast, trade in <b>herrings</b> and corn took place across the Irish Sea. In the 19th century, many of the rural poor emigrated to the New World from Cardigan, between five and six thousand leaving the town between 1790 and 1860. Aberystwyth became the main centre for the export of lead and Aberaeron and Newquay did brisk coastal trade. The building of the railway from Shrewsbury in the 1860s encouraged visitors and hotels sprang up in the town to accommodate them.|$|E
5|$|The long tail of {{the common}} thresher, the source of many fanciful tales through history, is used in a whip-like fashion to deliver incapacitating blows to its prey. This species feeds mainly on small {{schooling}} forage fishes such as <b>herrings</b> and anchovies. It is a fast, strong swimmer that {{has been known to}} leap clear of the water, and possesses physiological adaptations that allow it to maintain an internal body temperature warmer than that of the surrounding sea water. The common thresher has an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction, with oophagous embryos that feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated by their mother. Females typically give birth to four pups at a time, following a gestation period of nine months.|$|E

40|$|AIM: Few dietary {{studies have}} looked beyond fish oil {{to explain the}} {{beneficial}} metabolic effects of a fish-containing diet. Our aim was to study whether addition of <b>herring,</b> or sub-fractions of <b>herring,</b> could counteract negative metabolic effects known to be induced by a high-fat, high-sugar diet. METHODS: Rats were given six different diets: standard pellets; high energy diet with chicken mince (HiE control); high energy diet with <b>herring</b> mince (HiE herring); and high energy diet with chicken mince and either <b>herring</b> oil (HiE <b>herring</b> oil), <b>herring</b> press juice, PJ (HiE PJ) or <b>herring</b> low molecular weight PJ (HiE LMW-PJ). Factors associated with the metabolic syndrome were measured. RESULTS: There were no differences in energy intake or body weight between the groups, but animals fed high energy diets had a higher body fat content compared with the pellet group, although not statistically significant in all groups. Mesenteric adipocyte size was smaller in the HiE <b>herring</b> oil group compared with the HiE control. Glucose clamp studies showed that, compared with the pellet group, the HiE control and HiE <b>herring</b> diets, but not the HiE <b>herring</b> oil diet, induced insulin resistance. Addition of <b>herring</b> or <b>herring</b> oil to the high energy diet decreased total cholesterol levels, triacylglycerols and the atherogenic index compared with the HiE control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that addition of <b>herring</b> or <b>herring</b> oil counteracts negative effects on blood lipids induced by a high energy diet. The lipid component of <b>herring</b> thus seems {{to be responsible for}} these beneficial effects...|$|R

5|$|There are {{a number}} of items {{scattered}} around the castle, of which the player may carry up to three at a time. Some of these are always in the same place {{at the start of the}} game, whereas others are distributed randomly. Items include differently-coloured keys which will unlock their respective doors, the three pieces of the ACG key, and other items that affect certain enemies or are mere red <b>herrings.</b> Common enemies appear in each room upon entering and will attack the player on sight. Collision with these enemies destroys them but drains a portion of the player's health. There are also stationary poisonous fungi which will drain health constantly if the player is in contact with them, and enemies that require special items in order to either distract, repel or kill them, otherwise they remain invulnerable to conventional attacks. Bosses guard pieces of the ACG key, and contact with them will rapidly drain away the player's health.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (<b>herrings)</b> and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the Norwegian {{economic}} gains / costs of rebuilding the Norwegian spring-spawning <b>herring</b> (Clupea harrengus) is analysed by including {{the effect of}} the <b>herring</b> stock on the cod (Gadus morhua) and capelin (Mallotus villosus) fishery in the Barents Sea. The <b>herring</b> stock collapsed in the late 1960 's and went through a rebuilding period until mid 1990 's. The size of the <b>herring</b> spawning stock affects the productivity of cod and capelin. The effects are analysed by combining the existing bioeconomic model for the Barents Sea (AGGMULT/ECONMULT) and a bioeconomic model for <b>herring</b> in the Norwegian Sea. Two management strategies for <b>herring</b> are studied under different levels of cod TAC: 1) The possible harvest control rule proposed by ICES (ICES), and 2) The <b>herring</b> stock is kept at a low level (Low). Present value of contribution margin in the cod fishery and especially capelin fishery increases when the <b>herring</b> stock is at a low level. The reduction of present value of the contribution margin in the <b>herring</b> fishery in the Low strategy causes the total contribution margin to decrease compared to a large <b>herring</b> stock (ICES). In the low <b>herring</b> stock simulations a large <b>herring</b> fishery takes place in the beginning to reduce the <b>herring</b> stock. If this fishery is not included, the difference in total contribution margin increases a lot. Simulation results show that it is not economic optimal for Norway to reduce the <b>herring</b> stock and by the increase the economic gains from cod and capelin fishery...|$|R

25|$|<b>Herrings</b> are a {{prominent}} converter of zooplankton into fish, consuming copepods, arrow worms, pelagic amphipods, mysids, and krill in the pelagic zone.

25|$|The type genus of the herring family Clupeidae is Clupea.

40|$|In {{years with}} high {{abundance}} of juvenile Norwegian spring spawning <b>herring</b> in the Barents sea, the year-class strength of capelin has frequently been observed to be poor.

40|$|Atlantic saithe (Pollachius virens) and Norwegian {{spring-spawning}} <b>herring</b> (Clupea harengus) represent two of {{the most}} abundant and ecologically important fish species in the Northeast Atlantic.

Saithe is a potentially important predator on <b>herring.</b> In the present study we found the commercial catches of saithe off western Norway to be closely related to the migration of <b>herring</b> into the coastal spawning grounds, indicating that saithe follow the high concentrations of migrating <b>herring.</b> Acoustic surveys within a defined study area demonstrated that the species overlapped spatially and temporarily. Degree of overlap varied both diurnally and with the maturity status of the <b>herring</b> (pre-spawning, spawning or spent). Concurrent catches of saithe and <b>herring</b> from trawling and gillnets supported an overlap also on the meso-scale.
