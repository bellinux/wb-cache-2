40|$|Alternative {{agriculture}} and counter-cuisine movements {{have grown to}} a strong cultural current in Western European and North American societies. In recent years,these movements have begun to converge and coalesce around the concept of localizing agri-food relations and commodity chains {{as a way of}} redressing the deleterious environmental, social, and economic consequences of what are seen as dominant globalized <b>food</b> <b>relations.</b> This dissertation reports on a regional study in Eastern Kansas of the political economy of local <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> that has arisen through this producer and consumer response. It is an effort to recognize the regional interplay of disparate forces in constructing local food systems in the interest of framing more contextualized and nuanced questions about the environmental, social, and economic outcomes of alternative agri-food development. Network, conventions, and spatial analysis theories and methods were customized and put into practice in the service of these aims, using triangulation among them to mitigate each of their individual weaknesses in representing the variable embeddedness, politics, and spaces of local food in Eastern Kansas. It was found that local food generally represents a marketing niche in urban consumerism that is served primarily by regional rural producers. The distances, agricultural and food ecologies, forms of organization, and values underpinning local food linkages were all found to vary quite considerably throughout the region, creating a diverse combination of development agendas and impacts from local food networks and making food localization a highly contested concept. Local food development in its current form is thus highly dependent on urban/rural dialectics and projects of urbanization that lack open, transparent, and reflexive governance. Critical acknowledgement of these development interdependencies is important as a step toward encouraging social, economic, and environmental justice through local food development.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} culinary {{culture as a}} process around which {{identity}} - {{across a range of}} scales - is reproduced. It examines the relation between narrative constructions of self and the material practice of food production for individuals involved in the production of culinary culture. The research explores <b>food's</b> <b>relation</b> to identity by examining the oral history life stories of 40 individuals involved in the food industry in England. By focusing on food producers the research examines how discourses of identity (such as race, class and gender) are reproduced by, through and against narratives of food production (such as multiculture, domesticity and authenticity). Neither food nor identity are examined as knowable 'things', but as negotiated processes that are mutually constituted through a range of different yet related discursive practices. Life story interviews provide a means of examining <b>food's</b> <b>relation</b> to identity as shifting, provisional, nebulous, contestable and contingent. Moreover, the life story approach makes possible an analysis of food production and consumption through narrative accounts of a person's life. By interrogating the intersections of food, sUbjectivities and histories, and commercial retail practices, the research situates the individual within the sphere of production. In so doing the thesis assesses the relation between work and home, food production and food consumption, narrative and practice, and their relation to discourses of identity and food in contemporary Britain...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} issue of hunger {{in the context of}} climate change. In particular, it investigates the role that {{international}} law plays in finding ways to tackle hunger. The research focuses on one particular adaptation strategy to climate change that has been proposed, namely ‘climate-ready seeds’. Climate-ready seeds are genetically engineered for resistance to abiotic stresses, such as drought, and intended to increase food production in the face of climate change. This research presents narratives of climate-ready seeds that expose different perspectives on whether these seeds can contribute to solving the problem of hunger. The specific example of climate-ready seeds is seen as a reflection of the ‘neoliberal’ food regime. While the exploration of the role of international law focuses primarily on climate-ready seeds, the conclusions are also relevant for food regime theory more broadly. I study the role of law in discourse on climate-ready seeds through the fields of climate change adaptation law, intellectual property law (particularly seed patents), and human rights law (especially the right to food). My main argument is that, while law is often invoked as part of the solution to climate change-induced hunger, there is little attention for the role that law plays in framing the problem. How hunger is framed as a problem determines the solutions available to solve it. Ultimately, this inquiry investigates the contribution of international law in framing hunger in the context of climate change as a problem. The analysis is based on the identification of five fundamental assumptions underlying debates on climate-ready seeds. I argue that a great deal of critical attention is directed at corporate patent rights on seeds; much less consideration is given to fundamental questions about hunger and how to eradicate it Finally, I apply the conclusions about the role of law in debates about climate-ready seeds to the neoliberal food regime. My broader argument is that global <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> as understood through food regime theory must consider the role that law plays in creating and reinforcing a certain way of thinking about hunger in the context of climate change. Without addressing the framework of assumptions on which the current food regime is based, {{it will be difficult to}} truly change global <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> and formulate alternative ways of combating hunger...|$|E
40|$|Migrant {{seasonings}} ’ (the way migrants season their {{foods and}} lives, {{and the way}} they are ‘seasoned ’ into new social relations in receiving societies), can be understood as contested sites of power negotiations, as strategic reclamation of ‘small measures of autonomy’, socio-political action, and historical visibility. I propose that migrants’ translocal food routes reveal the crucial role of <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> in the gendered production of community across ethnic and national boundaries. Problematizing ‘domestic ’ food practices to reveal public and historical implications through the tracing of foodmaps can help us expand a critical analysis of ‘foodways ’ to understand the articulation of Afro-diasporic local/global ethnohistories and structural violence born out of colonization, slavery and present neoliberal development conditions. Dominican migrant foodmaps, for example, respond to culturally and historically specific ‘roots ’ and ‘routes ’ shared with other Afro-diasporic populations in the Americas. Their food-place-memory experiences become thus a continuum between former geopolitical ‘seasonings ’ in sending societies and new racializations in the US, as well as their own political positionings...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to create an}} {{overview}} of scientific findings about the prey and the predators of the representatives of infraorder Gerromorpha, their feeding habits and defence strategies against predators. Gerromorphans are adapted for life on the surface of various water bodies ranging from puddles to open ocean. Majority of water striders feed on insect fallen upon water surface, hatching larvae of aquatic insect or micro-crustacean. Gerromorphans locate their prey by sight and by sensory detection of ripples at water surface caused by prey. Gathering in schools {{turned out to be an}} efficient defence strategy against predators. Some species have compound eyes with specialized ommatidia which enable them to see prey on the surface as well as predator under surface. A proposal of the use of Gerromorpha in natural history teaching is part of this thesis. Gerromorphans are convenient for teaching of natural history thanks to the possibility of observation of piercing and sucking mouthparts and various <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> such as predation, cannibalism or kleptobiotic relation.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is to investigate the dynamics of development of institutionalised hierarchies and inequality in Greater Mesopotamia through the analysis of food politics. The first definitive appearance of social inequalities in this region {{can be attributed to}} the 5 th millennium BCE Ubaid period, but it is in the 4 th millennium, no later than 3300 BCE that the first centralised states were born. These states were based around institutions that controlled production and distribution of primary resources. The aim of my project is to investigate the process that brought the first social hierarchies to the point of being institutionalised, a development that lasted over a millennium. The period in question is the Late Chalcolithic (LC) specifically phases 1 - 4 (c. 4500 - 3300 BCE) preceding state formation in LC 5. My project is centred around the theme of food. The analysis of food consumption and preparation can give us insights into commensal groups and socio-economic relations within communities, and thus be essential for the recognition of inequalities.

40|$|Abstract thesis The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to discuss how the study of <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> can {{contribute}} to an insight in to the social dynamics of integration and globalisation processes. The empirical data is primarily based on a three-month fieldwork at Alanya Import, an international grocery shop at Storgata in Tromsø, Norway. I followed different customers and food commodities from Alanya Import to various kitchens in Tromsø. My research question {{as a starting point}} is how they relate to food from their homeland. The national, cosmopolitan and international are some of the belongings that are being expressed through grocery shopping, cooking and eating. My point of departure was to enlighten the anthropological insight that globalisation does not lead to cultural homogeneity, but new variation patterns. Further - how global processes are understood locally. My argument is that the senses are a highly important aspect of the understanding of complex identity processes in a complex urban space. It is a study of how particular food commodities are connected to memories and emotions, through senses and stories. I will argue how the camera is an excellent tool in doing research on the mentioned themes.

40|$|Biological {{knowledge}} {{has become more}} and more important in taking personal and social decisions. Biodiversity or biota diversity has been changing also because of human activities affecting natural ecosystems. Ability to recognize changes in the ecosystem allows an individual to have a deep insight into the state of the ecosystem. If we want to make changes in this field, it is necessary to start at the very early stage, with children in the primary school. The base of changes consists of two elements – individual's knowledge and understanding of processes that run out in ecosystems. Deep understanding of biological processes is based on pupils' readiness to accept new explanations about functioning of live systems as their own ones and integrate them into already existing knowledge network, while taking into consideration that effectiveness of learning is strongly connected with previous knowledge. The individual's previous misconceptions often present an obstacle in understanding new concepts. The master's thesis deals with perceptions of class 5 pupils about meadows as ecosystems. The method of sampling was non-accidental, purpose-made. 17 pupils, boys and girls, from one of primary schools in Ljubljana, average age 11 years, took part {{in the first part of}} the research. 10 pupils were involved in the qualitative part of the research. We had an interview with each one of them checking their perceptions about ecosystems and processes that are part of them. We wanted to find out how structure and functiong of the ecosystem were understood by the pupils. Furthermore, we wanted to check their view of <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> and energy flow in the ecosystem. Our wish was to get insight into their abilities of connecting their new-found knowledge about ecosystems and check their understanding of human influence on the ecosystem. At the end all the pupils, interviewees, took part in a group conversation which contributed to their understanding of ecology and role of organisms in the ecosystem. The data gained show that the pupils have a lot of different, often wrong conceptions about meadows and ecosystems in general. A larger number of incomplete perceptions is present in the field of understanding the ecosystem functioning, <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> and energy flows in ecosystems. It is obvious that the pupils have problems with understanding and using knowledge of natural sciences. Their knowledge about a meadow as the ecosystem is more or less limited to science phenomena than to their understanding. The results show that the pupils are not as good as expected at the end of the first educational period according to operational objectives and course syllabus, in the areas of use, analysis and synthesis of contents connected with ecosystems and their processes. The dynamics of group conversation had a positive influence on cognitive and affective factors of individual's learning. One of them is their ability to make a food web as a group instead of making food chains as individuals. Another good element was the fact that more pupils showed courage and touched an earthworm being stimulated by their classmates. But we were surprised when we noticed that these pupils had a detailed presentation of an earthworm and a snail (animals which are typical of anthropogenic environments) for the first time during our research and they had wrong perceptions and prejudices about them but they replaced them with more proper ones. The results of the reseach want to point out that perceptions of pupils play an imporant role in natural sciences and expose factors which are, when teaching science at early stages, often, probably unintentionally, neglected and reflect in pupils' misconceptions and later in adults' perceptions as well. They are the ones who by living in the ecosystem co-design it and have influence on it by their actions. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Foie gras {{is today}} {{one of the}} most contested foods. The animal welfare and rights {{movement}} disputes this product which is concurrently considered as part of heritage and embedded in tourism attractions. Technical anthropologists argue that the inclusion of animal in food involves the processes of moving the animal away, legitimising the killings and masking the animal origin of the food. However, these processes are challenged by the structural changes of society such as urbanisation and industrialisation which have also led to awareness of animal treatment and sensitiveness. Another outcome of these social developments is mobility and tourism is therefore an important metaphor of the contemporary social life. Food tourism has developed as a strategic standpoint to analyse food model dynamics. In regard to this perspective, we can question how the link between eater and animal is influenced by tourism experiences in rural territories. This study emphasises the role of the different types of rural relations {{in the construction of the}} sensibilities toward force-feeding and their adjustement during a rural experience: the tourism stay. Results show that the influence of the tourists ’ experience in the change of opinion about force-feeding varies according to the respondents ’ level of socialisation with the rural area, particularly the influence of the tourists ’ experience in the rural areas. For city-dwellers, local tourism experience and visits to animal farms contribute to the contemporary construction of the imageries and sensibilities toward farm animals. This paper concludes with implications for (i) individuals working in the production and valorisation of the foie gras sector and in the territorial development and tourism industry in rural areas; (ii) academic research on animal and food studies; and (iii) for hospitality and tourism educators and researchers.

40|$|The {{razor clam}} Ensis directus was {{introduced}} to Europe presumably as larvae in ballast water around 1978. Starting in the German Bight it spread northward and southward along the continental coastline. Currently {{it is the most}} common shellfish species in the Dutch coastal zone, where it mainly occurs in the Voordelta and off the Wadden Sea islands. The mean density of E. directus in the Dutch coastal zone increased from around 2 – 5 individuals m- 2 in the late ‘ 90 ’s to around 12 – 19 individuals m- 2 from 2002 onwards. Diet studies show that E. directus makes up a significant proportion in the current diet of plaice, sole, dab, flounder and dragonet and in the diet of eider and common scoter. In recent years E. directus contributed 20 – 100 % of the total wet weight in fish stomachs. The proportion E. directus in the diet increases with fish length. Based on stomach contents of oiled and beached birds and of faeces samples the recent frequency of occurrence is 85 – 90 % in eider and 26 % in common scoter. Also waders, gulls and corvids prey on E. directus but the contribution to the diet is still unquantified. Because of its great burying depth the species is not easily accessible. Fish either profit from massive die-offs that regularly occur, or they extract (probably only the smaller) individuals from the sediment. Sea ducks can extract E. directus from the sediment, while shorebirds and gulls feed on dying E. directus washing up on the shore. E. directus is possibly an important food item for fish and seabirds when they occur in high densities and in the right size classes. Since the availability depends greatly on massive die-offs, shell size, burying depth and water depth, it is probably not a very reliable food source. Judging from the role E. directus currently plays for the higher trophic levels, its introduction must have caused a major change in the <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> in its distribution area...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study on the {{influence}} of biologically stabilized kraft mill effluent (SKME) on the <b>food</b> <b>relations</b> and production of juvenile chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tschawytscha (Walbaum), in laboratory streams. Experiments were conducted at the Oak Creek Fisheries Research Laboratory, Oregon State University, during 1967 and 1968. Kraft mill effluent used in this study was either collected raw and biologically stabilized at the laboratory, or collected already treated from a mill operating a stabilization pond. Stabilization of wastes was accomplished at the laboratory by sewage bacteria under constant aeration and with the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus. One aspect of this study dealt with the relationship between salmon production and salmon biomass in streams stocked with salmon at different densities in three control and three streams receiving 1. 5 percent SKME by volume. This design permitted an analysis of the relationships between the abundance of the food organisms and the growth rate and biomass of salmon. Another aspect of the study dealt with the production of fish stocked at similar densities in two control streams and four streams each of which received a different concentration of SKME. In experiments conducted during the spring and fall periods, salmon production was lower in streams receiving a 1. 5 percent SKME concentration than in control streams. This difference was attributed to a direct effect of SKME since no reduction in the abundance of food organisms or in the basic capacity of the streams to produce food organisms could be demonstrated. In experiments during the summer salmon production was found to be greater in streams receiving up to 4. 0 percent SKME than in control streams. Salmon production was greatest at a 1. 0 percent concentration and declined at concentrations of 2. 0 and 4. 0 percent SKME. The increase in production can probably be attributed to an increase in the numerical density of the major food organism, an amphipod identified as Crangonyx sp. The decline in salmon production at concentrations above 1. 0 percent suggested that SKME was directly effecting salmon growth rates during summer experiments also, although this influence may have been small in relation to beneficial effects on food abundance. Amphipod biomass was related to the biomass of organic material in the laboratory streams...|$|E
