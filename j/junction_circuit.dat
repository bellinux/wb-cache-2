This permits studying the correlations of the radiation. To quantify the correlations, we derive a closed expression for full counting statistics in the limit of long measurement times.

40|$|SummaryPheromone {{responses}} are highly context dependent. For example, the C.  elegans pheromone ascaroside C 9 (ascr# 3) is repulsive to wild-type hermaphrodites, attractive to wild-type males, and usually neutral to “social” hermaphrodites with reduced {{activity of the}} npr- 1 neuropeptide receptor gene. We show here that these distinct behavioral responses arise from overlapping push-pull circuits driven by two classes of pheromone-sensing neurons. The ADL sensory neurons detect C 9 and, in wild-type hermaphrodites, drive C 9 repulsion through their chemical synapses. In npr- 1 mutant hermaphrodites, C 9 repulsion is reduced by the recruitment of a gap <b>junction</b> <b>circuit</b> that antagonizes ADL chemical synapses. In males, ADL sensory {{responses are}} diminished; in addition, a second pheromone-sensing neuron, ASK, antagonizes C 9 repulsion. The additive effects of these antagonistic circuit elements generate attractive, repulsive, or neutral pheromone responses. Neuronal modulation by circuit state and sex, and flexibility in synaptic output pathways, may permit small circuits to maximize their adaptive behavioral outputs...|$|E

40|$|Josephson {{junction}} qubits {{are promising}} candidates for a scalable quantum processor. Such qubits are commonly manipulated {{by means of}} sequences of rf-pulses and different methods are used to determine their quantum state. The readout {{should be able to}} distinguish the two qubit states with high accuracy and be faster than the relaxation time of the qubit. We discuss and experiment with a readout method based on the switching of a Josephson junction from the zero voltage state to a finite voltage state. The Josephson <b>junction</b> <b>circuit</b> has a non-linear dynamics and when it is brought to a bifurcation point, it can be made arbitrarily sensitive to small perturbations. This extreme sensitivity at a bifurcation point can be used to distinguish the two quantum states if the topology of the phase space of the circuit leads to a quick separation into the final states where re-crossings of the bifurcation point are negligible. We optimize a switching current detector by analyzing the phase space of a Josephson <b>junction</b> <b>circuit</b> with frequency dependent damping. A pulse and hold technique is used where an initial current pulse brings the junction close to its bifurcation point and the subsequent hold level is used to give the circuit enough time to evolve until the two states can be distinguished by the measuring instrument. We generate the pulse and hold waveform by a new technique where a voltage step with following linear voltage rise is applied to a bias capacitor. The frequency dependent damping is realized by an on-chip RC-environment fabricated with optical lithography. Josephson junction circuits are added on by means of e-beam lithography. Measurements show that switching currents can be detected with pulses as short as 5 ns and a resolution of 2. 5 % for a sample directly connected to the measurement leads of the cryostat. Detailed analysis of the switching currents in the RC-environment show that pulses with a duration of 20 us can be explained by a generalization of Kramers' escape theory, whereas switching the same sample with 25 ns pulses occurs out of thermal equilibrium, with sensitivity and speed adequate for qubit readout.

40|$|Neuromorphic {{computing}} {{based on}} single-electron circuit technology is gaining prominence because of recent claims about its massively increased computational efficiency and its increasing relevance between computer technology and nanotechnology [1], [2]. Its {{impact will be}} strongly felt maximum when single-electron circuits can operate at room temperature, based on fault-and noise-tolerant neural structures. In this paper, inspired by stochastic resonance (SR) in an ensemble of spiking neurons [3], we designed a basic single-electron neural component and examined its statistical results on the network. A single-electron box, in which a quantum dot lies between a nanoscale tunnel junction with capacitance C and a gate capacitance CG whose order of magnitude is close to that of C, is the simplest tunnel <b>junction</b> <b>circuit</b> [4]. We see a significant similarity between single-electron boxes and conductance-based neuron models, that is the tunnel junction and CG in a single-electron box correspond to a voltage-controlled gate and membrane capacitance in the neuron model, respectively.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the physics of}} coherent quantum phase slips in two distinct circuits containing small Josephson junctions: (i) a single junction embedded in an inductive environment and (ii) a long chain of junctions. Starting from the standard Josephson Hamiltonian, the single <b>junction</b> <b>circuit</b> can be analyzed using quasi-classical methods; we formulate {{the conditions under which}} the resulting quasi-charge dynamics is exactly dual to the usual phase dynamics associated with Josephson tunneling. For the chain we use the fact that its collective behavior can be characterized by one variable: the number $m$ of quantum phase slips present on it. We conclude that the dynamics of the conjugate quasi-charge is again exactly dual to the standard phase dynamics of a single Josephson junction. In both cases we elucidate the role of the inductance, essential to obtain exact duality. These conclusions have profound consequences for the behavior of single junctions and chains under microwave irradiation. Since both systems are governed by a model exactly dual to the standard resistively and capacitively shunted junction model, we expect the appearance of current-Shapiro steps. We numerically calculate the corresponding current-voltage characteristics {{in a wide range of}} parameters. Our results are of interest in view of a metrological current standard...|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{achieving}} trajectory boundedness and computing ultimate bounds and invariant sets for Lure-type nonlinear systems with a sector-bounded nonlinearity. Our first contribution is to compare two systematic methods to compute invariant sets for Lure systems. In the first method, a linear-like bound is considered for the nonlinearity, and this bound is used to compute an invariant set by regarding the nonlinear system as a linear system with a nonlinear perturbation. In the second method, the sector-bounded nonlinearity is treated as a time-varying parameterised linear function with bounded parameter variations, and then invariant sets are computed by embedding the nonlinear system into a convex polytopic linear parameter varying (LPV) system. We show that under some conditions on the system matrices, these approaches give identical invariant sets, the LPV-embedding method being less conservative in the general case. The second contribution of the paper is to characterise a class of Lure systems, for which an appropriately designed linear state feedback achieves bounded trajectories of the closed-loop nonlinear system and allows for the computation of an invariant set via a simple, closed-form expression. The third contribution is to show that, for disturbances that are ‘aligned’ with the control input, arbitrarily small ultimate bounds on the system states can be achieved by assigning the eigenvalues of the linear part of the system with ‘large enough’ negative real part. We illustrate the results via examples of a pendulum system, a Josephson <b>junction</b> <b>circuit</b> and the well-known Chua circuit...|$|E
