25|$|When {{sales of}} the Sylvia Stretcher declined, Kenny {{returned}} to <b>home</b> <b>nursing.</b> During one of her sales journeys, she met a family who arranged for her to visit their station west of Townsville in 1929 {{to care for their}} niece Maude, who was disabled by polio. After 18 months under Kenny's care, Maude was able to walk, return to Townsville, marry and conceive a child. The newspapers in Townsville took up the story, referring to it as a cure. In 1932, Queensland suffered its highest number of polio cases in 30 years; the following year, several local people helped Kenny set up a rudimentary polio-treatment facility under canopies behind the Queens Hotel in Townsville. In a few months (after further success with local children), she moved into the bottom floor of the hotel. The first official evaluation of Sister Kenny's work took place in Townsville in 1934, {{under the auspices of the}} Queensland Health Department (QHD). This evaluation of her work led to the establishment of Kenny clinics in several cities in Australia. The Sister Kenny Clinic in the Outpatients Building of the Rockhampton Base Hospital is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.|$|E

40|$|Aims. To explore {{attitudes and}} {{confidence}} in professional competence of <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> concerning depression and to evaluate the capacity of a minimal intervention in helping <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> detect depression in patients and their family caregivers. Background. Chronically ill patients have an elevated risk to develop comorbid depression, as do their family caregivers. However, most primary care providers have little training to detect patients at risk. A minimal intervention to help <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> detect symptoms of depression was therefore evaluated. Design. Quasi-experimental field study with pre, post and follow-up measures. Methods. In this study conducted from the fall of 2012 until the spring of 2013, <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> (N= 92) in three regions in Antwerp (Belgium) were assigned to a one hour intervention (consisting of information, skill training and discussion; N= 63) or to a control condition (N= 29). The Depression Attitude Questionnaire and the Morris Confidence Scale were completed before the intervention and three and seven months afterwards. For three months the number of detections in each region was monitored. Findings. No significant changes were found in attitude or confidence in professional competences, except for {{a decline in the}} role attitude for <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> in the intervention group. <b>Home</b> <b>nurses</b> who followed the intervention did detect significantly more depressed compared to controls. Conclusion. These findings suggest that a minimal intervention can allow <b>home</b> <b>nurses</b> to be more responsive to symptoms of depression in patients and their family caregivers.

60|$|Winter after winter, the Williamses {{heard the}} wolves howling round {{them in the}} woods, and this music was {{familiar}} to the ears of all the Ohio pioneers, who trusted their rifles for both the safety and support of their families. They deadened the trees around them by girdling them with the ax, and planted the spaces between the leafless trunks with corn and beans and pumpkins. These were their necessaries, but they had an occasional luxury in the wild honey from the hollow of a bee tree when the bears had not got at it. In its season, there was an abundance of wild fruit, plums and cherries, haws and grapes, berries, and nuts of every kind, and the maples yielded all the sugar they chose to make from them. But it was long before they had, at any time, the profusion which our modern arts enable us to enjoy the whole year round, and in the hard beginnings the orchard and the garden were forgotten for the fields. Their harvests must pay for the acres bought of the government, or from some speculator who {{had never seen the}} land; and the settler must be prompt in paying, or else see his home pass from him after all his toil into the hands of strangers. He worked hard and he fared hard, and if he was safer when peace came, it is doubtful if he were otherwise more fortunate. As the game grew scarcer, it was no longer so easy to provide food for his family, the change from venison and wild turkey to the pork, which early began to prevail in his diet, was hardly a wholesome one. Besides, in cutting down the trees, he opened spaces to the sun which had been harmless enough {{in the shadow of the}} woods, but which now sent up their ague-breeding miasms. Ague was the scourge of the whole region, and it was hard to know whether the pestilence was worse on the rich levels beside the rivers, or on the stony hills where the settlers sometimes built to escape it. Fevers of several kinds prevailed, and consumption was common in the climates that ague spared. There was little knowledge of the rules of health, and little medical skill for those who lost it; most of the remedies for disease and accident were such only as <b>home</b> <b>nursing</b> and home treatment could supply.|$|E
60|$|The worn patches in the carpets, and the pallor of the drawing-room, {{where no}} chair or cover had been renewed for some years, were due {{not only to}} the miserable pension, but to the wear and tear of twelve children, eight of whom were sons. As often happens in these large families, a {{distinct}} dividing-line could be traced, about half-way in the succession, where the money for educational purposes had run short, and the six younger children had grown up far more economically than the elder. If the boys were clever, they won scholarships, and went to school; if they were not clever, they took what the family connection had to offer them. The girls accepted situations occasionally, but there were always one or two at <b>home,</b> <b>nursing</b> sick animals, tending silkworms, or playing the flute in their bedrooms. The distinction between the elder children and the younger corresponded almost to the distinction between a higher class and a lower one, for with only a haphazard education and insufficient allowances, the younger children had picked up accomplishments, friends, and points of view which were not to be found within the walls of a public school or of a Government office. Between the two divisions there was considerable hostility, the elder trying to patronize the younger, the younger refusing to respect the elder; but one feeling united them and instantly closed any risk of a breach--their common belief in the superiority of their own family to all others. Henry was the eldest of the younger group, and their leader; he bought strange books and joined odd societies; he went without a tie for a whole year, and had six shirts made of black flannel. He had long refused to take a seat either in a shipping office or in a tea-merchant's warehouse; and persisted, in spite of the disapproval of uncles and aunts, in practicing both violin and piano, with the result that he could not perform professionally upon either. Indeed, for thirty-two years of life he had nothing more substantial to show than a manuscript book containing the score of half an opera. In this protest of his, Katharine had always given him her support, and as she was generally held to be an extremely sensible person, who dressed too well to be eccentric, he had found her support of some use. Indeed, when she came down at Christmas she usually spent a great part of her time in private conferences with Henry and with Cassandra, the youngest girl, to whom the silkworms belonged. With the younger section she had a great reputation for common sense, and for something that they despised but inwardly respected and called knowledge of the world--that is to say, {{of the way in which}} respectable elderly people, going to their clubs and dining out with ministers, think and behave. She had more than once played the part of ambassador between Lady Otway and her children. That poor lady, for instance, consulted her for advice when, one day, she opened Cassandra's bedroom door on a mission of discovery, and found the ceiling hung with mulberry-leaves, the windows blocked with cages, and the tables stacked with home-made machines for the manufacture of silk dresses.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. First, the {{resident}} safety culture of <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> from a <b>Nurse</b> Aide’s perspective was compared with existing data from hospitals. Second, how the safety culture of <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> varied according to facility characteristics and market charac-teristics was examined. Methods. Data came from 72 <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> and 1579 <b>Nurse</b> Aides (response rate of 55 %). From these <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>Nurse</b> Aides completed The Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) instrument, a previously validated survey with 12 subscales {{used to assess}} safety culture.
