5|$|Ranked wing {{commander}} at {{the outbreak of}} World WarII, Wackett immediately faced major supply challenges {{in his role as}} Director of Technical Services. Spare parts for the RAAF's mainly British-built equipment were now in short supply, a fact complicated by the infancy of the local aircraft industry and a US arms embargo. His directorate made whatever use it could of civilian repair facilities, setting up central recovery depots to salvage spares from damaged aircraft and other equipment. He also drew on the advice and support of his brother Lawrence, who had established the RAAF's technical services organisation in the 1920s and now, having retired from the Air Force, headed the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). By late 1940, Wackett had been promoted temporary group captain, and joined the <b>Flying</b> <b>Personnel</b> Research Committee. Its members, drawn from the aviation, medical, scientific and technical disciplines, were to study and report upon such factors as aircrew safety, comfort, fatigue, survival, motion sickness, decompression and hypoxia.|$|E

Transport operations continued throughout October, with the squadron's aircraft transporting around 800 passengers, most of whom were recently liberated Allied prisoners of war, and large quantity of freight. In November, No. 99 Squadron moved from Darwin to Tocumwal, New South Wales, where, the following month, further losses were incurred when one member was killed and four injured in a vehicle accident on the ground. As the demobilisation process began, the squadron was warned out for disbandment in March 1946. In early May, command of the squadron passed to Flight Lieutenant B.S. Garvin. The squadron was finally disbanded on 5 June 1946.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{dispersal}} of flying units {{was not a}} problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult.

[...] To resolve this, at the start of 1962, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. [...] This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization, which included the 349th Wing and its flying squadrons, occurred for the Cuban missile crisis.
