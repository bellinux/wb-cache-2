5|$|J.E.B. Stuart {{deprived}} Lee of cavalry intelligence {{during a}} <b>good</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the campaign by taking his three best brigades {{on a path}} away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the meeting engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent {{for the failure of}} the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.|$|E

The Brugman family moved to Puerto Rico and settled in the City of Mayagüez where Brugman met and married Ana Maria Laborde. He opened a colmado (grocery store) and became rather successful, only to lose a <b>good</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his fortune {{attempting}} to grow coffee. Like many other residents of Puerto Rico at the time, he resented the political injustices practiced by Spain on the island. This led him to become a believer in the cause of the Puerto Rican independence movement.|$|E

Remember the <b>good</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> 311? Well, if you took all the <b>good</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> 311 and added some soul-influenced vocals, At the Drive-In-esque guitars, fusion-y keyboards, and a female vocalist that could put most pop singers to shame, you might be getting somewhere near what Eclectic Collective is.
