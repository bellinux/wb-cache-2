Whereas unskilled workers migrating on a permanent basis into major countries of immigration (unlike the <b>temporary</b> <b>importation</b> of workers legally under the gastarbeiter programs of postwar Europe or the Bracero program of the United States for agricultural workers) are typically entering illegally, or have entered legally and stayed on illegally, the entry of skilled workers therefore has been through legal mechanisms.
