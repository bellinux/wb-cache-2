5|$|Braille {{studied in}} Coupvray {{until the age}} of ten. Because of his {{combination}} of intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> children in the world, the Royal Institute <b>for</b> <b>Blind</b> Youth, since renamed to the National Institute <b>for</b> <b>Blind</b> Youth in Paris. Braille, the last of the family's children to leave the household, departed for the school in February 1819. At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but it provided a relatively stable environment <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> children to learn and associate together.|$|E

The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|E

5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute <b>for</b> <b>Blind</b> Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E

5|$|Forrest Mims was {{interested}} in science and electronics as a youth and even built an analog computer while in high school. Mims graduated from Texas A University in 1966 (major in government with minors in English and history) then became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force. While serving in Vietnam as an intelligence officer, Mims continued his model rocket hobby. At Texas A, Mims developed an infrared obstacle-sensing device and he experimented with it at the Saigon School <b>for</b> <b>Blind</b> Boys and Girls. Launching model rockets in an area accustomed to rocket attacks and working with blind children resulted in {{a story in the}} military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. This caught the attention of an Air Force Colonel, who arranged for Mims to be assigned to the Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB even though Mims lacked an engineering degree.|$|E
5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E
