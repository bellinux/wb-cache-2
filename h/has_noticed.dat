5|$|Karen <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> {{how much}} fun Jim and Pam had {{together}} during their prank on Andy; she confronts Jim and asks him if he still has feelings for Pam. Jim nods as he quietly says yes and Karen walks out the room, visibly upset. Meanwhile, corporate sends Andy to anger management where he plans {{to get out of}} the 10-week program in five weeks through his usual charms: name repetition and personality imitation.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{is trying}} to juggle his lives in the two realities, and wears a red {{wristband}} on his wrist in the reality where Hannah is alive and a green one in the reality where Rex is alive. In the Rex, or green, reality, Michael <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> that Rex has focused a lot on tennis lately, as it was his mother's sport. Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) has been talking with Rex lately about his feelings. In the Hannah, or red, reality, Hannah {{is trying to}} write the late Rex out of their lives, wanting to move and try for another child.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of the reassessment of sources is the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of andropais. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux's The Trojan War Will Not Take Place, his first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> following her around. After turning down the opportunity to kiss her when she offers and when confronted by Paris, he eventually accepts the kiss {{at the end of}} the play just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus a symbol of the whole city's fatal fascination with Helen.|$|E
6000|$|Luckily Miss Trotter had {{her face}} turned from {{him at the}} {{beginning}} of the sentence, or he would <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> the quick flush that suddenly came to her cheek and eyes. Yet for an instant this calm, collected woman trembled, not at what Mr. Calton might <b>have</b> <b>noticed,</b> but at what SHE <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> in HERSELF. Mr. Calton, construing her silence and averted head into some resentment of his familiar speech, continued hurriedly:-- ...|$|R

"It is very simple," [...] said Fisher, [...] "when Boyle {{straightened}} {{himself from}} his stooping posture, something had happened which he <b>had</b> not <b>noticed,</b> which his enemy <b>had</b> not <b>noticed,</b> which nobody <b>had</b> <b>noticed.</b> The two coffee cups had exactly changed places." ...|$|R
60|$|But Lebat {{could give}} no {{description}} whatever of her. He <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> that Marie {{was speaking to}} some one when he first caught sight of her face; but he <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> nothing more, {{and did not know}} whether the woman was young or old.|$|R
5|$|For a {{time after}} the fourth night, Robert cannot find the Number Devil in his dreams; later, however, on the fifth night, Robert finds himself at a desert where the Number Devil teaches him about {{triangular}} numbers {{through the use of}} coconuts. On the sixth night, the Number Devil teaches Robert about the natural occurrence of Fibonacci numbers, which the Number Devil shortens to Bonacci numbers, by counting brown and white rabbits as they reproduce multiple times. By this dream, Robert's mother <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> a visible change in Robert's mathematical interest, and Robert begins going to sleep earlier to encounter the Number Devil. The seventh night brings Robert to a bare, white room, where the Number Devil presents Pascal's triangle and the patterns that the triangular array displays. On the eighth night, Robert is brought to his classroom at school. The Number Devil arranges Robert's classmates in multiple ways, teaches him about permutations, and what the Number Devil calls vroom numbers (factorials).|$|E
5|$|In {{the downstairs}} lounge, {{a few minutes}} before the Act 2 curtain for Me and Juliet rises, the ushers comment on the {{remarkable}} conclusion to Act 1—although the audience <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> nothing unusual ("Intermission Talk"). As Act 2 of the internal show starts, an enraged Bob is searching the theatre for Jeannie and Larry. Unable to find them, he takes up position at a bar across the street where he can watch the theatre doors ("It Feels Good"). The perspective shifts to the onstage action in Me and Juliet, where Don Juan and Carmen are on a date ("We Deserve Each Other"), before moving to the manager's office where Larry and Jeanie are hiding out ("I'm Your Girl"). Mac has only just begun his lecture to them when Bob enters through the window, having heard familiar voices. In the ensuing fight, Bob knocks out Mac, but when the electrician grabs for Jeannie, Larry strongly defends her. The fight ends when Bob accidentally hits his head on a radiator and is knocked out as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{survey by}} the store reveals some of its 600,000weekly {{customers}} are stockbrokers, solicitors, accountants and doctors, {{as opposed to an}} overwhelming majority of hard-up and poorly paid people. The retailer <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> a lot more consumers from the AB social grade in their stores, expecting this trend to continue even after the economy recovers.|$|E

60|$|Lately, however, she <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> {{again the}} cruel pitiful crying of a {{hedgehog}} {{caught in a}} gin, and she <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> the traps for the fierce little murderers, traps walled in with a small fence of fir, and baited with the guts of a killed rabbit.|$|R

25|$|The National Women's Service (SERNAM) <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> that it {{is easier}} to get {{politicians}} to support and pass poverty-alleviation programs aimed at poor women than proposals that challenge gender relations. Much of Chile's legislation concerning women's rights has been pushed by SERNAM: Between 1992 and 2010, sixty-four legislative proposals to expand women's legal equality were introduced by SERNAM.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Fireheart's best friend, Graystripe, risks {{the trust}} of his entire Clan as he {{continues}} having a forbidden love affair with Silverstream, who is from RiverClan.

25|$|Although the {{retailer}} made a pre-tax loss of £1.14 {{million in the}} year to 31 January 2007, they claim that, since then, consumers have become more cautious with their money and where they spend it, {{in response to the}} current economic conditions. The retailer <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> an increase of customers from the wealthier AB social grade (a system of demographic classification used in the United Kingdom) during the recession. Customers tend to speak positively about 99p Stores, with most reviewers noting customer and product overcrowding as their biggest criticisms, yet still rate the chain 4.5/5 on average.|$|E
60|$|Lisle <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> the {{correctness}} of her assumptions {{on other}} occasions, {{but he said}} nothing, for he <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> some bitterness in her voice.

500|$|Catherine Black {{identifies}} Dickerson as an archetypal [...] "lost child", {{raised in}} poor {{foster care and}} neglected. He visits funerals to connect with society, leaving her to wonder what has pushed him to murder. Meanwhile, Dickerson remains in hiding at the scrapyard, while Connor brings him food. Frank Black <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> that the [...] "S" [...] carved in Tina's stomach matches that seen in the logo for Skorpion Salvage, the scrapyard Dickerson is hiding in. When he and the police arrive to find Dickerson, Connor is able to escape while the yard's dogs attack Dickerson.|$|E
500|$|Other {{companies}} {{have also been}} affected. For example, the private Sterling Airlines declared bankruptcy on 29 October 2008. The national airline Icelandair <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> a significant slump in domestic demand for flights. However, the airline states that year-on-year international demand is up from last year. Guðjón Arngrímsson, {{a spokesman for the}} airline, said [...] "we're getting decent traffic from other markets... we are trying to let the weak [...] help us." [...] He has also stated {{that it is impossible to}} predict whether the company will be profitable this year. Morgunblaðið, an Icelandic newspaper, is cutting some jobs and merging parts of its operations with the media corporation 365. The newspaper 24 stundir has ceased publication due to the crisis, resulting in the loss of 20 jobs.|$|E

500|$|Various sources {{assert that}} Caroline was a prostitute living in Paris. As a young woman, {{she was the}} {{mistress}} of Antoine-Emmanuel Durrieux, a former officer in the French army. According to Adam Hochschild, Durrieux liked to support {{the two of them}} by betting on horse races; when his luck soured, he became a form of pimp, prostituting Caroline to well-born clients. They undertook their schemes at the Élysée Palace, but frequently left debts unpaid. One day in 1900, while residing in Paris, Leopold II of Belgium heard of her [...] "attractions" [...] and felt interested in her modest beginnings. A woman sent by Leopold informed Caroline, [...] "Madame, I am sent to you by a gentleman who <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> you. He is a very high personage, but his exalted position obliges me to withhold his name".|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} itself opens with Maxwell snidely informing the player of their gaunt {{appearance}} and includes little further story, the game's setup is told through its trailer. On a dark and stormy night, Wilson appears to be getting nowhere in a chemistry experiment until he is startled by his radio speaking to him. It reveals that it <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> his trouble and has [...] "secret knowledge" [...] for him. When he eagerly agrees, a flurry of equations and diagrams encircle him and fill his head with this information. Using white rats, a typewriter, and his own blood, among other tools and materials, Wilson creates a giant machine. The radio commends his work and tells him to pull the machine's switch. He hesitates, but at the radio's insistence, he does it; the machine rattles violently {{and a pair of}} ghostly arms whisk him into a different world while an apparition of Maxwell cackles.|$|E
500|$|On 8 December, PewDiePie's channel reached 50 million subscribers, {{becoming}} the first YouTube channel to do so. After reaching the milestone, PewDiePie tweeted [...] "will delete tomorrow 5pm gmt," [...] in reference to his channel, before later uploading a celebratory video featuring fireworks. Ultimately, he did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead shut down the joke Jack septiceye2 channel, stating [...] "You know {{when you make a}} joke and it just blows up way bigger than you'd imagined?" [...] PewDiePie's stunt received negative reception from Fortune. The publication's Mathew Ingram opined, [...] "this is just a temper tantrum by a man-baby who makes millions of dollars playing video games," [...] adding, [...] "at first glance, the video in which he threatens to delete his channel seems like the whining of a rich, entitled celebrity who <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> that his videos aren’t getting as many views as they used to, and blames the platform for not supporting him as much as he thinks they should." [...] On 18 December 2016, he received a Ruby Play Button from YouTube as a reward for hitting 50 million subscribers.|$|E

500|$|The artwork of Gunnerkrigg Court {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "stylized," [...] with simple character designs."What he did was make an intentional choice to make his characters very cartoony." [...] At least one reviewer, on the other hand, <b>has</b> <b>noticed</b> that the backgrounds, in contrast to the characters, are often very elaborate."His characters are really simple, and some of his backgrounds are really complicated." [...] The comic has also been described as having a [...] "rich" [...] look in spite of its limited color palette,"I love his use of color, too, in particular, because he never has more than like ten colors on the average page, but it looks really really rich." [...] and Siddell himself has stated that he first developed the idea for the comic using {{only a limited number of}} colors.Siddell: [...] "I did another sketch right after that of the same girl and, wanting to color it but only having a very limited selection of marker pens, put her in an ugly school uniform with some crazy makeup." [...] The pieces of artwork that Siddell has posted at the end of each printed book, entitled [...] "Treatise" [...] and [...] "Second Treatise," [...] demonstrate many such of Siddell's artistic and storytelling motifs: they integrate alchemical symbols, mythological figures, nature, and technology.|$|E
2500|$|Apuleius, in The Golden Ass, {{describes}} the witch Meroe {{and her sister}} as lamiae: [...] "The three major enchantresses of the novel—Meroe, Panthia and Pamphylia—also reveal many vampiric qualities generally associated with Lamiae," [...] David Walter Leinweber <b>has</b> <b>noticed.</b>|$|E
