He also complained about the bills applicants were forced to pay. Mess bills were reportedly £ 2 10s per week and laundry 5s. Most of his salary was expended on these necessities.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{called for}} the training of nearly 50,000 aircrew each year, {{for as long as}} necessary: 22,000 aircrew from Great Britain, 13,000 from Canada, 11,000 from Australia and 3,300 from New Zealand. Under the agreement, air crews received <b>elementary</b> <b>training</b> in various Commonwealth countries before travelling to Canada for advanced courses.

25|$|As part of Australia's {{commitment}} to the Empire Air Training Scheme, the RAAF established twelve elementary flying training schools in 1940 and 1941. The role of these units {{was to provide a}} twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages; the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying), which were used to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including 65 hours of flying) at the <b>elementary</b> <b>training</b> school. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to a service flying training school in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.|$|E
5|$|No.1 <b>Elementary</b> Flying <b>Training</b> School {{was formed}} as No.2 Flying Training School in Melbourne on 6November 1939. Its inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Squadron Leader F.J.B.

The same principle was followed in establishing No.3 Flying Training School (later renamed No.2 <b>Elementary</b> Flying <b>Training</b> School) at Archerfield, Queensland, No.3 <b>Elementary</b> Flying <b>Training</b> School at Essendon, Victoria, and No.4 <b>Elementary</b> Flying <b>Training</b> School at Mascot, New South Wales.|$|R

25|$|Having gained his pilot's licence in January 1935, Everett {{was called}} up to the RAAF on the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939. He was initially stationed at RAAF Pearce, near Perth, and later worked as an instructor at the Central Flying School (at Camden Aerodrome) and the <b>Elementary</b> <b>Training</b> School (at RAAF Narrandera), both in country New South Wales. At Narrandera, {{he was one of}} four WA state cricketers, the others being Gordon Eyres, Keith Jeffreys, and Alexander Barras. While stationed there in January 1941, he severely fractured his leg while working at a makeshift office next to a landing strip at Grong Grong, after the wingtip of a trainee pilot's Tiger Moth clipped his desk. The pilot of the Tiger Moth was killed in the incident, with his instructor, acting as co-pilot, severely injured.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Royal Canadian Air Force’s {{standard}} <b>elementary</b> <b>training</b> aircraft was the de Havilland DHC-1 Chipmunk. Flight instruction {{was completed by}} student pilots on the DHC-1 before they progressed to the then-brand-new Canadair CT-114 Tutor jet trainer. A decision was made by RCAF HQ to remove the DHC-1s from service and not replace them, as {{it was felt that}} the CT-114 was easy enough to fly that initial training was not needed. The CT-114 quickly developed a wash-out rate of near 95% amongst student jet pilots and it was clear that an elementary trainer was needed. Due to the RCAF’s previous customer relationship with Beechcraft while operating that company's Expeditor twin-engine aircraft, a hasty purchase of twenty-four B23 Musketeers was made in 1971. The first CT-134 arrived at CFB Portage la Prairie on March 23, 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Flight {{training}} in the UK consisted {{of a total of}} three hours dual instruction followed by up to a further 20 hours solo flying– although some pilots, including the AFC's highest-scoring ace, Harry Cobby, received less– after which a pilot had to prove his ability to undertake aerial bombing, photography, formation flying, signalling, dog-fighting and artillery observation. <b>Elementary</b> <b>training</b> was undertaken on types such as Shorthorns, Avro 504s and Pups, followed by operational training on Scouts, Camels and RE8s. Upon completion, pilots received their commission and their [...] "wings", and were allocated to the different squadrons based on their aptitude during training: the best were usually sent to scout squadrons, while the others were sent to two-seaters.|$|E

2500|$|At Winchester, the 154th {{was ordered}} {{detached}} to the Royal Flying Corps for technical training, and departed for the No. 3 Training Depot Station (TDS), RFC Lopcome Center, Nether Wallop, England on 17 March. The squadron {{was the first}} American unit assigned {{to this part of}} England, and the English had very little knowledge about the traits or character or to what the squadron's status was at the station. [...] It was assigned to the RFC-34 Wing, and the men were assigned [...] to duty and training in the hangars and various schools of instruction. [...] Initially there was a tendency to minimize the mechanical knowledge of the men of the squadron, however their anxiety to learn was displayed in almost every department and within several weeks, the <b>elementary</b> <b>training</b> was ended and the squadron was entrusted with work of the most important nature. [...] At the end of two months' training, the 154th was in complete control of two full Flights, consisting of about 24 airplanes, Sopwith Camels, Pups and Avroes. [...] In addition, squadron mechanics in the workshops, the airplane repair shops, the armorers in the gunnery school and the drivers in the Transport Flight had relieved {{a large proportion of the}} British personnel for service at the front lines in France. On 16 August, the squadron was split up into several Flights for final training at advanced bases in England, before being re-assembled at Winchester on the 30th. There, orders were received for transfer to France. [...] On 12 September the squadron proceeded to Le Havre, France, and moved to British Rest Camp No.2 there waiting further orders. It then moved to the Replacement Concentration Center, AEF, St. Maixent Replacement Barracks, France, arriving on 17 September 1918.|$|E
