5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>inaugural</b> {{season of}} {{competitive}} football, Liddell confirmed {{his status as}} a regular and contributed to Liverpool's first championship since 1923. Positioned on the left wing, he appeared in 34 matches, scored seven goals, and supplied strikers Albert Stubbins and Jack Balmer with numerous assists. Severe conditions in the winter disrupted the league's schedule and Liverpool did not secure the title until 14 June 1947.

5|$|After his Grand Prix racing career {{ended in}} 1983, Roberts briefly {{considered}} an auto racing career {{before deciding to}} field a Grand Prix team. In 1984, he entered a team into the 250cc world championship with riders Wayne Rainey and Alan Carter using Yamaha bikes. In 1986 he moved up to the 500cc world championship with riders Randy Mamola and Mike Baldwin. After returning to the United States {{to compete in the}} AMA Superbike championship, Wayne Rainey re-joined the team in 1988, finishing in third place <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>inaugural</b> 500cc season then, improving to second place behind Eddie Lawson in 1989.

5|$|Although the Dirty War {{ended in}} the eighties, Kirchner {{considered}} it an unresolved issue. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>inaugural</b> speech, he supported human rights organizations which sought the incarceration of the military connected with the National Reorganization Process. He also ordered the top military leadership to retire. Kirchner sent a bill to the Congress to annul the full stop law and the Law of Due Obedience, which had halted trials of the military for crimes related to the Dirty War. The laws had been repealed in 1998, but that repeal had little legal significance, as only an annulment would reopen the cases. Although this initiative was opposed by Duhalde and Scioli, most legislators considered it a symbolic gesture since the laws' constitutionality would {{be decided by the}} Supreme Court. Both laws were annulled by the Congress in August 2003, and many cases were reopened as a result. The Supreme Court declared the laws, and Menem's presidential pardons, unconstitutional in 2005. Jorge Julio López, witness in a trial of police officer Miguel Etchecolatz, disappeared in 2006. This caused a national scandal, as it was suspected that he was disappeared to intimidate other witnesses in the upcoming trials, and the government was unable to locate him.|$|E
