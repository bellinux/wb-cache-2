But collecting mountains <b>of</b> <b>data</b> is <b>of</b> no use until we use the <b>data</b> for perception <b>of</b> some meaningful patterns in it. This is possible with predictive analytics which exploit patterns in historical and transactional data to identify risks, opportunities and future events. One such application of predictive analytics is customer segmentation which aims towards {{a deeper understanding of}} customer by using the breadcrumbs left by the customers in the form <b>of</b> <b>data...</b>|$|R
40|$|Clonus of {{the lower}} jaw An old sign that comes back We report {{the case of a}} 68 -year-old woman with amyo-trophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) presenting with a 1 -year history of progressive dysarthria with unintelligible speech, dysphagia, muscular wasting, and a troublesome chin tremor with difficulty in chewing. At clinical examination, our attention was drawn to clonus {{of the lower}} jaw (video on the Neurology ® Web site at Neurology. org). Exaggerated jaw jerk is due to supranuclear lesion of the trigeminal nerve and it may occur in ALS. 1 However, although the first description of clonus of the lower jaw in ALS dates back to 1886, 2 this sign is not frequently noticed in clinical practice.
