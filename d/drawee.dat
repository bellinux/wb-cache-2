500|$|Burton {{argued that}} both {{constitutional}} provisions were violated because the crime {{had not occurred}} in the Eastern District of Missouri. Justice Peckham, writing for the entire Court except for Justice Harlan in dissent, reversed Burton's convictions on these grounds. The Court held that Burton's negotiation of the check in Washington, D.C. did not constitute conduct by Burton in St. Louis (the site of the <b>drawee</b> bank). In other words, whatever the Washington, D.C. bank did with the check afterwards, it did for itself, not as Burton's agent. [...] "From {{the time of the}} delivery of the check by the defendant to the bank it became the owner of the check; it could have torn it up or thrown it in the fire or made any other use or disposition of it which it chose, and no right of defendant would have been infringed." [...] Thus, the Court held that it was error for the trial judge to have submitted the question of the [...] "understanding [...] [...] [...] between the defendant and the bank" [...] to the jury. In support of this argument, the Court cited several of its own precedents concerning negotiable instrument law, as well as cases from the House of Lords and the courts of New York and Massachusetts.|$|E

5000|$|When a draft {{promises}} immediate {{payment to}} the holder of the draft, {{it is called}} a sight draft. Cheques written on demand deposits are examples of sight drafts. When a draft promises a deferred payment to the holder of the draft, it is called a time draft. The date on which the payment is due is called the maturity date. In {{a case where the}} drawer and <b>drawee</b> of a time draft are distinct parties, the payee may submit the draft to the <b>drawee</b> for confirmation that the draft is a legitimate order and that the <b>drawee</b> will make payment on the specified date. Such confirmation is called an acceptance — the <b>drawee</b> accepts the order to pay as legitimate. The <b>drawee</b> stamps ACCEPTED on the draft and is thereafter obligated to make the specified payment when it is due. If the <b>drawee</b> is a bank, the acceptance is called a banker's acceptance. Bankers acceptances are considered eligible collateral under the Treasury Tax & Loan (TT&L) Program under 31 CFR part 203 ...|$|E

50|$|Cheque {{truncation}} means {{stopping the}} flow of the physical cheques issued by a drawer to the <b>drawee</b> branch. The physical instrument is truncated at some point en route to the <b>drawee</b> branch and an electronic image of the cheque is sent to the <b>drawee</b> branch along with the relevant information like the MICR fields, date of presentation, presenting banks etc. This would eliminate the need to move the physical instruments across branches, except in exceptional circumstances, resulting in an effective reduction in the time required for payment of cheques, the associated cost of transit and delays in processing, etc., thus speeding up the process of collection or realization of cheques.|$|E

50|$|To {{settle a}} cheque, {{it has to}} be {{presented}} to the <b>drawee</b> bank for payment. Originally this was done by taking the cheque to the <b>drawee</b> bank, but as cheque usage increased this became cumbersome and banks arranged to meet each day at a central location to exchange cheques and settle the money. This became known as central clearing. Bank customers who received cheques could deposit them at their own bank, who would arrange for the cheque to be returned to the <b>drawee</b> bank and the money credited to and debited from the appropriate accounts. If a cheque was dishonoured or bounced it would be physically returned to the original bank marked as such.|$|E
50|$|Demands drafts {{are also}} known as sight drafts, as they are payable when {{presented}} by sight to the bank. Under UCC 3-104, a draft {{has been defined as}} a negotiable instrument {{in the form of an}} order. The person making the order is known as the drawer and the person specified in the order is called the <b>drawee,</b> as defined in the UCC 3-103. The party who creates the draft is called the maker and party who is order to pay is called the <b>drawee.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A payee that {{accepts a}} cheque will {{typically}} deposit {{it in an}} account at the payee's bank, and have the bank process the cheque. In some cases, the payee will take the cheque to {{a branch of the}} <b>drawee</b> bank, and cash the cheque there. If a cheque is refused at the <b>drawee</b> bank (or the <b>drawee</b> bank returns the cheque to the bank that it was deposited at) because there are insufficient funds for the cheque to clear, it is said that the cheque has been dishonoured. Once a cheque is approved and all appropriate accounts involved have been credited, the cheque is stamped with some kind of cancellation mark, such as a [...] "paid" [...] stamp. The cheque is now a cancelled cheque. Cancelled cheques are placed in the account holder's file. The account holder can request a copy of a cancelled cheque as proof of a payment. This is known as the cheque clearing cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Douglas {{chose to}} follow the rule set forth in United States v. National Exchange Bank of Providence, , in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the U.S. government, “as <b>drawee</b> of {{commercial}} paper stands in no different light than any other drawee” and could recover on a check as a <b>drawee</b> from {{a person who had}} cashed a pension check with a forged endorsement, despite the government's protracted delay in giving notice of the forgery. The National Exchange Bank case held the government to conventional business terms, but said nothing about whether lack of prompt notice was a defense for nonpayment of a check. The Court held that the Pennsylvania state law -- requiring prompt notice from the <b>drawee</b> -- presumed injury to the defendant by the mere fact of delay. In this case, not only did Clearfield Trust Co. fail to demonstrate that it had suffered a loss because of the delay in notice, it could still recover the amount of the check from J.C. Penney, because none of its employees detected the fraud. The court chastised both companies for their [...] "neglect and error" [...] in accepting the forged check, and suggested that they should only be permitted to shift the loss to the <b>drawee</b> only when he can demonstrate that the delay in notice caused him damage.|$|E
5000|$|A {{demand draft}} is a {{negotiable}} instrument {{similar to a}} bill of exchange. A bank issues a demand draft to a client (drawer), directing another bank (<b>drawee)</b> or {{one of its own}} branches to pay a certain sum to the specified party (payee).|$|E
50|$|Expressing this in {{less formal}} language, it is a written order from one party (the drawer) to another (the <b>drawee)</b> {{to pay a}} {{specified}} sum on demand or on a specified date to the drawer or to a third party specified by the drawer.|$|E
50|$|The Bank was at {{no point}} liable to pay M the {{proceeds}} of the cheques. The fact {{that a person is}} designated as payee on the face of a cheque does not on its own mean that a bank is liable to make a payment to the person. A <b>drawee</b> is answerable to the drawer. The question is to whom the <b>drawee</b> may make the payment. What is {{on the back of the}} cheque — the instructions or the endorsement — is crucial to this question. In this case, the instructions were to deposit the cheques into the joint account. The Bank’s liability to pay monies to M personally cannot be confused with its liability to pay monies to the holders of the joint account. There were no instructions that made the monies payable to M.|$|E
50|$|Documentary Bill: seller (drawer) draws {{a bill of}} {{exchange}} on the buyer (<b>drawee)</b> and attaches it to the bill of lading.

50|$|At the hearing, Trustco {{argued that}} the trial judge failed to {{differentiate}} between a demand for repayment of funds deposited in an account and the delivery of a cheque for deposit. In its view, it was liable only — as <b>drawee</b> — to pay funds out of the trust account upon proper presentment for payment by the holder of the cheque. At no point was it liable to make a payment to McLeod, the tax debtor. For its part, Canada contended {{that there was no}} distinction between presentment of a cheque to the <b>drawee</b> for the payment of cash to McLeod and presentment of a cheque for deposit to the joint account. Its position is that when McLeod delivered the cheques to Trustco and instructed it to pay the amounts into the joint account, he acted as payee, creditor, drawer and depositor, but that his role as depositor was irrelevant.|$|E

5000|$|A {{negotiable}} instrument or [...] "draft" [...] is a written order by the drawer to the <b>drawee</b> to pay {{money to the}} payee. A common type of bill of exchange is the cheque (check in American English), defined as a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and payable on demand. Bills of exchange are used primarily in international trade, and are written orders by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. They are not used as often today.A bill of exchange is essentially an order made by {{one person to another}} to pay money to a third person. A bill of exchange requires in its inception three parties—the drawer, the <b>drawee,</b> and the payee. The person who draws the bill is called the drawer. He gives the order to pay money to the third party. The party upon whom the bill is drawn is called the <b>drawee.</b> He is the person to whom the bill is addressed and who is ordered to pay. He becomes an acceptor when he indicates his willingness to pay the bill. The party in whose favor the bill is drawn or is payable is called the payee. The parties need not all be distinct persons. Thus, the drawer may draw on himself payable to his own order.A bill of exchange may be endorsed by the payee in favour of a third party, who may in turn endorse it to a fourth, and so on indefinitely. The [...] "holder in due course" [...] may claim the amount of the bill against the <b>drawee</b> and all previous endorsers, regardless of any counterclaims that may have disabled the previous payee or endorser from doing so. This is what is meant by saying that a bill is negotiable.In some cases a bill is marked [...] "not negotiable" [...] - see crossing of cheques. In that case it can still be transferred to a third party, but the third party can have no better right than the transferor.|$|E
50|$|The {{organization}} {{that produces a}} traveler's cheque is the obligor or issuer. The bank or other place that sells it is the agent. The natural person who buys the cheque is the purchaser. The entity to whom the purchaser hands the cheque in payment for goods or services is the payee or merchant. For purposes of clearance, the obligor is both maker and <b>drawee.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most {{state legislatures}} in the United States ban general {{corporations}} from accepting banker's deposits, which ban tends to cover any service whereby a general corporation {{acts as a}} funds <b>drawee</b> which transfers current funds (i.e. credit payable upon demand) to make payments {{as a substitute for}} coins on behalf of an account holder. Historically, in some states, this ban did not extend to a sole proprietor acting as a banker.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in the mid-1990s, some {{countries}} {{started to change}} their laws to allow [...] "truncation": cheques would be imaged and a digital representation of the cheque would be transmitted to the <b>drawee</b> bank, and the original cheques were destroyed. The MICR codes and cheque details are normally encoded as text {{in addition to the}} image. The bank where the cheque was deposited would typically do the truncation and this dramatically decreased the time it took to clear a cheque. In some cases, large retailers that received large volumes of cheques could also do the truncation.|$|E
5000|$|Parties {{to regular}} cheques {{generally}} include a drawer, the depositor writing a cheque; a <b>drawee,</b> the financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment; and a payee, the entity {{to whom the}} drawer issues the cheque. The drawer drafts or draws a cheque, which is also called cutting a cheque, especially in the US. There {{may also be a}} beneficiary—for example, in depositing a cheque with a custodian of a brokerage account, the payee will be the custodian, but the cheque may be marked [...] "F/B/O" [...] ("for the benefit of") the beneficiary.|$|E
50|$|A cheque {{or check}} (American English; see {{spelling}} differences) is {{a document that}} orders a bank to pay a specific amount of money from a person's account to the person in whose name the cheque has been issued. The person writing the cheque, the drawer, has a transaction banking account (often called a current, cheque, chequing or checking account) where their money is held. The drawer writes the various details including the monetary amount, date, and a payee on the cheque, and signs it, ordering their bank, known as the <b>drawee,</b> to pay that person or company {{the amount of money}} stated.|$|E

A sahyog hundi passes from one hand to another till it reaches the final recipient, who, after reasonable enquiries, presents it to the <b>drawee</b> for acceptance of the payment. Sahyog means co-operation in Hindi and Gujrati, the predominant languages of traders. The hundi is so named because it required the co-operation of multiple parties to ensure that the hundi has an acceptable risk and fairly good likelihood of being paid, {{in the absence of a}} formalized credit monitoring and reporting framework.|$|E
5000|$|When the six-digit {{sort code}} system {{was set up}} in the 1960s, numbers in the 70 range were {{reserved}} for the large number of London offices of banks which were not members of the London Clearing. Individual sort codes within the range 70-00-00 to 70-99-99 were allocated on a one-off basis to the many London offices of private and foreign banks. Cheques drawn on these banks were colloquially known within the banking industry as [...] "walks" [...] because they were cleared by being hand-delivered ("walked") to the <b>drawee</b> banks by messengers from the Clearing House. By the 1990s, all these banks had been issued with sort codes within the ranges of the various clearing banks which, henceforth, acted as clearing agents for them. The practice of [...] "walking" [...] cheques was ended and use of the 70 code range was discontinued.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{concerns}} {{about the amount of}} time it took banks to clear cheques, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. They produced a report recommending maximum times for the cheque clearing which were introduced in UK from November 2007. [...] In the report the date the credit appeared on the recipient's account (usually the day of deposit) was designated [...] "T". At [...] "T + 2" [...] (two business days afterwards) the value would count for calculation of credit interest or overdraft interest on the recipient's account. At [...] "T + 4" [...] clients would be able to withdraw funds on current accounts or at [...] "T + 6" [...] on savings accounts (though this will often happen earlier, at the bank's discretion). [...] "T + 6" [...] is the last day that a cheque can bounce without the recipient's permission—this is known as [...] "certainty of fate". Before the introduction of this standard (also known as 2-4-6 for current accounts and 2-6-6 for savings accounts), the only way to know the [...] "fate" [...] of a cheque has been [...] "Special Presentation", which would normally involve a fee, where the <b>drawee</b> bank contacts the payee bank to see if the payee has that money at that time.

40|$|Cheque Truncation System(CTS) is an {{automatic}} cheque clearance system implemented by RBI. CTS uses cheque image, {{instead of the}} physical cheque itself, for cheque clearance thus reducing the turn around time drastically. This approach holds back the physical movement of cheque from presenting bank to the <b>drawee</b> bank. In CTS, digital image of the cheque is protected using standard public key and symmetric key encryptions like RSA, triple DES etc. This involves a lot of computation overhead and key management. The security also depends on the hard mathematical problem and is only computationally secure. Information theoretically secure, secret image sharing techniques {{can be used in}} the CTS for the secure and efficient processing of cheque image. In this paper, we propose two simple and efficient secret image sharing schemes and a Cheque Truncation System based on these algorithms. In the proposed scheme,the presenting bank is acting as the dealer and the participants are the customer, and the <b>drawee</b> bank. The dealer should generate the shares of cheque and distributes it to customer and <b>drawee</b> bank. The validity of the shares are important during the reconstruction process.

40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to deal with the non-transferable cheque. Three {{questions}} have been addressed: (a) Whether sections 58, 79 and 83 apply to non-transferable cheques; (b) whether the non-transferability of a cheque implies only that a cambial transfer is excluded, but transfer by means of a ordinary cession is still possible; (c) whether the collecting and <b>drawee</b> banks can be held liable for damages to the owner of a non-transferable cheque. (a) It is clear that section 58 does not apply to non-transferable cheques. After the decision in Eskom, {{it is also clear that}} section 79 does apply to such cheques. Regarding the applicability of section 83 to non-transferable cheques, there is uncertainty. (b) Whether the rights arising from a non-transferable cheque can be transferred by means of an ordinary cession, it is not yet clear.
