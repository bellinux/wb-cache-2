40|$|The paper {{covers the}} {{evaluation}} of an axial flow lift <b>type</b> <b>turbine</b> carried out {{as part of the}} research to determine the feasibility of developing a kinetic energy tidal power generator. The evaluation was carried out on a test unit deployed at a site with a relatively high water velocity. The first turbine evaluated was an axial flow drag <b>type</b> <b>turbine.</b> Th results of this evaluation are used to show how the low efficiency of the turbine, drive train and alternators led to the replacement of the turbine with an axial flow lift <b>type</b> <b>turbine,</b> the development of a high efficiency alternator and modification of the drive train. The use of an electronic controller to control the power output by operating the turbine at a set tip speed ratio is explained. The results of {{the evaluation of}} the axial flow, lift <b>type</b> <b>turbine</b> are presented together with details of factors effecting performance, such as corrosion, turbulence and marine growth, and how their effects can be reduced...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presents}} {{results of}} comparative analysis of infrasound noise generated by wind turbines of two types: asynchronous type REPOWER MM 92 with power equal to 2 MW and synchronous type Vensys 62 with power equal to 1. 2 MW. Frequency spectra of sound pressure levels generated during operation by both turbines for exemplary chosen wind speed values are depicted. Within the shown spectra the resonant frequencies have been indicated, for which sound pressure variations {{over time are}} shown. Based on the achieved frequency spectra it was stated that in general the asynchronous <b>type</b> <b>turbine</b> produces lower pressure levels, which are less stable over time, and indicates higher pressure values around the resonant frequencies {{as compared to the}} synchronous <b>type</b> <b>turbine.</b> Also it was stated that the asynchronous <b>type</b> <b>turbine</b> is more influenced by the wind conditions and generates higher pressure values by higher wind speeds then the synchronous <b>type</b> <b>turbine.</b> The main contribution of this paper lies in indication that the <b>type</b> of wind <b>turbine</b> generator has significant impact on the level of infrasound noise emitted to the environment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the present {{status of the}} art on air turbines, {{which could be used}} for wave energy conversion.

This untapped energy is extractable using underwater turbines capable of converting water kinetic energy into mechanical energy.
