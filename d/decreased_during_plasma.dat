40|$|Analysis {{of human}} {{cartilage}} extracts by radioimmunoassay {{showed that the}} noncollagenous 148 -kd cartilage matrix protein was present in extracts of tracheal cartilage but was undetectable in normal or arthritic joint cartilage, corroborating previous results with bovine cartilage samples. Concentrations of the protein in the circulation, as studied by radioimmunoassay, were greatly elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast, patients with reactive arthritis and oligoarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, as well as rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with low-dose glucocorticoids, had levels {{similar to those in}} healthy controls. The serum concentrations were not related to age. A patient with polychondritis and tracheal involvement had a high serum concentration of the protein, which <b>decreased</b> <b>during</b> <b>plasma</b> exchange and cyclophosphamide treatment. Studies of the release of this cartilage matrix protein, which is present in nonarticular cartilage but not in articular cartilage, should aid in the understanding of the mechanisms of cartilage involvement in disease, and the protein may become a clinically useful marker...|$|E

We image the charged particle spatial distributions by extraction with a high-voltage pulse onto a position-sensitive detector.

40|$|An {{impulsive}} plasma injection {{has been}} used to study charge neutralization of the Space Shuttle Orbiter while it was emitting an electron beam into space. This investigation was performed by Space Experiments with Particle Accelerators on Spacelab- 1. A plasma consisting of 10 to the 19 th argon ion-electron pairs was injected into space for 1 ms while an electron beam was also being emitted into space. The electron beam energy and current were as high as 5 keV and 300 mA. While the orbiter potential was positive before the plasma injection and began to <b>decrease</b> <b>during</b> the <b>plasma</b> injection, it was near zero for 6 to 20 ms after the plasma injection. The recovery time to the initial level of charging varied from 10 to 100 ms. In a laboratory test in a large space chamber using the same flight hardware, the neutralization time was 8 - 17 ms and the recovery time was 11 - 20 ms. The long duration of the neutralization effect in space can be explained by a model of diffusion of the cold plasma which is produced near the Orbiter by charge exchange between the neutral argon atoms and the energetic argon ions <b>during</b> <b>plasma</b> injection...|$|R

Plasma concentrations {{of a variety of}} hormones were measured at set times before and during exercise and for twenty minutes afterward. The plasma concentration of norepinephrine and epinephrine and plasma activity of renin rose to a maximum at the end of exercise and then declined. The plasma concentrations of neurotensin and atrial natriuretic peptide followed a similar course. Plasma vasopressin rose to a peak at the end of exercise and then fell transiently below the initial value ten minutes after exercise. The plasma concentrations of aldosterone, prolactin and adrenocorticotropin increased during exercise but continued to do so, reaching a peak at ten minutes after exercise. Plasma growth hormone increased during exercise and continued to increase throughout the period of twenty minutes' recovery. Cortisol did not change during exercise but rose progressively during the recovery period.

Using time-resolved quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy, the densities of NO, NO 2 and N 2 O have been measured in synthetic air as well as in air with 0. 8 % of NO 2 and N 2 O, respectively. The temporal evolution of the NO density shows four distinct phases <b>during</b> the <b>plasma</b> pulse and the early afterglow in the three gas mixtures that were used. In particular, a steep density increase during the ignition phase and after termination of the discharge current pulse has been detected. The NO concentration has been found to reach a constant value of,, and for mean plasma currents of 50 mA, 100 mA and 150 mA, respectively, in the afterglow. The measured densities of NO 2 and N 2 O in the respective mixture <b>decrease</b> exponentially <b>during</b> the <b>plasma</b> pulse and remain almost constant in the afterglow, especially where the admixture of NO 2 has a remarkable impact on the NO production during the ignition. The numerical results of the coupled solution of a set of rate equations for the various heavy particles and the time-dependent Boltzmann equation of the electrons agree quite well with the experimental findings for the different air-like plasmas. The main reaction processes have been analysed {{on the basis of the}} model calculations and the remaining differences between the experiment and modelling especially during the afterglow are discussed...|$|R

In this study, pregnant (days 8, 15, and 20 of gestation) and postpartum (days 3 and 8 postpartum, including lactating and nonlactating dams) Wistar rats were used to investigate pituitary GH gene expression and hormone secretion, and the potential alterations of the major signals regulating GH secretion and action [somatostatin (SS) and GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), GH receptor (GH-R), and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) ]. GH and SS messenger RNA (mRNA) were quantitated by Northern blot, and both IGF-I and GH-R mRNA were analyzed by the ribonuclease protection assay technique. Pituitary IR-GH content and GH mRNA increased at midpregnancy. IR-GH content was decreased in lactating rats. Plasma GH levels progressively increased during pregnancy, whereas no significant alterations were shown during lactation. Elevated GH levels persisted during lactation. Levels at this time were higher in nonsuckling compared with suckling dams.

In addition, the <b>decrease</b> <b>during</b> recessions {{is greater than the}} increase during expansions; (2) the price-marginal cost ratio is very asymmetric — it <b>decreases</b> <b>during</b> recessions but shows no significant movement during an expansion. The lower price-marginal cost ratio during a recession implies that the elasticity of output with respect to labour decreases. Thus not only does the level of productivity fall, but the productivity of labour relative to capital also falls. These characteristics are consistent with labour hoarding. ...|$|R

A method for the visual analysis of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was also developed. This method selected, at each sampling time, spots that were significant.
