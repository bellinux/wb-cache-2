5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence.

However, in most cases strata are not <b>dated</b> by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were <b>dated</b> before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E

50|$|Electron Spin Resonance <b>Dating</b> {{is being}} used in fields like {{radiation}} chemistry, biochemistry, and as well as geology, archaeology, and anthropology.

30|$|Numerous {{changes to}} an {{aircraft}} trip’s temporal information {{results from the}} unload entire aircraft and inter-aircraft pallet swap neighborhoods. First, an aircraft trip departure <b>date</b> might require modification to minimize pallet temporal violations. If the current departure <b>date</b> of a trip is later than the ready to load <b>date,</b> DALP-TS can decrease the departure date; however, the algorithm does not schedule an aircraft trip’s departure <b>date</b> prior to its ready to load <b>date.</b> Decreasing a departure <b>date</b> only occurs if doing so improves the solution. Changing the departure <b>date</b> to a <b>date</b> which causes infeasibilities {{in the majority of}} the loaded pallets is unproductive. Decreasing the departure <b>date</b> of an aircraft trip creates a series of ready to load <b>date</b> decreases in subsequent aircraft trips; DALP-TS modifies the departure <b>date</b> of the succeeding aircraft trips if doing so improves the overall objective function value. Note that the trip ready to load <b>date</b> is the earliest <b>date</b> upon which an aircraft may depart; this <b>date</b> does not necessarily correspond to the best departure <b>date</b> for a given pallet load. By increasing a trip’s departure <b>date,</b> DALP-TS could trigger a series of updates to the subsequent aircraft trips. This occurs when a trip’s altered departure <b>date</b> causes the ready to load <b>date</b> of the succeeding trip to be after its departure date; DALP-TS then equates the departure <b>date</b> with the ready to load <b>date.</b>|$|R
