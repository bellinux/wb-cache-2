40|$|ABSTRACT Among the {{agricultural}} environments of traditional communities, <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> are frequently cited as high agrobiodiversity sites. However, the agrobiodiversity of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> along a rural-urban gradient demands study {{in order to}} identify possible influences of urbanization and to support mitigation of impacts. The present work investigated the role <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> play in the in situ agrobiodiversity conservation of plants in quilombola communities with different degrees of urbanization. The study found that more urbanized communities have larger <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> but the average richness of plant species in these areas was not statistically different among the communities. Furthermore, the abundance of plant species was similar. Medicinal and food plants were mainly found in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of the communities with high to intermediate levels of urbanization, while ornamental plants were more common in rural community <b>home</b> <b>gardens.</b> It is believed that crop exclusivity in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of the more urbanized communities highly influenced the results, increasing the role <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> play in maintaining traditional practices. The elevated and statistically equal species richness in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> suggests that, despite the factors generated by urbanization, all of the communities are very important for in situ conservation of native and introduced species...|$|R

Austin continues to live at Mercury's former <b>home,</b> <b>Garden</b> Lodge, Kensington, with her family. The outer walls of Garden Lodge in 1 Logan Place became a shrine to Mercury following his death, with mourners paying tribute by covering the walls in graffiti messages. Three years after his death, Time Out magazine reported, [...] "Since Freddie's death, the wall outside the house has become London's biggest rock 'n' roll shrine." [...] Fans continue to visit to pay their respects with messages in letters appearing on the walls.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Mercury had a {{long-term}} relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. He lived with Austin for several years in West Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, the singer had begun {{an affair with a}} male American record executive at Elektra Records and, in December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship. Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, into 12 Stafford Terrace in Kensington and bought Austin a place of her own nearby. They remained close friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, [...] "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary , but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me." [...] He also wrote several songs about Austin, the most notable of which is [...] "Love of My Life". Mercury's final <b>home,</b> <b>Garden</b> Lodge, 1 Logan Place, a twenty-eight room Georgian mansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, had been picked out by Austin.

2500|$|Penniman {{was famous}} for her skill in {{gardening}} and her garden was stocked with a rare variety of plants and shrubs. And {{it was here that}} two herbaria were made by Mrs. Penniman and her youngest daughter Adelia, who was born in 1800. The region around the High Bridge was discovered by a Massachusetts botanist, who botanized {{the west side of the}} state in 1829, to be “a remarkable region, rich in rare and interesting plants.” A part of this “remarkable region" [...] was comprised in the Penniman farm, and here, in 1814, the mother/daughter botanists found and preserved their specimens. They doubtless followed the windings of the river in both directions and are known to have gone often through the woods then on the site of the Fort in their search for wild flowers. Not satisfied with the pressed flowers in the herbarium, they carried home the plants from their native haunts and cultivated and improved them in the <b>home</b> <b>garden.</b> Botany was said to be Mrs. Penniman’s “favorite amusement.” This was before any manual of botany had been published in this country. But botanical textbooks were not the only books published in the old country to be found in this home. A granddaughter of Penniman tells how each of Scott’s novels was purchased as soon as it appeared, and how eagerly it was read and the question of authorship discussed by the whole circle of friends of the family. It may be that the specimens in these small herbaria were the oldest in the state, for the oldest in the herbaria of the University of Vermont are dated 1819. There were 80 or 90 specimens in each herbarium, although quite a number of cultivated plants are included. Many of the botanical names have long since been changed, and one at least, the ground or moss pink, had not been listed in the Vermont Flora, though reported as a recent “find” from Wallingford and also from Colchester.|$|E

He fled the sounds. Hard by him on his right a road struck towards the palace, and he {{followed}} it through the thick shadows and branching alleys of the park. It was a busy place on a fine summer's afternoon, when the court and burghers met and saluted; but at that hour {{of the night in}} the early spring it was deserted to the roosting birds. Hares rustled among the covert; here and there a statue stood glimmering, with its eternal gesture; here and there the echo of an imitation temple clattered ghostly to the trampling of the mare. Ten minutes brought him to the upper end of his own <b>home</b> <b>garden,</b> where the small stables opened, over a bridge, upon the park. The yard clock was striking the hour of ten; so was the big bell in the palace bell-tower; and, farther off, the belfries of the town. About the stable all else was silent but the stamping of stalled horses and the rattle of halters. Otto dismounted; and as he did so a memory came back to him: a whisper of dishonest grooms and stolen corn, once heard, long forgotten, and now recurring in the nick of opportunity. He crossed the bridge, and, going up to a window, knocked six or seven heavy blows in a particular cadence, and, as he did so, smiled. Presently a wicket was opened in the gate, and a man's head appeared in the dim starlight.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study of}} urban <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> {{is still a}} current gap in {{knowledge}} in Brazilian ethnobotany researches, especially {{in the south of}} Brazil. This study was carried out to survey the species composition of plants in urban residential <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of two neighborhoods in the municipality of Chapecó (state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil) : an older neighborhood created prior to the 1950 s, and a younger neighborhood created in the decade 1970 - 1980. It was hypothesized that the <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> in the older neighborhood would be larger and have greater species richness than those in the younger neighborhood. Data from 10 <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> in each neighborhood were collected through semi-structured interviews. The plants cited by interviewees were classified as used for alimentary, medicinal and/or ornamental purposes. A total of 372 plant species (256 in the older neighborhood and 248 in the younger one) were recorded. The two neighborhoods differed in the size of their <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> but had similar species richness. The high species richness of plants cultivated for alimentary, medicinal and ornamental purposes in both Chapecó neighborhoods indicates that these spaces are an important resource for food, subsistence and well-being...|$|R
40|$|Agrobiodiversity is {{a crucial}} {{environmental}} resource. Much of the agrobiodiversity remaining in situ today is found on the semi-subsistence farms of poorer countries and the small-scale farms or <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of more industrialised nations. The traditional farms of Hungary are an example. Labelled “home gardens” {{as a reflection of}} their institutional identity during the collectivisation period, they are micro-agroecosystems that provide important functions such as food security and diet quality. This paper applies the choice experiment method to estimate the private benefits farmers derive from four components of the agrobiodiversity found in Hungarian home gardens: richness of crop varieties and fruit trees; crop landraces; integrated crop and livestock production; and soil micro-organism diversity. The analysis is based on primary data collected in three environmentally sensitive areas where pilot agri-environmental programmes have been initiated as part of the Hungarian National Rural Development Plan. Findings demonstrate variation in the private values of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> and their attributes across households and regions, contributing to understanding the potential role of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> in these agri-environmental schemes. This study has implications for sustaining agrobiodiversity in transitional economies.

6000|$|Robert Browning's {{childhood}} {{was passed in}} an unusually serene and happy home. In Development he tells how, at five years of age, he was made to understand the main facts of the Trojan War by his father's clever use of the cat, the dogs, the pony in the stable, and the page-boy, to impersonate the heroes of that ancient conflict. Latin declensions were taught the child by rhymes concocted by his father as memory-easing devices. Stories and even lessons were made intelligible and vivid by colored maps and comic drawings. Until the boy was fourteen, his schooling was of the most casual sort, his only formal training being such as he received in the comparatively unimportant {{three or four years}} he spent, after he was ten, at Mr. Ready's private school. His real education came, through all his early life, from his home. What would now be called nature-study he pursued ardently and on his own initiative in the <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> and neighboring fields. His love for animals was inherited from his mother and fostered by her. He used to keep, says Mrs. Orr in her account of his life, [...] "owls and monkeys, magpies and hedge-hogs, an eagle, and even a couple of large snakes, constantly bringing home the more portable animals in his pockets and transferring them to his mother for immediate care." [...] Browning says that his faculty of observation at this time would not have disgraced a Seminole Indian. In the matter of reading he was not entirely without advice and guidance, but was, on the whole, allowed unusual freedom of choice. He afterwards told Mrs. Orr that Milton, Quarles, Voltaire, Mandeville, and Horace Walpole were the authors in whom, as a boy, he particularly delighted. His love for art was established and developed by visits to the Dulwich picture gallery, of which he afterwards wrote to Miss Barrett with [...] "love and gratitude" [...] because he had been allowed to go there before the age prescribed by the rules, and had thus learned to know [...] "a wonderful Rembrandt," [...] a Watteau, [...] "three triumphant Murillos," [...] a Giorgione Music Lesson, and various Poussins. His marked early susceptibility to music is evidenced by an incident narrated by Mr. Sharp: [...] "One afternoon his mother was playing in the twilight to herself. She was startled to hear a sound behind her. Glancing round she beheld a little white figure distinct against an oak bookcase, and could just discern two large wistful eyes looking earnestly at her. The next moment the child had sprung into her arms, sobbing passionately at he knew not what, but, as his paroxysm subsided, whispering with shy urgency: 'Play! Play!'" ...|$|E
