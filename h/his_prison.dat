5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them.

Because of this, he is able to tolerate <b>his</b> <b>prison,</b> which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E

5|$|A {{conflict}} between the new papal legate, Peter of Capua, and the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Peter of Angoulême, who had become Raymond-Roupen's supporter, ended with the excommunication of the patriarch. Exploiting the situation {{to get rid of}} his opponent, Bohemond replaced Peter of Angoulême with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, SymeonII {{with the support of the}} commune in early 1207. Peter of Angoulême was reconciled with the legate, excommunicated Bohemond and the commune, and then persuaded some nobles to rise up against Bohemond, forcing him to take refuge in the citadel. Leo entered Antioch, but Bohemond collected his forces and defeated the Armenians. Peter of Angoulême was captured and died of drink deprivation in <b>his</b> <b>prison.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} out from <b>his</b> <b>prison,</b> Brad {{falls into a}} moat before coming {{to a halt in}} a maze of an underground cavern.

In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.|$|E

5|$|After resting {{for several}} months, Berkman began to recover. He {{remained}} anxious about {{his lack of}} employment. He considered returning to his old job as a printer, but his skills had become obsolete in light of innovations in linotype machines. With Goldman's encouragement, Berkman began to write an account of <b>his</b> <b>prison</b> years, Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist, and she invited him to become the editor of her journal, Mother Earth. He served as editor from 1907 to 1915, and took the journal in a more provocative and practical direction, {{in contrast to the}} more theoretical approach which had been favored by the previous editor, Max Baginski. Under Berkman's stewardship, circulation of Mother Earth rose as high as 10,000 and it became the leading anarchist publication in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about Raynald's life while he was kept in jail for fifteen years.

In Raynald's absence, Constance wanted to rule alone, but BaldwinIII of Jerusalem made Patriarch Aimery regent for her fifteen-year-old son (Raynald's stepson), Bohemond III of Antioch. Constance died around 1163, shortly after her son reached the age of majority. Her death deprived Raynald of his claim to Antioch. However, he had become an important personality, with prominent family connections. His stepdaughter, Maria of Antioch, married ManuelI Komnenos in 1161. Raynald's own daughter, Agnes, became the wife of Béla III of Hungary.|$|E
