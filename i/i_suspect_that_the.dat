[...] Zec was kinder to Lazenby's co-star, saying that [...] "there is style to Diana Rigg's performance and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last scene which draws something of a performance out of Lazenby owes much to her silken expertise." [...] The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement." ...|$|E

"I cannot force Gloria {{to marry}} you just now, because those strangers may interfere. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wooden-legged man {{possesses}} great magical powers, or {{he would never have}} been able to carry himself and those children across the deadly desert." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Quite well," [...] replied Blacky, [...] "but unhappy.

60|$|Although in {{the dead}} state, the {{aperture}} of the capitulum seems to be always gaping, yet I have little doubt, that the living animal can fold the flexible membrane, like a mantle, round its thorax and cirri, and thus protect, though feebly compared with most Cirripedes, these organs. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mouth is always exposed.|$|E

"He {{may not be}} afraid, Fergus," [...] said Dan, [...] "yet <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Red-man's {{tactics are}} often the wisest, for {{what would be the}} use of making an attack in daylight, at the cost of several lives, when the attack might be made quite as well, if not better, at night, without the loss, perhaps, of any life at all?" ...|$|E
60|$|If I had had {{any idea}} of your coming (see how {{naturally}} I use the word when I am three hundred miles off!) to London so soon, I would never have written one word about the jump over next week.

6000|$|Another critic {{writing from}} the heart of a great {{university}} said, [...] "I value your stories highly as literature, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> social war which is coming you and I will be at each other's throats." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Thrall made no {{motion to}} take my hand from him, but she said, [...] "I think I have met Mr. Strange," [...] and now I saw in the background, sitting on a camp-stool near a long, lank young man {{stretched}} in a hammock, a very handsome girl, who hastily ran through a book, and then dropped it at the third mention of my name. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> book was the Social Register, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> girl's search for me had been satisfactory, for she rose and came vaguely towards us, while the young man unfolded himself from the hammock, and stood hesitating, but looking as if he rather liked what had happened.|$|R
60|$|And {{are there}} any men in this kingdom, except such as find their account in public confusion, who would hazard the {{introduction}} of such scenes of rapine, barbarity, and bloodshed, as have disgraced France and outraged humanity, {{for the sake of}} obtaining--what?--Liberty and Equality. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> meaning of these terms is not clearly and generally understood: it may be of use to explain them.|$|E
60|$|Recollections {{need not}} be {{combined}} like mosaic work; they may be blended, {{on the principle of}} composite portraiture. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> phantasmagoria may be in some part due to blended memories; the number of possible combinations would be practically endless, and each combination would give a new face. There would thus be no limit to the dies in the coinage of the brain.|$|E
60|$|The {{store of}} nutriment laid up within {{the seeds of}} many plants seems at first sight to have no sort of {{relation}} to other plants. But from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds (as peas and beans), when sown {{in the midst of}} long grass, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all around.|$|E

6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} that some of the Sioux are so. But that is not saying that they are civilised. All {{civilisation}} comes through literature now, especially in our country. A Greek got his civilisation by talking and looking, and in some measure a Parisian may still do it. But we, who live remote from history and monuments, we must read or we must barbarise. Once we were softened, if not polished, by religion; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pulpit counts for much less now in civilising." ...|$|E
60|$|Trifolium procumbens.--On one {{occasion}} covered-up plants seemed to yield as many seeds as the uncovered. On a second occasion sixty uncovered flower-heads yielded 9.1 grains weight of seeds, whilst sixty heads on protected plants yielded {{no less than}} 17.7 grains; so that these latter plants were much more productive; but this result I suppose was accidental. I have often watched this plant, and have never seen the flowers visited by insects; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flowers of this species, and more especially of Trifolium minus, are frequented by small nocturnal moths which, as I hear from Mr. Bond, haunt the smaller clovers.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> real {{attraction}} {{was a large}} {{library of}} fine books, which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked, made the library a region of bliss to her.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> even <b>the</b> Australian {{administrators were}} praying for {{rain and the}} delaying of the final outcome of a series that was proving a {{financial}} bonanza.

60|$|I {{could see}} little to laugh over. For the very rottenness {{of the service}} {{was due to the}} miserable and servile Ministry and Parliament of his Majesty, by means of which {{instruments}} he was forcing the colonies to <b>the</b> wall. Verily, <b>that</b> {{was a time when the}} greatness of England hung in the balance! How little <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young man then seated beside me, who had cast so unthinkingly his mighty powers on the side of corruption, was to be one of the chief instruments of her salvation! We were to fight George the Third across the seas. He was to wage no less courageous a battle at home, in the King's own capital. And the cause? Yes, the cause was to be <b>the</b> same as <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> Mr. Wilkes he reviled, who obtained his liberty that day.|$|R

I'll warn commandant Fleury if <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English are making ready for a coup outside the tavern. Personally I think it unlikely--because the duc de Kernogan will be inside the Rat Mort all the time, and he too will be {{the object of the}} Englishmen's attacks on his behalf. Citizen Martin-Roget too has about a score or so of his friends posted outside his sister's house: they are lads from his village who hate the Kernogans as much as he does himself. Still! I shall feel easier in my mind now that I am certain of commandant Fleury's co-operation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it was and}} it wasn't, and I don't {{know that}} it {{differed}} from {{anything else in the}} world, in that respect. It is true that there is a great distrust of the priests amongst the Italians. The young men hate them--or think they do--or say they do. Most educated men in middle life are materialists, and of course unfriendly to the priests. There are even women who are skeptical about religion. But <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> largest number of all those who talk loudest against the priests are really subject to them. You must consider how very intimately they are bound up with every family in the most solemn relations of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|By and by we {{left the}} casino and wandered among the grounds, {{threading}} interminable alleys of cypress, through the long vistas of which we could see {{here and there a}} statue, an urn, a pillar, a temple, or garden-house, or a bas-relief against the wall. It seems as if {{there must have been a}} time, and not so very long ago,--when it was worth while to spend money and thought upon the ornamentation of grounds in the neighborhood of Rome. That time is past, however, and the result is very melancholy; for great beauty has been produced, but it can be enjoyed in its perfection only at the peril of one's life. [...] . For my part, and judging from my own experience, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Roman atmosphere, never wholesome, is always more or less poisonous.|$|E

I should, in that case, be quite powerless to resist. My father owned the magic pearls {{at the time of}} the Great Fight, of which you have so often heard, and the pink pearl protected him from harm, while the blue pearl enabled him and his people to drive away the enemy.

40|$|When, on {{a special}} {{invitation}} from my patron and friend G. Ross Roy, I visited the University of South Carolina for several weeks in summer 1997, I was working mainly on the translation of Hugh MacDiarmid’s On a Raised Beach {{and some of his}} shorter lyrics in Scots, for a book which came out in Italy in 2000. Yet it was Ross’s enthusiasm for Robert Burns and all his achievements which attracted my curiosity and moved me on more than one occasion. I remember that one hot July morning Ross teasingly played the part of a detective story’s weaver, waking me up quite early and telling me that he would fetch me soon because he had, at his house, some serious stuff to show to me.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{interior}} {{arrangement of the}} choir and the chancel has been greatly modernized; for it is quite unlike anything that I have seen elsewhere. Instead of one vast eastern window, there are rows of windows lighting the Lady Chapel, and seen through rows of arches in the screen of the chancel; the effect being, whoever {{is to have the}} credit of it, very rich and beautiful. There is, I think, no stained glass in the windows of the nave, though in the windows of the chancel there is some of recent date, and from fragments of veritable antique. The effect of the whole interior is grand, expansive, and both ponderous and airy; not dim, mysterious, and involved, as Gothic interiors often are, the roundness and openness of the arches being opposed to this latter effect.|$|E
6000|$|I shall {{now give}} some {{examples}} which cannot so easily be ranked under any special head. Gill charges the Eastern counties with kiver for cover, and ta, for to.

In old spelling, to is the common (and indeed correct) form of too, which is only to {{with the sense of}} in addition. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sound of our too has caught something from the French tout, and {{it is possible that the}} old too too is not a reduplication, but a reminiscence of the feminine form of the same word (toute) as anciently pronounced, with the e not yet silenced.

60|$|I {{never heard}} who the poor soul was, or why he took {{himself out of}} the world, if he really did so, or if he ever was in it; but I am sure that my passion for Pope, and my purpose of writing pastorals, must have been {{powerful}} indeed to carry me through dangers of that kind. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strongest proof of their existence was the gloomy and ruinous look of the house, {{which was one of the}} oldest in the village, and the only one that was for rent there. We went into it because we must, and we were to leave it as soon as we could find a better. But before this happened we left Ashtabula, and I parted with one of the few possibilities I have enjoyed of seeing a ghost on his own ground, as it were.|$|E
60|$|The {{most notable}} absence {{observable}} in the billiard-room, was {{the absence of}} the river man. If he was there he had taken in his sign, he was in disguise. I saw there none of the swell airs and graces, and ostentatious displays of money, and pompous squanderings of it, which used to distinguish the steamboat crowd from the dry-land crowd in the bygone days, in the thronged billiard-rooms of St. Louis. In those times, the principal saloons were always populous with river men; given fifty players present, thirty or thirty-five were likely to be from <b>the</b> river. But <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ranks were thin now, and the steamboatmen no longer an aristocracy. Why, in my time they used to call the 'barkeep' Bill, or Joe, or Tom, and slap him on the shoulder; I watched for that. But none of these people did it. Manifestly a glory that once was had dissolved and vanished away in these twenty-one years.|$|R
60|$|All {{names of}} places--London, England, Europe, the Earth, the Solar System--similarly involve, when used, {{descriptions}} which start from some {{one or more}} particulars with which we are acquainted. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> even <b>the</b> Universe, as considered by metaphysics, involves such a connexion with particulars. In logic, on the contrary, where we are concerned not merely with what does exist, but with whatever might or could exist or be, no reference to actual particulars is involved.|$|R
60|$|The three commanders, however, {{remained}} {{beyond our}} line of vision, and, because no one save the rioting soldiery and the savages entered or {{came out of the}} headquarters tent, <b>I</b> began to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> leaders had run away.|$|R
