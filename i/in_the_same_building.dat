5|$|Despite the {{discontinuation}} {{of internal}} game development at 3D Realms, {{development of the}} game did not cease entirely. Nine ex-employees including key personnel like Allen Blum, continued game development throughout 2009 from their homes. These employees would later become Triptych Games, an independent studio housed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> as Gearbox, with whom they collaborated on the project.|$|E
5|$|Casson {{set up a}} {{residential}} clinic for women with mental disorders at Dorset House in Bristol in 1929 with enough residential space for 800 patients, and she opened the first school of occupational therapy in the UK <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> the following year. She took {{an active role in}} the therapeutic activities at Dorset House, even playing a part in the patient's production of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E
5|$|The {{eradication}} campaign {{led to the}} death of Janet Parker (c.1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the University of Birmingham who worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.|$|E
50|$|The {{school was}} taken over by Rotherham Corporation in 1906. It moved to Middle Lane in 1910. It closed in 1973 and a {{comprehensive}} school, Clifton Comprehensive School, opened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} few years, the grammar school and the new Thomas Rotherham College {{operated}} alongside each other <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings,</b> until <b>the</b> last of the grammar school boys reached the sixth form (c. 1971).|$|R
5000|$|The first {{classes were}} offered in {{buildings}} located in downtown Albany. President Lewis Froman received approval in 1957 {{to establish a}} [...] "private junior college" [...] operating on a daytime schedule <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1959, the College purchased {{a portion of the}} site of the Albany Home for Children (Now Parson's Child and Family Center) at New Scotland and Academy Road and a year later the entire Albany Division moved to the new campus, continuing to coexist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>in</b> daytime and evening schedules. <b>In</b> 1962, <b>the</b> Junior College of Albany received its own degree-granting power, and henceforth all associate degrees (day and evening) were awarded through JCA.|$|R
5|$|The murder inquiry, codenamed Operation Braid, {{was one of}} {{the largest}} police {{investigations}} ever undertaken in the Bristol area. The case dominated news coverage in the United Kingdom around the Christmas period as Yeates' family sought assistance from the public through social networking services and press conferences. Rewards amounting to £60,000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for Yeates' death. The police initially suspected and arrested Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' landlord, who lived in a flat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building.</b> He was subsequently released without charge.|$|E
5|$|While these {{characteristics}} never occur all together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building,</b> and none {{are unique to}} Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air. Other Baroque characteristics, such as broken pediments over windows, the extravagant use of statuary, and curved topped windows and doors are all emblematic of Baroque architecture, but can all be found on Baroque building all over Europe.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Reykjavík, Fischer gave a press conference. He lived a reclusive life in Iceland, avoiding entrepreneurs {{and others who}} approached him with various proposals. Fischer moved into an apartment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> as his close friend and spokesman, Garðar Sverrisson. Garðar's wife, Kristín Þórarinsdóttir, was a nurse and later looked after Fischer as a terminally ill patient. Garðar's two children, especially his son, were very close to Fischer. Fischer also developed a friendship with Magnús Skúlason, a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions {{with him on a}} wide variety of subjects.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, {{with the}} rise of {{interest}} in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and United States Constitution had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate pedestal for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed). In 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> in which federal judges were holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1909, Bryant moved to Portland, first sharing a {{downtown}} apartment {{with one of her}} college friends, Clara Wold, then renting her own apartment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building.</b> Among her jobs, she designed a stained-glass window for the Povey Brothers, worked as a freelance reporter for The Oregonian, and became an illustrator and society editor for the Portland Spectator, a weekly news magazine. Meanwhile, she formed friendships with people—such as Cas Baer, drama editor for The Oregonian—who were interested in journalism and the arts. In late 1909, she met and married Paul Trullinger, a dentist who lived on a houseboat on the Willamette River, collected art, and liked drinking parties that sometimes included invitations to his office to inhale ether.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{took place}} almost entirely in London. The {{directors}} somewhat followed the filming style of Bharat Nalluri, {{the director of}} the first two episodes of series one and two, who used London and the River Thames as characters in themselves. The exterior and interior of Freemasons' Hall continued to be a stand-in for Thames House, the headquarters of MI5. However, the Grid, the base of operations of Section D, was a set constructed at the fifth floor in another building. Danny's apartment was also filmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building.</b> Another constructed set was the back of mobile surveillance vans, which was housed near the Grid set.|$|E
50|$|Salford City College is {{a further}} {{education}} college based in Salford, England.

5|$|Walker ordered Major General John B. Coulter {{to observe}} the ROK troops on the east. Coulter flew to Kyongju, {{arriving}} there at 12:00 that day. Walker in the meantime formally appointed Coulter Deputy Commander, Eighth Army, placing him {{in command of the}} ROK I Corps which controlled the Capital and 3rd Divisions, the US 21st Infantry Regiment, the 3rd Battalion, US 9th Infantry Regiment, and the 73rd Medium Tank Battalion, less C Company. Coulter designated these units Task Force Jackson and established his headquarters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> in Kyongju in which the ROK I Corps commander and the Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) officers had their command post.|$|E
5|$|When Monk {{returns with}} Natalie (Traylor Howard) to Dr. Kroger's office, they meet Francis Merrigan (Gordon Clapp), who owns an {{importing}} and exporting business based <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building.</b> Merrigan {{is carrying a}} milk carton, which {{he says he is}} utilizing for a coffeemaker. That night, someone throws a rock through the window of Dr. Kroger's house. Stottlemeyer and Disher keep the suspicion on one of Dr. Kroger's patients. As they interview the Kroger family, they learn Kroger suspects his rebellious son Troy (Cody McMains) did it. Monk, however, believes that whoever killed Teresa might have thrown the rock to make everyone believe that one of Dr. Kroger's patients is involved. Monk recognizes the rock, though he does not know where he saw it.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center {{relocated}} {{its operations}} to Norman, Oklahoma, and was rechristened the Storm Prediction Center. At that time, the guidance center was housed at Max Westheimer Airport (now the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport), co-located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> as the National Severe Storms Laboratory {{and the local}} National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office (the latter of which, in addition to disseminating forecasts, oversees the issuance of weather warnings and advisories for the western two-thirds of Oklahoma and western portions of North Texas, and issues outline and status updates for SPC-issued severe thunderstorm and tornado watches that include areas served by the Norman office). In 1998, the Center began issuing the National Fire Weather Outlook to provide forecasts for areas potentially susceptible to the development and spread of wildfires based on certain meteorological factors. The Day 3 Convective Outlook (which is similar in format to the Day 2 forecast) was first issued on an experimental basis in 2000, and was made an official product in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Flerohopp grew {{up around}} the {{ironworks}} which had been founded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town <b>in</b> 1725. <b>The</b> name Flerohopp comes from {{the names of the}} three founders of the factory: G.W.

Rothlieb and Caspar Dietrich Hoppenstedt. <b>The</b> ironworks was <b>in</b> use until 1880. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> <b>the</b> glassworks were established in 1892, which was operational until 1960. Glass was blown for laboratory work and lightbulbs.|$|R
50|$|As mercantilism {{became the}} {{dominant}} economic {{theory of the}} Renaissance, merchants tended to conduct their business <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings,</b> which might include retail sales, warehousing and clerical work.

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)— in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 7:00 am on 30 December 2010, Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' {{landlord}} {{who lived}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building,</b> {{was arrested on}} suspicion of her murder. He {{was taken to a}} local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat. On 31 December, a senior police officer granted investigators a 12-hour extension to the arrest, enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning. Police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 December and 1 January. Investigators were able to detain him as a suspect for up to 96 hours, but released Jefferies on bail after two days. He retained the legal services of the law firm Stokoe Partnership to act on his behalf. On 4 March 2011, police released him from bail and stated he was no longer a suspect. He subsequently won an undisclosed sum in libel damages for defamatory news articles published following his arrest, and received an apology from Avon and Somerset Police for any distress caused to him during the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} {{included two}} judges, {{one for the}} civil court {{and one for the}} criminal court. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> were the Office and Court of Appeals. The judges of the Castellania were native Maltese and dealt with cases {{that took place in the}} district of Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities. Other districts, such as those under the courts of Mdina and Rabat, followed the same model and had to adopt decisions taken at the Castellania. On three days per week, the Fiscal Prosecutor brought cases before the judges. There was also a Cancelliere, who was responsible for receiving and preserving judicial acts, registering the sentences meted out by the judges and supervising the other workers in the courts. There was a Gran Visconte (the Chief of police) who coordinated the police, and the Capitani di notte who implemented the sentences. Other workers included an official who saw that prisoners were treated fairly, those who were responsible for the archives and advocates for legal aid. Advocates were generally Italian-speaking Maltese, as most knights and foreigners considered the position as for the inferior people. A report was drafted weekly and sent to the palace of the Grand Master, informing about occurrences presented to the Castellania.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{artefacts}} excavated {{from the}} acropolis {{date from the}} transition from the Terminal Classic Period to the Early Postclassic, when the surrounding population appears to have occupied the abandoned palace. Excavations of the south range of the acropolis uncovered a great many potsherds (roughly 11,000) dating to the Terminal Classic, and about 150 pieces dating to the Early Postclassic. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> 150 stone artefacts were excavated together with hundreds of fragments of waste chippings. Fifteen incomplete ceramic figurines were also found, including zoomorphic figures and elite human figures with elaborate headdresses. One of these figurines was a whistle in the shape of an owl, identical to another found in an excavated rubbish heap in the acropolis courtyard. Both of these owl-shaped whistles are very similar to a larger whistle found at Yaxha. A number of artefacts were recovered from the threshold of Room 3 of the south range, including a complete terminal classic ceramic vessel, a flint knife, some broken figurine fragments and some lithic fragments. In the area of the threshold of Room 4 in the south range a complete Early Postclassic tripod plate was recovered. Within Room 4 itself were found a further 70 broken pieces of Terminal Classic ceramics and 232 pieces dated to the Early Postclassic, and a greenstone axe among other finds. Many of the Postclassic fragments were from a tripod pitcher with zoomorph supports that archaeologists were largely able to reconstruct. Additionally, 798 Terminal Classic ceramic fragments were found during the exploration of the terraces immediately south of the acropolis, together with stone chippings and pieces of animal bones.|$|E
