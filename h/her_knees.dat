5|$|Alizon Device, whose {{encounter}} with John Law had triggered {{the events leading}} up to the trials, was charged with causing harm by witchcraft. Uniquely among the accused, Alizon was confronted in court by her alleged victim, John Law. She seems to have genuinely believed in her own guilt; when Law was brought into court Alizon fell to <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> in tears and confessed. She was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus {{because of the presence of}} her son, Cupid.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They {{would have a}} strained relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.|$|E
50|$|Reade {{fractured}} <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> {{two weeks}} before the UCI World Championships in July 2005 at a national event in England. She raced the World Championships with <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> wrapped up and on pain killers but crashed in the quarter finals.|$|R
50|$|On March 17, 2007, García twisted <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> {{in heavy}} snow while skiing in Killington, Vermont, {{incurring}} a torn anterior cruciate ligament. She underwent surgery on <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> on April 5, 2007, in New York City under Dr. Armin Tehrany. She returned to Raw on July 2.|$|R

5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} <b>her</b> <b>knees.</b> Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to <b>her</b> <b>knees.</b> Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna walking {{at night in}} the middle of the street of an American city {{surrounded}} by skyscrapers and wind. Then she finds herself in another dimension, as moving flowers surround her. As the video advances, Madonna walks on other different kinds of roads. She walks on a path of red flowers in the sky, and then walks on <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> on a deep, blue colored sea, as she is followed by little white fairies. At the end of the video, when there is destruction in the real dimension, Madonna finds peace and is surrounded by the fairies. When they go away, Madonna disappears altogether.|$|E

25|$|In September 2012, Raisman {{was injured}} during the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions in Ontario, California. She fell while {{performing}} a Maloney on the uneven bars and landed off the mats, bruising <b>her</b> <b>knees.</b> This occurred shortly after teammate McKayla Maroney injured herself performing a flyaway dismount {{on the same}} bars.|$|E
25|$|Thereafter, Maria wrote {{almost every}} day until 1947 and {{intermittently}} in the following years until 1951. She would write with a fountain pen in the notebook resting on <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and placed upon the writing board she had made herself. At times she would call Marta to read back to her what she had written.|$|E

25|$|The {{last few}} years of Graf's career were beset by injuries, {{particularly}} to <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and back. She lost the World No. 1 ranking to Martina Hingis and failed to win a Grand Slam title {{for the first time}} in ten years in 1997. That year Graf lost in the fourth round of the Australian Open in straight sets to Amanda Coetzer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the atrium}} of the house, a bed {{was made up}} for Juno, and a table set for Hercules. In the Hellenized mythological tradition, Juno tried to prevent the birth of Hercules, as it {{resulted}} from Jupiter's infidelity. Ovid has Lucina crossing <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and fingers to bind the labor. Etruscan religion, however, emphasized the role that Juno (as Uni) played in endowing Hercle with his divine nature through the drinking of her breast milk.|$|E
25|$|Emin's two self-portraits taken {{inside her}} beach hut, The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here I (2000) and The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here II (2000) are a diptych {{although}} they are often exhibited and sold separately. They depict a naked Emin on <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> inside her beach hut which she and friend Sarah Lucas had bought in Whitstable, Kent in 1992.|$|E

5000|$|She worked {{extremely}} hard on <b>her</b> rehabilitation, <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> repaired and <b>her</b> passion was restored. Ellis produced {{some of the}} best netball of her career in the two years that followed. She ended her 18-year career in her 122nd test with Australia winning the world championship 42-38. She overcame all critics and odds after coming back from <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> injury.|$|R
25|$|This national-patriotic {{movement}} {{charges that}} for centuries the West has plundered Russia of her natural resources, {{trying to bring}} Russia to <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and undermining Russia's messianic and self-sacrificing mission to enlighten and save mankind, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union as evidence. In their view, the United States want to break up Russia and turn it into a source of raw materials. The West being accused of Russophobia is a major part of their belief.|$|E
25|$|The Earl of Pembroke, a {{moderate}} baron with strong French links, intervened {{in an attempt}} to defuse the crisis. Edward continued to refuse to negotiate or exile the Despensers, so Pembroke arranged for Queen Isabella to publicly go down on <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers. This provided him with a face-saving excuse to exile the Despensers and defuse the crisis, but it was clear Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Malin Matsdotter {{was asked}} by the court to fall upon <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and repeat a prayer read to her, but she did not succeed before her 11th attempt, which was given great {{importance}} by the court. She had at one point been hired as a midwife by Anna Zippel, who had previously been executed for witchcraft, and she commented that if she had ever taken anyone to Blockula, which she denied, than in that case she would have learned it there.|$|E

25|$|In May 1970, Norris—on bail for {{his latest}} offense—attacked a female student {{whom he had}} been {{stalking}} {{on the grounds of}} the San Diego State University campus. Norris repeatedly struck her on the back of the head with a rock until she slumped to <b>her</b> <b>knees,</b> before he repeatedly beat her head against the sidewalk as he knelt upon her lower back. Shortly thereafter, Norris was charged with assault with a deadly weapon; he was committed to a total of five years' imprisonment at the Atascadero State Hospital, where he was classified as a mentally disordered sex offender.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln Cathedral {{reportedly}} received £100,000 {{in exchange}} for the right to film there, with filming there occurring between August 15 and 19, 2005, mainly within the cloisters of the cathedral. The cathedral's bell, which strikes the hour, was silent {{for the first time since}} World War II during that time. Although it remained a closed set, protesters led by a 61-year-old woman named Sister Mary Michael demonstrated against the filming. Sister Mary Michael spent 12 hours praying on <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> outside the cathedral in protest against what she saw as the blasphemous use of a holy place to film a book containing heresy.|$|E
25|$|A {{monument}} {{dedicated to}} the troops of the 72nd Mizil Infantry Regiment, who fought during the Romanian Campaign of World War I (1916-1917), stands in the town. Built in 1921, the pedestal is 1.8 m high and the sculptures reach 2.7 m. They depict a woman in folk costume embodying the Fatherland, with her right hand raised in salute and her left holding the standard; a soldier and a woman sitting before her, the latter with an open book on <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> and representing History. There is a bronze plaque showing a battle scene, another featuring an inscription, and others naming the 1190 officers and enlisted men who died in battle.|$|E
