40|$|In this paper, {{the results}} of {{radiation}} sensitive field effect transistors (Al-gate p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors) sensitivity to gamma and X-ray irradiation are presented. Radiation fields were created using 60 Co source for three <b>dose</b> <b>ranges</b> (0 - 1 Gy, 0 - 5 Gy, and 0 - 50 Gy), as well as X-ray unit of 280 kVp spectrum for a single <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> from 0 to 5 Gy.

It was shown that for the three <b>dose</b> <b>ranges</b> of gamma radiation, {{as well as for the}} X-ray range from 0 Gy to 5 Gy there is approximately a linear dependence between threshold voltage shift DVT and radiation dose D. The application of positive bias of + 5 V at the RADFET gate during irradiation, for these ranges of gamma radiation, also for X-ray <b>dose</b> <b>range,</b> leads to the increase in DVT and also, approximately a linear dependence between DVT and D, is established.

Epidemiological data show high disease incidence in young children and suggest that immunization programs should target children below two years of age: this is not possible with available vaccines. The Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health developed a conjugate vaccine (Vi-CRM₁₉₇) for infant vaccination concomitantly with EPI vaccines, either starting at 6 weeks with DTP or at 9 months with measles vaccine. We report the results from a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 <b>dose</b> <b>ranging</b> trial with Vi-CRM₁₉₇ in European adults. Following randomized blinded comparison of single vaccination with either Vi-CRM₁₉₇ or licensed polysaccharide vaccines (both containing 25 · 0 µg of Vi antigen), a randomised observer blinded <b>dose</b> <b>ranging</b> trial was performed in the same center to compare three concentrations of Vi-CRM₁₉₇ (1 · 25 µg, 5 · 0 µg and 12 · 5 µg of Vi antigen) with the polysaccharide vaccine.
