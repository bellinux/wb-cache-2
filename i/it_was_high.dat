5|$|The copper mines prospered {{for about}} seventy years, {{but by the}} early 17th century the {{industry}} was in decline. Demand for copper fell {{and the cost of}} extracting <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>high.</b> Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving. Although the boom of the mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Business {{and family}} {{commitments}} kept Rush busy {{for the next}} few years. He moved his home up-river from Maclean to Grafton, the effective 'capital' of the Clarence River district. Rush purchased a hotel and an adjacent store, and a riverside villa which he named 'Clarence House'. Rush took an active part in a great many community and sporting organisations. He was a founder of the Grafton Rowing Club and was several times an office-holder of the Clarence River Jockey Club. He continued to promote and take part in local regattas. One of these was the Clarence River Aquatic Carnival, held on 10 March 1883. The Carnival attracted thousands of spectators. The main event was Rush vs Laycock for a stake of £1000 and the Championship of Australia, which Laycock won convincingly. At a banquet later that week, Rush announced his retirement from professional sculling, but in December of that year, he rowed Trickett on the Parramatta River for a stake of £400, and lost convincingly. The newspapers praised Rush for his valour, but hinted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> time he retired.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised slightly. As a result of the hasty construction work, even at the wall's lowest part, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes that had been stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could be most effective, and a wicket gate that flanked {{a large part of the}} wall, was left open but cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon that had been placed at the gate to enfilade its approach with showers of grapeshot.|$|E

5|$|Yet all {{the while}} Britain strove for independence, {{at the same time}} it sought {{interdependence}} in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. This was desired more than ever, as other countries recovered from the war and once again began to challenge Britain's status. As successful as <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>High</b> Explosive Research fell short on both counts. The technology demonstrated at Monte Bello in October 1952 was already seven years old. The following month the United States tested Ivy Mike, a thermonuclear device. The British government would now have to decide whether to initiate its own hydrogen bomb programme. Penney, for one, feared that this would likely prove to be beyond the financial resources of Britain's war-ravaged economy. The successful British hydrogen bomb programme, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the Sputnik crisis, led to amendment of the United States Atomic Energy Act in 1958, and a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E

25|$|Emmer wheat (triticum dicoccum) was {{initially}} {{the most widespread}} variety of wheat, as it grew well in the warm climate and was resistant to fungal rot. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> yielding, with large grains and relatively high amounts of gluten, and bread made from emmer wheat flour was thus fairly light in texture. However, emmer required time-consuming pounding or roasting to remove its husk, and during the Iron Age, durum wheat (triticum durum), a descendent of emmer, gradually replaced emmer and became the favored grain for making fine flour. Durum grew well in the rich soil of the larger valleys of the central and northern areas of the country, where rainfall exceeded 225 millimeters per year, was higher yielding than emmer, and its grains released more easily from the chaff. It could therefore {{be separated from the}} husk without roasting or pounding first, thus reducing the work required for threshing, and also leaving most of the grains whole, which was better for longer storage.|$|E

25|$|The {{abutments}} {{of modern}} London Bridge rest several metres above natural embankments of gravel, sand and clay. From the late Neolithic era the southern embankment formed a natural causeway above the surrounding swamp and marsh of the river's estuary; the northern ascended to higher {{ground at the}} present site of Cornhill. Between the embankments, the River Thames could have been crossed by ford when the tide was low, or ferry when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>high.</b> Both embankments, particularly the northern, would have offered stable backheads for boat traffic up and downstream – the Thames and its estuary were a major inland and Continental trade route from at least the 9th century BC. There is archaeological evidence for scattered Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement nearby, but until a bridge was built there, London did not exist. Two ancient fords were in use a few miles upstream, beyond the river's upper tidal reach. It seems that the course of Watling Street was aligned with them and led into the heartlands of the Catuvellauni, {{who at the time}} of Caesar's invasion of 54 BC were Britain's most powerful tribe. Some time before Claudius's conquest of AD 43, power shifted to the Trinovantes, who held the region northeast of the Thames Estuary from a capital at Camulodunum, nowadays Colchester in Essex. Claudius imposed a major colonia on Camulodunum, and made it the capital city of the new Roman province of Britannia. The first London Bridge was built by the Romans as part of their road-building programme, to help consolidate their conquest.|$|E
25|$|In 1910, Rusk led an {{expedition}} to Mount McKinley and when he returned, they moved {{to the area of}} Grants Pass in Oregon where his parents were living. There, he helped his parents, working in their Lucky Spot gold mine. In 1912, he moved back to Washington, to the Yakima Valley. He became the editor of the Benton Independent published in Prosser, a position he held for a year before selling the paper and resuming law practice. He continued his practice until the spring of 1915 when he was appointed to a four-year term as the receiver for the United States Land Office in Yakima. During his time in the Yakima Valley, Rusk became a vocal conservationist. He was an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt and started a local campaign to get Mount Adams set aside as a national park. He felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> time that it got the recognition it deserved and in 1919, he wrote the short booklet Mount Adams–Towering Sentinel of the Lower Columbia Basin, in which he laid out his case for the Yakima National Park as he called it. In 1920, Rusk was {{a founding member of the}} Cascadians mountaineering club and became its first president. Later, he also served as the chairman of the outing committee. Some of his closest friends he met while a member of the club. In 1922, the members of the Cascadians presented Rusk with a Swiss ice-axe as a gift for being an inspiring leader and being the first president of the club.|$|E
25|$|Even well-intentioned support can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} care recipient's psychological adjustment to stressful events {{if it is}} inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights {{the fact that the}} care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle the stressor by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but lowered levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the responsiveness of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness. That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of support hinges on responsiveness.|$|E

Some time later, Ann Wood repeated this under-flying – without realising that this time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>high</b> tide and there was [...] less headroom but she just squeezed through.

2500|$|On this background, in April 1839, {{the spiritual}} {{leadership}} of the Hamburg Temple decided to draft a second edition of its prayerbook, indeed the only new Reform liturgy since the former.

The commission in charge comprised Gotthold Salomon, Eduard Kley, Bresselau and Fränkel.

They declared that the new tome must express the [...] "pure teaching of out ancestral religion", and all that contrasted it [...] "must be removed." [...] In comparison to the Wissenschaft-inspired rabbinical cadre the Hamburg commission was still quite dilettante, lacking a well-defined ideological stance, a matter which little concerned them. It also had to accommodate a diverse congregation and maintain its legitimacy within the wider community. [...] "Not a few" [...] among its constituents, as Meyer commented, were rather conservative, even strictly observant, and had no interest in far-reaching modifications.
