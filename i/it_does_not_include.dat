5|$|As Grameen {{bank has}} {{developed}} and expanded {{in the years}} since its beginning, it continues to operate on those same two principles. Today, Grameen bank still assumes that when individuals are provided credit, {{they will be able to}} initiate upward social mobility for themselves through entrepreneurial endeavours. As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a list}} of membranophones used in the Caribbean music area, {{including}} the islands of the Caribbean Sea, as well as the musics of Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Belize, Garifuna music, and Bermuda. It only includes membranophones that are indigenous to the local music area or are a vital and long-standing part of local culture. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> membranophones that are, for example, a part of Western style orchestras, nor does it include trap sets and other common membranophones used in popular music recordings of many genres across the world. Almost all membranophones are drums and percussion instruments.|$|E
5|$|The genus Carcharocles may be invalid, and {{the shark}} may {{actually}} {{belong in the}} genus Otodus, making it Otodus megalodon. A 1974 study on Paleogene sharks by Henri Cappetta erected the subgenus Megaselachus, classifying the shark as Otodus (Megaselachus) megalodon, along with O. (M.) chubutensis. A 2006 review of Chondrichthyes elevated Megaselachus to genus, and classified the sharks as Megaselachus megalodon and M. chubutensis. The discovery of fossils assigned to the genus Megalolamna in 2016 led to a re-evaluation of Otodus, which concluded that it is paraphyletic, that is, it consists of a last common ancestor but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> all of its descendants. The inclusion of the Carcharocles sharks in Otodus would make it monophyletic, with the sister clade being Megalolamna. There was one apparent description of the shark in 1881 classifying it as Selache manzonii.|$|E
5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to all other}} modern theories of fundamental interactions, general relativity is a classical theory: <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> the effects of quantum physics. The quest for a quantum version of general relativity addresses {{one of the most}} fundamental open questions in physics. While there are promising candidates for such a theory of quantum gravity, notably string theory and loop quantum gravity, there is at present no consistent and complete theory. It has long been hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would also eliminate another problematic feature of general relativity: the presence of spacetime singularities. These singularities are boundaries ("sharp edges") of spacetime at which geometry becomes ill-defined, with the consequence that general relativity itself loses its predictive power. Furthermore, there are so-called singularity theorems which predict that such singularities must exist within the universe if the laws of general relativity were to hold without any quantum modifications. The best-known examples are the singularities associated with the model universes that describe black holes {{and the beginning of the}} universe.|$|E
