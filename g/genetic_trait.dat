5|$|The {{content is}} divided into five parts. The first part, Ancient Balances, {{considers}} psychological and historical aspects of debt. Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived {{from a sense of}} need or greed and a sense of fairness in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal that suggests a sense of fairness may be a <b>genetic</b> <b>trait</b> shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E

Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully believe that a serial killer from the 1940s passed his <b>genetic</b> <b>trait</b> of violence to his grandchild after a detective, BJ Morrow (Deborah Strang) mysteriously uncovers the remains of an FBI agent who disappeared almost fifty years before while investigating a modern-day murder case similar to the older cold case.|$|E

5|$|Population {{studies from}} {{numerous}} {{areas in the}} world have shown that HHT occurs at roughly the same rate in almost all populations: somewhere around 1 in 5000. In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a founder effect, in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate of a particular <b>genetic</b> <b>trait</b> because one of these ancestors harbored this trait. In Haut Jura, this {{has been shown to be}} the result of a particular ACVRL1 mutation (named c.1112dupG or c.1112_1113insG). The highest rate of HHT is 1:1331, reported in Bonaire and Curaçao, two islands in the Caribbean belonging to the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E

40|$|A set of 12 anthropometric {{measures}} and six <b>genetic</b> <b>traits,</b> available for 520 Yanomama Indians from 19 villages in nine clusters, {{were used to}} allocate individuals to villages. On the basis of anthropometrics alone, 36 % of the individuals were allocated to the right village and 60 % to the right cluster. On the basis of <b>genetic</b> <b>traits</b> alone, 16 % were allocated to the right village and 26 % to the right cluster. A combination of all 18 characters yielded 41 % allocation to the right village and 63 % to the right cluster. Of the 924 possible combinations of six anthropometric measures, only one provided poorer resolution than did the six <b>genetic</b> <b>traits.</b> We explain the better resolution of the anthropometric traits by noting that the anthropometric traits are not totally heritable and that <b>genetic</b> <b>traits</b> are not continuously distributed. Randomization studies indicated {{that all of the}} observed correct-allocation fractions are far in excess of random expectation. We infer that the village phenotype distributions overlap only partially, and that they represent real and substantial population differentiation...|$|R

Selene and Michael work together to evade the Lycans, and understand Michael's significance to the conflict. He is eventually captured by the Lycans, who take him to Lucian.|$|E

Conversely, SIT1 mutations are believed to result in full expression of iminoglycinuria in some cases where heterozygous mutations of PAT2 would otherwise have only been sufficient to cause hyperglycinuria.|$|E

25|$|H. pylori can infect {{the stomach}} {{of some people}} without causing stomach ulcers. In {{investigating}} asymptomatic carriers of H. pylori, researchers identified a <b>genetic</b> <b>trait</b> called Interleuik-1 beta-31 which causes increased production of stomach acid, resulting in ulcers if patients become infected with H. pylori. Patients without the trait do not develop stomach ulcers in response to H. pylori infection, but instead have increased risk from stomach cancer if they become infected. Investigation into other gastrointestinal infections has also shown that the symptoms {{are the result of}} interaction between the infection and specific genetic mutations in the host.|$|E
25|$|Since November 19, 2004, {{there have}} been over 2,800 {{incidents}} of lasers directed at aircraft within the United States. These concerns have led to an inquiry in the US Congress. Exposure to hand-held laser light under such circumstances may seem trivial given the brevity of exposure, the large distances involved and beam spread of up to several metres. However, laser exposure may create dangerous conditions such as flash blindness. If this occurs during a critical moment in aircraft operation, the aircraft may be endangered. In addition, some 18% to 35% of the population possess the autosomal dominant <b>genetic</b> <b>trait,</b> photic sneeze, that causes the affected individual to experience an involuntary sneezing fit when exposed to a sudden flash of light. Some observers believe that the danger is greatly exaggerated, at least for small hand-held lasers.|$|E

When the Fringe team arrives, Olivia (Anna Torv) identifies that all the victims were from the groom's side, whose grandmother was a Holocaust survivor - [...] and Walter (John Noble) surmises {{that they were all}} killed via their shared genetic traits. Later, a similar mass death occurs at a coffee shop, in which Walter recognizes the victims all had brown eyes, another common <b>genetic</b> <b>trait.</b> From fingerprints found at the scene, they discover the culprit is Alfred Hoffman (Craig Robert Young), a Nazi scientist apparently somehow over 100 years old. Walter realizes that the man likely worked with his own father, Robert Bishoff (a German scientist who defected to the US in 1943 and anglicised his name), in creating a chemical agent that, once heated as a gas, could be used to target any specific trait using DNA from the target subject - especially those not of the master race. Though Walter originally had his father's files on the subject, his son Peter (Joshua Jackson), 10 years earlier, had sold them; Peter tries to recover the files but finds some have been used by an artist to create sensationalism art, causing Walter to become distraught.|$|E

2500|$|Twins are a {{valuable}} source for observation because they allow {{the study of}} environmental influence and varying genetic makeup: [...] "identical" [...] or monozygotic (MZ) [...] twins share nearly 100% of their genes, which means that most differences between the twins (such as height, susceptibility to boredom, intelligence, depression, etc.) are due to experiences that one twin has but not the other twin. [...] "Fraternal" [...] or dizygotic (DZ) twins share only about 50% of their genes, the same as any other sibling. Twins also share many aspects of their environment (e.g., uterine environment, parenting style, education, wealth, culture, community) because they are born into the same family.
