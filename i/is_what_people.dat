[...] For the finale, Thomas promised [...] "80 percent total satisfaction. People will know who killed Lilly Kane. And there won't be that twist at the end that 'perhaps they didn't do it.' I'm {{not going to be}} leaving people like that. However, {{at the end of the}} episode, it gives us a pretty big cliffhanger {{question}} as well." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the novel was {{published}} in the United Kingdom, The Guardian ran an article about French best-sellers published in English, focusing on The Elegance of the Hedgehog. In it, writer Alison Flood contended that [...] "fiction in translation is not an easy sell to Brits, and French fiction is perhaps the hardest sell of all". Promotions buyer Jonathan Ruppin predicted that the novel would struggle to gain a readership in the United Kingdom because, according to him, in the UK market [...] "the plot <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> want more than anything else" [...] and the novel's storyline is not its central aspect.|$|E

The end of the song segued into the beginning of [...] "Zoo Station", leading concert historian Pimm Jal de la Parra to speculate that it was being considered to open the set. In 2006, The Edge said [...] "it never became a live favourite... I don't think that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> come to U2 for." [...] In 2012, Willie Williams, U2's lighting designer and concert director, described the rehearsed version as [...] "extremely dramatic", saying [...] "in a stadium situation {{it could be argued}} that it might have the same dramatic impact as walking out on stage and telling the audience to fuck off." ...|$|E

500|$|Gaudí {{had a deep}} {{appreciation}} for his native land and great pride in his Mediterranean heritage. He believed Mediterranean people to be endowed with creativity, originality and an innate sense for art and design. Gaudí reportedly described this distinction by stating, [...] "We own the image. Fantasy comes from the ghosts. Fantasy <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> in the North own. We are concrete. The image comes from the Mediterranean. Orestes knows his way, where Hamlet is torn apart by his doubts." [...] Time spent outdoors, particularly during summer stays in the Gaudí family home Mas de la Calderera, afforded Gaudí the opportunity to study nature. Gaudí's enjoyment {{of the natural world}} led him to join the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya in 1879 at the age of 27. The organisation arranged expeditions to explore Catalonia and southern France, often riding on horseback or walking ten kilometres a day.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about {{the inspiration for the}} song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> want to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|E

500|$|After the film's release, {{there was}} {{criticism}} in Uganda of {{its failure to}} state more clearly that Kony and his forces fled northern Uganda in 2006 and were dispersed across the jungles of three neighbouring countries. Fred Opolot, spokesman for the Ugandan government, said, [...] "It is totally misleading {{to suggest that the}} war is still in Uganda." [...] Arthur Larok, ActionAid's director in Uganda, said, [...] "It doesn't sound like a fair representation of Uganda. We have challenges within the country, but certainly the perception of a country at war is not accurate at all." [...] Dr Beatrice Mpora, director of a community health organization in Gulu, commented, [...] "There has not been a single soul from the LRA here since 2006. Now we have peace, people are back in their homes, they are planting their fields, they are starting their businesses. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> should help us with." [...] Prime Minister of Uganda Amama Mbabazi launched an online response on YouTube, in which he seeks to correct the [...] "false impression" [...] that Uganda is still at war, and invites everyone to visit the country, assuring that people would find it [...] "a very different place to that portrayed by Invisible Children". Meanwhile, dozens of members of Ugandan diaspora in United States protested outside the Invisible Children offices in San Diego, also criticizing the video but saying Kony represents [...] "only three percent of all the problems" [...] in their home country and lambasting the Ugandan government for its inadequate response to Kony's terror and other issues.|$|E

[...] Under the pressure, Dole admitted during an October 1995 press briefing on Capitol Hill that he regretted the decision to return the check, and that his campaign was responsible for it without consulting him. [...] "I think if they'd have consulted me, we wouldn't have done that, wouldn't have returned it," [...] Dole said. Dole later told Washington Post editor and author Bob Woodward that the LCR episode was a [...] "mistake" [...] because the decision to return the check [...] "gets into Bob Dole the person.

High continues that an eagle sits on the branches of Yggdrasil and that it has much knowledge. Between the eyes of the eagle sits a hawk called Veðrfölnir. A squirrel called Ratatoskr scurries up and down the ash Yggdrasil carrying [...] "malicious messages" [...] between the eagle and Níðhöggr. Four stags named Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr, and Duraþrór run between the branches of Yggdrasil and consume its foliage. In the spring Hvergelmir are so many snakes along with Níðhöggr [...] "that no tongue can enumerate them". Two stanzas from Grímnismál are then cited in support. High continues that the norns that live by the holy well Urðarbrunnr each day take water from the well and mud from around it and pour it over Yggdrasil so that the branches of the ash do not rot away or decay. High provides more information about Urðarbrunnr, cites a stanza from Völuspá in support, and adds that dew falls from Yggdrasil to the earth, explaining that [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> call honeydew, and from it bees feed".|$|E

Manila Bulletin gave Nina Reborn positive response, saying [...] "Nina as a powerhouse singer is a given, but the seeming restraint she demonstrated that night was just as effective and lent her vocals more heft and soul." [...] The Philippine Star stated, [...] "Nina {{is one of those}} interpreters who can take on any song [...] The results are very good." [...] All Good consists mostly of original songs, with five cover versions of OPM classics. The album was a critical acclaim, with The Philippine Star explaining that its purpose is [...] "not to surpass her previous achievements, but to empower its belief that [...] has more to offer as a recording artist." [...] Journal praised the album's sound, stating [...] "A more mature Nina <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>people</b> will hear [...] All Good is a suite of beautiful songs."
