2500|$|An {{attendee}} at the 1891 fungus foray was Alfred Watkins, subsequently {{to become}} {{a president of the}} club. Watkins was a keen photographer and archaeologist. In June 1921, whilst mapping old sites near Blackwardine, Watkins noticed some surprising alignments which suggested to him a series of prehistoric trackways marked by ancient landmarks some of which were still visible. Later that year, he delivered a talk to the club on [...] "Early British Trackways" [...] and after <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> published his thesis and his findings in The Old Straight Track (1925). His book was not well received by academics, but Watkins' theory of ley lines gained followers and a resurgence of interest in the 1970s, when it acquired a mystic dimension which would have surprised Watkins himself.|$|E
2500|$|This {{debate was}} {{concurrent}} with {{that over the}} book On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, and was evidently related; but was not one in which Charles Darwin initially made his own views public. Consolidation of the [...] "antiquity of man" [...] required more work, with stricter methods; and this proved possible {{over the next two}} decades. The discoveries of Boucher de Perthes therefore motivated <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> to try to repeat and confirm the findings at other sites. Significant in this were excavations by William Pengelly at Brixham Cavern, and with a systematic approach at Kents Cavern (1865–1880). Another major project, which produced quicker findings, was that of Henry Christy and Édouard Lartet. Lartet in 1860 had published results from a cave near Massat (Ariège) claiming stone tool cuts on bones of extinct mammals, made when the bones were fresh.|$|E
2500|$|Kittredge's {{edition of}} Shakespeare was the {{standard}} well beyond {{his death and}} continues to be cited occasionally. He was also arguably the leading critic of Geoffrey Chaucer of his time and is considered largely responsible for the introduction of Chaucer as a standard part of the college English curriculum. His essay on [...] "Chaucer's Discussion of Marriage" [...] (1912) has traditionally been credited with introducing the idea of the [...] "marriage group" [...] in the Canterbury Tales, though he was not the originator of this phrase. Through his historical researches Kittredge also identified Thomas Malory, author of Le Morte d'Arthur (1985), and hitherto an obscure figure, with a knight and member of Parliament who served with the Earl of Warwick, a discovery that paved the way for <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> on Malory by Edward Hicks, to whose 1928 book on Malory's turbulent career [...] Kittredge supplied the introduction. Kittredge's [...] work on Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was influential as well.|$|E

6000|$|His work? What {{work had}} he now? It {{seemed to be}} done; for {{attending}} scientific meetings, receiving dividends, playing the country squire's only son and the wealthy host whilst awaiting the title which Mary wished for--these things are not work, and somehow his days were so arranged that he was never allowed to go beyond them. All <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> and experiments were discouraged. What did it matter if he were unfitted for that which {{he could no longer}} do? His work was finished. There it stood before him in that box, stamped [...] "Monk's aerophone. The Twin. No. 3412." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{long day}} had {{convinced}} Geraldine that the pleasantness of intercourse with the Whites was over, {{and she was}} not sorry that a letter was waiting for Clement to say that the rheumatic clergyman would arrive, if desired, in another week. This was gladly accepted, and the question remained, whither should they go? Clement's year of absence would be over in June, and he was anxious to get home; besides that, it was desirable to take Francie to her mother as soon as possible. The only cause for delay was the possibility of Gerald's extracting something further from his mother, which might lead to <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> on the Continent; but as most places were readily accessible from London, this was decided against, and it was determined to go back to Brompton {{at the same time as}} the Rotherwoods returned from San Remo.|$|E

60|$|<b>Further</b> <b>researches</b> {{into the}} well being out of the question, their {{next step was to}} make a {{thorough}} inspection of the chapel-cave itself. They examined the walls inch by inch, tapping them with a hammer to hear if they sounded hollow, but without result. They examined the altar, but it proved to be a solid mass of rock. By the help of a little ladder they had made, they examined the crucifix, and discovered that the white figure on the cross had evidently been fashioned out of some heathen statue of soft limestone, for at its back were the remains of draperies, and long hair which the artist had not thought it necessary to cut away. Also, they found that the arms had been added, and were of a slightly different stone, and that the weight of the figure was taken partly by an iron staple which supported the body, and partly by strong copper wire twisted to resemble cord, and painted white, which was passed round the wrists and supported the arms. This wire ran through loops of rock cut in the traverse of the cross, that itself was only raised in relief by chiselling away the solid stone behind.|$|E
60|$|After breakfast, we all walked out, and, {{crossing}} the English Bridge, {{looked at the}} Severn over its parapet. The river is here broader than elsewhere, and very shallow, and has an island covered with bushes, about midway across. Just over the bridge we saw a church, of red freestone, and evidently very ancient. This is the Church of the Holy Cross, and is {{a portion of the}} Abbey of St. Peter and St. John, which formerly covered ten acres of ground. We did not have time to go into the church; but the windows and other points of architecture, so far as we could discern them, and knew how to admire them, were exceedingly venerable and beautiful. On {{the other side of the}} street, over a wide space, there are other remains of the old abbey; and the most interesting was a stone pulpit, now standing in the open air, seemingly in a garden, but which originally stood in the refectory of the abbey, and was the station whence one of the monks read to his brethren at their meals. The pulpit is much overgrown with ivy. We should have made <b>further</b> <b>researches</b> among these remains, though they seem now to be in private grounds; but a large mastiff came nut of his kennel, and, approaching us to the length of his iron chain, began barking very fiercely. Nor had we time to see half that we would gladly have seen and studied here and elsewhere about Shrewsbury. It would have been very interesting to have visited Hotspur's and Falstaff's battle-field, which is four miles from the town; too distant, certainly, for Falstaff to have measured the length of the fight by Shrewsbury clock. There is now a church, built there by Henry IV., and said to cover the bones of those slain in the battle.|$|E
