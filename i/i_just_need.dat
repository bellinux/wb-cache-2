So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while.

I'm having a lot of fun with that one." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E

[...] Bajo says, [...] "It's always gameplay for me. I don't care what the game is about, if the gameplay is engaging, challenging, and interesting to me, I will play the hell out of it and I'll love it. Second, for me it needs a good story. I'm also a graphics whore, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> it to look good." [...] Bajo and Hex stressed {{that there is no such}} thing as a [...] "boy's game" [...] or a [...] "girl's game", and that one should decide to play a game merely based on how good it is.|$|E

Stiefvater wrote on Tumblr, [...] "You can have your own opinions on Green's books and Internet presence, {{but the fact remains that}} he is a very real positive influence on thousands of teens. You're not just making sure you can't have nice things. You're taking away other people's nice things." [...] In a subsequent email to USA Today, Stiefvater stated, [...] "I had to say something.
