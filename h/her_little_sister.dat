500|$|According to Artani, [...] "Everytime" [...] {{was written}} in large part as a {{response}} to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] as well as various radio interviews. Artani explained, [...] "He was getting personal.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of <b>her</b> <b>little</b> <b>sister</b> is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E

The two have a strictly physical affair, but Kelly ends it out of loyalty to Brenda. Upon returning from Paris, Dylan and Brenda reunite.

2500|$|The iconic {{explosion}} overlay most {{associated with}} the TV show was introduced after the third episode to mask the cut point between the Diana and Wonder Woman clips, meaning they no longer needed to be perfectly aligned. This allowed them to be shot without a locked off camera at more convenient points in the production schedule, when Carter {{was already in the}} appropriate costume. [...] The slow motion aspect of the sequence was dropped, and Wonder Woman was no longer left holding her Diana Prince clothes. [...] A thunderclap sound effect accompanied the explosion effect; both the explosion flash and its sound are apparently non-diegetic (only heard by the audience, not within the narrative world), as demonstrated by Diana changing unnoticed in a dormitory of sleeping women, in adjoining office spaces, etc. [...] Generally the audience never sees Wonder Woman change back to Diana Prince, although there is one occasion when it is almost shown: Wonder Woman reveals her secret identity to <b>her</b> <b>little</b> <b>sister</b> Drusilla by slowly turning on the spot, but the actual moment of transformation is masked by a cut-away reaction shot of Drusilla (no thunderclap was heard) ...|$|E

60|$|The Holy Week {{was calm}} and grave; {{and the two}} girls, with Anna Vanderkist and <b>her</b> <b>little</b> <b>sisters,</b> were very happy over their primroses and anemones on Easter Eve, with the {{beautiful}} Altar Cross {{that no one could}} manage like Aunt Cherry, whose work was confined to that, and to the two crosses on the graves.|$|R
60|$|Now {{this was}} a sly hit at Ingeborg, who was sitting by, for she was well known to have a shrewish temper, and to be self-willed and opinionated, in so much that most men kept out of her way.

60|$|Nothing {{could be}} more passive than Miss Conway. She could not {{remember}} her mother, but her childhood had been passed under an admirable governess; and though her own Miss Longman had left her, Miss King, the successor, was a person worthy of her chief confidence. At two-and-twenty, the school-room was still the home of her affections, and her ardent love was lavished on <b>her</b> <b>little</b> <b>sisters</b> and <b>her</b> brother Walter.|$|R
