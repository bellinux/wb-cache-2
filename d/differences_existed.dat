5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender <b>differences</b> <b>existed</b> in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E

25|$|Traditional peasant {{clothing}} in Suvalkija, while {{consisting of the}} same basic items, can be clearly differentiated from {{clothing in}} other parts of Lithuania. Because the region was relatively wealthier, the clothes were richer in color, decoration, and ornament. They were also made of better and more expensive materials, including brocade, silk, wool, and damask. Regional <b>differences</b> <b>existed</b> even within Suvalkija. Kapsai women wore long, wide dress garments with large designs of stars and tulips, semidark in colour and partially striped.

25|$|In 1814, {{leaders such}} as Luther Rice were able to help Baptists unify nationally under what became known informally as the Triennial Convention (because it met every three years) based in Philadelphia. It allowed them to join their {{resources}} to support missions abroad. The Home Mission Society, affiliated with the Triennial Convention, was established in 1832 to support missions in frontier territories of the United States. By the mid-19th century, numerous social, cultural, economic, and political <b>differences</b> <b>existed</b> among business owners of the North, farmers of the West, and planters of the South. The most divisive conflict was primarily over the deep sectional issue of slavery and secondarily over missions.|$|E
25|$|Although the Tang dynasty (618–907) capital at Chang'an was {{the most}} {{thriving}} metropolis of China in its day, it was the city of Yangzhou—in proximity to the Grand Canal—that was the economic hub of the Tang era. Besides being the headquarters for the government salt monopoly and the largest pre-modern industrial production center of the empire, Yangzhou was also the geographical midpoint along the north-south trade axis, and so became the major center for southern goods shipped north. One of the greatest benefits of the canal system in the Tang dynasty—and subsequent dynasties—was that it reduced the cost of shipping grain that had been collected in taxes from the Yangtze River Delta to northern China. Minor additions to the canal were made after the Sui period {{to cut down on}} travel time, but overall no fundamental <b>differences</b> <b>existed</b> between the Sui Grand Canal and the Tang Grand Canal.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} uniform for {{the majority}} of regiments throughout the period was the traditional red coat. There was no standardised supply for uniforms, and it was generally left to the regimental colonel to contract for and obtain uniforms for his men, which allowed for some regimental variation. Generally, this was in the form of specific regimental badges, or ornamentation for specialised flank companies, but occasionally major <b>differences</b> <b>existed.</b> Highland regiments generally wore kilts and ostrich feather hats, although six of these regiments exchanged the kilt for regulation trousers or tartan trews in 1809. Officers of Highland regiments wore a crimson silk sash worn from the left shoulder to the right hip. Regimental tartans were worn but they were all derived from the Black Watch tartan. White, yellow or red lines were added to distinguish between regiments. Trousers for the rank and file were generally of white cotton duck canvas for summer use, and grey woolen trousers were issued for winter wear, although considerable variation exists in the color of the woolen trousers. Originally, the white trousers were cut as overalls, designed to be worn to protect the expensive breeches and gaiters worn by the rank and file, although on campaign, they were often worn by themselves; a practice which was later permitted except on parade. Soldiers were also issued with grey greatcoats starting in 1803.|$|E

The children were presented with a multiple-choice picture identification test and an interview to determine the extent of their knowledge of current affairs. The seven major purposes to this study are: (1) to determine if any <b>differences</b> <b>exist</b> between the concept formation of current affairs between the low- and middle-class children, (2) to determine if any <b>differences</b> <b>exist</b> between the current affairs concepts as a variant of sex, (3) to determine if <b>differences</b> <b>exist</b> in current affairs concepts between age groups, (4) to determine if any <b>differences</b> <b>exist</b> with regard to current affairs concepts relevant to difference in intelligence and mental age, (5) to determine if <b>differences</b> <b>exist</b> in the extent of recall vs. true conceptualization of current affairs relating to two lasting news stories (namely the Vietnam War and the space program), (6) to determine if <b>differences</b> <b>exist</b> in regard to the knowledge of war events when compared with the personal knowledge of a person in Vietnam, and (7) to determine if <b>differences</b> <b>exist</b> in relation to the amount of time the child spends watching television newscasts and other related programs and his amount of knowledge concerning current affairs.

2500|$|The current {{received}} text finally achieved predominance {{through the}} reputation of the Masoretes, schools of scribes and Torah scholars working between the 7th and 11th centuries, based primarily in the Land of Israel in the cities of Tiberias and Jerusalem, and in Babylonia. According to Menachem Cohen these schools developed such prestige for the accuracy and error-control of their copying techniques that their texts established an authority beyond all others. [...] Differences remained, sometimes bolstered by systematic local differences in pronunciation and cantillation. Every locality, following the tradition of its school, had a standard codex embodying its readings. [...] In Babylonia the school of Sura differed from that of Nehardea; and similar <b>differences</b> <b>existed</b> in the schools of the Land of Israel as against that at Tiberias, which in later times increasingly became the chief seat of learning. In this period living tradition ceased, and the Masoretes in preparing their codices usually followed the one school or the other, examining, however, standard codices of other schools and noting their differences.|$|E
