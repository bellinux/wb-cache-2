5|$|Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, {{is a large}} <b>disk-shaped</b> barred-spiral galaxy about 30kiloparsecs in {{diameter}} and a kiloparsec thick. It contains about two hundred billion (2×1011) stars and has a total mass of about six hundred billion (6×1011) times {{the mass of the}} Sun.|$|E
5|$|<b>Disk-shaped</b> LC {{molecules}} can orient {{themselves in}} a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.|$|E
5|$|The two lions have a male mane, {{patterned}} with dense, short lines; the manes continue beneath the body. Distinctly patterned tufts of hair grow from the lion's ears {{and on their}} shoulders, emanating from a central <b>disk-shaped</b> whorl. They lie prone, their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, but {{with a degree of}} artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed.|$|E
5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are <b>disk-shaped</b> blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E
5|$|French {{astronomer}} Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while {{searching for}} objects that would confuse comet hunters. The second brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster, M87 is located about 16.4 million parsecs (53.5 million light-years) from Earth. Unlike a <b>disk-shaped</b> spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, {{it has an}} almost featureless, ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre. Forming around one sixth of M87's mass, the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution, their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core. At the core is an active supermassive black hole, which forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus. This object is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. M87's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs (490,000 light-years), {{where it has been}} truncated—possibly by an encounter with another galaxy. Between the stars is a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip {{from one side to}} another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had <b>disk-shaped</b> plates on its hips.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a <b>disk-shaped</b> complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Ammolite {{comes from}} the fossil shells of the Upper Cretaceous <b>disk-shaped</b> ammonites Placenticeras meeki and Placenticeras intercalare, and (to a lesser degree) the {{cylindrical}} baculite, Baculites compressus. Ammonites were cephalopods, that thrived in tropical seas until becoming extinct along with the dinosaurs {{at the end of}} the Mesozoic era.|$|E
25|$|Medieval maps of {{the world}} in Europe were mainly {{symbolic}} in form {{along the lines of the}} much earlier Babylonian World Map. Known as Mappa Mundi (clothes of the world) these maps were circular or symmetrical cosmological diagrams representing the Earth's single land mass as <b>disk-shaped</b> and surrounded by ocean.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} Earth follows the major events in Earth's past {{based on the}} geologic time scale, a system of chronological measurement based {{on the study of}} the planet's rock layers (stratigraphy). Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago by accretion from the solar nebula, a <b>disk-shaped</b> mass of dust and gas left over from the formation of the Sun, which also created the rest of the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, Galactocentrism is {{the theory}} that our sun is {{at or near the}} center of the galaxy. Observations by William Herschel in 1785 {{indicated}} that the Milky Way was a separate <b>disk-shaped</b> galaxy with the sun in a central position. Although proved incorrect by Harlow Shapley in 1918, the theory was a step in the development of cosmological models as the speculation of the existence of other galaxies, comparable in size and structure to our own, placed the earth in its proper perspective with respect to the rest of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Early {{steps in}} the {{development}} of intellectual thought in ancient Greece belonged to Ionians from their well-known city of Miletus in Asia Minor. Miletus was placed favourably to absorb aspects of Babylonian knowledge and to profit from the expanding commerce of the Mediterranean. The earliest ancient Greek who is said to have constructed a map of the world is Anaximander of Miletus (c. 611–546 BC), pupil of Thales. He believed that the earth was a cylindrical form, like a stone pillar and suspended in space. The inhabited part of his world was circular, <b>disk-shaped,</b> and presumably located on the upper surface of the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Coins were minted in the Achaemenid Empire, {{including}} the gold darics and silver sigloi. With the Achemenid conquest of Gandhara under Darius the Great c. 520 BC, the practice {{spread to the}} Indo-Gangetic Plain. The coins of this period were called Puranas, Karshapanas or Pana. These earliest Indian coins, however, are unlike those circulated in Persia, which were derived from the Greek/Anatolian type; they not <b>disk-shaped</b> but rather stamped bars of metal, suggesting that the innovation of stamped currency was added to a pre-existing form of token currency which had already been present in the Mahajanapada kingdoms of the Indian Iron Age. Mahajanapadas that minted their own coins included Gandhara, Kuntala, Kuru, Panchala, Shakya, Surasena and Surashtra.|$|E
25|$|Perforated antler objects {{discovered}} at Dereivka and other sites contemporary with Suvorovo {{have been identified}} as cheekpieces or ‘’psalia’’ for horse bits. This identification is no longer widely accepted, as the objects in question have not been found associated with horse bones, and could have had a variety of other functions. However, through studies of microscopic wear, it has been established that many of the bone tools at Botai were used to smooth rawhide thongs, and rawhide thongs might have been used to manufacture of rawhide cords and ropes, useful for horse tack. Similar bone thong-smoothers are known from many other steppe settlements, but it cannot be known how the thongs were used. The oldest artifacts clearly identified as horse tack—bits, bridles, cheekpieces, or any other kind of horse gear—are the antler <b>disk-shaped</b> cheekpieces associated with the invention of the chariot, at the Sintashta-Petrovka sites.|$|E
25|$|Japan Air Lines flight 1628 was a UFO {{incident}} that occurred on November 17, 1986 involving a Japanese Boeing 747 cargo aircraft. The aircraft {{was en route}} from Paris to Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, with a cargo of Beaujolais wine. On the Reykjavík to Anchorage section of the flight, at 17:11 over eastern Alaska, the crew first witnessed two unidentified objects to their left. These abruptly rose from below and closed in to escort their aircraft. Each had two rectangular arrays of {{what appeared to be}} glowing nozzles or thrusters, though their bodies remained obscured by darkness. When closest, the aircraft's cabin was lit up and the captain could feel their heat on his face. These two craft departed before a third, much larger <b>disk-shaped</b> object started trailing them, causing the pilots to request a change of course. Anchorage Air Traffic Control obliged and requested an oncoming United Airlines flight to confirm the unidentified traffic, but when it and a military craft sighted JAL 1628 at about 17:51, no other craft could be distinguished. The sighting of 50 minutes ended in the vicinity of Denali (formerly Mount McKinley).|$|E
500|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} have flat <b>disk-shaped</b> bodies, deep blue or black with white spots on {{top with a}} white underbelly, and {{distinctive}} flat snouts similar to a duck's bill. Their tails are longer than those of other rays and may have 2–6 venomous spines, just behind the pelvic fins. The front half of the long and wing-like [...] disk has five small gills in its underside.|$|E
500|$|The Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar was a VTOL {{aircraft}} {{developed by}} Avro Canada {{as part of}} a secret U.S. military project carried out {{in the early years of}} the Cold War. [...] The Avrocar intended to exploit the Coandă effect to provide lift and thrust from a single [...] "turborotor" [...] blowing exhaust out the rim of the <b>disk-shaped</b> aircraft to provide lift. In the air, it would have resembled a flying saucer.|$|E
500|$|The {{early stages}} of fruit body {{development}} {{can be divided into}} four discrete stages. In the first, <b>disk-shaped</b> knots measuring [...] appear {{on the surface of the}} substrate. As the knot expands in size, a primordial stipe emerges from its center. The stipe lengthens, orients upward, and two types of hyphal elements develop: long, straight and smooth basal hairy hyphae and short stipe hyphae, some of which are inflated and project out of a cohesive layer of tightly packed hyphal elements. In the final stage, which occurs when the stipe is [...] long, immature caps appear that have ridges and pits with distinct filament-like paraphyses. Extracellular mucilage that covers the ridge layer imparts shape and rigidity to the tissue and probably protects it against dehydration.|$|E
500|$|In late 1953, a {{group of}} U.S. defence experts visited Avro Canada to view the new CF-100 fighter jet. Somewhere along the way, Frost co-opted the tour and rerouted it to the Special Projects area where he {{proceeded}} {{to show off the}} Project Y mock-up and models and drawings (some never before seen by senior company officials) for a completely circular <b>disk-shaped</b> aircraft known as [...] "Project Y-2." [...] The USAF agreed to take over funding for Frost's Special Projects Group, and a contract for US$750,000 followed in 1955. By 1956, Avro management was interested enough to commit $2.5 million to build a [...] "private venture" [...] prototype. In March 1957, the Air Force added additional funding, and the aircraft became Weapons System 606A.|$|E
500|$|The Milky Way is {{the galaxy}} that {{contains}} our Solar System. The descriptive [...] "milky" [...] {{is derived from}} the appearance from Earth of the galaxy – a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin , from the Greek [...] ( [...] , [...] "milky circle"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its <b>disk-shaped</b> structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way {{is just one of many}} galaxies.|$|E
500|$|Frost {{felt the}} {{excellent}} {{performance of his}} new engine would be a natural fit for a VTOL aircraft due to its high expected power-to-weight ratio. The problem was {{how to use the}} annular thrust to drive the aircraft forward, as well as the problem of fitting the very large engine into a suitable airframe. Frost suggested using a series of ducts and vents to redirect the thrust flowing out of the front of the engine towards the rear. In order to keep the pipes as short as possible, the design ported the thrust out along the leading edge of what was essentially a thick delta wing. As the engine was <b>disk-shaped,</b> the triangular delta shape was pushed out near the front where it met the engine disk, producing a shape roughly like a spade on a playing card. For this reason the design was also referred to as the [...] "Avro Ace," [...] a likely reference to the Ace of Spades.|$|E
500|$|The Avrocar was a <b>disk-shaped</b> {{aircraft}} {{with the}} same basic shape as a frisbee, the upper surface of the disk being fairly curved, and the bottom much less so. The disk was [...] in diameter and [...] thick. The main structural truss was a large equilateral triangle, to which the various components were attached. The 124-blade [...] "turborotor" [...] sat {{in the center of}} the triangle, with most of the rotor's thrust directed straight down through an opening in the lower surface, but some was bled off to power the control system running along the outer rim of the disk. Power for the rotor was provided by three Continental J69-T-9 jet engines attached to the truss. Each engine had its own fuel and oil tanks and other support systems, although it was expected these would be interconnected in future models. The majority of the airframe was made of aluminum with an empty weight of [...]|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{anthropomorphic}} {{images of}} Shiva, {{he is also}} represented in aniconic form of a lingam. These are depicted in various designs. One common form is {{the shape of a}} vertical rounded column in the centre of a lipped, <b>disk-shaped</b> object, the yoni, symbolism for the goddess Shakti. In Shiva temples, the linga is typically present in its sanctum sanctorum and is the focus of votary offerings such as milk, water, flower petals, fruit, fresh leaves, and rice. According to Monier Williams and Yudit Greenberg, linga literally means [...] "mark, sign or emblem", and also refers to a [...] "mark or sign from which the existence of something else can be reliably inferred". It implies the regenerative divine energy innate in nature, symbolized by Shiva. Some scholars, such as Wendy Doniger, view linga merely as an erotic phallic symbol, although this interpretation is disputed by others, including Swami Vivekananda, Sivananda Saraswati, and S. N. Balagangadhara. According to Moriz Winternitz, the linga in the Shiva tradition is [...] "only a symbol of the productive and creative principle of nature as embodied in Shiva", and it has no historical trace in any obscene phallic cult.|$|E
500|$|Lego Star Wars IIs {{gameplay}} {{is from a}} third-person perspective, {{and takes}} place in a 3D game world that contains objects, environments and characters designed to resemble Lego pieces. Its gameplay—a combination of the action-adventure, platform, and sometimes puzzle genres—shares elements with that of [...] (2005). While Lego Star Wars followed the events of [...] (1999), [...] (2002), and [...] (2005), Lego Star Wars II is based on Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). The game comically retells the trilogy's events using cutscenes without dialogue. The player assumes the roles of the films' characters, each of whom possess specific weapons and abilities. At any time, a second player can join the game, by activating a second controller. During gameplay, players can collect Lego studs [...] small, <b>disk-shaped</b> objects, that serve as the game's currency. The player has a health meter, which is displayed on the game's heads-up display. The player's health is represented by four hearts; when these hearts are depleted the player dies and a small amount of their studs bounce away. However, they instantly respawn and can often re-collect the lost studs.|$|E

2500|$|In {{all of the}} dated chariot graves, {{the heads}} and hooves {{of a pair of}} horses were placed in a grave that once {{contained}} a chariot. Evidence of chariots in these graves was inferred from the impressions of two spoked wheels set in grave floors 1.2–1.6m apart; in most cases the rest of the vehicle left no trace. In addition a pair of <b>disk-shaped</b> antler [...] "cheekpieces," [...] an ancient predecessor to a modern bit shank or bit ring, were placed in pairs beside each horse head-and-hoof sacrifice. The inner faces of the disks had protruding prongs or studs that would have pressed against the horse's lips when the reins were pulled on the opposite side. Studded cheekpieces were a new and fairly severe kind of control device that appeared simultaneously with chariots.|$|E
2500|$|In the French {{astronomer}} Gérard de Vaucouleurs' revised Hubble Sandage (VRHS) {{system of}} galaxy morphological classification, the Triangulum galaxy {{is classified as}} type SA(s)cd. The S prefix indicates {{that it is a}} <b>disk-shaped</b> galaxy with prominent arms of gas and dust that spiral out from the nucleus—what is commonly known as a spiral galaxy. The A is assigned when the galactic nucleus lacks a bar-shaped structure, in contrast to SB class barred spiral galaxies. American astronomer Allan Sandage's [...] "(s)" [...] notation is used when the spiral arms emerge directly from the nucleus or central bar, rather than from an inner ring as with an (r)-type galaxy. Finally, the cd suffix represents a stage along the spiral sequence that describes the openness of the arms. A rating of cd indicates relatively loosely wound arms.|$|E
2500|$|The company {{took the}} first steps towards {{developing}} the View-Master stereoscope after a chance meeting, at the Oregon Caves in 1938, between Graves and William Gruber, an organ maker of German origin trained by Welte & Sons and an avid photographer, living in Portland. The View-Master used <b>disk-shaped</b> [...] "reels" [...] which are thin cardboard disks containing seven stereoscopic 3-D pairs of small color photographs on film, and its individual eyepieces immersed the viewer into the scene more fully than previous stereoscopes. [...] Mayer and Gruber had both developed devices for viewing stereo images, but Gruber had developed the idea of mounting tiny pieces of Kodachrome color transparency film into reels made from heavy paper stock, for viewing in a stereo slide viewer designed for the reels.

2500|$|Pseudoscorpions {{are small}} {{arthropods}} with a flat, pear-shaped body and pincers that {{resemble those of}} scorpions. They range from [...] long. The opisthosoma {{is made up of}} twelve segments, each guarded by plate-like tergites above and sternites below. The abdomen is short and rounded at the rear, rather than extending into a segmented tail and stinger like true scorpions. The colour of the body can be yellowish-tan to dark-brown, with the paired claws often a contrasting colour. They may have two, four or no eyes. They have two very long pedipalps with palpal chelae (pincers) that strongly resemble the pincers found on a scorpion. The pedipalps generally consist of an immobile [...] "hand" [...] and [...] "finger", with a separate movable finger controlled by an adductor muscle. A venom gland and duct are usually located in the mobile finger; the poison is used to capture and immobilise the pseudoscorpion's prey. During digestion, pseudoscorpions pour a mildly corrosive fluid over the prey, then ingest the liquefied remains. Pseudoscorpions spin silk from a gland in their jaws to make <b>disk-shaped</b> cocoons for mating, molting, or waiting out cold weather. Another trait they share with their closest relatives, the spiders, is breathing through spiracles. Most spiders have one pair of spiracles, and one of book lungs, but pseudoscorpions do not have book lungs.|$|E
