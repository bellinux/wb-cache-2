The Vichy authorities kept GMT+1 (French summer time) {{during the winter of}} 1940-1941 and adopted GMT+2 (double summer time, which was the same as German summer time) in May 1941 in order to unify the railway timetables between occupied and non-occupied <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>France.</b> In 1942, 1943, and 1944 the whole of <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>France</b> thus used GMT+2 during the summer, and GMT+1 during the winter.|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{determine}} the extent of off label and unlicensed drug use in French office based paediatric practice.  METHODS—A prospective one day survey of all written prescriptions, for patients under 15 years, among 95 office based paediatricians in the Paris, <b>France</b> <b>metropolitan</b> area. Main outcome measures were: comparison of the use of each drug with its product licence for age, indication, dose, and route of administration.  RESULTS—A total of 2522 prescriptions were administered to 989 patients; 844 (33 %) were used either in an unlicensed (4 %) or an off label (29 %) manner. A total of 550 (56 %) paediatric patients received one or more off label prescriptions.  CONCLUSIONS—Off label prescriptions (that is, outside the terms of the Summary of Product Characteristics) are widespread in office based paediatric practice, while unlicensed drug use is rare in our study. New regulations in the licensing process in Europe are needed to allow children to receive drugs that have been fully evaluated in their specific age group. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{literature}} reports {{an association between}} neighbourhood deprivation and individual depression after adjustment for individual factors. The present paper investigates whether vulnerability to neighbourhood features is influenced by individual "activity space" (i. e., the space within which people move about or travel {{in the course of}} their daily activities). It can be assumed that a deprived residential environment can exert a stronger influence on the mental health of people whose activity space is limited to their neighbourhood of residence, since their exposure to their neighbourhood would be greater. Moreover, we studied the relationship between activity space size and depression. A limited activity space could indeed reflect spatial and social confinement and thus be associated with a higher risk of being depressed, or, conversely, it could be linked to a deep attachment to the neighbourhood of residence and thus be associated with a lower risk of being depressed. Multilevel logistic regression analyses of a representative sample consisting of 3011 inhabitants surveyed in 2005 in the Paris, <b>France</b> <b>metropolitan</b> area and nested within 50 census blocks showed, after adjusting for individual-level variables, that people living in deprived neighbourhoods were significantly more depressed that those living in more advantaged neighbourhoods. We also observed a statistically significant cross-level interaction between activity space and neighbourhood deprivation, as they relate to depression. Living in a deprived neighbourhood had a stronger and statistically significant effect on depression in people whose activity space was limited to their neighbourhood than in those whose daily travels extended beyond it. In addition, a limited activity space appeared to be a protective factor with regard to depression for people living in advantaged neighbourhoods and a risk factor for those living in deprived neighbourhoods. It could therefore be useful to take activity space into consideration more often when studying the social and spatial determinants of depression...|$|E

40|$|In Europe, {{migrants}} are {{at higher}} risk of common mental disorders or psychological distress than are natives. Little is known regarding the social determinants of migrant mental health, particularly the roles played by migration conditions and transnational practices, which may manifest themselves in different ways for men and for women. The goal {{of this paper was}} to understand the gendered roles of migration paths and transnational ties in mental health among sub-Saharan African migrants residing in the Paris, <b>France,</b> <b>metropolitan</b> area. This study used data from the Parcours study conducted in 2012 – 2013, which employed a life-event approach to collect data from a representative sample of migrants who visited healthcare facilities (n = 2468). We measured anxiety and depressive symptoms at the time of data collection with the Patient Health Questionnaire- 4 (PHQ- 4). Reasons for migration, the living conditions in the host country and transnational ties after migration were taken into account by sex and after adjustment. Our study demonstrates that among sub-Saharan African migrants, mental health is related to the migratory path and the migrant’s situation in the host country but differently for women and men. Among women, anxiety and depressive symptoms were strongly related to having left one’s home country because of threats to one’s life. Among men, residing illegally in the host country was related to impaired mental health. For both women and men, cross-border separation from a child less than 18 years old was not independently associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. In addition, social and emotional support from relatives and friends—both from the society of origin and of destination—were associated with lower anxiety and depressive symptoms. Migrant mental health may be impaired in the current context of anti-migrant policies and an anti-immigrant social environment in Europe...|$|E
