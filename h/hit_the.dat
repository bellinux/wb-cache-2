50|$|Scoring examples: If a thrower <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> bottle {{directly}} and the defenders fail to catch both {{the bottle and}} the disc, the throwing team earns 3 points, one for <b>the</b> bottle <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ground, one for <b>the</b> disc <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ground, and one for <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> bottle directly. If the defending team catches both the bottle and the disc, the throwing team only gets the 1 point (for <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> bottle). If <b>the</b> disc <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> stake rather than the bottle, then 1 point is scored for each object that <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> ground (the bottle and/or the disc). If the defending team catches both, then no points are scored. If the bottle is not dislodged, but the receiving team fails to catch the disc, the throwing team gets 1 point.|$|R

5|$|When Iselle made {{landfall}} on the Big Island with {{winds of}} 60mph (95km/h), {{it became the}} strongest tropical cyclone on record to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> island, and {{one of only three}} storms to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> island at tropical storm intensity or higher, along with Tropical Storm Seven in 1958, and Tropical Storm Darby in 2016. If Iselle had made landfall as a hurricane, {{it would have been the}} first hurricane to ever <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> Big Island. With estimated damage cost of $79.2 million (2014USD), Iselle surpassed Hurricane Dot in 1959 as the third-costliest tropical cyclone to ever <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> U.S. state of Hawaii, even after accounting for inflation. The only storms to cause more damage to the islands were hurricanes Iniki and Iwa in 1992 and 1982, respectively.

5|$|A batsman can be out lbw even if {{the ball}} did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck on the head could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), {{even if the}} ball would have {{otherwise}} <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects {{the location of the}} off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E
