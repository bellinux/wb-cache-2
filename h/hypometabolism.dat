25|$|GAPDH {{has been}} implicated in several {{neurodegenerative}} diseases and disorders, largely through interactions with other proteins specific to that disease or disorder. These interactions may affect not only energy metabolism but also other GAPDH functions. For example, GAPDH interactions with beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) could interfere with its function regarding the cytoskeleton or membrane transport, while interactions with huntingtin could interfere with its function regarding apoptosis, nuclear tRNA transport, DNA replication, and DNA repair. In addition, nuclear translocation of GAPDH {{has been reported in}} Parkinson's disease (PD), and several anti-apoptotic PD drugs, such as rasagiline, function by preventing the nuclear translocation of GAPDH. It is proposed that <b>hypometabolism</b> may be one contributor to PD, but the exact mechanisms underlying GAPDH involvement in neurodegenerative disease remains to be clarified. The SNP rs3741916 in the 5' UTR of the GAPDH gene may be associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
500|$|Having {{evolved in}} Madagascar's {{challenging}} environment, replete with poor soils, extreme shifts in poor, seasonal plant productivity, and devastating climatic {{events such as}} extended droughts and annual cyclones, lemurs have adopted unique combinations of unusual traits to survive, distinguishing them significantly from other primates. [...] In response to limited, seasonal resources, lemurs may exhibit seasonal fat storage, <b>hypometabolism</b> (including torpor and hibernation in some cheirogaleids), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and/or strict breeding seasons. [...] Secondarily, extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding {{are thought to have}} resulted in three other relatively common lemur traits: female dominance, sexual monomorphism (lack of size differences between the sexes), and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism (conflict), such as sperm competition.|$|E
500|$|Also, <b>hypometabolism.</b> An energy-conserving {{strategy}} used by {{some small}} (under [...] ) birds in which they become inactive and unreactive to external stimuli, and reduce their metabolism causing decreases in body temperature {{by an average of}} [...] below their normal respiration and heart rate. [...] Two types of torpor are recognized. In one type, such as in hummingbirds, torpor may be entered on a daily basis and last only a few hours; other behaviours, such as foraging, continue during non-torpor periods. For other species, torpor may only be entered during cold conditions or when food becomes limited, but may persist for weeks or even months. The extent of unresponsiveness during torpor can be pronounced. A hummingbird in deep torpor, for example, with a body temperature of , will not respond to a variety of external stimuli such as attempts to push it from a perch; only the locking reﬂex of the feet stops the bird from falling. [...] Torpor has been reported in eight orders of birds.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{physiological}} and biochemical concerns for an aestivating animal are to conserve energy, retain {{water in the}} body, ration the use of stored energy, handle the nitrogenous end products, and stabilize bodily organs, cells, and macromolecules. This can be quite a task as hot temperatures and arid conditions may last for months. The depression of metabolic rate during aestivation causes a reduction in macromolecule synthesis and degradation. To stabilize the macromolecules, aestivators will enhance antioxidant defenses and elevate chaperone proteins. This is a widely used strategy across all forms of <b>hypometabolism.</b> These {{physiological and}} biochemical concerns {{appear to be the}} core elements of <b>hypometabolism</b> throughout the animal kingdom.

Abnormal visual attention may underlie certain visuospatial difficulties in patients with (AD). People with AD have <b>hypometabolism</b> and neuropathology in the parietal cortex, and given the role of parietal function for visual attention, patients with AD may have hemispatial neglect, which may result in difficulty with disengaging attention in visual search.|$|E
5000|$|Structural MRI scans often reveal {{frontal lobe}} and/or {{anterior}} temporal lobe atrophy but in early cases the scan may seem normal. Atrophy {{can be either}} bilateral or asymmetric. [...] Registration of images at different points of time (e.g., one year apart) can show evidence of atrophy that otherwise (at individual time points) may be reported as normal. Many research groups have begun using techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional imaging and cortical thickness measurements {{in an attempt to}} offer an earlier diagnosis to the FTD patient. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans classically show frontal and/or anterior temporal <b>hypometabolism,</b> which helps differentiate the disease from Alzheimer's disease. The PET scan in Alzheimer's disease classically shows biparietal <b>hypometabolism.</b> Meta-analyses based on imaging methods have shown that frontotemporal dementia mainly affects a frontomedial network discussed in the context of social cognition or 'theory of mind'. This is entirely in keeping with the notion that on the basis of cognitive neuropsychological evidence, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is a major locus of dysfunction early on {{in the course of the}} behavioural variant of frontotemporal degeneration.

50|$|This {{corresponds}} to areas 23 and 31 of Brodmann LP of von Economo and Bailey and von Bonin. Its cellular structure is granular. It is followed posteriorly by the retrosplenial cortex (area 29).Dorsally is the granular area 31. The posterior cingulate cortex receives {{a great part}} of its afferent axons from the superficial nucleus (or nucleus superior- falsely LD-) of the thalamus (see thalamus), which itself receives axons from the subiculum. To some extent it thus duplicates Papez' circuit. It receives also direct afferents from the subiculum of the hippocampus. Posterior cingulate cortex <b>hypometabolism</b> (with 18F-FDG PET) has been defined in Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
50|$|Psychopathy is a brain {{disorder}} remarked {{by lack of}} moral emotions, empathy, remorse and guilt. People with psychopathy appear to have defects in moral judgement, but not in moral reasoning. Neuroimaging of the psychopathic brain has reveled hypoperfusion and <b>hypometabolism</b> {{in areas of the}} frontal cortex. The areas of the medial prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex correlate with a higher score in the psychopathy scale. The amygdala is also dysfunctional in psychopaths decreasing the ability to recognize emotional stimuli and lacking the ability to promote activity in the moral promoting region of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Causes== The exact {{cause of}} ALO {{is not yet}} fully understood. Despite its name, {{it is not a}} true apraxia, but thought to be due to a supranuclear origin of {{abnormal}} neuronal activity. Voluntary eyelid opening involves the simultaneous activation of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle and the inhibition of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Electromyographic studies have shown that ALO may involve either involuntary levator palpebrae superioris muscle inhibition, persistent pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle contraction, or both. <b>Hypometabolism</b> of glucose may play a part, and has been documented in the basal ganglia, frontal lobe, and the primary visual cortex in some cases of ALO.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex forms {{connections with}} dorsolateral prefrontal cortex meaning prefrontal regions have strong connections with limbic structures. This {{can be seen in}} the following study conducted by Eslinger et al. A woman with bilateral encephalomalacia had a damaged medial thalamus and showed behavioral problems including utilization behavior. She conducted unnecessary motor use of objects in her immediate environment. The effect of the damage to the paramedian thalamic region did not astonish researchers because of its connection to the cingulate cortex. Thalamic infarctions have produced <b>hypometabolism,</b> a decrease in metabolic rate, in the frontal areas and hypoperfusion resulting in UB. The patient was marked with the behavior, and brain imaging noticed the infarctions in the thalamus.|$|E

50|$|While {{hibernation}} {{has long}} been studied in rodents, namely ground squirrels, no primate or tropical mammal was known to hibernate prior to the discovery that the fat-tailed dwarf lemur of Madagascar hibernates in tree holes for seven months of the year. Malagasy winter temperatures sometimes rise to over 30 C, so hibernation is not exclusively an adaptation to low ambient temperatures. The hibernation of this lemur {{is strongly dependent on}} the thermal behaviour of its tree hole: if the hole is poorly insulated, the lemur's body temperature fluctuates widely, passively following the ambient temperature; if well insulated, the body temperature stays fairly constant and the animal undergoes regular spells of arousal. Dausmann found that <b>hypometabolism</b> in hibernating animals is not necessarily coupled to a low body temperature.|$|E

50|$|The PCC is {{commonly}} affected by neurodegenerative disease. In fact, reduced metabolism in the PCC {{is an early}} sign of Alzheimer's disease, and is frequently present before a clinical diagnosis. The reduced metabolism in the PCC is typically one part in a diffuse pattern of metabolic dysfunction in the brain that includes medial Temporal lobe structures and the anterior thalamus, and these metabolic abnormalities {{may be due to}} damage in isolated but connected regions. For instance, Meguro et al. (1999) show that experimental damage of the rhinal cortex results in <b>hypometabolism</b> of the PCC. In Alzheimer's disease, the metabolic abnormality is linked to Amyloid deposition and brain Atrophy with a spatial distribution that resembles the nodes of the Default mode network (DMN). In early Alzheimer's, the functional connectivity within the DMN is reduced and affects the connection between the PCC and the hippocampus, and these altered patterns can reflect ApoE genetic status (a risk factor associated with the disease). It has been found that neurodegenerative diseases spread 'prion-like' through the brain. For example, when the proteins amyloid-b and TDP-43 are in their abnormal form, they spread trans-synaptically and are associated with Neurodegeneration. This transmission of abnormal protein would be constrained by the organization of white matter connections and could potentially explain the spatial distribution of Alzheimer's pathology within the DMN. In Alzheimer’s disease, the topology of white matter connectivity helps in predicting atrophic patterns, which could explain why the PCC is affected {{in the early stages of}} the disease.|$|E
5000|$|Storey {{is one of}} {{the most}} cited {{researchers}} in the world. Storey's research includes studies of enzyme properties, gene expression, protein phosphorylation, and cellular signal transduction mechanisms to seek out the basic principles of how organisms endure and flourish under extreme conditions. He is particularly known within the field of cryobiology for his studies of animals that can survive freezing, especially the frozen [...] "frog-sicles" [...] (Rana sylvatica) that have made his work popular with multiple TV shows and magazines. Storey's studies of the adaptations that allow frogs, insects, and other animals to survive freezing have made major advances in the understanding of how cells, tissues and organs can endure freezing. Storey was also responsible for the discovery that some turtle species are freeze tolerant: newly hatched painted turtles that spend their first winter on land (Chrysemys picta marginata & C. p. bellii). These turtles are unique as they are the only reptiles, and highest vertebrate life form, known to tolerate prolonged natural freezing of extracellular body fluids during winter hibernation. These advances may aid the development of organ cryopreservation technology. [...] A second area of his research is metabolic rate depression - understanding the mechanisms by which some animals can sharply reduce their metabolism and enter a state of <b>hypometabolism</b> or torpor that allows them to survive over the long term under difficult environmental stresses. His studies have identified molecular mechanisms that underlie metabolic arrest across phylogeny and that support phenomena including mammalian hibernation, estivation, and anoxia and ischemia tolerance. Control mechanisms include transcription factor changes that alter gene expression, and reversible phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. These studies across multiple species also hold key applications for medical science, particularly for preservation technologies that aim to extend the survival time of excised organs in cold or frozen storage. Additional applications include insights into hyperglycemia in metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and anoxic and ischemic damage caused by heart attack and stroke.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship between baseline neuropsychological functioning and 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). We hypothesized relationships between dominant temporal lobe <b>hypometabolism</b> and verbal memory and between nondominant temporal lobe <b>hypometabolism</b> and nonverbal memory in line with the lateralized material-specific model of memory deficits in MTLE. We also hypothesized an association between performance on frontal lobe neuropsychological tests and prefrontal <b>hypometabolism.</b> Thirty-two patients who had undergone temporal lobectomy for treatment of MTLE and who completed both presurgical FDG-PET and comprehensive neuropsychological investigations with widely used standardized measures were included. Age-adjusted composite measures were calculated for verbal memory, nonverbal memory, relative material-specific memory, IQ, executive function, attention/working memory, and psychomotor speed. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was analyzed with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to identify <b>hypometabolism</b> relative to healthy controls. Pearson's correlation was used to determine the relationship between regions of <b>hypometabolism</b> and neuropsychological functioning. Dominant temporal lobe <b>hypometabolism</b> was associated with relatively inferior verbal memory, while nondominant temporal lobe <b>hypometabolism</b> was associated with inferior nonverbal memory. No relationship was found between performance on any frontal lobe measures and prefrontal <b>hypometabolism.</b> Statistical parametric mapping-quantified lateralized temporal lobe <b>hypometabolism</b> correlates with material-specific episodic memory impairment in MTLE.

40|$|Objectives: Several {{studies using}} 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose {{positron}} emission tomography (18 F-FDG-PET) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have found both temporal and extratemporal abnormalities in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with ipsilateral hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS), but data are lacking about the findings of both techniques in the same patients. We aimed {{to determine whether the}} extent of 18 F-FDG-PET <b>hypometabolism</b> is related to DTI abnormalities. Methods: Twenty-one patients with MTLE-HS underwent comprehensive preoperative evaluation; 18 (86 %) of these underwent epilepsy surgery. We analyzed and compared the pattern of white matter (WM) alterations on DTI and cortical <b>hypometabolism</b> on 18 F-FDG-PET. Results: We found widespread temporal and extratemporal 18 F-FDG-PET and DTI abnormalities. Patterns of WM abnormalities and cortical glucose <b>hypometabolism</b> involved similar brain regions, being more extensive in the left than the right MTLE-HS. We classified patients into three groups according to temporal 18 F-FDG-PET patterns: <b>hypometabolism</b> restricted to the anterior third (n =  7), <b>hypometabolism</b> extending to the middle third (n =  7), and <b>hypometabolism</b> extending to the posterior third (n =  7). Patients with anterior temporal <b>hypometabolism</b> showed DTI abnormalities in anterior association and commissural tracts while patients with posterior <b>hypometabolism</b> showed WM alterations in anterior and posterior tracts. Conclusions: Patients with MTLE-HS have widespread metabolic and microstructural abnormalities that involve similar regions. The distribution patterns of these gray and white matter abnormalities differ between patients with left or right MTLE, but also with the extent of the 18 F-FDG-PET <b>hypometabolism</b> along the epileptogenic temporal lobe. These findings suggest a variable network involvement among patients with MTLE-HS...|$|E
40|$|The logopenic {{variant of}} primary {{progressive}} aphasia is an atypical clinical variant of Alzheimer's disease which is typically characterized by left temporoparietal atrophy on {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and <b>hypometabolism</b> on F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. We aimed to characterize and compare patterns of atrophy and <b>hypometabolism</b> in logopenic primary progressive aphasia, and determine which brain regions and imaging modality best differentiates logopenic primary progressive aphasia from typical dementia of the Alzheimer's type. A total of 27 logopenic primary progressive aphasia subjects underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. These subjects were matched to 27 controls and 27 subjects with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Patterns of atrophy and <b>hypometabolism</b> were assessed at the voxel and region-level using Statistical Parametric Mapping. Penalized logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} determine what combinations of regions best discriminate between groups. Atrophy and <b>hypometabolism</b> was observed in lateral temporoparietal and medial parietal lobes, left greater than right, and left frontal lobe in the logopenic group. The logopenic group showed greater left inferior, middle and superior lateral temporal atrophy (inferior p =  0. 02; middle p =  0. 007, superior p =  0. 002) and <b>hypometabolism</b> (inferior p =  0. 006, middle p =  0. 002, superior p =  0. 001), and less right medial temporal atrophy (p =  0. 02) and <b>hypometabolism</b> (p< 0. 001), and right posterior cingulate <b>hypometabolism</b> (p< 0. 001) than dementia of the Alzheimer's type. An age-adjusted penalized logistic model incorporating atrophy and <b>hypometabolism</b> achieved excellent discrimination (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve =  0. 89) between logopenic and dementia of the Alzheimer's type subjects, with optimal discrimination achieved using right medial temporal and posterior cingulate <b>hypometabolism,</b> left inferior, middle and superior temporal <b>hypometabolism,</b> and left superior temporal volume.
