40|$|Abstract — Wireless mesh {{networking}} {{has emerged as}} a promising technology in providing economical and scalable broadband Internet accesses. A wireless mesh network consists of mesh routers and mesh clients, connected in an ad hoc manner via wireless links. A subset of the mesh routers, referred to as <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes,</b> are capable of external Internet connections. Since other mesh routers and clients have to access the Internet through the <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes,</b> these nodes can easily become bottlenecks in the network. In this paper, we present a novel queuing model based analysis of the delay and throughput of the <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes.</b> Our simulation results suggest that the analytical results are quite accurate, which provides an effective guideline for gateway-related design and optimization in wireless mesh networks.

40|$|In {{wireless}} ad hoc networks, clustering {{is one of}} {{the most}} important approaches for many applications. A connected k-hop clustering network is formed by electing clusterheads in k-hop neighborhoods and finding <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes</b> to connect clusterheads. Therefore, the number of nodes to be flooded in broadcast related applications could be reduced. In this paper, we study the localized solution for the connectivity issue of clusterheads with less <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes.</b> We develop the adjacency-based neighbor clusterhead selection rule (A-NCR) by extending the " 2. 5 " hops coverage theorem [17] and generalizing it to k-hop clustering. We then design the local minimum spanning tree [9] based gateway algorithm (LMSTGA), which could be applied on the adjacent clusterheads selected by A-NCR to further reduce <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes.</b> In the simulation, we study the performance of the proposed approaches, using different values for parameter k. The results show that the proposed approaches generate a connected k-hop clustering network, and reduce the number of <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes</b> effectively.

The Convergence Node, which is environmentally hardened and powered via the copper wire from the CO, terminates the bonded signals and acts as the <b>gateway</b> <b>node</b> for the subscriber ‘collector’ ring. DSL Rings technology {{is based on the}} Resilient Packet Rings (RPR) protocol. The technology enables a fail-safe in that, if a single pair is cut, the traffic goes in the opposite direction around the ring to get to the network <b>gateway</b> <b>node.</b> RPR also provides built in Quality of Service (QoS) for traffic differentiation and managed services as well as an Efficient Multicast (EM) capability that significantly reduces overall ring bandwidth requirements for multicast/broadcast video.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} a two-tier communication scenario in an underwater sensor network. The field nodes form single-hop clusters around the <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes</b> {{and communicate with}} them via acoustic wireless links, while the <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes</b> communicate directly via radio frequency (RF) wireless links to the sink node. Thus, the field data is collected at the sink node via two-hop communication links. The field data being sporadic, the multi-access communications in the two hops are considered slotted random access (S-Aloha) based. We first analyze {{the performance of the}} receiver synchronized S-Aloha in underwater network which is used for data communication from the sensor nodes to their respective <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes.</b> The multi-access throughput performance over the RF links at the sink node is also characterized. We then study the optimum cluster size that maximizes the overall network throughput. Our numerical results are supported by discrete event based random network simulation studies. I...|$|R

50|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSN) are a spatially {{distributed network}} of autonomous sensors used for monitoring an environment. Energy cost {{is a major}} limitation for WSN requiring the need for energy efficient networks and processing. One of major energy costs in WSN is the energy spent on communication between nodes and it is sometimes desirable to only send data to a <b>gateway</b> <b>node</b> when an event of interest is triggered at a sensor. Sensors will then only open communication during a probable event, saving on communication costs. Fields interested {{in this type of}} network include surveillance, home automation, disaster relief, traffic control, health care and more.|$|E
50|$|If sensors collect {{multiple}} {{data points}} {{at a given}} time then another method of using threshold based detection is to measure the variance of the data and only send data to a <b>gateway</b> <b>node</b> if the variance reaches a certain threshold. Events may occur in {{only a small portion of}} the data set. In this case it is important to break the data into smaller segments and take into account the variance of each individual segment. Consider an N-dimensional data set that can be divided into four equal quadrants. The sum of absolute difference can be calculated for all the samples in that section and can be used as an approximation of the variance of that quadrant. Below is what the equation would look like for one quadrant.|$|E

In ZHLS, all network nodes construct two routing tables, an intra-zone routing table and an inter-zone routing table, by flooding NodeLSPs within the zone and ZoneLSPs throughout the network. However, this incurs a large communication overhead in the network. In ZHLS-GF, the flooding scheme floods ZoneLSPs {{only to the}} <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes</b> of zones thus reduces the communication overhead significantly. Further, in ZHLS-GF only the <b>gateway</b> <b>nodes</b> store ZoneLSPs and construct inter-zone routing tables therefore the total storage capacity required in the network is less than ZHLS.|$|R

They all require a set of training vectors to simulate or re-enact events of interest.|$|E
30|$|After clustering, {{the next}} step is to choose the <b>gateway</b> <b>node</b> for each cluster. In a cluster-based CRAHN, two {{clusters}} can access each other through different nodes and so there arises the problem of selection of the node more suitable to function as the <b>gateway</b> <b>node</b> between them. It is the responsibility of the cluster head to choose the <b>gateway</b> <b>node</b> for the adjacent clusters. The main goal of choosing a gateway and designing the control channels for a CRAHN is that the connectivity between the adjacent clusters is strengthened. To strengthen the inter-cluster connectivity, there should be a large set of channels for inter-cluster communication. Therefore, the node with more channels in common with the adjacent cluster should be selected as the <b>gateway</b> <b>node.</b>|$|E
30|$|In the {{initialization}} phase, each <b>gateway</b> <b>node</b> sends one ADV message {{including the}} ID of this node and the multimedia sensor nodes receive these ADV messages. In general, each sensor node can receive {{more than one}} ADV message. At this time, the sensor node needs to compare the signal strength of the received messages and select the <b>gateway</b> <b>node</b> with strong signal to join in its cluster. If the <b>gateway</b> <b>node</b> {{is located at the}} right position, we can establish an ideal cluster structure based on cellular topology by this way.|$|E

Adhoc networks are dynamically created and maintained by a group of wireless enabled devices (gargets) with out the assistance of pre-existing infrastructure like Base Station (BS) for communication purposes. In this study, we consider the issue of performance enhancement of wireless networks in terms of `overhead messages per node and power consumption`. Minimizing power consumption is an important challenge in mobile networks. Wireless network interface is often a device`s single largest consumer of power. To fulfill the above requirements, we have designed a topology management scheme for Adhoc wireless networks.
