5|$|Among the {{earliest}} {{members of the}} Mecoptera are the Nannochoristidae of Upper Permian age. Fossil Mecoptera become abundant and diverse during the Cretaceous, <b>for</b> <b>example</b> <b>in</b> China, where panorpids such as Jurassipanorpa, hangingflies (Bittacidae and Cimbrophlebiidae), Orthophlebiidae, and Cimbrophlebiidae have been found.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{hearts are}} widely {{consumed}} as food. As {{they are almost}} entirely muscle, they are high in protein. They are often included in dishes with other offal, <b>for</b> <b>example</b> <b>in</b> the pan-Ottoman kokoretsi.|$|E

This was in contravention of the Clean Air Act, 42.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{huge numbers}} of cacti are {{produced}} annually. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> 2002 in Korea alone, 49 million plants were propagated, with a value of almost US$9million. Most of them, 31 million plants, were propagated by grafting.|$|E

50|$|Photoreceptor {{proteins}} typically {{consist of}} a protein moiety and a non-protein photopigment that reacts to light via photoisomerization or photoreduction, thus initiating a change of the receptor protein which triggers a signal transduction cascade. Pigments found in photoreceptors include retinal (retinylidene proteins, <b>for</b> <b>example</b> rhodopsin <b>in</b> animals), flavin (flavoproteins, <b>for</b> <b>example</b> cryptochrome <b>in</b> plants and animals) and bilin (biliproteins, <b>for</b> <b>example</b> phytochrome <b>in</b> plants).|$|R

5|$|Escher's artwork is {{especially}} well liked by mathematicians like Doris Schattschneider and scientists like Roger Penrose, who enjoy {{his use of}} polyhedra and geometric distortions. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> Gravitation, animals climb around a stellated dodecahedron.|$|E

5|$|Goldstone's theorem {{in quantum}} field theory states that in a system with broken {{continuous}} symmetry, there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone bosons. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> crystalline solids, these correspond to phonons, which are quantized versions of lattice vibrations.|$|E

5|$|In {{more recent}} applications, the {{influence}} {{has also been}} reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background. In a similar vein, geometric group theory employs geometric concepts, <b>for</b> <b>example</b> <b>in</b> the study of hyperbolic groups.
