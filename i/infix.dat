40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the nature of <b>infixes</b> and whether {{it is possible to}} explain their position in a configurational theory of word formation. We argue that in Spanish the elements called <b>infixes</b> are actually two different kinds of entities with different characteristics. The first class of <b>infixes</b> corresponds to a syntactic head and, in consequence, induces a systematic and predictable reading to the base it selects. The second class of <b>infixes</b> is part of certain contextually conditioned allomorphs of the base; as these <b>infixes</b> are subject to Late Insertion, they can only induce conceptual (and, therefore, idiosyncratic) meaning differences...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{data from the}} languages Palauan and Akkadian where identical <b>infixes</b> and prefixes respond differently to feature cooccurrence restrictions (OCP). In both languages, OCP is enforced on the root domain. While prefixes {{are not subject to}} OCP, identical <b>infixes</b> need to conform to OCP restrictions. To explain the asymmetry between identical <b>infixes</b> and prefixes, I propose that <b>infixes</b> are part of the root morpheme in the output while prefixes are outside of the root domain. <b>Infixes</b> become part of the output root morpheme via a process of what I will call morpheme absorption. Empirical consequences of this proposal are explored. 1...|$|R

25|$|Nouns inflect for {{plurality}} through suffixation. Compare noosi 'mourning dove' and noosi-lc 'mourning doves'. Pluralization is very complicated; {{for this}} reason, each noun {{is listed in}} the dictionary with its plural form. Some nouns ostensibly use an <b>infix</b> to indicate plural: caatc 'grasshopper', caatjc 'grasshoppers'. A few nouns have completely suppletive plural forms: cmiique 'Seri person', comcáac 'Seri people', ziix 'thing', xiica 'things'.|$|E
25|$|Many of the verbs {{mentioned}} in the previous paragraph undergo a change of their vowel rather than use the <b>infix</b> -in- (completed aspect). In the actor focus (i.e. -um- verbs), this happens only to verbs having the vowel /u/ in the first syllable. For example, the verb lukas (to take off) is conjugated lukas (will take off), lulukas (is taking off), and likas (took off) (rather than *linukas).|$|E
25|$|In some {{programming}} languages, given a two-argument function f (or {{a binary}} operator), the outer product of f and two one-dimensional arrays A and B is a two-dimensional array C such that C = f(A,B). This is syntactically represented in various ways: in APL, as the <b>infix</b> binary operator °.f; in R, as the function outer(A, B, f); in Mathematica, as Outer. In MATLAB, the function kron(A,B) {{is used for}} this product. These often generalize to multi-dimensional arguments, and more than two arguments.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, France {{uses the}} <b>infix</b> {{notation}} like most countries. For large numbers the long scale is used. Thus, the French {{use the word}} billion for the number 1,000,000,000,000, which in countries using short scale is called a trillion. However, there exists a French word, milliard, for the number 1,000,000,000, which in countries using the short scale is called a billion. Thus, despite {{the use of the}} long scale, one billion is called un milliard ("one milliard") in French, and not mille millions ("one thousand million"). It {{should also be noted that}} names of numbers above the milliard are rarely used. Thus, one trillion will most often be called mille milliards ("one thousand milliard") in French, and rarely un billion.|$|E
