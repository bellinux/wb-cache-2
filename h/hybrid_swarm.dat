2500|$|Cichlids provide {{scientists}} {{with a unique}} perspective of speciation, having become extremely diverse in the more recent geological past. It is widely believed {{that one of the}} contributing factors to their diversification are the various forms of prey processing displayed by cichlid pharyngeal jaw apparatus. These different jaw apparatus allow for a broad range of feeding strategies including: algae scraping, snail crushing, planktivores, piscivores, and insectivores. Some cichlids can also show phenotypic plasticity in their pharyngeal jaws, which can also help lead to speciation. In response to different diets or food scarcity, members of the same species can display different jaw morphologies that are better suited to different feeding strategies. As species members begin to concentrate around different food sources and continue their life cycle, they most likely spawn with like individuals. This can reinforce the jaw morphology and given enough time, create new species. Such a process can happen through allopatric speciation, when species diverge according to different food sources in different areas, or through sympatric speciation, in which multiple species evolve from a shared ancestor. In Lake Apoyo in Nicaragua, Amphilophus zaliosus and its sister species Amphilophus citrinellus display many of the criteria needed for sympatric speciation. In the African rift lake system, cichlid species in [...] numerous distinct lakes evolved from a shared <b>hybrid</b> <b>swarm.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>hybrid</b> <b>swarm</b> is a {{population}} of hybrids that has survived beyond the initial hybrid generation, with interbreeding between hybrid individuals and backcrossing with its parent types.

5000|$|Some botanists {{consider}} that O. diploursina {{is not a}} distinct taxon but instead {{is a form of}} O. trichophora. The original paper did not differentiate well between the two. Also, O. trichophora occurs 150 miles north in Utah and the small O. diplourisina populations could be outliers. [...] Opuntia diploursina (2n=22) is known to hybridize with O. basilaris (2n=22) wherever the species co-occur. This results in fertile progeny that can backcross with either parent eventually creating a <b>hybrid</b> <b>swarm.</b> The polyploid O. erinacea (2n=44) which is widely distributed in the Mojave and Great Basin deserts, is suspected to be a stabilized allopolyploid derived from O. diploursina and O. basilaris.

5000|$|Spartina alterniflora {{has also}} been found to {{hybridize}} with S. foliosa, producing offspring that may be an even greater threat than S. alterniflora by itself.

The hybrids produce enormous amounts of pollen, which swamp the stigmas of the native S. foliosa flowers to produce even larger numbers of hybrid offspring, leaving the native Spartina little chance to grow as a pure strain. The hybrids also produce much larger numbers of fertile seeds than the native Spartina, and are producing a hybrid population that is not only increasing in numbers, but increasing in its rate of population growth. [...] The hybrids may also be able to fertilize themselves, which the native Spartina cannot do, and which increases the spread of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>swarm</b> even further.|$|E
50|$|Paeonia suffruticosa is {{the name}} used for most tree peony cultivars, but is not a {{naturally}} occurring species.

Almost all of the remaining cultivars has chloroplast DNA identical to that in P. qiui, and rarely from P. ostii and partially from Paeonia rotundiloba. In the nuclear DNA however, homology with Paeonia rockii is largest, with lesser contributions from P. qiui, P. ostii, P. cathayana and P. jishanensis. Paeonia decomposita is the only species from the Vaginatae that has not contributed to these cultivars.|$|E
