5|$|Achebe's novels laid a {{formidable}} groundwork for this process. By altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into a distinctly African style. In some spots this {{takes the form}} of repetition of an Igbo <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> standard English parlance; elsewhere it appears as narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences.|$|E

3000|$|Connecting ideas across {{disciplines}} {{is challenging}} when students {{have little or}} no understanding of the relevant <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> the individual disciplines. Also, students do not always or naturally use their disciplinary knowledge in integrated contexts. Students will thus need support to elicit the relevant scientific or mathematical <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> an engineering or technological design context, to connect those ideas productively, and to reorganize their own <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> ways that come to reflect normative, scientific ideas and practices.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to help students <b>in</b> developing their <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> writing due to their difficulties to arrange ideas. Although they do have ideas, they cannot structure their <b>ideas</b> well <b>in</b> their papers. Several factors could cause this problem such as lack of vocabulary and knowledge or strategies <b>in</b> arranging <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> papers. Another factor is unclear explanation and insufficient guidance from the teachers. Based on literature review, dictoglos can be a guide for students to develop their <b>ideas</b> <b>in</b> writing. It is a teaching technique which incorporates various activities such listening, taking notes, discussing, and reconstructing which have some standard procedures and variations...|$|R
5|$|While {{the long}} neck has {{traditionally}} been interpreted as a feeding adaptation, it was also suggested that the oversized neck of Diplodocus and its relatives may have been primarily a sexual display, with any other feeding benefits coming second.

5|$|A common <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film {{with his parents}} before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, rose {{hobbyist}} and Oregon Journal editor Jesse Currey convinced {{city officials}} {{to establish a}} rose test garden to protect hybrid roses grown in Europe during World War I. Portland's Park Bureau approved the <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> 1917, allowing rose enthusiasts in England to send roses to Portland for preservation. City landscape architect Florence Holmes Gerke began designing the International Rose Test Garden and accompanying amphitheatre in 1921. The garden was dedicated in June 1924 with Currey as the first curator. He served {{until his death in}} 1927. A stone bench in the garden honors Currey's work as founder.|$|E

5|$|In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court {{decided against}} the then-prevailing {{opinions}} in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable, while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was {{a translation of}} source code and embodied in a silicon chip, it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright. The Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code {{is a form of}} translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.|$|E
5|$|Jonze {{conceived}} the <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> the early 2000s after reading {{an article about}} a website that allowed for instant messaging with an artificial intelligence program. After making I'm Here (2010), a short film sharing similar themes, Jonze returned to the idea. He wrote {{the first draft of}} the script in five months. Principal photography took place in Los Angeles and Shanghai in mid-2012. The role of Samantha was recast in post-production, with Samantha Morton being replaced with Johansson. Additional scenes were filmed in August 2013 following the casting change.|$|E

The new prime minister was Gough Whitlam and new postmaster-general was Doug McClelland. In early 1973, {{in an effort to}} foster a more independent organisation, Madgwick asked Whitlam if the ABC's employees could be removed from the Public Service Board, which administered the Commonwealth government employment system. Although Whitlam had supported the <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> the past, he now opposed it as prime minister and did not act on Madgwick's request.|$|E
5|$|Spokane {{is known}} as the birthplace of the {{national}} movement started by Sonora Smart Dodd that led to the proposal and eventual establishment of Father's Day as a national holiday in the U.S. The first observation of Father's Day in Spokane was on June 19, 1910.

5|$|The duality {{represents}} a major advance {{in our understanding}} of string theory and quantum gravity.

5|$|The {{introduction}} of printed planar technologies greatly simplified {{the manufacture of}} many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. The inventor of printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the <b>idea</b> <b>in</b> 1951.Barrett, 1952,Niehenke et al., p.846. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's stripline soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially triplate and microstrip. The generic term stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate.|$|E
