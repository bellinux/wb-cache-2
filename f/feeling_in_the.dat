5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E

25|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a disorder}} that causes a strong urge to move one's legs.

The feelings generally happen when at rest and therefore can {{make it hard to}} sleep. Due to the disturbance in sleep, people with RLS may have daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Additionally, many have limb twitching during sleep.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to reveal the {{different}} levels of representation of invisible <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work of Frida Kahlo. In order to express these <b>feelings,</b> <b>in</b> some paintings, <b>the</b> artist uses visible objects, such as tears – which become the first level of representation of <b>the</b> invisible. <b>In</b> other paintings, however, she uses internal organs of the human body to represent invisible pain or suffering. These organs are hidden from the eye and are therefore invisible. There are two categories within this second level: the first one consists of internal organs traditionally used to represent invisible <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European culture, such as the skull. The second category embraces organs used especially by Frida, like the womb. The study observes how her life had made this physically broken, but mentally strong artist to cut open her own body to show it to the world, representing feelings that only a woman can feel, but nobody can see...|$|R

25|$|Musical {{expression}} {{is the art}} of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical {{expression is}} sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is {{more than the sum of}} measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.|$|E
25|$|These {{plans were}} scuttled {{by the death}} of Edward VII on 6 May 1910. Asquith and his ministers were {{initially}} reluctant to press the new king, George V, in mourning for his father, for commitments on constitutional change, and the monarch's views were not yet known. With a strong <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country that the parties should compromise, Asquith and other Liberals met with Conservative leaders in a number of conferences through much of the remainder of 1910. These talks failed in November over Conservative insistence that there be no limits on the Lords's ability to veto Irish Home Rule. When the Parliament Bill was submitted to the Lords, they made amendments that were not acceptable to the government.|$|E
25|$|Burning or gnawing <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach area lasting between 30minutes and 3hours {{commonly}} accompanies ulcers. This {{pain can}} be misinterpreted as hunger, indigestion or heartburn. Pain is usually {{caused by the}} ulcer {{but it may be}} aggravated by the stomach acid when it comes into contact with the ulcerated area. The pain caused by peptic ulcers can be felt anywhere from the navel up to the sternum, it may last from few minutes to several hours and it may be worse when the stomach is empty. Also, sometimes the pain may flare at night and it can commonly be temporarily relieved by eating foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking anti-acid medication. However, peptic ulcer disease symptoms may be different for every sufferer.|$|E

25|$|Lumbar disc herniations {{occur in}} the lower back, most often between {{the fourth and fifth}} lumbar {{vertebral}} bodies or between the fifth and the sacrum. Symptoms can affect the lower back, buttocks, thigh, anal/genital region (via the perineal nerve), and may radiate into the foot and/or toe. The sciatic nerve is the most commonly affected nerve, causing symptoms of sciatica. The femoral nerve can also be affected and cause the patient to experience a numb, tingling feeling throughout one or both legs and even feet or even a burning <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hips and legs. A hernia in the lumbar region often compresses the nerve root exiting at the level below the disk. Thus, a herniation of the L4/5 disc will compress the L5 nerve root.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after the raid, the German Kaiser sent a {{telegram}} ("Kruger telegram") congratulating President Kruger and the government of the South African Republic on their success, and when the text of this telegram was disclosed in the British press, it generated a storm of anti-German <b>feeling.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> baggage of the raiding column, to the great embarrassment of Britain, the Boers found telegrams from Cecil Rhodes and the other plotters in Johannesburg. Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, quickly moved to condemn the raid, despite previously having approved Rhodes' plans to send armed assistance {{in the case of a}} Johannesburg uprising. Subsequently, Rhodes was severely censured at the Cape inquiry and the London parliamentary inquiry, and forced to resign as Prime Minister of the Cape and as Chairman of the Chartered Company for having sponsored the failed coup d'état.|$|E
25|$|In France this {{flat and}} simple {{treatment}} {{was to a}} certain extent used. Doors were most suitably adorned in this way, and the split baluster so characteristic of Jacobean work is often to be met with. There are some very good cabinets in the museum at Lyngby, Denmark, illustrating these two methods of treatment in combination. But the Swiss and Austrians elaborated this style, greatly improving the effect by the addition of color. However, the best Continental designs adopted the typical acanthus foliage of Italy, while still retaining a certain amount of Gothic <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strength of the lines and the cut of the detail. Panelling often long and narrow was commonly used for all sorts of domestic purposes, a feature being a medallion in the center with a simple arrangement of vase, dolphins, dragons, or birds and foliage filling in the spaces above and below.|$|E

After Þorsteinn Pálsson {{resigned}} as Prime Minister in 1988, after falling out {{with the leaders of}} his two coalition parties, there was a widespread <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party that its leadership should be changed, and pressure was put on Davíð to run against Þorsteinn which he did in 1991, becoming leader of the Independence Party. Under Davíð Oddsson’s leadership, in 1991, the Independence Party regained most of the parliamentary support it had lost in 1987. In record time, Davíð formed a coalition government with the social democrats, Alþýðuflokkurinn, whose leader, Jón Baldvin Hannibalsson, became Minister of Foreign Affairs. Jón Baldvin and Davíð jointly decided that Iceland should become the first state to renew recognition of the sovereignty and independence of the three Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E
