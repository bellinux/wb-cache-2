40|$|Small {{pelagics}} are {{the main}} fish resource in North West Africa. In Senegal, these are mainly sardinellas (Sardinella aurita and S. maderensis) and bonga shad (Ethmalosa fimbriata). The fisheries, mainly encircling gillnets and purse seines, are predominantly performed by artisanal fishers and are of great importance for the Senegalese economy and for food security in the region. However, in recent years, the main conditions for these fisheries have changed and recent observations have shown strong declines in profit. An analysis over {{the last twenty years}} (1993 - 2013) show that the fisheries lost profit between 65 % and 100 % while operating costs increased by 25 % and 90 %, for <b>encircling</b> <b>gillnet</b> and purse seine, respectively. While the fuel price dominates as determining factor during the survey period, important other drivers during the last five years were a decrease in fish biomass and an increase in fishing effort...|$|E
40|$|The mesh {{selectivity}} of monofilament <b>encircling</b> <b>gillnet</b> for Oxeye scad (Cuvier, 1833). Selar boops, {{was investigated}} using multi-panel of six different nets with mesh size of 1. 50 ”, 1. 75 ” and 2. 00 ” (hang-in ratios 35 % and 65 % for each mesh size). Experimental fishing operation {{was carried out}} in the coastal area of Waai (Ambon Island) between September to November 2009. Probability of captured of oxeyescad was estimated using Holt’s method. Estimated optimum selectivity lengths for nets with 35 % hang-in ratio were 14. 33 cm for 1. 50 ” mesh size, 16. 74 cm for 1. 75 ” mesh size and 19. 11 cm for 2. 00 ” mesh size. Net with 65 % hang-in ratio showed slightly larger optimum selectivity lengths (14. 46 cm for 1. 50 ” mesh size and 16. 87 cm for 1. 75 ” mesh size) then the other one...|$|E
50|$|<b>Encircling</b> <b>{{gillnets}}</b> are gillnets set vertically {{in shallow}} water, with the floatline remaining {{at the surface}} so they encircle fish. Small open boats or canoes {{can be used to}} set the net around the fish. Once the fish are encircled, the fishers shout and splash the water to panic the fish so they gill or entangle themselves. There is little negative impact on the environment. As soon as the gear is set the scaring takes place and the net is hauled back in. The fish are alive and discards can be returned to the sea. <b>Encircling</b> <b>gillnets</b> are commonly used by groups of small-scale fishers, and does not require other equipment.|$|R

[...] 1 pageSmall-scale {{fisheries}} {{target to}} several resources, using {{a diversity of}} gears. These fisheries provide employment to limited-income European communities, while are also supporting the food security by local communities from developing countries. Nevertheless, few target species are assessed and monitored, whereas most of gears and métiers are hardly considered into a regular management. Exploring multi-gear and multi-species scenarios without the trawling participation, we analyze competition among gears in the Colombian Caribbean area. Thus, the competition indicators were determined for 22 métiers, operating in data-poor artisanal fisheries, between 2006 and 2014. The results show an increasing dominance of <b>encircling</b> <b>gillnets</b> both wooden and fiberglass boats, because {{they are able to}} catch target species of many others métiers. Conversely, all the canoe fleet, as well as the bottom gillnet and longline fleets have lost both dominance and independence at the expense of <b>encircling</b> <b>gillnets.</b> These results suggest that <b>encircling</b> <b>gillnets,</b> which high catches and few fishers, are promoting activity reduction on many métiers that are supporting the majority of employment. Additionally, this gear removes small size fishes from the ecosystem, resulting in growth overfishing. A single-species pseudo-cohort assessment for two of the most important fishery species Lutjanus synagris (lane snapper) and Haemulon plumierii (white grunt), leads to similar conclusions than competition analysis. Therefore, this multi-gear analysis is useful for an early and inexpensive management on a data-poor context, considering a multi-species fisheryPeer Reviewe...|$|R
