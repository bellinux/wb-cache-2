5|$|In 2003, Professor Simon Brown {{established}} the jack jumper <b>desensitisation</b> program, although {{the program is}} at risk of closure. Since {{the establishment of the}} program, no death has been recorded since 2003. However, the ant may be {{responsible for the death of}} a Bunbury man in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants {{are among the}} most toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% of the human {{population}} are allergic to the venom of M. pilosula and can suffer life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung; many human deaths have been recorded. People prone to severe allergic reactions can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (<b>desensitisation).</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, {{there have}} been four {{recorded}} deaths, all in Tasmania and all due to anaphylactic shock. All known patients who died from jack jumper stings were at least 40 {{years old and had}} cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Severe laryngeal oedema and coronary atherosclerosis was detected in most of the autopsies of those who died. Most of the victims died within 20 minutes after being stung. Prior to any <b>desensitisation</b> program being established, the fatality rate was one person every four years from the sting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Desensitisation</b> (also called allergy immunotherapy) to {{the jack}} jumper sting venom has shown {{effectiveness}} in preventing anaphylaxis, but the standardisation of jack jumper venom {{is yet to}} be validated. Unlike bee and wasp sting immunotherapy, jack jumper immunotherapy lacks funding and no government rebate is available. Venom is available; however, no commercial venom extract is available {{that can be used for}} skin testing. Venom extract is only available through the Therapeutic Goods Administration Special Access Scheme.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. <b>Desensitisation</b> (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run <b>desensitisation</b> programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of <b>desensitisation.</b> Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to <b>desensitisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of <b>desensitisation.</b> Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and venom immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E
5|$|Their sting {{generally}} only {{causes a}} mild local reaction in humans; however, {{it is one}} of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus Myrmecia. The ant venom is particularly immunogenic for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant allergies. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population has developed an allergy to the venom and about half of these allergic people can suffer from anaphylactic reactions (increased heart rate, falling blood pressure, and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, there were four deaths due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (<b>desensitisation).</b>|$|E
5|$|Fatalities {{associated}} with Myrmecia stings are well known, {{and have been}} attested to by multiple sources. In 1931 two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings, possibly from M. pilosula or M. pyriformis. Another fatality was reported in 1963 in Tasmania. Between 1980 and 2000, there were six recorded deaths, five in Tasmania and one in New South Wales. Four of these deaths were due to M. pilosula, while the remaining two died from a M. pyriformis sting. Half of the victims had known ant-sting allergies, but {{only one of the}} victims was carrying adrenaline before being stung. Most victims died within 20 minutes of being stung, but one of the victims died in just five minutes from a M. pyriformis sting. No death has been officially recorded since 2003, but M. pilosula may have been {{responsible for the death of}} a man from Bunbury in 2011. Prior to the establishment of a <b>desensitisation</b> program, Myrmecia stings caused one fatality every four years.|$|E

25|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, the much-studied β2-adrenoceptor {{has been}} demonstrated to activate the ERK2 pathway after arrestin-mediated uncoupling of G-protein-mediated signaling. Therefore, {{it seems likely that}} some mechanisms previously believed related purely to receptor <b>desensitisation</b> are actually examples of receptors switching their signaling pathway, rather than simply being switched off.|$|E
25|$|Translocation: The {{receptor}} is, {{along with}} {{the part of the}} membrane it is embedded in, brought {{to the inside of the}} cell, where it is dephosphorylated within the acidic vesicular environment and then brought back. This mechanism is used to regulate long-term exposure, for example, to a hormone, by allowing resensitisation to follow <b>desensitisation.</b> Alternatively, the receptor may undergo lysozomal degradation, or remain internalised, where it is thought to participate in the initiation of signalling events, the nature of which depending on the internalised vesicle's subcellular localisation.|$|E
25|$|Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A) are {{activated}} by the signal chain {{coming from the}} G protein (that was {{activated by}} the receptor) via adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP (cAMP). In a feedback mechanism, these activated kinases phosphorylate the receptor. The longer the receptor remains active the more kinases are activated and the more receptors are phosphorylated. In β2-adrenoceptors, this phosphorylation results in the switching of the coupling from the Gs class of G-protein to the Gi class. cAMP-dependent PKA mediated phosphorylation can cause heterologous <b>desensitisation</b> in receptors other than those activated.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine {{treatment}} {{should be}} discontinued {{as soon as}} possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. Tolerance develops to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines; for example tolerance occurs to the anticonvulsant effects and as a result benzodiazepines are not generally recommended for the long-term management of epilepsy. Dose increases may overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may increase. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines includes uncoupling of receptor sites, alterations in gene expression, down-regulation of receptor sites, and <b>desensitisation</b> of receptor sites to the effect of GABA. About one-third of individuals who take benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks become dependent and experience withdrawal syndrome on cessation.|$|E
25|$|Currently, all PGD embryos are {{obtained}} by assisted reproductive technology, although {{the use of}} natural cycles and in vivo fertilization followed by uterine lavage was attempted {{in the past and}} is now largely abandoned. In order to obtain a large group of oocytes, the patients undergo controlled ovarian stimulation (COH). COH is carried out either in an agonist protocol, using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for pituitary <b>desensitisation,</b> combined with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), or an antagonist protocol using recombinant FSH combined with a GnRH antagonist according to clinical assessment of the patient’s profile (age, body mass index (BMI), endocrine parameters). hCG is administered when at least three follicles of more than 17mm mean diameter are seen at transvaginal ultrasound scan. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is scheduled 36 hours after hCG administration. Luteal phase supplementation consists of daily intravaginal administration of 600µg of natural micronized progesterone.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Hobart Hospital {{offers a}} <b>desensitisation</b> program for {{patients}} {{who have had a}} severe allergic reaction to a jack jumper sting. However, the program may face closure due to budget cuts. Professor Simon Brown, who founded the program, commented, [...] "Closing the program will leave 300 patients hanging in the lurch". There is a campaign to make the program available in Victoria. The Royal Adelaide Hospital runs a small-scale program that desensitises patients to the ants venom.|$|E
2500|$|... 3) Immunotherapy: A {{wide variety}} {{immunotherapy}} and <b>desensitisation</b> protocols have been trialled {{in attempts to}} reduce or modify the immune response, with considerable success rates. So far, there appear to a significant benefit in more than 80% of equine cases. This particular BioEos product is now available through The National Sweet Itch Centre in the UK and ProVet in the EU. [...] The underlying immune modulation is now proven to shift the immune system from a Th2 to a Th1 mode. BioEos is a research and development company with worldwide patents derived from many years of research at University College London and the many applications are being developed for use in both human, agricultural and aquaculture treatments. [...] Current clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} pancreatic cancers (Immodulon Therapeutics) and the treatment of other chronic immune deficiency disorders (ActinoPharma) are putting this research into practical effect.|$|E
5000|$|Editing also {{occurs at}} the R/G site. Editing at the R/G sites results in {{variation}} in the rate that the receptor recovers from <b>desensitisation.</b> Editing at these sites results in faster recovery time from <b>desensitisation</b> ...|$|E

50|$|PEPA is an ampakine drug {{which acts}} as an {{allosteric}} potentiator of AMPA receptor <b>desensitisation,</b> which is up to 100x more potent than aniracetam in vitro. It produces memory-enhancing effects in rats when administered intravenously.|$|E

50|$|Homologous {{desensitization}} {{should not}} be confused with heterologous <b>desensitisation,</b> which is a different process whereby repeated stimulation of a receptor by an agonist results in desensitization of the stimulated receptor and other receptors on the cell working through similar mechanism to the agonist.|$|E
50|$|Prolonged or {{repeated}} {{exposure to a}} stimulus often results in decreased responsiveness of that receptor toward a stimulus, termed <b>desensitisation.</b> nAChR function can be modulated by phosphorylation by the activation of second messenger-dependent protein kinases. PKA and PKC, as well as tyrosine kinases, {{have been shown to}} phosphorylate the nAChR resulting in its <b>desensitisation.</b> It has been reported that, after prolonged receptor exposure to the agonist, the agonist itself causes an agonist-induced conformational change in the receptor, resulting in receptor desensitisation.Desensitised receptors can revert to a prolonged open state when an agonist is bound {{in the presence of a}} positive allosteric modulator, for example PNU-120596. Also, there is evidence that indicates specific chaperone molecules have regulatory effects on these receptors.|$|E

50|$|This {{research}} {{contributed to}} an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve <b>desensitisation.</b> Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to venom-based allergens took longer, and immunity was found on average after five years.|$|E

50|$|Glycoprotein hormones such as lutropin, which {{triggers}} {{release of}} the egg during ovulation, must stimulate their receptors in pulses to avoid receptor <b>desensitisation.</b> Glycans on their surface are capped with sulphated N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), making them ligands for the cysteine-rich ricin homology domain of the mannose receptor. This tag ensures a cycle of release, stimulation, and removal from the circulation.|$|E
