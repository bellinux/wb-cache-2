After Toby <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> jury duty, Holly returns, causing Michael to once again pursue her, despite her being in a relationship. After eventually proving himself to her, the two get engaged, but Michael decides to move to Boulder, Colorado to help Holly {{take care of her}} elderly parents.

25|$|Fighting the {{bullying}} {{can require}} near heroic action, {{especially if the}} bullying targets {{just one or two}} individuals. It can also be a difficult challenge. There are some times when confrontation <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>for.</b> First, there is always a chance that the bully boss is labouring under the impression {{that this is the way}} to get things done and does not recognize the havoc being wreaked on subordinates.|$|E
25|$|The {{saxophone}} {{was subsequently}} {{introduced into the}} concert bands, which generally call for an E alto saxophone, a B tenor saxophone, and an E baritone saxophone. A typical high-level concert band includes two altos, one tenor, and one baritone. A B soprano saxophone is also occasionally used, in which case it is normally played by the first alto saxophonist. A bass saxophone in B <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> in some concert band music (especially music by Percy Grainger).|$|E
25|$|Current {{experimental}} evidence {{focuses on the}} involvement of the occipitotemporal pathway in both the perceptual equivalence of objects across translations of retinal position and also across size modifications. Recent evidence points to this pathway as a mediator for an individual's perception of size. Even further, numerous cases suggest that size perception may be dissociated from other aspects of visual perception such as color and movement. However, more research <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> to correctly relate the condition to defined physiological conditions.|$|E

25|$|The name {{given in}} the act of Congress, taken in {{connection}} with its context, would assuredly apply to a rapid in the Des Moines River, if a notorious one existed, as the Mississippi River is not mentioned in the call, and the Des Moines is; nor was the Mississippi River to be reached by that line. Then, again, the rapid is fourteen miles long, and no part of it <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> as an opposite point to found the line upon.|$|E

In Tier 2, the competitors will audition to a producer of the show, where they will be asked to sing a minimum of two songs. The successful auditioner will receive a Blue Ticket, and will need to return to the registration desk to register for the Celebrity Judges round.|$|E
25|$|If, in {{a process}} of change of state of a closed system, the energy {{transfer}} is not under a practically zero temperature gradient and practically frictionless, then the process is irreversible.

25|$|Every Monday, Thursday and Shabbat in Orthodox synagogues (and many Conservative ones as well), {{a portion}} from the Torah is read aloud in the {{original}} Hebrew {{in front of the}} congregation. On weekdays, this reading is divided into three; it is customary to call a kohen for the first reading (aliyah), a Levite for the second reading, and a member of any other Tribe of Israel to the third reading. On Shabbat, the reading is divided into seven portions; a kohen <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the first aliyah and a levite to the second, and a member of another tribe for the rest.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} {{of the novel is}} told from many perspectives – ranging from the rich nobility to low-class civilians – and tells of the opening phases of the siege on Vervunhive. The mega-city's neighbouring hive, Ferrozoica, amasses an army and marches on their former rival with an unknown agenda. The Vervun Primary militia prepares to repel the invasion forces, but as Vervunhive's High Master refuses to believe that Ferrozoica has mobilised against them, they are not given permission to arm their defence batteries before the Zoicans fire the opening salvos. Much of Vervunhive is plunged into panic and thousands perish in the first few days, and aid from the Imperial Guard <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{the regular}} aliyot, {{the honor of}} Hatan Torah ("Groom of the Torah") is given to a {{distinguished}} member of the congregation, who <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> an aliyah in which the remaining verses of the Torah are read, to complete that year's reading. Another member of the congregation is honored with Hatan Bereishit ("Groom of Genesis"), and receives an aliyah in which the first verses of the Torah, containing the creation account of Genesis, are read (a second copy of the Torah is usually used, so that the first need not be rolled {{all the way to}} the beginning while the congregants wait). Afterwards, the services proceed in the usual manner, with the maftir and haftarah for Simchat Torah.|$|E

25|$|Barry causes Colin {{problems}} by interfering with his work, deliberately making him jealous, {{and engaging in}} criminal antics with villainous Nick Cotton (John Altman) leaving Colin {{to pay for the}} damages. Further problems arise when Colin <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> jury service in 1987. The plaintiff {{is a member of the}} gangster organisation known as The Firm, and when Colin refuses to give a verdict of not guilty at the trial, Colin's flat is vandalised by Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt). Colin calls the police, but they are more concerned about Colin's relationship with Barry than catching the vandals. They discover that Barry was under the age of legal sexual consent for gay men when he and Colin began living together, and the police decide to inform Barry's parents (in 1987 the legal age of sexual consent for gay men was 21). Barry is petrified of his homophobic father and decides to end his relationship with Colin.|$|E
25|$|The Curia Urbis or the Vicariate of the City of Rome {{was divided}} into four {{departments}} (officia), of which the second is again divided into four sections. The first department (officium) has under its care all the church services and the Apostolic visitation of the diocese. The second department watches over the behaviour of the clergy and the Christian people. Judicial matters are settled in the third department, and the fourth department {{is devoted to the}} economic administration of the entire vicariate. The head of all these bureaus is the cardinal who is the vicar-general of the pope in Rome. His office and the extent of his power are always the same and are permanent, so that they do not cease even when the Papal See is vacant. This fact distinguishes the cardinal vicar as he <b>is</b> <b>called,</b> <b>for</b> the designation is not an official title, from all other vicars-general in the world, and gives him his peculiar legal position. In the same way it is a noticeable exception that the four departments can carry on their customary business, even when the vicar is not able to supervise what is done on account of the conclave or of some other impediment. Even should the vicar die the work of the departments goes quietly on. Formerly {{this was not the case}} to so large a degree, as is shown by the deputation of 17 December 1876, on the death of Cardinal Vicar Patrizi.|$|E
