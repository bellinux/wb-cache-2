He became Senator from São Paulo for the former Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) in 1982, substituting as a suplent the newly-elected governort of São Paulo, Franco Montoro. In 1985, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of São Paulo against former President Jânio Quadros. Ahead in the polls, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be photographed in the mayor's chair before the elections. Some attribute his loss to this episode.|$|E
25|$|The legend {{continues}} that, as the seer foretold, Olaf {{was attacked}} {{by a group of}} mutineers upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the Haakon Jarl was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.|$|E
25|$|In the Swiss Cup final that season, Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In {{the former}} Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via a penalty. The game {{went down in}} {{football}} history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1–1, referee Karl Göppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty: André Grobéty had pushed Hauser gently {{in the back and}} <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> drop theatrically. Subsequent to Basel taking the lead, Lausanne players refused to resume the game, sitting down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee was forced to abandon the match and Basel were awarded the cup with a 3–0 default victory.|$|E

25|$|In 995 Olaf Tryggvason became King Olaf I of Norway. Olaf had raided various European {{cities and}} fought in several wars. In 986 however, he (supposedly) met a Christian seer on the Isles of Scilly. As the seer foretold, Olaf was {{attacked}} {{by a group of}} mutineers upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be baptized. He then stopped raiding Christian cities and lived in England and Ireland. In 995 he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, Haakon Jarl was already facing a revolt, and Olaf Tryggvason could convince the rebels to accept him as their king. Haakon Jarl was later betrayed and killed by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.|$|E
500|$|Henry VIII {{ascended the}} English throne in 1509 {{at the age}} of 17. He made a dynastic {{marriage}} with Catherine of Aragon, widow of his brother Arthur, in June 1509, just before his coronation on Midsummer's Day. Unlike his father, who was secretive and conservative, the young Henry appeared the epitome of chivalry and sociability. An observant Roman Catholic, he heard up to five masses a day (except during the hunting season); of [...] "powerful but unoriginal mind", <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be influenced by his advisors from whom he was never apart, by night or day. He was thus susceptible to whoever had his ear.|$|E
500|$|In the hatch, Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Ana-Lucía (Michelle Rodriguez) {{interrogate}} [...] "Henry Gale" [...] (Michael Emerson). After Henry's new cover-up {{story is}} proved false, Henry finally {{admits that he}} is indeed an Other, but says he would be killed if he talks. Later, Locke (Terry O'Quinn) confronts the prisoner, demanding to know if <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be caught, thinking {{it might have been}} to find the Swan. [...] "Henry", however, calls the hatch a [...] "joke", saying that during the lockdown, he never entered the numbers into the computer or pushed the button; he simply stood there, and watched the timer's numbers turn to red hieroglyphs before they reset back on their own. Locke, however, replies angrily that Henry is lying, but he replies that he's [...] "done lying".|$|E
6000|$|A revulsion of {{contempt}} and disgust came over Gerald's soul. The disgust {{went to the}} very bottom of him, a nausea. Ah, what was he doing, to what depths was <b>he</b> <b>letting</b> <b>himself</b> go! As if he cared about her enough to kill her, to have her life on his hands! ...|$|R
50|$|A mid-tempo ballad {{backed by}} {{electric}} guitar, the song centralizes on the male character who has {{finally come to}} the realiziation that he has caused his lover emotional pain. He then asks <b>himself</b> why <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>himself</b> treat her wrongly, and why he takes so long to show his feelings for her.|$|R
50|$|Louis Dewis {{embodies the}} Flemish spirit, {{in love with}} colorings that are warm and harmonious. He treats tenderly the humble motifs {{reinforcing}} the simplicity of their soberly translated soul. But he also adores the sumptuous symphonies in which the greens, the reds and the golds sing, as <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>himself</b> be charmed by the veil of a mist.|$|R
500|$|The {{landlord}} of The Plumbers Arms {{described how}} Lady Lucan had entered his bar covered [...] "head to toe in blood" [...] before {{she fell into}} [...] "a state of shock". He claimed that she shouted [...] "Help me, help me, I've just escaped from being murdered" [...] and [...] "My children, my children, he's murdered my nanny". Pathologist Keith Simpson outlined his post-mortem examination, concluding that death was caused by [...] "blunt head injuries" [...] and [...] "inhalation of blood". He confirmed that the lead pipe found at the scene was most likely responsible for Rivett's injuries; some, to the left eye and mouth, he thought {{more likely to have}} been caused by punches from a clenched fist. The last person to confirm seeing Lucan alive, Susan Maxwell-Scott, told the court that the earl looked [...] "dishevelled", and his hair [...] "a little ruffled". His trousers had a damp patch on the right hip. Lucan had told her that he was walking, or passing by the house when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> in but slipped in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs. He told Maxwell-Scott that the attacker ran off, and that Veronica was [...] "very hysterical" [...] and accused him of having hired a hitman to kill her.|$|E
2500|$|The writer R.V. Cassill has {{suggested}} that of all crime fiction, Thompson's was the rawest and most harrowing; that neither Dashiell Hammett nor Raymond Chandler nor even Horace McCoy, author of the bleak They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, ever [...] "wrote a book within miles of Thompson". Similarly, {{in the introduction to}} Now and on Earth, Stephen King says he most admires Thompson's work because [...] "The guy was over the top. The guy was absolutely over the top. Big Jim didn't know {{the meaning of the word}} stop. There are three brave lets inherent in the foregoing: <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> see everything, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> write it down, then <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> publish it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Iliad vi.155–203 {{contains}} an embedded narrative told by Bellerophon's grandson Glaucus, named for his great-grandfather, which recounts Bellerophon's myth. Bellerophon's father was Glaucus, {{who was the}} king of Corinth {{and the son of}} Sisyphus. Bellerophon's grandsons Sarpedon and the younger Glaucus fought in the Trojan War. In the Epitome of pseudo-Apollodorus, a genealogy is given for Chrysaor ("of the golden sword") that would make him a double of Bellerophon; he too is called the son of Glaucus the son of Sisyphus. Chrysaor has no myth save that of his birth: from the severed neck of Medusa, who was with child by Poseidon, he and Pegasus both sprang at the moment of her death. [...] "From this moment we hear no more of Chrysaor, the rest of the tale concerning the stallion only... perhaps also for his brother's sake, by whom in the end <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be caught, the immortal horse by his mortal brother." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Remarkable is Berkhout’s {{enormous}} drive. He becomes genuinely enthousiastic {{when other}} musicians play good solo’s and <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>himself</b> be inspired to play clarinetsolo’s of a calibre {{that has not}} been heard since the days of Jan Morks. He is Holland’s best jazz clarinettist by far.” (Bert Brandsma, saxophonist in the Chris Barber Jazz Band, Doctor Jazz magazine 2012) ...|$|R

60|$|Lockhart's Review.[242] Don't {{like his}} article on Sheridan's life. There is no breadth in it, no general views, the whole flung away in smart but party criticism. Now, no man can take more general and liberal views of {{literature}} than J.G.L. But <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>himself</b> too easily into that advocatism of style, {{which is that}} of a pleader, not a judge or a critic, and is particularly unsatisfactory to the reader.
