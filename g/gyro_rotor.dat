5000|$|The {{instrument}} {{may develop}} small [...] "precession" [...] errors, in pitch indication during {{extended periods of}} acceleration or deceleration and, in bank indication during extended periods in a turn, caused by the mechanism that normally keeps the <b>gyro</b> <b>rotor</b> properly erected. These errors develop very slowly (usually at not more than 2 or 3 degrees per minute) and are not significant in normal flying. Some attitude indicators can only tolerate a specific range of bank angles. If the aircraft rolls too steeply or achieves an extreme pitch attitude — while performing aerobatics, for example — the attitude indicator can [...] "tumble" [...] (or [...] "topple") and become temporarily unusable. For this reason, some attitude indicators are fitted with a [...] "caging mechanism" [...] (a device to restore the gyroscope to an erect position). Some attitude indicators can be manually erected once the airplane is in level flight using the caging mechanism. Most modern instruments are designed to tolerate 360 degrees of rotation in pitch and roll without tumbling, although periods of violent aerobatics may tumble any gyro horizon. [...] Once tumbled, an instrument without a caging mechanism {{may not be able}} to re-erect itself until power is removed and the aircraft is in a level pitch and roll attitude for a long enough period that the <b>gyro</b> <b>rotor</b> comes to a stop.|$|E
50|$|It {{is based}} on a {{gyroscope}} that erects so its spin axis is vertical. The housing for the <b>gyro</b> <b>rotor</b> rotates at a low speed, on the order of 18 rpm. On opposite sides of the housing are two small tanks, partially filled with mercury, and connected by a capillary tube. Mercury flows to the lower tank, but slowly (several seconds) because of the tube's restriction. If the gyro's spin axis is not vertical, the added weight in the lower tank would pull the housing over {{if it were not for}} the gyro and the housing's rotation. That rotational speed and rate of mercury flow combine to put the heavier tank in the best position to make the gyro precess toward the vertical.|$|E

At same time, it around y axis rotation follows the disc. That is, the disk does not rotation, but each particle in the rotor circular motion relative to the disk, at the same time, it rotate with the angular velocity ω follows the disc. On {{the basis of the}} simplified model, apply the knowledge on the synthetic movement of theoretical mechanics; research each particle acceleration in the <b>gyro</b> <b>rotor.</b> Then according to the Newton's law to analysis the force situation of each particle in the rotor, to reveal the mechanical essence of nutation and precession characteristics of the <b>Gyro</b> <b>rotor.</b> Then, according to the situation of the applied forces on each particle in the rotor, reveal mechanics essence of nutation and precession characteristics of the gyro. Characteristics of the Gyro After a high-speed free rotating gyroscope transient is disturbed, its axis deviation. But after the deviation from the axis of rotation for a period of time, the rotation shaft gradually returned to the pre disturbance location. If applying a couple in a free rotating <b>gyro</b> <b>rotor,</b> not as people imagine, the rotor will produce rotation around perpendicular vectors applied couple axis.

Niobium-coated fused quartz <b>gyro</b> <b>rotors</b> have been successfully suspended and spun up in those housings. The Cu/Ti bilayer coating and alternative multilayer coatings (Cu/Mo, Mo/Cu/Ti and Mo/Cu/Mo) with 2 -micron thickness produced by sputter deposition on flat, fused quartz substrates have been examined with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and four-point resistivity measurement techniques.

The SQUID will be built around the <b>gyro</b> <b>rotor,</b> with a very close spacing to give an inductance between 10 millionths and 1 millionth Hy.

50|$|Although many regard {{trails and}} street as being {{completely}} opposite, the attraction is similar — trails riders {{build their own}} jumps so their riding is limited only by their creativity and resourcefulness. Trails riders usually run a rear brake only as they have no use for a front brake, and usually a <b>rotor</b> (<b>gyro)</b> {{to make it easier}} to do barspins, so they do not have to spin the bars back the other way to untangle them, which is hard to do on trails. In general, trail/dirt jumping bikes have longer wheelbases (chainstays) than other BMXs to aid with stability, the added stability is important in trails riding.|$|R
40|$|GPS {{was used}} with a short {{baseline}} (1 and 2 wavelengths) triple antenna configuration to obtain attitude in conjunction with solid state rate gyros. The system was used to provide an inexpensive Attitude-Heading Reference System (AHRS) for use by small General Aviation aircraft. The gyros enabled a high bandwidth output while the GPS was used to estimate the gyro drift rate. The resulting attitude information was used, along with GPS-based position, by a graphical "out-thewindow " view with tunnels indicating the desired path in the sky for the current phase of flight. Accuracy and ease of flying are enhanced by the system. I.

40|$|The {{progress}} {{accomplished in}} the Stanford Gyro Relativity program during the period November 1974 to October 1975 was described. Gyro developments were continued in the main laboratory dewar, concentrating on the operation of a three axis gyro readout and on improvements to the methods of canceling trapped fields in the rotor; these efforts culminated in the first successful observation of the London moment in the spinning <b>gyro</b> <b>rotor</b> in March 1975. Following a review meeting at that time, a new goal was formulated for the next 12 to 18 months, namely to operate a gyroscope in the new ultra-low field facility with readout resolution approaching 1 arc-second. The following other tasks were also completed: (1) sputtering work, (2) magnetometry, (3) construction and installation of the North Star simulator, (4) analysis of torques on the gyro, especially in inclined orbits, (5) equivalence principle accelerometer, and (6) analysis of a twin-satellite test of relativity...|$|E
40|$|GyroWheel is an {{innovative}} device that combines the actuating capabilities of a control moment gyro with the rate sensing capabilities of a tuned <b>rotor</b> <b>gyro</b> {{by using a}} spinning flex-gimbal system. However, {{in the process of}} the ground test, the existence of aerodynamic disturbance is inevitable, which hinders the improvement of the specification performance and control accuracy. A vacuum tank test is a possible candidate but is sometimes unrealistic due to the substantial increase in costs and complexity involved. In this paper, the aerodynamic drag problem with respect to the 3 -DOF flex-gimbal GyroWheel system is investigated by simulation analysis and experimental verification. Concretely, the angular momentum envelope property of the spinning rotor system is studied and its integral dynamical model is deduced based on the physical configuration of the GyroWheel system with an appropriately defined coordinate system. In the sequel, the fluid numerical model is established and the model geometries are checked with FLUENT software. According to the diversity and time-varying properties of the rotor motions in three-dimensions, the airflow field around the GyroWheel rotor is analyzed by simulation with respect to its varying angular velocity and tilt angle. The IPC-based experimental platform is introduced, and the properties of aerodynamic drag in the ground test condition are obtained through comparing the simulation with experimental results...|$|R
