5|$|FMCSA rules {{prohibit}} {{driving a}} passenger-carrying CMV (e.g., commercial and city buses, passenger vans, and school buses) {{for more than}} 10hours, or to drive after having been on-duty for 15hours. The 5-hour difference between the 10-hour driving limit and the 15-hour on-duty limit gives drivers {{the opportunity to take}} care of non-driving work-related duties such as loading and unloading of passengers and luggage, and <b>fueling</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, as well as non-working duties such as meal and rest breaks. After completing a 10 to 15-hour on-duty period, the driver must be allowed 8hours off-duty.|$|E
5|$|FMCSA rules {{prohibit}} {{driving a}} property-carrying CMV (e.g., trucks) more than 11hours or to drive {{after having been}} on-duty for 14hours.

After completing an 11- to 14-hour on-duty period, the driver must be allowed 10hours off-duty.|$|E
25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl. <b>The</b> float lifts upward toward the bottom of <b>the</b> inverted <b>fuel</b> bowl. With <b>the</b> float at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet valve opens, as it would when there is not enough <b>fuel</b> in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl. With <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet valve open, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump continues pumping <b>fuel</b> into <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl, where <b>the</b> resulting excess <b>fuel</b> causes <b>the</b> fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R

5|$|The Melbourne Storm has {{a strong}} rivalry with Brisbane, built {{in large part on}} the large number of finals games played between the teams, {{including}} one final in each year from 2004 to 2009; the Storm winning all but one of them.

5|$|After {{changing}} {{little in}} intensity {{for much of}} 6 November, Gay strengthened as the ridge to its north intensified and the previous restrictions to its outflow diminished. The storm moved due west through a small fetch of warmer waters, <b>fueling</b> <b>the</b> process of intensification over the next 42hours. Based on estimates provided {{through the use of}} the Dvorak technique, the JTWC assessed Gay to have attained its peak intensity as a Category5-equivalent cyclone with winds of 260km/h (160mph) early on November8. Around this time, the IMD estimated that the storm had three-minute sustained winds of 240km/h (145mph), classifying Gay as a modern-day Super Cyclonic Storm. Additionally, the agency estimated the cyclone's central pressure to have decreased to 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Around 1800UTC, Gay made landfall over a sparsely populated area near Kavali, India, in Andhra Pradesh. Upon coming ashore, the storm's eye was about 20km (12mi) wide, with gale-force winds within 95km (60mi) of the center. Now over land, Gay no longer had access to warm waters, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm less than 12hours after landfall. The storm continued to deteriorate while moving across India, before it completely dissipated over Maharashtra on 10 November.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the city proper begins around 660 BCE, when Greek {{settlers}} from Megara established Byzantium on the European side of the Bosphorus. The settlers built an acropolis adjacent to the Golden Horn {{on the site of}} the early Thracian settlements, <b>fueling</b> <b>the</b> nascent city's economy. The city experienced a brief period of Persian rule at the turn of the 5th century BCE, but the Greeks recaptured it during the Greco-Persian Wars. Byzantium then continued as part of the Athenian League and its successor, the Second Athenian Empire, before gaining independence in 355 BCE. Long allied with the Romans, Byzantium officially became a part of the Roman Empire in 73 CE. Byzantium's decision to side with the Roman usurper Pescennius Niger against Emperor Septimius Severus cost it dearly; by the time it surrendered at the end of 195 CE, two years of siege had left the city devastated. Five years later, Severus began to rebuild Byzantium, and the city regained—and, by some accounts, surpassed—its previous prosperity.|$|E
