5|$|In April 1992, ITV offered Parry an {{improved}} bid of £34 million per year, which bettered the BBC's joint-bid with BSkyB. East was confident of closing the deal – he {{was supported by}} 11 club chairmen and was informed that ITV's rivals would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with £100 {{million a year to}} better their offer. Parry was undecided as to which bid he preferred; though he favoured a non-exclusive deal with ITV, he wanted the reconsider its decision to work with subscription companies. He harboured the idea of a football channel and noted SBC's approval amongst other clubs. Parry also hoped BSkyB would increase their bid, which they later did.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact the}} {{builders}} {{of the new}} Albatros twin-gunned stationary-engined fighters of late 1916 had to introduce their own synchronization gear, known as the Hedtke gear or Hedtkesteuerung, and {{it was evident that}} Fokker were going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with something radically new.|$|E
500|$|Ian Wolf {{from the}} British Comedy Guide commented that: [...] "The {{fact that the}} series moved {{from town to town}} was very {{impressive}} – as it meant Steel had to write a unique half-hour routine for each venue (compare this to most stand-ups, who only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with about an hour of strong material a year!)." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Market Forces" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Robinson and {{directed}} by Dan Fausett. Though the show {{is done in the}} style of traditional animation, computer-generated imagery was used to produce the green sonic beams made by Shocker. In the original comic book publications, Shocker's secret identity was a man named Herman Schultz. For The Spectacular Spider-Man, they changed his identity to that of Enforcer Montana, who had, in the comics, been a prominent character already. Using Montana allowed the writers to not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a completely new origin for Shocker. His suit was generally the same as that done in the comic books, but had extra features including goggles and vibrators. His voice was provided by veteran voice performer Jeff Bennett.|$|E
500|$|He {{also argued}} that [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] and trilogy episodes in general are an excuse for the series' writers to not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with new stories for the characters. [...] "It's {{understandable}} that after eleven years, a show might have trouble continuing {{to come up with}} original material for the same five characters, but the anthology episodes come across as rather transparent attempts to avoid that challenge", he wrote. On the other hand, DVD Verdict's Mac MacEntire argued that [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] is one of the season's best episodes. He wrote that the episode is [...] "filled with great gags", including the hobo's sponge bath and Bart and Nelson's discussion about [...] "backtacks" [...] and [...] "tackbacks".|$|E
500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Don Johnson Big Band" [...] {{comes from}} the actor Don Johnson in the series Miami Vice. The band <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a name to reserve a place for training.|$|R

500|$|Regarding Wolverine {{within the}} context of the X-Men film series, Tom Charity of CNN commented: [...] "Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this Wolverine movie does just enough to keep the X-Men {{franchise}} on life support, but the filmmakers will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction." [...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that [...] "X-Men Origins: Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue." [...] On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's [...] "dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff" [...] is [...] "of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read it all in Marvel comics." ...|$|E
500|$|Sandra Harding {{says that}} the [...] "moral and {{political}} insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds." [...] Some feminists, such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller, criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective. A part of the feminist research agenda is {{the examination of the}} ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions. Physicist Lisa Randall, appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, [...] "I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kingdom Hearts III will {{introduce}} more worlds such as Kingdom of Corona, San Fransokyo, and {{one based on}} Toy Story. When questioned {{on the possibility of}} including worlds based on Disney-purchased properties such as Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm, co-director Tai Yasue said, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a world {{that has a lot of}} originality. We want variety... so we don't want too many of one sort of world, that would look the same. For each world there has to be some meaning for it, in the plot... Also, gameplay-wise, is that world something that would make gameplay fun?" [...] The game will not feature any worlds based on Final Fantasy.|$|E

50|$|Visu {{mentioned}} that the censor wanted 87 cuts for the film as they were not impressed with the caricatured portrayal of character Rowther (portrayed by M. N. Nambiar). Visu <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the scene where he explains about his portrayal.|$|R
25|$|The Rough Riders {{landed at}} Daiquirí on June 22, 1898. Two Buffalo Soldiers, of the 10th Cavalry fell overboard. Upon seeing this, O'Neill {{jumped into the}} water in full uniform and sabre.

2500|$|In {{classical}} statistical mechanics, {{the number}} of microstates is actually uncountably infinite, since the properties of classical systems are continuous. For example, a microstate of a classical ideal gas is specified by the positions and momenta of all the atoms, which range continuously over the real numbers. If we want to define Ω, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a method of grouping the microstates together to obtain a countable set. This procedure is known as coarse graining. In {{the case of the}} ideal gas, we count two states of an atom as the [...] "same" [...] state if their positions and momenta are within δx and δp of each other. Since the values of δx and δp can be chosen arbitrarily, the entropy is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an additive constant. (As we will see, the thermodynamic definition of entropy is also defined only up to a constant.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Large undeveloped {{private and}} federally owned coal {{deposits}} are located along Otter Creek, {{a tributary of}} the Tongue River. These coal deposits are located south of Ashland, which is at the junction of the Tongue River and Otter Creek. These coal deposits are sufficiently thick, and are located under sufficiently thin overburden, as to be economically viable. Drawbacks for production are the lack of a rail spur to transport the coal, and the lack of an established community of sufficient size in the area to support the work force needed to develop the coal mines. A railroad spur line, if built, would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> the Tongue River from Miles City, a distance of some 65 to 70 miles. Extensive infrastructure improvements would have {{to be added to the}} community of Ashland before it could support the number of worker's families that the mine would draw to the area. These deposits on Otter Creek are the source of much debate over the future of energy development in southeastern Montana. [...] Arch Coal has submitted an application to develop a coal mine in the area, but it has not, as of 2015, been approved by state regulators. [...] The Tongue River Railroad project, planned to move coal from the mine to Colstrip, is also in the permitting stage.|$|E

50|$|Because this {{exercise}} is {{an introduction to}} argument in the philosophical schools, the use of thesis was not performed until first completing all previous exercises. Students <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a thesis argument of their own nature; these questions were often ones difficult to answer.|$|R

60|$|The Tunnel is a {{subterranean}} passage {{under the}} Thames, {{made at a}} place where it was impossible to have a bridge, on account of the shipping. They expected, when they made the Tunnel, that it would be used a great deal by persons wishing to cross the river. But it is found, on trial, that almost every body who wishes to go across the river at that place prefers to go in a boat rather than go down into the Tunnel. The reason is, that the Tunnel is so far below the bed of the river that you have to go down a long series of flights of stairs before you get to the entrance to it; and then, after going across, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> just as many stairs before you get into the street again. This is found to be so troublesome and fatiguing that almost every one who has occasion to go across the river prefers to cross it by a ferry boat {{on the surface of the}} water; and scarcely any one goes into the Tunnel except those who wish to visit it out of curiosity.|$|E
