There he learned that his brother Heman had died just the previous week, and that his brother Zimri, who had been caring for Allen's family and farm, {{had died in the}} spring following his capture. The death of Heman, with whom Allen had been quite close, hit <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> hard.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after filming Basic Instinct 2, {{he began}} work on The Reaping (2007) in Louisiana, in which he played science teacher Doug Blackwell {{opposite}} Hilary Swank. The role had been offered to <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> late in pre-production, and he flew to Baton Rouge the Monday after Basic Instinct 2 wrapped. He took the role {{because he was a}} fan of Swank, and Hopkins' film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004), and he preferred the thriller aspect of the Reaping script above the horror aspect. After a week of filming, production had to be suspended when Hurricane Katrina hit the state. He found the filming schedule quite demanding, particularly the three weeks of night filming and a scene in which his character is attacked by a plague of locusts, most of which were computer-generated in post-production but some were real on camera. The Reaping was released in 2007 and performed badly in cinemas. Despite the failures of both films, Morrissey was grateful that they opened him up to more film offers from Hollywood.|$|E

25|$|Hadlee was a right-arm pace bowler. Initially {{extremely}} fast, as {{the years}} progressed he shortened his run amid great controversy, gained accuracy, movement off the wicket and in the air, and a reputation that probably gained <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> a few wickets on its own. Perhaps his most potent delivery was the often unplayable outswinger, which became his main weapon in the latter stages of his career.|$|E
25|$|With Roman backing, Masinissa {{established}} his own kingdom of Numidia, west of Carthage, with Cirta — present day Constantine — as its capital city. All of {{this happened in}} accordance with Roman interest, as they wanted to give Carthage more problems with its neighbours. Masinissa’s chief aim was to build a strong and unified state from the semi-nomadic Numidian tribes. To that end, he introduced Carthaginian agricultural techniques and forced many Numidians to settle as peasant farmers. Masinissa and his sons possessed large estates throughout Numidia, {{to the extent that}} Roman authors attributed to <b>him,</b> <b>quite</b> falsely, the sedentarization of the Numidians. Major towns included Capsa, Thugga (modern Dougga), Bulla Regia and Hippo Regius.|$|E

25|$|Various {{sources and}} {{publications}} {{have suggested that}} some springtails may parasitize humans, but this is entirely inconsistent with their biology, and no such phenomenon has ever been scientifically confirmed, though {{it has been documented}} that the scales or hairs from collembolans can cause irritation when rubbed onto the skin. They may sometimes be abundant indoors in damp places such as bathrooms and basements, and incidentally found on one's person. More often, claims of persistent human skin infection by springtails may indicate a neurological problem, such as delusory parasitosis, a psychological rather than entomological problem. Researchers themselves may be subject to psychological phenomena. For example, a publication in 2004 claiming that springtails had been found in skin samples was later determined to be a case of pareidolia; that is, no springtail specimens were actually recovered, but the researchers had digitally enhanced photos of sample debris to create images resembling small arthropod heads, which then were claimed to be springtail remnants. However, Steve Hopkin reports one instance of an entomologist aspirating an Isotoma species and in the process accidentally inhaling some of their eggs, which hatched in his nasal cavity and made <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> ill until they were flushed out.|$|E

500|$|His Wisden {{obituary}} {{states that}} Small was a [...] "tall, loose-limbed all-rounder, who did much fine work for Trinidad". In The Complete Record of West Indian Test Cricketers, Bridgette Lawrence states: [...] "Joe Small {{was one of}} West Indies' pioneering all-rounders in Test cricket. He was a gifted batsman with all the strokes at his command, a medium-pace off-break bowler and a competent slip fielder." [...] The Daily Gleaner gave Small credit, along with other Trinidadian cricketers of the time, for overcoming {{the dominance of the}} Barbados team. Wisden also described him as a [...] "splendid" [...] slip fielder. Small batted in a variety of positions in the batting order, but usually lower than number three. He sometimes opened the bowling and was capable of bowling quickly. He also bowled off spin at medium pace; his height made <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> difficult for batsmen to face.|$|E

500|$|Francis Iles, {{writing in}} The Guardian, noting the short-story format, [...] "thought {{it better than}} the novels" [...] and wrote that [...] "the first story is full of the old wild improbabilities, {{but one of the}} others has a {{positively}} Maughamish flavour." [...] Iles also thought that [...] "it seems that one must either enjoy the novels of Mr. Ian Fleming beyond reason or be unable to read them at all." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> well" [...] although the downside is that [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along. Perhaps all that mattress pounding is taking it out of poor Bond".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 31, 1910. It states, [...] "May Smalley is a simple little country girl with whom Jack, a youth whom she has known since childhood, {{is very much in}} love. When a traveling show, consisting of a hypnotist and a Hindu magician comes to the opera house in her little town, the two young people are among the other interested spectators who flock to see the performance. May's youth and beauty attract the hypnotist, who plans to lure her away from her home. He sends May a message that he has a communication for her from the spirit world. Against the protest of Jack, her escort, May goes behind the scenes after the performance to meet with the great hypnotist, who fascinates her with his wiles. The hypnotist is an unscrupulous villain, and seeing that May is thoroughly impressed with his few tricks and considers <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> superhuman, he induces her to follow him when he leaves the town. How Jack proves himself to be a youth of resource as well as courage, the important part he played in May's deliverance by the Hindu fakir, is well told by the picture. Finally the hypnotist is shown in his true light. May is disillusioned, and comes to decide that Jack is just about the kind of protection she needs in a world of uncertainty." [...] According to a reviewer, Jack comes up to the stage where the Hindu magician is and knocks him down. Jack takes his costume and follows the hypnotist and May to the hotel where he rescues her.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, who {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation in May 2007, {{thought she might}} be more forgiving in hindsight as she knows that the follow-ups to [...] "Datalore" [...] were great episodes. She thought it was reminiscent of the evil twin of Captain James T. Kirk in [...] episode [...] "" [...] and the mirror universe version of Spock seen in [...] "". She felt that Lore lacked any motivation for what he was intending to do, and that the crew were made to look [...] "pretty stupid" [...] by their inaction to the Lore threat. She thought that the ending was shocking, as transporting the villain into space would never have occurred if they were human, and [...] "a moment of utter inconsistency" [...] as Lore had only just told the entity to attack when the shields drop following a transporter activation. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] valued the episode for providing backstory to Data, but said that [...] "no one is smart enough to realize the obvious. None of the crew except Boy Wesley realizes that Lore is impersonating Data — and when Wesley (who is always somehow more observant than the silly adults) brings this to their attention, we get helpful lines like, [...] "Shut up, Wesley," [...] which lead to even more helpful lines of would-be teenage rebellion when Wesley complains about the officers not listening to <b>him.</b> <b>Quite</b> simply, this is annoying material, continuing in season one's trend of Wesley's child status as a plot device. Meanwhile, all the adults look terminally clueless." [...] He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{criticism}} of Clark's reliability arose in March 2007 {{with the discovery}} that Clark's account, given in his memoirs and elsewhere, of walking the streets of Bonn the day after Kristallnacht was untrue. By examining Clark's letters and diary, the writer Mark McKenna established that it was Clark's future wife Dymphna, and not Clark, who was present on that day, although Clark did arrive in Bonn a fortnight later. Brian Matthews notes, however, that when Clark was reunited with Dymphna [...] "as his diary records, on 25 November 1938" [...] evidence of Kristallnacht [...] "was still shockingly visible, and it was explicit and confronting enough to scar his sensibilities and live in his memory...With his capacity for imaginative reconstruction and his acute sensitivity to emotional ambience and atmosphere, what he saw of its immediate aftermath was for <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> as shattering as the original event had been for Dymphna and others who had experienced it {{on the night of}} 10 November 1938".|$|E

2500|$|During Nancy's childhood, {{her family}} moved to a house called Rheola in Croxley Green. After she left school, Nancy {{completed}} a course at the Triangle Secretarial College in London and obtained a position as a clerk in the Imperial Continental Gas Association. Soon after she started there, her friend from the College, Madge Fox, joined her. In 1925, Madge married Frank Henry James, and the couple lived in Hurtmore Cottage near Godalming. It was here that Christie saw Nancy at house parties on weekends before his divorce from Agatha. After their marriage, in 1928, Archie and Nancy Christie lived in a London flat at 84 Avenue Road (NW8). They had one son, Archibald (born 1930). Christie stayed in contact with Rosalind, his daughter from his first marriage. In an interview that was published in The Times, Rosalind Hicks made the following comments about her father's second marriage: [...] "Eventually my father married Nancy Neele and they lived happily together until she died. I saw <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> often and we always liked and understood one another." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ivan Bunin's early childhood, {{spent in}} Butyrky Khutor {{and later in}} Ozerky (of Yelets county, Lipetskaya Oblast), was a happy one: the boy was {{surrounded}} by intelligent and loving people. Father Alexei Nikolayevich was described by Bunin as a very strong man, both physically and mentally, quick-tempered and addicted to gambling, impulsive and generous, eloquent in a theatrical fashion and totally illogical. [...] "Before the Crimean War he'd never even known the taste of wine, on return he became a heavy drinker, although never a typical alcoholic," [...] he wrote. His mother Lyudmila Alexandrovna's character was much more subtle and tender: this Bunin attributed {{to the fact that}} [...] "her father spent years in Warsaw where he acquired certain European tastes which made <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> different from fellow local land-owners." [...] It was Lyudmila Alexandrovna who introduced her son to the world of Russian folklore. Elder brothers Yuly and Yevgeny showed great interest in mathematics and painting respectively, his mother said later, yet, in their mother's words, [...] "Vanya has been different from the moment of birth... none of the others had a soul like his." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the persons}} who knew Escrivá best was the Bishop of Madrid, where Opus Dei was initiated, Bishop Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, for Escrivá would visit and report to <b>him</b> <b>quite</b> {{frequently}} and the two established a very strong friendship. In a 1943 report to Rome, the bishop stated: [...] "The distinctive notes of his character are his energy and his capacity for organization and government; with an ability to pass unnoticed. He has shown himself most obedient to the Church hierarchy -- one very special hallmark of his priestly work {{is the way he}} fosters, in speech and in writing, in public and in private, love for Holy Mother Church and for the Roman Pontiff." [...] Bishop Eijo y Garay wrote to the Jesuit Provincial of Toledo, Carlos Gomez Martinho, S.J. during 1941: [...] "Fr. Escrivá is an exemplary priest, chosen by God for apostolic enterprises; humble, prudent, self-sacrificing in work, docile to his bishop, of outstanding intelligence and with a very solid spiritual and doctrinal formation." [...] Eijo y Garay told an officer of the Falange that [...] "o think that Fr. Josemaría Escrivá is capable of creating anything secret is absurd. He is as frank and open as a child!" ...|$|E
