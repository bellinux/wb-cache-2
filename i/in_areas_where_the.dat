5|$|Flame robins {{often become}} more {{abundant}} in areas recently burnt by bushfires, but move away once the undergrowth regrows. They may also move into logged or cleared areas in forests.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> least weasel is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} stoat, {{the two species}} {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> new wages were applied, {{factories}} would {{struggle to}} recruit workers for important tasks because the reform {{had given a}} low pay grade to a task that was considered to require {{a lower level of}} skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low pay grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable to recruit workers to operate them.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong and equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) long and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The species typically grows <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> soils are relatively deep, especially in semi-arid and wadi areas, and on terraces and slight inclines and hills.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps {{can be used for}} space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E

5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|Pyelonephritis {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following {{two or three days}} of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters live {{in coastal}} waters 15 to 23meters (50 to 75ft) deep, and usually stay within a {{kilometer}} (⅔mi) of the shore. They are found {{most often in}} areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst drift ice but not land-fast ice. Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometers long, and remain there year-round.|$|E

5|$|Suicide {{rates in}} Germany {{increased}} {{as the war}} drew to a close, particularly <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Red Army was advancing. More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead), Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead) and Berlin, where at least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. <b>In</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier {{than they have in}} the past.|$|E
5|$|The black honeyeater (Sugomel nigrum) is {{a species}} of bird in the honeyeater family Meliphagidae, and the sole species in the genus Sugomel. The black honeyeater {{exhibits}} sexual dimorphism, with the male being black and white while the female is a speckled grey-brown; immature birds look like the female. The species is endemic to Australia, and ranges widely across the arid areas of the continent, through open woodland and shrubland, particularly <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> emu bush and related species occur.|$|E

They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Boletus abruptibulbus grow singly or in groups in sand. The species is known {{only from the}} Gulf Coast of the Florida Panhandle, where fruiting occurs on older sand dunes, {{particularly}} <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> habit changes from coastal scrub to oak-pine woods. This latter habitat {{is characterized by the}} presence of the tree species Sand Live Oak (Quercus geminata), Myrtle Oak (Q.myrtifolia), and Sand Pine (Pinus clausa). Fruiting occurs from December to March. Boletus abruptibulbus is one of only three North American Boletaceae species that occur in coastal sand dunes; the others are Leccinum arenicola, found in New Brunswick, Canada, and Phylloporus arenicola, described from Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Wolves may {{encounter}} striped hyenas in Israel, Central Asia and India, usually in disputes over carcasses. Striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> two species interact. One-to-one, hyenas dominate wolves, and may prey on them, but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas. However, {{there was a}} case of a female striped hyena dominating 12 Arabian wolves. Two cases are known however from southern Israel, where wolves and striped hyenas associated closely with each other in an apparently amicable way.|$|E

5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
5|$|Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P.falciparum malaria {{does occur}} naturally, {{but only in}} {{response}} to years of repeated infection. An individual can be protected from a P.falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry {{a version of the}} parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation. The highly polymorphic nature of many P.falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito. Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own. For example, SPf66 was tested extensively <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
