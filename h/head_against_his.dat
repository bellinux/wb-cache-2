25|$|Women {{invariably}} grew {{their hair}} long and, {{as in other}} European cultures, this custom was also common among the men. It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their long hair—for example, a person {{could be forced to}} pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> will. For women, very long hair was seen as a mark of beauty. Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid their hair and fasten hollow golden balls to the braids. Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the glib (short all over except for a long, thick lock of hair towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and flexible band of burnished gold, silver or findruine. When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their hair long at the back were deemed to be giving in to the Irish life.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E
60|$|He {{raised her}} and soothed {{her with her}} <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> breast.|$|E
60|$|I shoved my <b>head</b> closer <b>against</b> <b>his</b> chest. There {{was another}} {{silence for a}} long time.|$|R
60|$|She gave a {{contented}} little sigh, {{and let her}} <b>head</b> rest <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. He {{knew that}} he was forgiven.|$|R
60|$|He moved {{nearer to}} her, and stole one arm around her; her sweet <b>head</b> leaned <b>against</b> <b>his</b> breast; each felt the other's throbbing.|$|R
60|$|Florence {{laid her}} <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> pillow, and whispered how much {{stronger}} he was growing.|$|E
6000|$|Bobus {{raised the}} white wasted form, and rested the <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> square firm shoulder. [...] "Dear old Bob! This is jolly! I'm not {{cramping}} you?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{put his arm}} about her, {{and gave}} her a great hug. After that she laid her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, and cried a little; the Judge sighed.|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned her}} <b>head</b> wearily <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, {{and her body}} shivered with {{recurrent}} nervousness. He waited for a {{time for her to}} speak, and then went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not forget}} {{that you are a}} Tudor and a Queen, and remember," [...] he added quaintly, as her <b>head</b> fell <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, [...] "remember [...] . . . I am only a man!" ...|$|R
60|$|Joe's arm {{was around}} Nell. She had demurred at first, {{but he gave}} no heed to her slight resistance, and finally her <b>head</b> rested <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. There was no need of words.|$|R
60|$|The cook (divested of his decorations) and the Marquis lingered for {{a moment}} {{in the shadow of the}} grub wagon. The Marquis leaned her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Gregory, {{and for a}} {{long time}} he could not say any more. He sat with his elbow on the table, and his <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> lifted hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him with tears {{starting}} to her eyes, and then she put her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> breast. She was too happy to say anything, and she did not try.|$|E
50|$|Dahlene's {{first game}} as a <b>head</b> coach was <b>against</b> <b>his</b> former mentor, A. R. Kennedy.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time his arm stole gently around her. Her golden-bronze <b>head</b> slid restfully <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|At this {{juncture}} Annie called them to supper. Later, when Col. Zane {{sat on the}} doorstep smoking, Betty came and sat beside him with her <b>head</b> resting <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. The Colonel smoked on in silence. Presently the dusky head moved restlessly.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right," [...] Dick said, as {{he placed}} {{her on the}} {{blankets}} before him, and held her with his right arm, with her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. [...] "She is dead asleep." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, mounting, {{he slipped}} {{behind her and}} lifted and turned her, and then held her with his left arm so that she lay across the saddle and his knees, her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Beating--his--wife! How ghastly!' {{said the}} Bride. 'Fancy YOUR beating ME!' She slipped an arm round her husband's waist, and, leaning her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, looked {{out across the}} cloud-filled valley in deep content and security.|$|E
60|$|She lay still, thinking, whilst his arm was round her, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> her shoulders, <b>his</b> body <b>against</b> hers, {{just behind}} her. He was still asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A nice wife I should be, if I shared {{all your}} joys {{and none of}} your sorrows! Anyhow, I had rather share sorrow with you than joy within any one else.' She snuggled her <b>head</b> up <b>against</b> <b>his</b> knee. 'Tell me about it, Frank.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Please {{take it for}} granted, darling, that I know nothing. It is so jolly to {{have some}} one before whom it is not {{necessary}} to keep up appearances. Now, begin at the beginning and go ahead.' She pillowed her <b>head</b> luxuriously <b>against</b> <b>his</b> knees.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} she leant her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder; but with her emotion was a thing soon vanquished. She wished, above all things, to be manly, as befitted a soldier's wife. She shook herself, and withdrew from Jamie's arms.|$|E
60|$|God {{knows what}} magic the name had for his ears; but Barnaby {{released}} his hold, fell back, {{and looked at}} him aghast. Suddenly he sprung towards him, put his arms about his neck, and pressed his <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> cheek.|$|E
6000|$|ALBERTO. In a minute, my darling. There, there, poor Lucrezia. (He puts an arm round her, {{kisses her}} hair and neck. LUCREZIA leans her bowed <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> chest. The sound of {{footsteps}} is heard. They both look up with scared, wide-open eyes.) ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he suddenly, to my astonishment, {{opened the door}} and slipped in, closing it {{instantly}} behind him. At {{the sound of his voice}} the huge, lithe creature rose, yawned and rubbed its round, black <b>head</b> affectionately <b>against</b> <b>his</b> side, while he patted and fondled it.|$|R
6000|$|... "They must not, my dear," [...] he {{answered}} her; stroking the fair <b>head</b> that lay <b>against</b> <b>his</b> breast. [...] "They must not fail. I must see to that." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{last night}} {{before he left the}} house she sat on his knee by the window looking out beyond the firefly twinkle of Oltrarno, to the silence and solid dark of the solemn company of hills beyond. They had not lighted the lamps because of the mosquitoes, and they had talked till her <b>head</b> dropped <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|She {{ran up to}} him, flung her parasol on the grass, put {{her little}} <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> breast, and then there began a narrative, disjointed by such a hysterical weeping as was never surpassed for {{intensity}} in {{the whole history of}} love.|$|E
60|$|Amyas {{was silent}} awhile; while Ayacanora, who was evidently utterly {{exhausted}} by the night's adventure, and probably by long wanderings, watchings, and weepings which had gone before it, sank with her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> knee, fell fast asleep, and breathed as gently as a child.|$|E
60|$|Jane Porter {{had risen}} to her feet; as Clayton {{turned back to her}} she {{staggered}} in weakness. He put out his arms to save her from falling, and then drew her close to him--pressing her <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, he stooped to kiss her in thanksgiving.|$|E
60|$|He leaned wearily {{the back}} of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> the wall. <b>His</b> {{vitality}} seemed exhausted. Even his sunken eyelids drooped within the bony sockets. Only his thin, waspish, beautifully pencilled eyebrows, drawn together a little, suggested the will {{and the power to}} sting--something vicious, unconquerable, and deadly.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fifth}} round Stoke were handed a tricky tie at League Two high-fliers Crawley Town {{in what was}} the first meeting between the clubs. Danny Collins made a {{surprise}} start after failing {{to move away from the}} club in January and it was Crawley who made the bright start putting City's defence under pressure which led to Peter Crouch <b>heading</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own bar. The match took a turn in the 17th minute when Rory Delap was sent-off for a tackle on David Hunt. This seemed to spring Stoke into life and they were awarded a soft looking penalty just before half-time which Walters put past Rene Gilmartin. Stoke scored a second goal just after the half time break through a Crouch header. The Red Devils tried in vain to get back into the tie and Stoke booked their place in the quarter final for the third season in a row.|$|R
60|$|The stallion, in the {{fulfilment}} of a conquest such as {{had made}} him king of the wild ranges, was magnificent in action. Wheeling about her, neighing, and plunging, he arched his splendid neck and pushed <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> her. <b>His</b> action {{was that of a}} master. Suddenly Black Bolly snorted and whirled down the glade. Silvermane whistled one blast of anger or terror and thundered after her. They vanished in the gloom of the cedars, and the band of frightened horses and mustangs clattered after them.|$|R
