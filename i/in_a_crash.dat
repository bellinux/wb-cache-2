5|$|The 2015 Tour of Flanders (in Dutch, Ronde van Vlaanderen) was the 99th {{edition of}} the Tour of Flanders one-day cycling race. It took place on 5 April and was the eighth race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The race {{is one of the}} cobbled {{classics}} and is the second of the cycling monuments on the 2015 calendar. The 2014 champion was Fabian Cancellara; {{he was not able to}} defend his title after breaking two vertebrae <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> at E3 Harelbeke.|$|E

5|$|Although the new Phantoms were {{assigned}} a British designation as the F.3, they were generally {{referred to as}} the F-4J(UK). They {{were assigned}} to 74 Squadron at RAF Wattisham, which stood up in October 1984, two months after the first flight. The aircraft remained in service through the transition to the Tornado, which began entering service in 1987. In 1990, thanks to the conversion of F-4M squadrons to the Tornado, the RAF were able to transfer the best of its remaining FGR.2s to 74 Squadron, which meant that the F.3 was able to be withdrawn in January 1991. With a couple of exceptions, all of the RAF's F-4Js were broken up for scrap. One of the 15 airframes was lost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> in 1987, killing both crew members.|$|E
5|$|Built at Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire in 1940, the DH82A Tiger Moth {{that appears}} in the film (registration G-ANFM, serial number 83604) {{had served in the}} RAF before being sold to the Association of British Aero Clubs in 1953. Since the {{production}} of Thunderbird 6, the plane has made appearances in other films, such as Michael Apted's Agatha (1978). Damaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> in 1992, the repaired Tiger Moth currently forms a part of the Diamond Nine aerobatics squadron, based at White Waltham Airfield, Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999 Marlboro 500 CART race, Canadian driver Greg Moore died <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> {{along the}} backstretch of the track. It was {{determined}} that after sliding along the infield grass, Moore's car hit the edge of oncoming pavement, which caused the car to flip into a concrete retaining wall. The incident prompted the track owners, ISC, to pave the backstretch of both Auto Club Speedway and its sister track Michigan International Speedway {{in an attempt to}} prevent a similar accident. Shortly after the crash, CART mandated the use of a head-and-neck restraint system on all ovals. The rule eventually became mandatory on all tracks.|$|E

5|$|NATO {{acquired}} 18 E-3As {{and support}} equipment for a NATO air defense force. Since all aircraft must be registered {{with a certain}} country, {{the decision was made}} to register the 18 NATO Sentries with Luxembourg, a NATO member that previously did not have any air force. The first NATO E-3 was delivered in January 1982. The eighteen E-3s were operated by Number 1, 2 and 3 Squadrons of NATO's E-3 Component, based at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen. Presently, 16 NATO E-3As are in the inventory, since one E-3 was lost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> and one was retired from service in 2015 (see below).|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E
5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. Anti-lock brakes were {{standard}} on all models; electronic brakeforce distribution was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of traction control for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front airbags were a standard fitment across the range; side-impact airbags were equipped on higher luxury levels such as the Fairmont. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> safety assessment conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{returned}} to racing in 1999 in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series with car owner James Finch. At her debut {{race in the}} FirstPlus Financial 200 at Daytona International Speedway, she took a second-place finish, the best for a woman driver in the championship. Afterward, Robinson moved into a car owned by Winston Cup Series driver Jeremy Mayfield, and finished fourth at Lowe's Motor Speedway. She qualified in eighth place at the final race of her year in Talladega Superspeedway but was involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> after completing 66 laps and retired from the event. Robinson clinched the season's highest finishing rookie award.|$|E
5|$|Seeking better {{performance}} and fulfilment of the Air Ministry Specification E.38/46, Sydney Camm designed the Hawker P.1052, which {{was essentially a}} Sea Hawk outfitted with a 35-degree swept wing. Performing its first flight in 1948, the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials, but was ultimately determined to not warrant further development into a production aircraft. As a private venture, Hawker proceeded to convert the second P.1052 prototype into the Hawker P.1081 with swept tailplanes, a revised fuselage, and a single jet exhaust at the rear. On 19June1950, the P.1081 conducted its maiden flight, and was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF); however, further development was stalled by difficulties with the engine's reheat. In 1951, the sole P.1081 prototype was lost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion {{also took}} part in a similar {{operation}} in 1944 and formed 81 and 82 Columns. As in the first expedition in 1943 the Chindits again suffered heavy casualties and fought behind the Japanese lines at Kohima and Imphal. After Orde Wingate was killed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> in March 1944, it was decided to break up the remaining Chindit formations and some of them were to be converted into airborne infantry battalions. The 1st King's was converted to become the 15th (King's) Parachute Battalion of the Parachute Regiment and joined the 77th Indian Parachute Brigade attached to the 44th Indian Airborne Division where it remained {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 Australian Grand Prix saw {{the debut}} of several young drivers new to Formula One and a late {{replacement}} for McLaren's Fernando Alonso. Two weeks prior to the Grand Prix, McLaren announced that Alonso would miss the inaugural 2015 race due to a concussion suffered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. Doctors advised Alonso not to race, avoiding further medical complications and his place was therefore taken by McLaren reserve driver, Kevin Magnussen who finished second on his debut at the same event in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} touring in 1956, including to Toronto. In late February {{or early}} March, Powell and Rollins, traveling together near Philadelphia, were involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> that destroyed Powell's car, {{but they were}} not seriously injured. The quintet recorded under the leadership of Rollins in March for Prestige; this was released as Sonny Rollins Plus 4. They also had live national CBS Radio broadcasts from the Basin Street club in April and May. Two years of exposure with the Brown–Roach ensemble meant that Powell was beginning to achieve some recognition in his own right.|$|E
5|$|The drivers {{took the}} track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up in wet weather, with lap times {{slower than the}} {{previous}} days' practice and qualifying sessions. Häkkinen maintained his good performance, setting a time of 2:03.392. Michael Schumacher was the second-fastest driver; Button was third, two-thousands of a second behind Schumacher. Barrichello completed the top four, three-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen. Giancarlo Fisichella struck the barriers heavily at turn 14 after spinning sideways and was launched into the air, landing upside-down; the session was suspended while marshals cleared the track of debris. Fisichella sustained a bruised left knee, {{and was forced to}} start the race with his team's spare car. Jacques Villeneuve damaged his car's rear end <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> later in the session, but was able to continue.|$|E

5|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was lost}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> at NAS China Lake on 13 October 1944. Investigation {{showed that the}} wing structure was {{not strong enough to}} resist compressibility effects. This was cured by doubling the number of rivets in the outer wing panels. The second prototype crashed on 25 March 1945 when the pilot failed to recover from a dive from , probably also due to compressibility effects. The third prototype crashed on 5 April when the canopy blew off during a high-speed pass over Lindbergh Field.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen, {{driving a}} Lancia Delta S4, died <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> on 2 May 1986 while leading the Tour de Corse rally in Corsica. His American co-driver, Sergio Cresto, also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal crash had no close {{witnesses}} {{and the only}} remains of the car were the blackened spaceframe, {{making it impossible to}} determine the cause of the crash. Within hours of the crash, Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.|$|E
5|$|XF-104 53-7786 {{was lost}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> on 11July1957 when it {{developed}} an uncontrollable fin flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests. The entire tail group was ripped from the airframe, and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park {{was forced to}} eject. Fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had been limited to speeds {{of no more than}} Mach0.95 {{at the time of the}} accident. Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed in a museum, arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties.|$|E
