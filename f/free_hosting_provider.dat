40|$|<b>Hosting</b> <b>Providers</b> play an {{essential}} {{role in the development of}} Internet services such as e-Research Infrastructures. In order to promote the development of such services, legislators on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean introduced “safe harbour” provisions to protect Service Providers (a category which includes <b>Hosting</b> <b>Providers)</b> from legal claims (e. g. of copyright infringement). Relevant provisions can be found in § 512 of the United States Copyright Act and in art. 14 of the Directive 2000 / 31 /EC (and its national implementations). The cornerstone of this framework is the passive role of the <b>Hosting</b> <b>Provider</b> through which he has no knowledge of the content that he hosts. With the arrival of Web 2. 0, however, the role of <b>Hosting</b> <b>Providers</b> on the Internet changed; this change has been reflected in court decisions that have reached varying conclusions in the last few years. The purpose of this article is to present the existing framework (including recent case law from the US, Germany and France) ...|$|R

The organizations would critically examine several factors of cloud <b>hosting</b> <b>provider</b> and security {{is the most}} important one.
