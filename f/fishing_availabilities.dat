This study aims {{to contribute to}} our understanding of how rice and <b>fish</b> <b>availability</b> affect occupation and food security of people in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB), including Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam. The study focuses on subsistence and commercial fishers and farmers. The data obtained for my research are from the first basin-wide survey conducted across the four countries using a common methodology and timing in 2009. Results of the study show that the extent of dependence of people on rice and <b>fish</b> <b>availability</b> for occupation, income, and food and their resilient capacities varies greatly between strata and across study sites. If both fish and rice decline at a common rate applicable to the whole LMB, cash income of at least one of four strata in each site will easily fall below the poverty line of $ 1. 00 per capita per day. Seen from the perspective of food, all strata of all sites will be significantly affected if the availability of rice and fish decline. Altogether, fish and rice account for more than 81 % of the total daily calorie intake. With uneven distribution of population by countries and varied social-ecological zones and livelihood activities, impacts of changes in the rice and <b>fish</b> <b>availability</b> will not distribute evenly. If changes occur throughout the Mekong, the number of people impacted will be highest in Vietnam, followed by Cambodia and Lao PDR. Thailand will be affected the least.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{dimension is}} integral {{to the concept of}} food security. A wide range of food commodities are required to fulfill nutritional security need of the people. Animal proteins which include milk, fish, meat and egg are essentially required for nutritionally balanced diets which are available from diverse food commodities. The fish in general and freshwater fish in particular are among the fast growing sectors with increasing contributions in the nutrition security of Indian consumers. The present paper analyses relative role of fish in the nutritional security of India based on the food balance sheet data of FAO available for the period 1961 – 2013. The apparent fish consumption per capita per year in India has increased primarily due to increase in freshwater <b>fish</b> <b>availability</b> from 0. 7  kg/cap/year in 1961 – 3. 48  kg/cap/year in 2013, enabling increase in the overall <b>fish</b> <b>availability</b> from 1. 9 to 5. 04  kg/cap/year during this period. During 1961 – 2013, contributions of freshwater fish to non-vegetarian protein, animal protein and total protein increased from 9. 1 to 27. 2, 3. 3 – 8. 7 and 0. 4 – 1. 7 %, respectivel...|$|R

The data collected showed that households can be grouped, into low, middle and high income groups and the analysis revealed that majority of the households in the study area fell within the low income group and this group spent a higher percentage of their income on fish. The study revealed that household size, educational status of household head, taste of <b>fish,</b> <b>availability</b> of <b>fish,</b> ease of preparation of fish, income of household head had significant effects on the preference and consumption pattern of fish in the study area. The result revealed that majority of the households (about 50 %) preferred frozen form of fish and this was followed by fresh water fish while a few made smoked fish their choice. It was found out that factors which were significant to frozen <b>fish</b> include <b>availability</b> of <b>fish,</b> household size, ease of preparation of fish, freshness of fish while those significant to fresh water include educational status, level of household head, taste of fish, cleanliness of fish and factors significant to smoked <b>fish</b> include <b>availability</b> of <b>fish,</b> ease of preparation of fish, household size and freshness of fish...|$|R

Predation on turtle was found only during cold periods (established by spraint analysis and also by the collection of 182 turtle carcasses in 2003). The relationship was not close between <b>fish</b> <b>availability</b> and turtle consumption (r(P) =- 0. 325, P= 0. 19). The crude protein content of the turtle head and leg was {{higher than that of}} fish, frog and turtle body, whereas the energy content of the samples was similar. The mean body weight of the killed turtles (460 g) fell within the range of the optimal prey size of the otter. Turtles were used as cache foods by otters during extreme environmental conditions (as in the long winter), but occurred only rarely as buffer foods during moderate winter. In fish ponds, the conservation of the coexistent otter and turtle depends on pond management.

40|$|While {{ecosystem}} {{and human}} health have been closely linked, the mechanisms through which natural and social systems interact to support human health are rarely understood. Yet the rapid transformation of Earth’s natural systems makes appreciating the drivers and ramifications of environmental change for human health particularly critical. To illuminate these links, I analyze the effects of changing resource access on household livelihoods, food security, health and nutrition. Specifically, I use the case of Lake Victoria, Kenya, to examine ways individuals and households respond to and affect <b>fish</b> <b>availability.</b> I employ both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, including a longitudinal household survey, ecological monitoring of fish catch, and qualitative in-depth interviews. My analyses examine a bi-directional relationship between <b>fish</b> <b>availability</b> {{and the health of}} people who depend on fish resources. First, I analyze how participation in fishing livelihoods affects fish consumption and food security. Next, I examine the bounds of resource availability in time and space in affecting household fish consumption. Further, I assess the impact of illness in fishers on fishing methods, and thereby fishery sustainability. Finally, I analyze how fish declines affect women’s access to fish, and, in particular, the power dynamics of transactional fish-for-sex relationships and HIV risk. Through these analyses, I aim to illuminate both the extensive effects of environmental change and mechanisms that tie the health of people and their environment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: According to optimal {{foraging}} theory {{the prey}} choice strongly affects the benefit-cost ratios. Predators search prey giving the high-est benefit {{and costs of}} all components of preda-tion (i. e. prey search, encounter, pursuit, capture, and handling) may be considerably reduced if the prey is more available. The study on Cormorant diet and the species composition of prey fish as-semblages in the Dobczyce Reservoir (area 985 ha, submontane, eutrophic reservoir in Southern Po-land) in spring (May-June) and in autumn (Oct-Nov) showed differences in the food composition and the prey size affected by seasonal changes in <b>fish</b> <b>availability.</b> The diet of Cormorant included eleven fish species and the dominant species in the food was roach in spring (72 %) and roach and perch in autumn (49 % in total). Roach and perch had the highest share in prey assemblages too (56 % in spring, and 53 % in autumn). Significant preference toward roach in spring was found. The share of roach and perch did not changed season-ally and could not explain {{the change in the}} com-position of Cormorant diet. The range of the total length (LT) of fish in Cormorant diet was 3. 5 – 35. 2 cm. Diet consisted of distinctly smaller fish in autumn. Relative number of small fish was ca 3 times greater in this period compared to spring. Weighted mean of fish TL in prey assemblage was 20. 0 cm for roach and 12. 5 cm for perch in spring, and 11. 8 and 8. 1 in autumn, respectively. The pro-portion of average weight of roach (W = 0. 004074 LT 3. 334) to that of perch (W = 0. 005779 LT 3. 260) was greater in spring (4. 1 : 1) than in autumn (2. 9 : 1). Probably it can explain the diet shift in autumn. The switch to smaller but more abundant fish in autumn was not related to temperature but to <b>fish</b> <b>availability</b> which reduced the cost of searching and the prey may be easily found...|$|R

40|$|Hawaii's diverse pelagic {{fisheries}} supply {{the bulk of}} the State's total catch. The largest Hawaii fishery is the recently expanded longline fishery, which now lands about 4, 400 metric tons (t) of broadbill swordfish, Xiphias gladius; 1, 500 t of bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus, and 3, 000 t of other pelagic species annually. The increased catch of these other species has raised concerns regarding the continued availability of yellowfin tuna, T. albacares; blue marlin, Makaira mazara; and mahimahi, Coryphaena hippurus, in the small-vessel troll and handline fisheries which target those species. Analysis of catch per unit effort (CPUE) statistics from Hawaii's fisheries did not provide strong evidence of recent declines in availability related to local fishery expansion. A more influential factor was variation in Pacific-wide CPUE, representing overall population abundance and catchability.

40|$|Abstract. —In two coastal North Carolina rivers (Contentnea Creek and the Northeast Cape Fear River), {{we found}} the food habits of {{introduced}} flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris to be primarily piscivorous, which could restructure or suppress native fish communities through direct predation. Fish or crayfish contributed more than 50 % of the stomach contents by percent occurrence, percent by number, and percent by weight in both rivers during each of 2 years. Significant differences in diet composition (percent by number) were found between rivers and between years in the Northeast Cape Fear River but not between years within Contentnea Creek. Chesson’s selectivity index values and trends in relative abundances of <b>fish</b> <b>availability</b> relative to those occurring in the diet suggest that flathead catfish feeding is generally random, indicating that these introduced flathead catfish do not selectively feed on prey species with which they did not coevolve. Our research represents the first assessment of prey selectivity by an introduced ictalurid population and provides evidence of the potential impact on native fish communities through their piscivorous food habits.

Total fish density and biomass averaged 10, 024 fish/ha and 276. 3 kg/ha, respectively. Density and biomass of total fish varied among years and seasons, but seasonal patterns differed among years. Yellow perch Perca flavescens, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, walleye Stizostedion vitreum, and common carp Cyprinus carpio were the predominant species overall, but the proportional species composition of both total density and total biomass varied highly. Changes in the fish assemblage resulted in dramatic changes in the potential <b>availability</b> of prey <b>fish</b> over time and with piscivore size. These dynamics could lead to variable growth and condition of resident piscivores as well as to variable success of stocking fingerling piscivores...|$|R
