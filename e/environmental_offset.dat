40|$|Environmental offsets and {{environmental}} trading initiatives are being rapidly introduced into environmental regulatory regimes. These relatively new legal mechanisms {{are attempting to}} fill in the gaps left by command and control regulation. The introduction of <b>environmental</b> <b>offset</b> and trading policy in Queensland will need to be compatible with existing land tenure regulation. Who owns and who uses natural resources are controlled by a range of legislative reservations and restrictions. Reservations give the State ownership of certain natural resources such as minerals, quarry material and, in some circumstances, forest products. Where there is a reservation in operation, the land holders rights are weakened. Restrictions in relation to uses prevent land holders from carrying out certain activities on the land. An example of a restriction of use is the operation of the Vegetation Management Act 1999 (Qld), which prescribes the manner in which vegetation is to be dealt with. This article explores the nature of freehold and leasehold land tenure in Queensland and examines the effect of reservations and restrictions upon the operation of <b>environmental</b> <b>offset</b> and trading initiatives. Presently Queensland legislation does not directly address the relationship between land tenure and <b>environmental</b> <b>offset</b> and trading initiatives. The stability of tenure required for the creation of environmental offsets can be at odds with the flexibility allowed for under leasehold arrangements. This flexibility may act to undermine the permanency requirement of <b>environmental</b> <b>offset</b> creation (i. e. the guarantee that the offset is created for the long term) ...|$|E

The Wentworth Group has long been an advocate of the use of <b>environmental</b> <b>offsets.</b> However some vegetation associations have been so extensively cleared that they have become irreplaceable and cannot be offset to improve or maintain environmental outcomes. Therefore it is only under some circumstances that offsets allow new development to proceed whilst maintaining and improving the long term health of Australia’s land, water and biodiversity assets. The Wentworth Group supports the existing Commonwealth <b>Environmental</b> <b>Offsets</b> Policy, which follows a hierarchy of development assessment: to avoid, minimise and mitigate impacts on matters of national environmental significance. 1 Under this policy, <b>environmental</b> <b>offsets</b> are employed as a mitigation measure to treat impacts that could not otherwise be avoided or minimised.

40|$|An {{important}} tool {{for sustainable development}} in any country is Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and {{an important component of}} EIA is impact mitigation. In most cases, certain unwanted impacts of development projects are left without mitigation thereby reducing the gains of such developments. Thus, emerging in current literature is the concept of <b>Environmental</b> <b>offset</b> which provides a leeway for residual impacts of development projects. This study therefore assesses the perception and level of application of the <b>environmental</b> <b>offset</b> strategy by EIA Practitioners and other stakeholders in the mitigation of negative environmental impacts of developments in the Niger Delta, Nigeria as that would have significant implication for sustainable development efforts in Nigeria. The study found out that there is negative perception among the host communities about the suitability of offset as mitigation measure. Even though the EIA practitioners considers <b>Environmental</b> <b>offset</b> as a viable option, its adoption has been marred by the misgiving of the local people. This misgiving could be attributed to the long period of neglect and abandonment which has led to abject poverty in the region and loss of confidence in any institutional frameworks.

40|$|Market-based {{environmental}} regulation {{is becoming increasingly}} common within international and national frameworks. <b>Environmental</b> <b>offset</b> and trading regimes {{are part of the}} market-based instrument revolution. This paper proposes that environmental market mechanisms could be used to introduce an ethic of land holder responsibility. In order for market based regimes to attract sufficient levels of stakeholder engagement, participants within such scheme require an incentive to participate and furthermore need to feel a sense of security about investing in such processes. A sense of security is often associated with property based interests.

Relevant property-related considerations include land tenure considerations, public versus private management of land choices, characteristics and powers associated with property interests, theories defining property and the recognition of legal proprietal interests.

There are now approximately 45 compensatory mitigation programs for biodiversity impacts worldwide, with another 27 programs in development. While offsets have great potential as a conservation tool, their establishment requires overcoming a number of conceptual and methodological hurdles. In Australia, new policy changes at the national and state (i. e., Western Australia) level require that offsets follow a set of general principles: (1) <b>Environmental</b> <b>offsets</b> may not be appropriate for all projects and will only be considered after avoidance and mitigation options have been pursued; (2)  Environmental offsets will be based on sound environmental information and knowledge; (3) Establishing goals for offsets requires an estimate of expected direct and indirect impacts; (4) <b>Environmental</b> <b>offsets</b> will be focused on longer term strategic outcomes; (5) <b>Environmental</b> <b>offsets</b> will be cost-effective, as well as relevant and proportionate to the significance of the environmental value being impacted.

40|$|Background: <b>Environmental</b> <b>offset</b> {{programs}} for threatened plant species can {{be limited by}} the capacity to propagate sufficient plants for establishing offset plantations. This study describes the use of clonal propagation techniques for an offset program that propagated two species impacted by a landslide and road works. Materials and Methods: Cuttings were collected from Pomaderris clivicola (Rhamnaceae) and Bertya pedicellata (Euphorbiaceae) on 9 and 7 occasions, respectively. Shoots were also initiated into tissue culture. Results: Both species proved extremely difficult to propagate from cuttings and tissue culture. Rooting frequencies for P. clivicola cuttings were 4. 3 %. Repeated harvests of cuttings from the impacted plant population over more than 2 years eventually provided most of the P. clivicola plants required for the offset planting. However, the offset population of P. clivicola also had to be supplemented with some plants produced by tissue culture and with one plant that was excavated from the impacted population. Rooting frequencies for B. pedicellata cuttings were only 1. 3 %. A combination of cutting propagation and tissue culture did not produce sufficient B. pedicellata plants for the offset planting, but the offset population was supplemented with 27 plants that were excavated during road works. Conclusion: Success in producing the offset plants depended ultimately {{on a combination of}} (a) Cutting propagation, (b) Tissue culture propagation and (c) Whole plant excavation and translocation. This case study highlights challenges and successes in propagating poorly-known species for an <b>environmental</b> <b>offset</b> program within a short timeframe and with little prior knowledge of suitable propagation methods...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{offsetting}} involves compensating for {{the residual}} adverse impacts {{of an action}} on the environment by generating an equivalent benefit elsewhere. As the prevalence of environmental offsetting grows, so does the challenge of translating no-net-loss goals to workable policy. From 2011 – 2012, the Australian Government developed an Environmental Offsets Policy and an accompanying metric (the Offsets Assessment Guide) to support decision making about offset requirements under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Through extensive stakeholder consultation and in collaboration with academic researchers, the Guide was developed {{with the aim of}} accounting appropriately for ecological equivalence in a transparent and flexible manner. This paper outlines the Australian Government 2 ̆ 7 s <b>environmental</b> <b>offset</b> policy development process, and describes the approach adopted for evaluating the suitability of proposed offsets in meeting the policy goals. The Guide explicitly estimates the extent to which an offset will improve the target biota and/or avert future losses, the degree of confidence that the offset will be implemented successfully, and the time it will take to deliver a conservation benefit. Since implementation of the Environmental Offsets Policy and the Guide, there has been a shift in focus from estimating offset requirements based on simplistic area ratios, toward directly evaluating the components of an offset action that determine its environmental performance. Achieving a balance between scientific robustness and policy workability is an ongoing challenge. The Environmental Offsets Policy and Guide represent an important step towards consistency and transparency in <b>environmental</b> <b>offset</b> decision-making...|$|E

Corals successfully colonised the {{artificial reef}}, despite the relatively harsh environmental conditions at the site (annual water temperature range 18 - 32 °C, intermittent high turbidity, frequent cyclones, frequent nearby ship movements). Coral settlement to the artificial reef was examined by terracotta tile deployments, and later stages of coral community development were examined by in-situ visual surveys within fixed 25 x 25 cm quadrats on the rock and concrete substrates. Mean coral density on the tiles varied from 113 ± 17 SE to 909 ± 85 SE per m 2 over five deployments, whereas mean coral density in the quadrats was only 6. 0 ± 1. 0 SE per m 2 at eight months post construction, increasing to 24. 0 ± 2. 1 SE per m 2 at 62 months post construction. Coral taxa colonising the artificial reef were a subset of those on the surrounding natural reef, but occurred in different proportions—Pseudosiderastrea tayami, Mycedium elephantotus and Leptastrea purpurea being disproportionately abundant on the artificial reef. Coral cover increased rapidly in the later stages of the study, reaching 2. 3 ± 0. 7 SE % at 62 months post construction.

The catalysts combine the reverse-water gas shift reaction with the Fischer-Tropsch process to convert carbon dioxide (CO 2) into hydrocarbons (HCs) often employed as fuels and feedstocks for the chemical industry; offering the potential synthesis of HCs void of fossil fuel extraction. The catalysts operational performance was shown to vary considerably dependent on the specific iron:palladium loadings. LCA results afforded insight into 'green' catalyst design, palladium addition vastly improves catalyst performance. However, with such a high embodied environmental impact a trade-off is witnessed whereby the continual addition of palladium, although shows favourable CO 2 conversion and HC yields, does not return a sufficient <b>environmental</b> <b>offset</b> in terms of produced HCs to cover the embodied impacts present in its formation. With the present laboratory setup their embodied environmental impacts are several orders of magnitude more impactful than traditional process pathways, largely due to the electricity use; a switch to renewable generators can reduce the overall process impacts by 90 %, a significant step in increasing the competitiveness of the process, a use of renewable electricity in the synthesis of hydrogen further strengthens the case for its use in HC production has environmental merit. Indeed, from a material exchange perspective the H 2 consumes is of a lesser environmental impact than those offset through the HCs produced.

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>offsets</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a technique for managing {{the environmental impacts of}} new developments in regions that are not in compliance with environmental standards. By requiring developers to 'offset' any impacts by purchasing 'environmental credits', environmental quality can be maintained or even improved. <b>Environmental</b> <b>offsets</b> have a lot of intuitive appeal, and are being used widely in the USA, Australia and other countries. However there is at present no robust theoretical framework for analyzing the use of offsets, which has led to some of the weaknesses of existing programs and criticisms against the use of offsets. We present an economic model for designing offset programs that is based on identifying and valuing environmental service flows. We also discuss a number of factors that influence the effectiveness efficiency of offset programs including fungibility, effects on incentives of landholders and uncertainty and make recommendations about how to respond to these factors based on our model. The distributional effects of offsets are also explored and it is noted that offsets are not distributionally neutral. We argue on the basis of distributional effects that it is not appropriate to use offsets alone to seek to improve environmental quality. Furthermore, we recommend the combining of offsets with other market-based instruments such as Pigouvian taxes or cap and trade systems {{in order to reduce the}} negative distributional effects of offset programs, provide greater scope for achieving environmental improvements and to increase the probability of achieving first best (socially optimal) solutions. offsets, market-based instruments, efficiency, distribution, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

While existing theoretical models on the voluntary provision of public goods usually focus exclusively on single motivations for individual contributions, we explicitly account for various motivations in a unified framework, drawing on theories for public good provision such as pure and impure altruism, internalized norms and social approval. Such an approach is particularly useful when individual offset behavior is heterogeneous. The applicability of our theoretical framework is supported by data from a choice experiment on voluntary carbon offsetting in Switzerland and the USA. We find that willingness to pay for offsets mainly depends on an individual's internalized norms to avoid environmental degradation as well as partly on income. The probability to offset, instead, is better explained by an individual's expected social recognition for offsetting...|$|R

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>offsetting</b> is {{a concept}} whereby a company can <b>offset</b> its <b>environmental</b> impacts by paying for another party to reduce its <b>environmental</b> impacts. <b>Offsets</b> are {{designed}} for greenhouse gases emissions (carbon) and biodiversity. Though the concept is new in the debate, it relies on the idea common to environmental economists of flexibility and cost efficiency where the firms that have the lowest pollution abatement costs reduce more pollution than firms that have high abatement costs. Even if the offsetting concept makes sense from an economic point of view, the public may oppose it on several grounds. It may be for moral reasons (the polluter must pay), for equity reasons (the victims of the local pollution cannot escape pollution), or for economic reasons (preference for a local public good jointly produced with the global one, or in a dynamic model, incentive for polluters to pollute less in the future). These multiple motivations make difficult eliciting preferences of consumers for products where producers used offsets. Therefore, we use stated choice to elicit these preferences for a good produced using offsets while controlling for attributes such as level and location of joint local public good (water pollution). We find that although consumers {{are willing to pay}} for a reduction in GHG emissions, they oppose offsets even when controlling for the level of joint local public good. An investigation of the reasons consumers are against offsets is that the original victims of the pollution still suffer and it is not acceptable to pay someone else to avoid reducing one’s own pollution (indulgences argument) ...|$|R
