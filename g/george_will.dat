25|$|Members of the Canadian Royal Family, {{other than}} the {{sovereign}}, also hold peerages, though these were granted by letters patent issued by the sovereign of the United Kingdom and are used in Canada as courtesy titles. Further, Sylvana Tomaselli, a Canadian citizen, has been known as Countess of St. Andrews since her marriage to George Windsor, who uses the courtesy title Earl of St. Andrews, a subsidiary title of his father, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, a grandson of King George V. Upon {{the death of the}} Duke of Kent, is it expected that <b>George</b> <b>will</b> succeed to the title and Sylvana will become Duchess of Kent, Countess of St. Andrews, and Baroness Downpatrick, though her eldest son, Edward, also a citizen of Canada and the present Lord Downpatrick, and his wife, if any, will then use the titles Earl and Countess of St. Andrews as a courtesy title and their eldest son, if any, would be known as Lord Downpatrick. Also, Karen Gordon, a Canadian citizen, became Countess Spencer upon her marriage in 2011 to the Earl Spencer, brother of Diana, Princess of Wales.|$|E

He was succeeded by John McCain, who praised his {{predecessor}} as the man who [...] "transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan." [...] Goldwater strongly supported the 1980 presidential campaign of Reagan, who had become the face of the conservative movement after his Time for Choosing speech. Reagan reflected many of the principles of Goldwater's earlier run in his campaign.

On November 8, 1975, he hinted at entering some presidential primary elections to steer the party away from what he saw as a strong conservative trend. Over the next few months, Mathias continued to show signs of entering the election, but never campaigned aggressively and lacked any political organization.

In response to the announcement, Republican consultant Christopher Barron countered the claim of <b>George</b> <b>Will</b> on the campaign's potential [...] "spoiler effect."

500|$|On the {{subsequent}} Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen generally interspersed hard-rocking song sequences after {{every three or}} four numbers in order to give Weinberg's hands a chance to recover. Weinberg's wife Becky unintentionally triggered one of the tour's most celebrated episodes. She was a fan of the This Week with David Brinkley television program and invited panelist <b>George</b> <b>Will</b> to the Washington-area Capital Centre show. After seeing the band perform, Will became convinced that they were exemplars of hard-working patriotism and traditional American values; he wrote, [...] "... consider Max Weinberg's bandaged fingers. [...] The rigors of drumming have led to five tendonitis operations. He soaks his hands in hot water before a concert, in ice afterward, and sleeps with tight gloves on." [...] Will further decided that Springsteen might endorse Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential campaign and talked to the campaign, which later led to Reagan's famous extolling of Springsteen at a stop in Hammonton, New Jersey and Springsteen's subsequent negative response.|$|E
500|$|During {{his second}} run for president, Reagan's {{campaign}} advisor, <b>George</b> <b>Will,</b> tried to co-opt Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] for the campaign.

A week after Will's writing appeared in a column, Reagan praised Springsteen in a stump speech given in Hammonton, New Jersey. Soon after Reagan's speech, Springsteen expressed discontent with the president and his policies, and [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was dropped from the campaign. Reagan's team then reached out to John Cougar Mellancamp to use his song [...] "Pink Houses" [...] and were turned down. The campaign then adopted [...] "God Bless the U.S.A."

Jerry advises George to wait a few days for Carol to call back; George agrees, but continues to leave increasingly angry — and eventually almost hostile — messages on her machine. When he discovers she was out of town, he decides to go through with the plan of changing the tape. Frustrated by his inability to use an answering machine, George convinces Jerry to go with him. They decide to wait for Carol outside her apartment, and <b>George</b> <b>will</b> distract her while Jerry changes the tape. They succeed, but, just as they are about to leave Carol's apartment, she tells George that she had already heard the messages and found them funny, adding that she [...] "loves jokes like that." ...|$|E

Russ Verney, who had served {{as an adviser to}} Ross Perot in the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections, joined the campaign as a volunteer adviser and worked with Barr's consulting firm, Liberty Strategies LLC, to form a campaign team and build an organization. Verney became the campaign manager after Barr officially announced his candidacy. A poll in late April by Barr's exploratory committee showed that Barr had the support of 7% of the electorate before he had officially declared his candidacy. Leading up to Barr's announcement, columnist <b>George</b> <b>Will</b> wrote an article in Newsweek chronicling the Libertarian Party and the potential candidate's run. Will stated that Barr could {{have an effect on the}} election similar to Ralph Nader's in 2000.

500|$|The film {{received}} universal acclaim. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film four stars and wrote, [...] "This {{is not simply}} a good movie. It is one of those movies that brush away our cautions and win our hearts." [...] He later added it to his Great Movies list, structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about the first time they watched it. Michael Sragow of Rolling Stone called Spielberg [...] "a space age Jean Renoir.... for the first time, [...] has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian wrote that [...] "E.T. is a superlative piece of popular cinema ... a dream of childhood, brilliantly orchestrated to involve not only children but anyone able to remember being one". Leonard Maltin would include it in his list of [...] "100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century" [...] as one of only two movies from the 1980s. <b>George</b> <b>Will</b> {{was one of the few}} to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.|$|E
500|$|Based on 55 reviews {{collected}} from notable publications by popular review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 84% [...] "fresh" [...] approval rating, with the consensus, [...] "As history, Oliver Stone's JFK is dubious, but as filmmaking it's electric, cramming {{a ton of}} information and excitement into its three-hour runtime and making great use of its outstanding cast." [...] However, the film's production and release were subject to intense scrutiny and criticism. A few weeks after shooting had begun, on May 14, 1991, [...] Jon Margolis wrote in the Chicago Tribune that JFK was [...] "an insult to the intelligence." [...] Five days later, The Washington Post ran a scathing article by national security correspondent George Lardner titled, [...] "On the Set: Dallas in Wonderland" [...] that used {{the first draft of}} the JFK screenplay to blast it for [...] "the absurdities and palpable untruths in Garrison's book and Stone's rendition of it." [...] The article pointed out that Garrison lost his case against Clay Shaw and that he inflated his case by trying to use Shaw's homosexual relationships to prove guilt by association. Stone responded to Lardner's article by hiring a public relations firm that specialized in political issues. Other critical articles soon followed. Anthony Lewis in The New York Times stated that the film [...] "tells us that our government cannot be trusted to give an honest account of a Presidential assassination." [...] Washington Post columnist <b>George</b> <b>Will</b> called Stone [...] "a man of technical skill, scant education and negligible conscience." ...|$|E

[...] Roger Ebert gave it {{three out of four}} stars, calling it [...] "one of the most innocent movies in a long time,” and “a sweet, warm-hearted comedy." [...] Richard Roeper called the film [...] "one of my favorite movies of all time. It {{has one of the highest}} 'repeatability' factors of any film I've ever seen ... I can watch it again and again. There's also this, and I say it in all sincerity: Ferris Bueller's Day Off is something of a suicide prevention film, or at the very least a story about a young man trying to help his friend gain some measure of self-worth ... Ferris has made it his mission to show Cameron that the whole world in front of him is passing him by, and that life can be pretty sweet if you wake up and embrace it. That's the lasting message of Ferris Bueller's Day Off." [...] Roeper pays homage to the film with a license plate that reads [...] "SVFRRIS".

500|$|Kemp {{was partly}} at fault for not {{achieving}} either of his primary goals {{because he did}} not get {{along with the rest of}} the Cabinet. At one point, Kemp told James Baker, White House Chief of Staff, that Bush's best chance to win reelection was to dump his economic advisors in dramatic fashion. Before the 1992 Republican National Convention, Kemp and six prominent Republican conservatives prepared a controversial memo urging Bush to revise his economic policy. Contemporaneously, conservative Republicans in office and in the media such as William F. Buckley Jr. and <b>George</b> <b>Will</b> felt Dan Quayle should be ousted in favor of Kemp. This followed Kemp's reference to parts of the President's economic policy as [...] "gimmicks" [...] after the 1992 State of the Union Address. Kemp was respected within the party for opposing Bush, and towards the end of Bush's administration insiders recognized his value. In late 1991, 81 of the 166 Republican Congressmen signed a letter co-authored by Curt Weldon and Dan Burton requesting that Bush cede some domestic authority to Kemp as a [...] "domestic policy czar." [...] The letter, highlighting Kemp's [...] "energy, enthusiasm and national clout", insulted Bush. Kemp was a bit of a surprise to stay in the [...] for the duration of his presidency, and he was described as one of the few Bush Administration members who would take tough stands. Kemp did not expect to be retained if the Republicans were reelected in 1992, and some pundits agreed with him.|$|E
