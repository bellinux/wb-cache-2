25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>smuggling</b> is the {{practice}} of intermediaries aiding undocumented migrants in crossing international borders for financial gain, often in large groups. <b>Human</b> <b>smuggling</b> differs from, but is sometimes associated with, human trafficking. A human smuggler will facilitate illegal entry into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, fraud, or deception to obtain and transport people, usually {{for the purpose of}} forced labor or prostitution at the destination.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, {{the state}} of Nuevo León and its {{surrounding}} territories have become a battleground for a brutal conflict between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, two drug trafficking organizations from northeastern Mexico. Reports of forced disappearances have not been uncommon in the past years. The municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez — a middle-class, industrial community where the bodies were found — {{is known for its}} broom factory, an oil refinery, and its historical role {{as one of the first}} places where baseball was played in Mexico. Nonetheless, it had at least five municipal employees slain in April 2012; just a week before the massacre, a military general stepped up and took over the city's depleted police force. In fact, the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez is under dispute by Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel, and the Sinaloa Cartel; the area is a strategic point for <b>human</b> <b>smuggling,</b> drug trafficking, and oil theft. The municipality of Cadereyta is the most violent municipality in {{the state of}} Nuevo León that does not form part of the Monterrey metropolitan area.|$|E

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} main trends, issues, actors, {{and activities}} regarding {{the operation and}} extension of <b>human</b> trafficking and <b>smuggling</b> via irregular border crossings in the Middle East. Its premise is that rather than the obvious involvement of hierarchical mafia-type organized crime groups, globally articulated networks of locally operating independent, individual groups comprise the essential foundation for <b>human</b> trafficking and <b>smuggling</b> in the region. The available empirical evidence first suggests that elaborating on various aspects of <b>human</b> trafficking and <b>smuggling</b> is a delicate task and any consideration of priorities for {{data collection and analysis}} on these activities must start with a clear idea of the information needed and how to obtain that information. Given the highly sensitive nature of trafficking and smuggling issues, there is no simple research practice that can satisfy all these concerns. It is within this context that our analysis here only offers some partial explanation of the complex nature of <b>human</b> trafficking and <b>smuggling</b> in the Middle East. The data used here provide, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first primary, reliable, and representative information on traffickers and smugglers as they come directly from the narratives of the traffickers and smugglers interviewed. Evidence from our fieldwork in Turkey during the last five years indicates that the ongoing pattern of <b>human</b> trafficking and <b>smuggling</b> in the region is the outcome of quite complex interactions among locally operating individuals and groups, with the simultaneous and sequential operation of a variety of interacting factors, including the presence of interpersonal trust relations between human traffickers and smugglers and the migrants, and the existence of national-, ethnic-, kinship-, friendship-based networks spanning countries of origin, of transit, and of destination worldwide. The study has confirmed that the nature of trafficking and smuggling in the Middle East is quite different from similar activities found elsewhere in the world. Nevertheless, the study concludes that we should not disregard these issues from the perspective of criminal justice and human rights...|$|R
