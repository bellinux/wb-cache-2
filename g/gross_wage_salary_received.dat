The study also considers different concepts of “entrepreneur”, as own-account worker and as employer. The results are analysed, first, using univariate tests and then estimating probit models. The variables most closely associated with a high probability of starting a business after returning from migration are entrepreneurial experience during the migration, {{and the fact of}} having returned voluntarily, as well as having worked in the host country in agriculture or the hospitality sector. Having university training and having worked in public administration before migrating are negative factors.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theoretical {{model of the}} inequality in <b>wages</b> and <b>salaries</b> associated with differences in years of schooling (educational inequality, for short). Our model assumes {{that in the long}} run individual decisions to become more educated equalize the lifetime earnings of more educated workers and comparable less educated workers. Given this assumption our model implies that innovations that increase the relative demand for more educated labor, and which cause short-run increases in educational inequality, in the long run induce offset- ting increases in the relative supply of more educated labor. But, our model also has the novel implication that innovations that increase differences between the <b>wages</b> and <b>salaries</b> <b>received</b> by workers with the same years of education who are more or less able (ability premiums, for short) cause a smaller fraction of workers to choose to become more educated. Consequently, innovations that increase ability premiums in the long run also cause educational inequality to be larger than otherwise. In applying our theory to recent changes in educational inequal- ity in the United States, we suggest that, to the extent that innovations that increase ability premiums are contributing to educational inequality, the increases in educational inequality during the 1980 s and 1990 s are unlikely to be soon reversed...|$|R

40|$|The study {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} effects of cyclical fluctuations - including those of the current economic crisis - on revenues and expenditures of the German public pay-as-you-go pension system on the one hand. On the other hand the pension reforms of the most recent decade are scrutinised in terms of their repercussions on the business cycle. Special emphasis is placed on the gradual reduction of the public pension level and the subsidisation of private fully funded so-called "Riester" pension schemes. For the analysis the authors develop an econometric model of the public pension system and integrate it into the IMK's existing macro model of the German economy. The analysis shows several weaknesses of the current public pension formula. Firstly, it should not include the effects of short-time working on the aggregate of <b>gross</b> <b>wages</b> and <b>salaries</b> per employee. Otherwise the current extensive use of short-time working to avoid unemployment will first reduce pensions and then raise them again. Secondly, the time lag between cyclical changes and their repercussions on the expenditures of the pension system could be further increased to improve the stabilising effects of the pension system on the business cycle. And thirdly, the pension system's provisions for revenue fluctuations should be raised in order to avoid increasing contributions in a severe and protracted crisis. A separate section of the study deals with the cyclical effects of private households' increased savings for old age. To a significant extent the increase of the savings ratio since the beginning of this decade is due to the "Riester" reforms and has retarded growth and employment. ...|$|R

40|$|The areas located outside {{metropolitan}} areas and also outside areas activated through other big cities are called peripheries. There are big {{differences between the}} levels of development of metropolitan and peripheral areas in Poland. There are also great differences in opportunities to development including the location of new investment. Peripheral areas are characterized by features such as: high unemployment, relatively impoverished populations, low productivity, low territorial accessibility, small development potential. Lack of development factors {{is the cause of}} low development level. Peripheral areas are differential. The author analyses this differentiation, including location of development factors in peripheral areas of northern Poland. Touristic values are such factor, but tourism is mainly seasonal. The tourist season is short, 2 - 4 months. The development of this tourism increases the income of people and business, but the increase of permanent work-places is small. The lack of robust businesses that are able to start constant and stable development {{is one of the main}} weakness of peripheral areas. Bed transport accessibility is the other weakness of peripheral areas. As one of the factors of socio-economic development considered by author is the spatial structure, including settlement network. In some areas lack of appropriately big node could be the weakness of such network. The analysis of case study area is conducted on the basis of the features of poviats (counties), which are described by following indicators: employees in the industry sector and market service sector per 1000 population of working age, number of entities in national economy between 10 - 49 and more than 49 workers per 1000 population of working age, investment outlays in enterprises per capita in the years 2008 - 2010, gross value of fixed assets in enterprises per capita, average monthly <b>gross</b> <b>wages</b> and <b>salaries,</b> unemployment rate, participation of the urban population, population of the biggest settlement node.

40|$|One {{important}} artefact of compulsory superannuation saving is the tax concession. It is {{a by-product}} {{of the interaction between}} the flat tax regime of superannuation and the progressive taxation system that applies to <b>salary</b> and <b>wages</b> income. As a consequence, those on the lowest <b>wages</b> and <b>salary</b> scale <b>receive</b> the least amount of tax concession. However, this does not reconcile with stated government intention to reduce the future call on the pension. Based on treasury modelling, the need for retirement support would likely come from this same low income group who were also traditionally averse to superannuation saving. This research paper employs scenario analysis to predict the future value of the tax concessions for low, medium and high income earners. To this end, portfolios are constructed that mimic APRA's balanced fund asset allocation. Time series data from 1900 have then been used to estimate and forecast portfolio returns over a range of economic conditions. Ultimately, the study benchmarks the welfare-increasing potential that the current tax concessions offer against Adam Smith's economic theory. Smith said that to be deemed effective, a system of taxation needed to be equitable, efficient and transparent...|$|R

40|$|In Chapter 1 ，I {{introduce}} the viewpoint {{and the purpose}} of this study. This is a study of the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration system which is really the substance of labor management in modern enterprise. In this paper. <b>Wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system is taken up as the central problem domain from the viewpoint of business management. And then this study' s purpose is to consider that <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system based on the seniority-oriented system should be corrected for what kind of it in the times of aging of population composition, internationalization of labor movement, and the computerization in our country. Moreover. it considers about the rule by which <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for <b>wage</b> and <b>salary,</b> and the principles of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration which are not established as yet in Japanese enterprise. Chapter 2 is the preceding chapter before the main subject. The <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system which is the central problem domain of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration system is surrounded by various laws, theories and influences on <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration. I considered the surrounding four positions. The first is the legal theory on subjects of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> (labor standard law of our country, collective agreement and office regulations of enterprise of our country). The second is the theory of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> as economic theory (the wage fund theory, the marginal productivity theory and the labor value theory). The third is the social theory of the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> as the factor which should be taken into consideration in the case of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> determination (the market rate, the laborer' s living expenses level, change of prices, labor productivity, the ability of enterprise to pay) Finally，it is the business management theory of the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary.</b> Although such theory and influence are not the direct requirements for the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration or <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system, it's effect is never small Therein is clarified the basic meaning of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary,</b> the positioning <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration in labor management，and the domain of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration. That is to say, the article about <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> is taken up from five laws, including the labor standard law of our country. And then，it is clarified that <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> is the compensation of labor between laborer and employer. <b>Wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration is positioned with one basic domain of labor management that is divided to seven domains of labor management (Employment Management, Educational Training and Capability Development Management. Working Environmental Management. <b>Wage</b> and <b>Salary</b> Administration， Health and Welfare Management, Management of Human Relations，Management of lndustrial Relations). Also, the main domain of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration is divided into two <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system and the amount of money for <b>wage</b> and <b>salary.</b> These two points are occupying the important positions in this study. In Chapter 3, I discussed the trend of the actuality in the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration system in enterprise of our country. The first <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system in our country is a Den-san type wage structure, this wage structure had the deep color of living wages. Next. the seniority-oriented <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system appeared around from 1960, subsequently, job performance abilities evaluation wage rate system appear around from 1975. But the color of living wages and seniority-oriented wages remained in this <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system. However, in our country, aging of population composition and internationalization of labor movement progress around from 1980. It becomes increase of personnel expenses (labor cost) and it becomes the big burden of business management in enterprise. Moreover, in the times of the computerization which spreads quickly, the correspondence to change of the job contents is needed by business management in enterprise. In this way， adoption of a new <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system come to be seen in after 1990. Here, I touch the annual salary system and profit or added value sharing plan that draws public attention as new <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system. It is decided how the result (profit or added value) is shared among both based on recognition as the result of collaboration of laborer and employer (Profit Sharing Plan, Rucker Plan, Scanlon Plan, American Mortor's Plan, Kaiser Plan). The annual salary plan is the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system that is adopted as the managerial position of the company of our country on the pretext of restructuring in after 1990. This plan can say it is correction of the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system from living serious-consideration wages to job serious-consideration wages. Also，this plan has the strong character of reward, and the wage rate in this plan, can be called single job rate. Therefore, it is necessary for us to give feed back on job evaluation research. By the way, the seniority-oriented system and the custom of lifelong things completely, but however, have a close relation in fact. Merely，the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system does not give any answer about the amount of money for <b>wage</b> and <b>salary.</b> Therefore another principle is required. When the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for <b>wage</b> and <b>salary,</b> the separate principle is necessary. That is to say, the purpose of business management is the upkeep and the development of enterprise, and improvement in the laborer' s living standard. What business management should think important is two subjects of cost (labor cost) and laborer' s life (living expenses). From here, business management does not use mind only for the cost reduction, but should adopt “the laborer' s living standard" as the separate principle for the determination of the amount of money. Moreover，I {{introduce the}} principles of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration which should be thought important. In case the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system is actually combined with the amount of money for wage and salary，it is very important. That is, conditions on the side of business management is the requirement of management. nature and objective of the organization, integration in administration. And conditions on the side of labor is satisfy the public interest, locality requirement, and reactions of the labor union. These principles are advocated by Prof. Y. Shimabukuro as basic theory of “Consensus Management". This “Consensus Management" is the important principle in that the determination of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> should be reached by consensus among both laborer and employer. These six principles of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration must be taken notice of as what functions on the “consensus" formation among business management and laborer. In addition，the incentive nature of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> and the dissatisfied concentration nature of <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> are taken up as important matters in enforcement of the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration system. Chapter 6 is conclusions of what so far has been described. That is to say <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system which is main content of the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration system in the modern enterprises has been studied center in this paper. First, as a direction of the ecdysis by aging and internationalization from the seniority-oriented <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system, it was asserted that the correction to job evaluation wage rate system was concretely appropriate to the work(job) center <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system. Secondly， the adoption of the Paterson method (the job evaluation method) is asserted as the correspondence to change of the job contents by the computerization. Thirdly, when the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> payment system is combined with actual amount of money, the principle to be emphasized is no except for “living standard of the worker". Therefore, it should be sufficiently regarded on this principle in the business administration side. And, I would advocate that it should be equal agreement determination by the “consensus" formation among business management and laborers on the <b>wage</b> and <b>salary</b> administration system. まえがき　Abstract　基本用語　第 1 章 序　第 2 章 賃金管理に影響を与える理論 第 1 節 賃金管理といくつかの立場 第 2 節 賃金問題に関する理論 第 1 項 賃金の法律理論(賃金問題への法の介入) 第 2 項 賃金の経済理論(労働市場における賃金水準の存在) 第 3 項 賃金の社会理論(賃金決定の際に考慮されるべき要因) 第 4 項 賃金の経営理論(労務管理の実体としての賃金管理) 第 3 節 賃金管理と賃金支払制度 第 3 章 我国企業の賃金管理制度における現実の動向 第 1 節 年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱却 第 2 節 我国企業における新しい賃金支払制度の採用 第 1 項 成果分配制度 〈成果分配制度導入企業の実例〉 第 2 項 年俸制 〈年俸制導入企業の実例〉 第 3 節 職務給制度採用の妥当性 第 1 項 高齢化・国際化が要請する年功序列型賃金支払制度からの脱皮の試み 第 2 項 職務評価と職務給制度 第 4 章 賃金支払制度と職務給制度 第 1 節 賃金問題と賃金支払制度 第 2 節 賃金支払制度の形態 第 3 節 職務給制度の発展 第 1 項 職務給制度の前身としての計測日給制度 第 2 項 職務給制度と労働能力 第 3 項 職務給制度における賃金体系 第 4 項 賃金規程の実例および職務給制度導入企業の実例 第 4 節 “意思決定"要素による職務評価(バターソン法) 第 1 項 評価要素および評価尺度 第 2 項 職務評価手続き 第 3 項 パターソン法による職務評価の事例(化学工業会社の場合) 第 4 項 パターソン法についてのまとめ 第 5 章 賃金支払制度と賃金額 第 1 節 賃金支払制度の賃金額への結合 第 2 節 賃金管理の原理 第 3 節 賃金管理制度の実施における留意点 第 1 項 賃金の刺激性 第 2 項 賃金とその不満集約性 第 6 章 結 ※注釈 ※参考文献 ※資料①～...|$|R
