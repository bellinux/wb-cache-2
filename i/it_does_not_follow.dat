5|$|The game {{originally}} did {{not have}} a cooperative multiplayer mode, as the development team thought that it would distract from the tonally darker levels of the single-player campaign, not matching the game's narrative. However, a cooperative mode was still added to the game in August 2012 as free downloadable content; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the storyline of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Labyrinth: The Computer Game is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} {{game in which}} the player maneuvers a character through a maze while solving puzzles and evading dangers. It is an adaptation of the 1986 film Labyrinth, many of whose events and characters are reproduced in the game. However, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> {{the plot of the}} film. At the beginning, the player enters their name, sex and favorite color: the last two fields determine the appearance of the player character. Afterward, a short text-based adventure sequence unfolds, wherein the player enters a movie theater to watch the film Labyrinth. The game then changes to a graphic adventure format. Jareth, the main antagonist, appears on the projection screen and transports the protagonist to a labyrinthine prison.|$|E
25|$|In English {{heraldry}} the crescent, mullet, martlet, annulet, fleur-de-lis {{and rose}} may {{be added to}} a shield to distinguish cadet branches of a family from the senior line. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow,</b> however, that a shield containing such a charge necessarily belongs to a cadet branch. All of these charges occur frequently in basic (undifferenced) coats of arms.|$|E

25|$|This book re-imagines {{the life}} of Jesus Christ, using the events {{depicted}} in the canonical gospels as a scaffold on which to construct its story. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the chronology of {{the life of}} Jesus Christ found in the New Testament. It placed far greater emphasis on the earlier part of Jesus' life than the canonical gospels do.|$|E
25|$|Conventions of domesticity in {{the nineteenth}} century {{reinforced}} the idea that women should remain at home to look after the family. Who Would Have Thought <b>It?</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the typical romance of domesticity because it introduces women from the domestic sphere into political and public spheres. The novel is situated during a time of modernization in the United States during which the home was transformed. The novel also parodies mid-nineteenth-century family life.|$|E
25|$|Female {{androgenic}} alopecia {{has become}} a growing problem that, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, affects around 30million women in the United States. Although hair loss in females normally occurs {{after the age of}} 50 or even later when <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> events like pregnancy, chronic illness, crash diets, and stress among others, it is now occurring at earlier ages with reported cases in women as young as 15 or 16.|$|E

50|$|The {{decision}} to sell {{part of the}} park before redesignating the land for residential development was illegal, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the City of York's Official Plan.

25|$|The Ceredigion Coast Path at {{this point}} runs northwards through Patch and Gwbert, on towards and beyond Mwnt, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the {{coastline}} itself. The official route currently runs eastwards to Y Ferwig, thence northwards to the coastline at Mwnt. An alternative route, heading north from Cardigan Island Farm Park to reach the coastline much sooner, is currently under dispute, with alleged dangerous cliff sections. South of Gwbert, at St Dogmaels, the Coast Path links to the Pembrokeshire Coast Path.|$|E
25|$|Tomkinson dispatches {{a common}} atheist objection. He agrees {{it is common}} sense that {{everything}} which has a beginning {{is likely to have}} an end, too. But <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> from this that humans are merely transient beings. Adam was formed from earth and water, 'elements' which the Muggletonians say have existed for all eternity. Thus, humans will be capable of being resurrected as bodies in a glorified condition at world's end. Then, each will have a full understanding of paradise which can only be partially glimpsed now as inner peace and bliss.|$|E
25|$|A false consequent, in contrast, is a {{conclusion}} {{known to be}} false, fictional, imaginary, or insufficient. In a conditional statement, a fictional conclusion {{is known as a}} non sequitur, which literally means out of sequence. A conclusion that is out of sequence is not contingent on any premises that precede it, and <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> from them, so such a sequence is not conditional. A conditional sequence is a connected series of statements. A false consequent cannot follow from true premises in a connected sequence. But, on the other hand, a false consequent can follow from a false antecedent.|$|E
50|$|The {{fall of the}} Soviet Union in 1991 led to {{a crisis}} in the PCF, but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the example of some other European {{communist}} parties by dissolving itself or changing its name. At the XXVIIIth Congress in 1994, Marchais stepped down as secretary-general in favour of Robert Hue.|$|R
25|$|Digital Research's DR-DOS is {{sometimes}} {{regarded as a}} clone of MS-DOS, but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> Microsoft's version numbering scheme. For example, MS-DOS 4, released in July 1988, was followed by DR DOS 5.0 in May 1990. MS-DOS 5.0 came in April 1991, with DR DOS 6.0 being released the following June.|$|R

25|$|Although section 13 of the act, 29 U.S.C.A. 163, provides, 'Nothing in this Act (chapter) {{shall be}} {{construed}} {{so as to}} interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike,' <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> that an employer, guilty of no act denounced by the statute, has lost the right to protect and continue his business by supplying places left vacant by strikers. And he is not bound to discharge those hired to fill the places of strikers, upon {{the election of the}} latter to resume their employment, in order to create places for them.|$|E
25|$|The Principle of {{computational}} equivalence {{has been}} criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions. It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property. Moreover, critics such as Ray Kurzweil have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> that any two programs they might run are also equivalent. Others suggest it {{is little more than a}} rechristening of the Church–Turing thesis.|$|E
25|$|One can {{conclude}} that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision in effect says the State of Georgia {{has the right to}} make a wrong decision—wrong {{in the sense that it}} violates some people's views of rights in a just society. We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a necessary component of its own political processes. Its citizens have the political liberty to direct the governmental process to make decisions that might be wrong in the ideal sense, subject to correction in the ordinary political process.|$|E

500|$|Except for toll {{bridges and}} tunnels, very few U.S. Routes are toll roads.

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, even granted the above, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> that {{identity}} theories {{of all types}} must be abandoned. According to token identity theories, {{the fact that a}} certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state. The type–token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example: the word [...] "green" [...] contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter e along with one each of the others.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Little X and features cameo appearances by Keri Hilson, Bria Myles, Sean Faris and Justin Timberlake. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> a storyline and per Furtado's request, focuses on scenes with dancing and flirting {{because she wanted to}} recreate the song's indicative vibe, and took the opportunity to film a club video for the first time. Furtado said of the video, [...] "It's that whole dance that goes on. There's that mystery there, the fun, playful sexiness, the verbal Ping-Pong game". Furtado and Timbaland cannot decide whether they want to begin dating or instead flirt with others on the dance floor. Their single performances are intercut with several scenes of a dancing crowd, and the lighting changes between blue, green, red, and yellow colors.|$|E

30|$|As expected, the I-Text-based STD system, which {{employed}} the correct transcription of the query as input {{and the target}} language information, significantly outperformed all the QbE STD systems (p< 0.01).

50|$|However, Sweetman's {{greatest}} initiative as Minister was {{the appointment}} of another young man of talent and vision. On 30 May 1956 he elevated a 39-year-old civil servant named Ken Whitaker {{to the position of}} Secretary-General of the Department of Finance. This was a revolutionary step, as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the convention of promotion based on time served.|$|R
500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage was a {{frequent}} reviewer of HolbyBlue. He found the opening episode [...] "boring", deeming it [...] "a cliché-ridden disaster with some duff casting decisions and bizarrely clunky dialogue". Wright criticised the decision to launch the show under the Holby moniker, opining {{that it is not}} a true brand as Casualty and Holby City both possess [...] "distinct personalities". He noted that he loathes the former and loves the latter, but concluded that despite differing audience demographics, they are both hospital dramas and <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> that their audiences would also enjoy a police procedural. Despite his criticism, Wright was pleased when the programme was recommissioned for a second series, hoping that an increased number of episodes would allow the production team to fix issues with HolbyBlue and further develop its format. Following the programme's cancellation, Wright gave HolbyBlue a mixed review. He described the first series as [...] "disastrous", writing that it was largely unoriginal and impeded by the Holby brand, but deemed series two [...] "a great improvement, with some excellent and quite engrossing character drama".|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. Although <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> a substantial plot, it features outfits and scenes inspired by The Sound of Music. Stefani and her Harajuku Girls are often dancing in front of fields of flowers and a background of key-like symbols composed of two G's placed back to back. In a scene mimicking The Sound of Music, Stefani portrays Maria von Trapp while the dancers, dressed in pajamas, portray her children and jump on a bed. In another scene, Stefani uses curtains to create sailor suits for the Harajuku Girls. Stefani also appears as a nun and an orchestra conductor. One scene uses smoke {{to create the illusion}} that Stefani is a submerged escape artist searching for a key. She pulls the key, a symbol of [...] "the sweet escape", from her mouth as an allusion to performances by escapologist Harry Houdini. The song's title is often visualized by a colorful sign that reads [...] "wind it up". Another video was produced in 3-D, but this version was never released. After seeing the video, Jimmy Iovine, co-founder of Interscope Records, decided to work with James Cameron to produce other 3-D music presentations.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary {{critics of}} Keats enjoyed the poem, {{and it was}} heavily quoted in their reviews. An {{anonymous}} review of Keats's poetry that ran in the August and October 1820 Scots Magazine stated: [...] "Amongst the minor poems we prefer the 'Ode to the Nightingale.' Indeed, we are inclined to prefer it beyond every other poem in the book; but let the reader judge. The third and seventh stanzas have a charm for us which we should {{find it difficult to}} explain. We have read this ode over and over again, and every time with increased delight." [...] At the same time, Leigh Hunt wrote a review of Keats's poem for the 2 August and 9 August 1820 The Indicator: [...] "As a specimen of the Poems, which are all lyrical, we must indulge ourselves in quoting entire the 'Ode to a Nightingale'. There is that mixture in it of real melancholy and imaginative relief, which poetry alone presents us in her 'charmed cup,' and which some over-rational critics have undertaken to find wrong because it is not true. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> that what is not true to them, is not true to others. If the relief is real, the mixture is good and sufficing." ...|$|E
