Stresses are caused by the overvoltages across CBs, the interrupting currents {{and the rate of}} rise of recovery voltage (RRRV).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{and compare the}} quantitative accuracy of 90 Y imaging across different generation PET/CT scanners, {{for the purpose of}} dosimetry after radioembolization with resin microspheres. Methods: A strict experimental and imaging protocol was followed by 47 international sites using the NEMA 2007 /IEC 2008 PET body phantom with an 8 -to- 1 sphere-to-background ratio of 90 Y solution. The phantom was imaged over a 7 -day period (activity ranging from 0. 5 to 3. 0  GBq) and all reconstructed data were analysed at a core laboratory for consistent processing. Quantitative accuracy was assessed through measures of total phantom activity, activity concentration in background and hot spheres, misplaced counts in a nonradioactive insert, and background variability. Results: Of the 69 scanners assessed, 37 had both time-of-flight (ToF) and resolution recovery (RR) capability. These current generation scanners from GE, Philips and Siemens could reconstruct background concentration measures to within 10  % of true values over the evaluated range, with greater deviations on the Philips systems at low count rates, and demonstrated typical partial volume effects on <b>hot</b> sphere <b>recovery,</b> which dominated spheres of diameter 20  mm in diameter, activity concentrations were consistently underestimated by about 20  %. Non-ToF scanners from GE Healthcare and Siemens were capable of producing accurate measures, but with inferior quantitative recovery compared with ToF systems. Conclusion: Current generation ToF scanners can consistently reconstruct 90 Y activity concentrations, but they underestimate activity concentrations in small structures (≤ 37  mm diameter) within a warm background due to partial volume effects and constraints of the reconstruction algorithm. At the highest count rates investigated, measures of background concentration (about 300  kBq/ml) could be estimated on average to within 1  %, 5  % and 2  % for GE Healthcare (all-pass filter, RR + ToF), Philips (4 i 8 s ToF) and Siemens (2 i 21 s all-pass filter, RR + ToF) ToF systems, respectively. Over the range of activities investigated, comparable performance between GE Healthcare and Siemens ToF systems suggests suitability for quantitative analysis in a scenario analogous to that of postradioembolization imaging for treatment of liver cancer. 0 SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} and detection of ultrafast time domain (TD) THz pulse trains {{is an active}} area of research, with recent developments pushing sources to higher power and greater bandwidth. This thesis presents research in two frontiers of the science and technology of THz radiation; the generation of high power TD-THz pulses and the dynamic THz spectroscopy of an emerging new material, epitaxial graphene. To increase the SNR of conventional time domain (TD) THz sources, a novel method is proposed for high average power, high repetition rate, TD-THz generation based on an ultrafast fiber laser and optical rectification inside a GaP waveguide. A model for the THz generation is developed by combining a finite-difference frequency-domain mode solver with the 1 D generation equation. The measured 150 -µW average power and 3 THz bandwidth represent nearly a two order of magnitude increase over conventional TD-THz systems, and are in good agreement with the theoretical model. Since the demonstration of the isolation of single atomic sheets of graphite, graphene has received tremendous attention due to its unique mechanical and electrical properties. These unique properties indicate graphene is a highly promising material for high-speed (THz-bandwidth) electronic devices. This thesis presents TD-THz spectroscopy of multilayer epitaxial graphene samples, {{with the goals of}} identifying the presence of a possible bandgap opening at low energies and of measuring the <b>hot</b> carrier <b>recovery</b> dynamics on picosecond timescales. The graphene transmission spectrum is shown to be remarkably flat and is used to verify the absence of a bandgap at meV energies.

Lastly, THz detection of coherent controlled photocurrents is demonstrated {{for the first time in}} epitaxial graphene. Optical coherent control provides a method for contactless injection of ultrafast current bursts into semiconductor materials. The associated radiated THz pulse is used to verify the unique polarization independence and power scaling with theoretical predictions.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} plastics (FRP) are of considerable {{interest to the}} automotive industry. Intelligent application of these materials could reduce vehicle weight for higher operating efficiency, at a reduced manufacturing cost. The principal use of FRP in high volume (greater than 100, 000 parts per annum) has been restricted to non-structural body panels made from short fibre reinforcement. Long fibre reinforced composites are ideal for load bearing structures resulting from a high specific strength. However, a high volume technique to produce these components at a moderate cost has not been realised. One long fibre reinforcement process {{with the potential to}} meet the high volume demands of the automotive industry is resin transfer moulding (RTM). Prolonged cycle times are an obstacle to high volume RTM. Cycle time is dictated by thermal quench near the injection gate from cold resin entering the <b>hot</b> mould. Heat <b>recovery</b> by the mould, and coincident heating of the resin to initiate cure is necessary to complete the cycle. Microwave preheating of the resin before injection reduces thermal quench. Since microwave heating is volumetric, low conductivity resins can be heated uniformly and efficiently. In-line resin preheating has been developed for its compatibility with high volume RTM. The use of an in-line microwave resin preheating system to reduce cycle time was investigated. This system was incorporated into the automatic RTM cycle. The resin temperature could be held constant or profiled during injection using a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) power controller. Both injection techniques reduced cycle time, although temperature profiling enabled coincident resin cure across the mould for a maximum cycle time reduction. Resin preheating had no adverse affects on the RTM process or laminates. This suggested that the microwave resin preheating system could be retrofitted within an existing RTM facility to reduce the component cycle time without damaging the mould or degrading component quality...|$|R

40|$|To {{explore the}} use of insertion-duplication {{mutagenesis}} (IDM) as a random gene disruption mutagenesis tool for genomic analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a large mutagenic library of chimeric plasmids with 300 -bp inserts was constructed. The library was large enough to produce 60, 000 independent plasmid clones in Escherichia coli. Sequencing of {{a random sample of}} 84 of these clones showed that 85 % of the plasmids had inserts which were scattered widely over the genome; 80 % of these plasmids had 240 - to 360 -bp inserts, and 60 % of the inserts targeted internal regions of apparent open reading frames. Thus, the library was both complex and highly mutagenic. To evaluate the randomness of mutagenesis during recombination and to test the usefulness of the library for obtaining specific classes of nonessential genes, this library was used to seek competence-related genes by constructing a large pneumococcal transformant library derived from 20, 000 mutagenic plasmids. After we screened the mutants exhaustively for transformation defects, 114 competence-related insertion mutations were identified. These competence mutations hit most previously known genes required for transformation as well as a new gene with high similarity to the Bacillus subtilis competence gene comFA. Mapping of the mutation sites at these competence loci showed that the mutagenesis was highly random, with no apparent <b>hot</b> spots. The <b>recovery</b> of a high proportion of competence genes and the absence of hot spots for mutational hits together show that such a transformant library is useful for finding various types of nonessential genes throughout the genome. Since a promoterless lacZ reporter vector was used for the construction of the mutagenic plasmid library, it also serves as a random transcriptional fusion library. Finally, use of a valuable feature of IDM, directed gene targeting, also showed that essential genes, which can be targets for new drug designs, could be identified by simple sequencing and transformation reactions. We estimate that the IDM library used in this study could readily achieve about 90 % genome coverage...|$|R
40|$|PET studies provide {{valuable}} {{information in the}} assessment of animal models for human diseases. MicroPET systems provide the high resolution needed to explore small organs but suffer from a reduced axial FOV. Multiple bed positions are then used to obtain whole body scans resulting in increased scan time and incomplete dynamic data. In contrast, human PET systems have larger axial FOV but a lower resolution. In this study, an image-based model of the scanner spatial response function combined with a 3 D-OSEM reconstruction algorithm were used to improve spatial resolution of the Siemens ECAT EXACT HR+ PET scanner. A stationary double Gaussian model [1] of the ECAT EXACT HR+ point spread function was derived from 18 F point source measurements performed at different radial and axial locations in the scanner FOV. This model was used in a 3 D-OSEM reconstruction (3 D-OSEM-RM). Sinograms were normalized and attenuation and scatter corrected using the Siemens ECAT tools before reconstruction. Both NEMA NU 2 - 1994 performance phantoms and NEMA NU 4 - 2008 image quality phantom mimicking small animals were used to evaluate the accuracy of corrections for physical effects and the overall image quality. A 50 min dynamic FDG rat study was conducted on the ECAT HR+ and reconstructed with 3 D-OSEM-RM. The images were used to compute the metabolic rate of glucose (MRglu) in multiple brain structures. These images were also visually compared to the static image obtained with a FOCUS 120 microPET immediately after the HR+ dynamic scan. The standard deviations of the two Gaussians used to model the transaxial (axial) resolution in a central FOV of 5 cm radius were σ 1 = 1. 6 (2. 75) mm and σ 2 = 3. 66 (4. 16) mm, and the ratio of the weights {{between the first and second}} Gaussians was ρ = 0. 2 (0. 7). Image uniformity and accuracy of scatter and attenuation corrections, evaluated following NEMA NU 2 - 1994, were found to be very similar between 3 D-OSEM, 3 D-OSEM-RM, 2 D- and 3 D-FBP reconstructed images. When using the NEMA NU 4 - 2008 image quality phantom a significant increase of the <b>hot</b> rod <b>recovery</b> coefficient was observed. This effect was rod size dependent and amounted to 17 - 35 % for the 3 D-OSEM-RM compared to the 3 D-OSEM and to 35 - 62 % compared to the FBP reconstructions. Nevertheless the values obtained with 3 D-OSEM-RM were around 20 - 35 % lower than those obtained with the FOCUS 120 microPET scanner. Most of the small brain structures observed on microPET images were also visible on the images obtained with the HR+ scanner and 3 D-OSEM-RM. Rat cerebral MRglu values calculated on 3 D-OSEM-RM images were in the range of published values [2] (e. g. whole brain = 25. 34 μmol/min/ 100 g). Using an approximate model of the ECAT EXACT HR+ spatial response in 3 D-OSEM resulted in sufficient image quality for dynamic whole body scans of small rodents, despite the large FOV, and resulted in improved contrast compared to images generated using the built-in software. This methodology will be applied for future small animal dosimetry and modeling studies in our laboratory. [1] Comtat et al. IEEE Nucl Sci Symp Conf Record. pp. 4120 - 4123 (2008) [2] Schiffer et al.

The development and use of a computer simulation program incorporating an interactive spreadsheet software package to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of cogeneration systems is described. Three hypothetical case studies including a comprehensive sensitivity analysis were completed to demonstrate the employment of the simulation program. The simulation can model cogeneration systems using either a gas turbine, internal combustion (IC) engine or steam turbine prime mover for both electrical and thermal load matching. The modeled systems can be arranged in either a simple or combined cycled configuration. The heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) model developed for the program incorporates a fixed surface effectiveness calculation and includes correlations for off-design performance. The HRSG can also be operated in a fired or unfired mode. The IC engine prime mover model also includes a water jacket energy recovery unit. The program simulates the system on an hourly and monthly basis using variable predefined daily and monthly profiles. The program also includes hourly and annual energy balances for the combined system. The economic results are in terms of conventional parameters including the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and the years to zero net present value (payback time). The three cases studies compared the operating costs of the current system to the cost of constructing and operating a cogeneration system and investigated their sensitivity to variations in the design condition parameters. The proposed cogeneration systems included: (1) a commercial laundry with a 400 kW IC engine with a waste heat <b>recovery</b> <b>hot</b> water heater in a simple cycle configuration, (2) a medium sized medical complex with a 1, 600 kW gas turbine prime mover with an HRSG in a simple cycle configuration, and (3) an industrial plant with a 17. 5 MW gas turbine prime mover, a 4 MW extraction steam turbine and a natural gas fired HRSG unit in a combined cycle configuration. The sensitivity analyses investigated the effect of the variations in at least 22 design and economic parameters for the percent change in the number of years to zero net present value for each case...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the development of "in-situ" environmental - transmission electron microscope (TEM) specimen holder assemblies. To date, experimentation with TEM has essentially been two-dimensional and static. In-situ experiments are presently not possible for analyzing complex <b>hot</b> deformation, dynamic <b>recovery</b> and dynamic recrystallization processes because of limitations in the specimen holder design. By developing technology that allows in- situ TEM, {{it will be possible to}} assess phenomena such as materials microstructural changes throughout heating process rather than using traditional post mortem techniques. The ability to conduct environmental in -situ experiments is also important because many biological applications currently analyze catalyst samples under static, post-reaction conditions that do not adequately represent reaction dynamics. The lack of an ability to perform in -situ analysis has delayed the fundamental understanding of dynamic catalytic surfaces, complex structural changes, and reaction mechanisms that evolve during processes such as oxidation-reduction. In this respect, this dissertation present novel holder technology that enables in- situ experiments for dynamically capturing microstructure and texture changes in specimens. Such analyses are not capable at the present time and will lead to breakthrough technologies for evaluating mechanisms of microstructural evolution and chemical process reactions. Environmental instability has been shown to be the limiting factor in holder design when attempting to obtain TEM atomic resolution. In this dissertation, two of the most common environmental problems associated with TEM resolution have been analyzed, air pressure and temperature fluctuations. The present approach to solving these limitations has included extensive experimental and numerical analyses. Based on these analyses, we have designed and optimized two heated TEM holders that overcome the current technical problems associated with performing in situ experiments. These novel holder designs are dynamically stable and accurate for image processing, are capable of elevating the sample temperature to 2000 K, allow the specimens to be subject to diverse environments, and have minimum drift in sample position over time. Our initial work utilized the finite element method to dynamically and thermally analyze presently available TEM holder assemblies. From these simulations, the dynamic and thermal behavior of the holders were obtained. This information proved to be critical for establishing the limitations of the present TEM technology. It also allowed creation of optimization objectives for designing holders for in-situ TEM experiments. Utilizing the numerical results of the current TEM holders as a basis, two novel different holder technologies were designed and numerically analyzed. The first holder utilized existing resistive heating technology and was found to be significantly better than existing holders with respect to its dynamic stability, uniformity in heating, and minimization of stresses induced in the sample. The new design also had less thermal drift and significantly lower heat loss from the furnace than prior holder designs. The second holder design incorporated a localized laser diode to heat the sample to 2000 K. Such technology has never been applied to TEM technology, making it completely novel to the field. Based on the numerical simulations performed, the laser-diode holder significantly outperformed all of the other heater specimen holder designs analyzed in this dissertation. In addition, laser heating of the sample was found to overcome important restrictions associated with small pole piece gaps that are required in resistive heating holders. Overcoming these restrictions will allow the TEM holder to be used in completely new application of tomography. Finally, in addition to the finite element simulations, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) analyses were performed to determine the performance of the holder in different gas environments. These analyses allowed for optimizing the holder design when specific molecular densities or molecule impingement rates were required to induce a chemical reaction. Through the DSMC and finite element analyses, the new specimen holders were demonstrated to be greatly improved over existing holder technology and will allow a new level of materials analysis. Both the new resistive heater and laser diode designs will significantly advance TEM technology by allowing atomic level and chemical reaction information to be obtained dynamically, something which is not possible today...|$|R
