5|$|Croatian air {{pollution}} levels reflect {{the drop in}} industrial production recorded in 1991 {{at the onset of}} the Croatian War of Independence—pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of unleaded petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (<b>GHG)</b> <b>emissions</b> in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of <b>GHG</b> <b>emissions</b> is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.|$|E

This paper will firstly describe the current situation of <b>GHG</b> <b>emission</b> and reduction target for Japanese electric utility industry. Followed by introduced the technique of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to forecast trend of the electricity consumption and <b>GHG</b> <b>emission</b> in Japan, with and without the impact of 311 Earthquake. In the conclusion, we analyze the challenges faced by Japanese electric utility industry regarding the issue of <b>GHG</b> <b>emission</b> reduction Post Kyoto Protocol. According to the simulation result, decrease in electricity consumption coupled with the large increase in nuclear energy to be introduce into Japanese electricity generation, the <b>GHG</b> <b>emission</b> level is expected to significantly decline from 2012 - 2020. The electricity consumption level in 2020 will be 1 % higher than 2010 level but the <b>GHG</b> <b>emission</b> is 3 % lower accordingly. If we included the impact of 311 Earthquake into the simulation, the <b>GHG</b> <b>emission</b> generated by Japanese electric utility industry will reach to 656 million metric tons CO 2 in 2020. This is 311. 4 million metric tons {{in excess of the}} forecast without the impact of the 311 Earthquake.
