The Department's role, therefore, is an advisory one.|$|E

However, during World War I and World War II all states and territories used daylight saving time (DST). In 1968 Tasmania became the first state in peacetime to use DST, followed in 1971 by New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory. Western Australia and the Northern Territory did not adopt it. Queensland abandoned DST in 1972. Queensland and Western Australia have occasionally used DST during the past 40 years during trial periods.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{scholars}} view Cain and Abel as symbolic {{rather than}} real. Like {{almost all of}} the persons, places and stories in the Primeval history (the first eleven chapters of Genesis), they are mentioned nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible, a fact that suggests that the History is a late composition attached to Genesis to serve as an introduction. Just how late <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> dispute: the history may be as late as the Hellenistic period (first decades of the 4th century BCE), but the high level of Babylonian myth behind its stories (Cain and Abel are paralleled by Dumuzi and Enkimdu) has led others to date it to the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE).|$|E
25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that {{they are at the}} same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, then {{at least one of the}} bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court of Canada {{ruled that}} the Government has the {{authority}} to amend the definition of marriage, but did not rule on whether or not such a change is required by the equality provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court stated that such a ruling is not necessary because the Federal Government had accepted the rulings of provincial courts to the effect that the change was required. The Court also ruled that given freedom of religion in the Charter of Rights, and wording of provincial human rights codes, it was highly unlikely that religious institutions could be compelled to perform same-sex marriages, though because solemnization of marriage <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> provincial governments, the proposed bill could not actually guarantee such protections.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, Garner raised two themes, {{the first of}} which was the use of the concept of justice. Agreeing with Cochrane that the concept is the defining feature of a political account, as opposed to more general accounts of animal ethics, Garner nevertheless found Cochrane's account of justice to be [...] "too broad and loose". In the book, Cochrane considers justice for animals to be [...] "about recognising that the treatment of animals <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> political communities to enforce" [...] and [...] "recognising that the treatment of animals is something that political communities ought to enforce for the sake of animals themselves".

500|$|Names {{of units}} follow the {{grammatical}} rules associated with common nouns: in English and in French they {{start with a}} lowercase letter (e.g., newton, hertz, pascal), even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter.

The spelling of unit names <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> the guardians of the language concerned – the official British and American spellings for certain SI units differ – British English, as well as Australian, Canadian and New Zealand English, uses the spelling deca-, metre, and litre whereas American English uses the spelling deka-, meter, and liter, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Leave Home was {{released}} on January 10, 1977 and was well received by critics. Although the album did not receive much initial reception, Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a favorable review in 1977, {{saying that it is}} very similar to their debut yet more experienced sounding. He sums up the album with: [...] "The Ramones are as direct and witty as before. They've also lost just a pinch of their studied rawness: whether this is a sign of maturity or sellout <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> debate. The Ramones make rousing music and damn good jokes, but they're in a bind: the hard rock of this group is so pure it may be perceived as a freak novelty by an awful lot of people." [...] In the 1979 book The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the album was given 4.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E

500|$|Though {{awareness}} for {{linguistic diversity}} {{is a policy}} target, the language rights of speakers of regional, minority, lesser-used and migrant languages are not legally protected. In the European Union, language policy {{is the responsibility of}} member states and European Union does not have a [...] "common language policy." [...] Based on the [...] "principle of subsidiarity", European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in their language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages. The content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states and the European Union has very limited influence in this area. However, a number of European Union funded programmes actively promote language learning, most prominently under the much wider Lifelong learning Programme 2007–2013. Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes, protection of linguistic rights <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>for</b> the member states.|$|E
