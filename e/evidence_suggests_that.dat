5|$|<b>Evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{hydrogen}} peroxide is abundant {{across much of}} the surface of Europa. Because {{hydrogen peroxide}} decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid water, the authors argue that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms.|$|E
5|$|Existing <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> water {{fluoridation}} reduces tooth decay.

No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.|$|E

5|$|Germanium supplements, {{made from}} both organic and {{inorganic}} germanium, have been marketed {{as an alternative}} medicine capable of treating leukemia and lung cancer.

5|$|Recent <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> nonpathogenic {{strains of}} H. pylori may be beneficial, e.g., by {{normalizing}} stomach acid secretion, and {{may play a}} role in regulating appetite, since its presence in the stomach results in a persistent but reversible reduction in the level of ghrelin.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{effects of}} the menstrual cycle on alcohol consumption have found mixed evidence.

5|$|Although the Earth is {{the only}} body within the solar system known to support life, <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{in the distant past}} the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.

5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E

5|$|Around 1170, Keynsham Abbey {{was founded}} by the Victorine {{congregation}} of canon regulars.

5|$|<b>Evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{a native}} pony existed in Wales before 1600 BC. The {{original}} Welsh Mountain Pony {{is thought to}} have evolved from this prehistoric Celtic pony. Welsh ponies were primarily developed in Wales, and their ancestors existed in the British Isles prior to the arrival of the Roman Empire. Bands of ponies roamed in a semi-feral state, climbing mountains, leaping ravines, and running over rough moorland terrain.|$|E
