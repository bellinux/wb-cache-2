The play had a cross-country tour from Washington, D.C. to the Pasadena Playhouse.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{theatrical}} release, Danger: Diabolik performed below De Laurentiis' expectations {{at the box}} office, {{and received}} negative reviews <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> and Variety. With the re-evaluation of Bava's filmography, contemporary reception of the film has been more positive, with critics praising its visuals, the performances of Law and Mell, and the score by Ennio Morricone. Two new adaptations of Diabolik were announced in the 2000s, but neither went into production.|$|E

5|$|The {{first edition}} of Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{published}} on October 10, 1995, by Vintage Books. It was the first book compiled by Spin. Having edited their book, Weisbard put his pursuit of a PhD at UC Berkeley on hold and accepted a job offer from the magazine, which {{marked the beginning of}} his career as a rock critic. Although the book did not sell well, its entry on 1960s folk artist John Fahey, written by Byron Coley, helped renew interest in Fahey's music. According to Ben Ratliff <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times,</b> this led to substantial interest in Fahey from record labels and the alternative music scene, helping revive his career.|$|E
5|$|Across Cuba, anti-Batista groups {{carried out}} bombings and sabotage; police responded with mass arrests, torture, and extrajudicial executions. In March 1957, the DR {{launched}} a failed {{attack on the}} presidential palace, during which Antonio was shot dead. Frank País was also killed, leaving Castro the MR-26-7's unchallenged leader. Although Guevara and Raúl were well known for their Marxist–Leninist views, Castro hid his, hoping to gain the support of less radical revolutionaries. In 1957 he met with leading members of the Partido Ortodoxo, Raúl Chibás and Felipe Pazos, authoring the Sierra Maestra Manifesto, in which they demanded that a provisional civilian government be set up to implement moderate agrarian reform, industrialization, and a literacy campaign before holding multiparty elections. As Cuba's press was censored, Castro contacted foreign media to spread his message; he became a celebrity after being interviewed by Herbert Matthews, a journalist <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times.</b> Reporters from CBS and Paris Match soon followed.|$|E
5|$|An American Idiot stage musical {{adaptation}} premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in September 2009. The musical was {{a collaboration}} between Green Day and director Michael Mayer. Green Day did {{not appear in the}} production, but the show featured an onstage band. The production transferred to Broadway at the St. James Theatre, and opened in April 2010. The show received mixed to positive reviews from critics, but received a rave review <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times.</b> The show features all of the songs from the album American Idiot, including B-sides, as well as songs from Green Day's follow-up album, 21st Century Breakdown. Armstrong appeared in the Broadway production as St. Jimmy multiple times. With his return in 2011, the show grossed over $1million.|$|E

5|$|Owing to the {{confluence}} of these problems, the Census was completed and tabulated several months behind schedule to much popular criticism, and led indirectly to a deterioration in Walker's health {{during the spring of}} 1871. Walker took leave to travel to England with Bowles that summer to recuperate and upon return that fall, despite an offer <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> to join their editorial board with an annual salary of $8,000 ($ in 2016), accepted Secretary Columbus Delano's offer to become the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs in November 1871. The appointment was simultaneously a go-around to continue to fund Walker's federal responsibilities as Census superintendent despite Congress' cessation of appropriations for the position as well as a political opportunity to replace a scandal-ridden predecessor. Walker continued to work on the Census for several years thereafter, culminating in the publication of the Statistical Atlas of the United States that was unprecedented in its use of visual statistics and maps to report the results of the Census. The Atlas won him praise from both the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as well as a First Class medal from the International Geographical Congress.|$|E
