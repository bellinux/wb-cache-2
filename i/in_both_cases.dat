5|$|By the {{spectral}} theorem, real symmetric matrices and complex Hermitian matrices have an eigenbasis; that is, every vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> all eigenvalues are real. This theorem can {{be generalized to}} infinite-dimensional situations related to matrices with infinitely many rows and columns, see below.|$|E
5|$|Chinese uses {{traditional}} logograms {{for writing}} the unit names, while in Japanese unit names {{are written in}} the phonetic katakana script; <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> symbols are also written using the internationally recognised Latin and Greek characters.|$|E

30|$|<b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>case</b> studies, the NLFEA {{proposed}} herein gives {{very good}} results that match with acceptable accuracy the experimental test {{results in the}} case of non-damaged beams. The approach is numerically stable and insensitive over a wide range of number of elements and size of load increments. The tuning parameter, α, of the displacement field tuning convergence (DFTC) can be calibrated with only a few trials <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>case</b> studies, and the convergence of the model becomes systematic in almost all the studied cases.|$|R
50|$|The {{probability}} to hit {{either an}} atom or a Si-H bond is random, {{and the average}} energy involved in each process is the same <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R
5|$|Further rebellions {{occurred}} in 1287–88 and, more seriously, in 1294, {{under the leadership}} of Madog ap Llywelyn, a distant relative of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. This last conflict demanded the King's own attention, but <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> the rebellions were put down.|$|E
5|$|In some monarchies—such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Thailand—promulgation is {{required}} {{as well as}} royal assent. In other monarchies—such as Sweden—the government officially promulgates laws. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> however, the process of royal assent is usually a formality, whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{conflict}} between feminist and traditional members {{led to the}} latter leaving Beth Israel, and forming the Orthodox Congregation Ahavas Torah. Beth Israel came under attack from neo-Nazi members of the Volksfront twice, in 1994 and again in 2002. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> the perpetrators were caught and convicted.|$|E

30|$|Increase in R dips {{fatigue crack}} growth rate, dc/dN, in the {{laminates}} under ambient and aqueous environments, whereas it augments dc/dN in corrosive (salt) environment. The trends hold good <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>case</b> I and case II laminates.|$|R
5|$|Juveniles moult their head, {{body and}} some wing {{feathers}} {{a few weeks}} after fledging, and adults have a complete moult after breeding. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> if the process is not complete by the time of migration it is suspended and completed on the wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Since 2005, a {{digitally}} restored {{version of}} Top Hat is available separately {{and as part}} of The Astaire & Rogers Collection, Vol.1 from Warner Home Video. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> the film features a commentary by Astaire's daughter, Ava Astaire McKenzie, and Larry Billman, author of Fred Astaire, a Bio-bibliography.|$|E
5|$|Since these events, Glacier Peak has {{produced}} several lahars. The largest events were 5,900 and 1,800 {{years ago and}} were associated with dome-building eruptions. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> the lahars traveled down the Skagit River to Puget Sound.|$|E
50|$|Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite or, in French, Détermination d'Orbite et Radiopositionnement Intégré par Satellite (<b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>case</b> {{yielding}} {{the acronym}} DORIS) is a French satellite system {{used for the}} determination of satellite orbits (e.g. TOPEX/Poseidon) and for positioning.|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>case</b> studies III and IV, {{convergence}} {{is satisfied}} {{in all cases}} of damaged and undamaged beams. The capability of the NLFEA to capture the ultimate load and deformation and its numerical stability and fast convergence enhance the confidence for its use in more complex applications.|$|R
25|$|He was {{nominated}} twice for a Grammy {{in the category}} Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album in 2006 (It's Time) and 2007 (Caught in the Act) but lost <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>case</b> to Tony Bennett. In 2007, Bublé received one Juno nomination, for Fan Choice, but lost to Nelly Furtado.|$|R
5|$|Some Anglo-Saxon kings {{are known}} to have been killed by their {{households}} or in open warfare against rivals, but overall the record is very sparse. The evidence as regards the deposition of kings is equally limited. Only two eighth-century depositions offer any context, those of Æthelwald Moll in Northumbria and Sigeberht of Wessex. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> the decision is presented as that of some form of council.|$|E
5|$|The Zion Cinema was {{the site}} of two {{attempted}} bombings, one in 1951 and the other in 1967. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> an incendiary device was planted under the theater seats and was discovered before it detonated.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcomes}} of the confirmation of charges hearings were announced on 23 January 2012. Despite the ICC regulations requiring the Pre-Trial Chamber to normally issue a verdict on confirmation of charges within sixty days of the hearings taking place the chamber issued a ruling on 26 October 2011 to vary this time limit to allow both the results <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> to be announced simultaneously.|$|E
30|$|Inspecting, now, Tables 5 and 6, it can {{be readily}} {{verified}} that <b>both</b> <b>case</b> scenarios resulted <b>in</b> significantly increased total volume of optimal pumping rates. The differences observed between the total volume of the optimal pumping rates, {{as well as the}} distribution of the pumping volume among the active locations <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>case</b> scenarios, suggest that the location of the extra artificial well significantly affects the final optimal pumping setup.|$|R

5|$|When {{the glass}} {{electrode}} cannot be employed, as with non-aqueous solutions, spectrophotometric methods are frequently used. These may involve absorbance or fluorescence measurements. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> the measured quantity {{is assumed to}} be proportional to the sum of contributions from each photo-active species; with absorbance measurements the Beer-Lambert law is assumed to apply.|$|E
5|$|Xenophon {{mentions}} Aspasia {{twice in}} his Socratic writings: in Memorabilia and in Oeconomicus. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> her advice is recommended to Critobulus by Socrates. In Memorabilia Socrates quotes Aspasia {{as saying that}} the matchmaker should report truthfully on the good characteristics of the man. In Oeconomicus Socrates defers to Aspasia as more knowledgeable about household management and the economic partnership between husband and wife.|$|E
5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E
