5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to {{his opposition to the}} hydrogen bomb.

The events he planned were attended by the Ileana regulars, and, in time, attracted virtually all other major en plein air painters of the day: Nicolae Dărăscu, Ștefan Dimitrescu, Iosif Iser, M. H. Maxy, Theodor Pallady, Camil Ressu.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of <b>his</b> <b>activities,</b> but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E

5|$|From Persia, Andranik {{moved to}} the Caucasus, where he met the Armenian leaders in Baku and Tiflis.

In 1906 in Geneva, he published a book on military tactics. Most of the work was about <b>his</b> <b>activities</b> and the strategies he used during the 1904 Sasun uprising.|$|E
5|$|From ca. 1088 on, he {{used his}} base at Smyrna to wage war against the Byzantines. Employing Christian craftsmen, he built a fleet, with which he {{captured}} Phocaea and the eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos (except for the fortress of Methymna), Samos, Chios and Rhodes. A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle. Some modern scholars have speculated that <b>his</b> <b>activities</b> during this time {{may have been in}} conjunction, and perhaps even coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine Greek rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann, a Dutch {{administrator}} of the Kedu region, continued Cornelius's work, and in 1835, the whole complex was finally unearthed. His interest in Borobudur was more personal than official. Hartmann did not write any reports of <b>his</b> <b>activities,</b> in particular, the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of Buddha in the main stupa. In 1842, Hartmann investigated the main dome, although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty.|$|E

5|$|He {{received}} the presbyterate {{in the first}} months of 1786, and was appointed for the Concepción parish, the same one where he was baptized. He also worked at the aforementioned House of Spiritual Works of Buenos Aires. He got the curacy of Magdalena on 12 September 1790, but resigned a year later because of health problems. He returned in 1793, and resigned definitively on 21 February 1794. After this, he moved to Maldonado. There are few historical records of <b>his</b> <b>activities</b> in those curacies.|$|E
5|$|He was {{transferred}} to Lublin {{in the summer of}} 1942, where he joined the staff of SS-Brigadeführer Odilo Globočnik, the SS and Police Leader of the Kraków area, as part of Operation Reinhard, the code name given to the establishment of the three extermination camps at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka. Nothing is known of <b>his</b> <b>activities</b> in the six months he served with Operation Reinhard; participants were sworn to secrecy.

5|$|In 1842 {{the leaders}} of the Society of Friends, the Quaker group to which Coffin belonged, advised their members to cease {{membership}} in abolitionist societies and end activities assisting runaway slaves.

Coffin continued to {{take an active role in}} assisting escaping slaves and the following year the Quaker society expelled him from membership. Coffin and other Quakers who supported <b>his</b> <b>activities</b> separated and formed the Antislavery Friends; the two rival groups remained separate until a reunification occurred in 1851.|$|E
