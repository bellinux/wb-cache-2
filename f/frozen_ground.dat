5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the <b>frozen</b> <b>ground.</b> The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the <b>frozen</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{most places}} on Fishing Creek, {{there is not}} enough {{dissolved}} aluminum to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level for fish. Fishing Creek itself and all its other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: aluminum trapped in <b>frozen</b> <b>ground</b> is released into the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, aluminum levels in the creek peak in March and April and drop to almost zero in the summer.|$|E

5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the <b>frozen</b> <b>ground,</b> the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|Mid-March brought warmer air to {{the country}} which thawed the snow lying on the ground. This {{snowmelt}} rapidly ran off the <b>frozen</b> <b>ground</b> into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10per cent of the year's industrial production, 10to 20per cent of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The ruling Labour Party began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party in the 1950 election. That winter is also cited {{as a factor in}} the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80, Britain's decline from being a superpower, and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh backs {{repeatedly}} {{exposed the}} three threequarter system {{used by the}} English, as once the Welsh backs broke through the pack there was little defensive-cover to prevent run away scores. With the score at 9–7 to England, Marshall extended the lead with his third try of the match. This gave England an 11–7 lead with only ten minutes remaining. The game swung again when Percy Phillips received ball quickly before passing to Gould. Gould broke through the English defence and scored, though again Bancroft missed the conversion. With further Welsh pressure, a penalty was awarded to Wales on the English 25-yard line, but at a wide angle. Accounts differ as to what happened; some say that Gould tried to place the ball for Bancroft, but failed on the <b>frozen</b> <b>ground,</b> another states that Bancroft defied his captain to take the penalty as a drop kick, while other accounts mention Bancroft and Gould arguing on the pitch before Bancroft's attempt. Regardless, Bancroft kicked the penalty, the first penalty to be scored in an international match. It was the final score {{of the game and}} Wales were victorious, 12–11.|$|E
50|$|Danish miners Svend Viltorft dig up {{a section}} of a giant reptile's tail from the <b>frozen</b> <b>grounds</b> in Lapland, where they are drilling. The section is flown to the Danish Aquarium in Copenhagen, where it is {{preserved}} in a cold room for scientific study. But due to careless mishandling, the room is left open and the section begins to thaw, only for scientists {{to find that it}} is starting to regenerate.|$|R

5|$|Most procellariids' nests are in burrows or on {{the surface}} on open ground, with a smaller number nesting {{under the cover of}} {{vegetation}} (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the snow petrel nest in the open, the snow petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting snow petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where <b>frozen</b> <b>ground</b> is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to skuas, gulls and other avian predators, something the aggressive oil-spitting fulmars are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no wind-chill to contend with. The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on tropical islands is why some shearwaters and two species of gadfly petrel can nest in the open. This has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on coralline islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies nocturnally in order to reduce predation as well. Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the herald petrel, which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal white-bellied sea eagle.|$|E

40|$|Permafrost and <b>frozen</b> <b>grounds</b> are key {{elements}} of the terrestrial cryosphere that will be strongly affected by a warming climate. This chapter presents {{an overview of the}} remote sensing methods for permafrost studies with current sensor technologies. It outlines the remote sensing methods in two permafrost environments that differ substantially in their character: mountain permafrost and lowland permafrost. For remote sensing of permafrost in mountain areas, evaluating surface features is the dominant remote sensing application. Remote sensing techniques employed in the vast arctic and subarctic lowland areas, however, include a wide range of sensors that allow both mapping of surface features and monitoring of physical surface variables {{that can be used to}} assess the permafrost state. The chapter concludes with an outlook on thermal permafrost modeling using remotely sensed data sets as input...|$|R
5000|$|... "Long ago in {{the deepest}} heart of the black forest, a young prince lived, unloved and {{neglected}} in a dark castle. Like the ghostly horrors that always grow in secret shadows, Prince Ludwig grew to be a troubled child. Soon, even the kindest of servants avoided his evil gaze. One dark winter's night, as Ludwig wandered the lonely, <b>frozen</b> <b>grounds</b> of the palace, an old woman appeared. Outraged at this intrusion, Ludwig howled in fury! There, in her place, stood a snarling wolf. As her angry yellow eyes bored into Ludwig's, she revealed his dark destiny: Wicked ruler of a corrupt kingdom. Guided by the wolf, Ludwig set out to take the throne. His parents tried {{to put an end}} to his ruthless ambitions, but they mysteriously vanished.|$|R
25|$|Frozen {{water is}} {{found on the}} Earth’s surface {{primarily}} as snow cover, freshwater ice in lakes and rivers, sea ice, glaciers, ice sheets, and <b>frozen</b> <b>ground</b> and permafrost (permanently <b>frozen</b> <b>ground).</b> The residence time of water {{in each of these}} cryospheric sub-systems varies widely. Snow cover and freshwater ice are essentially seasonal, and most sea ice, except for ice in the central Arctic, lasts only a few years if it is not seasonal. A given water particle in glaciers, ice sheets, or ground ice, however, may remain frozen for 10-100,000 years or longer, and deep ice in parts of East Antarctica may have an age approaching 1 million years.|$|E
25|$|Dao Vallis begins near a large volcano, called Hadriaca Patera, so it {{is thought}} to have {{received}} water when hot magma melted huge amounts of ice in the <b>frozen</b> <b>ground.</b> The partially circular depressions {{on the left side of}} the channel in the adjacent image suggest that groundwater sapping also contributed water.|$|E
25|$|Munitions – Snow, ice, <b>frozen</b> <b>ground,</b> and low {{temperatures}} affect mine-laying operations. Burying mines in a frost layer may be difficult, requiring mines {{to be placed}} on top of the ground and then camouflaged. Snow or ice may prevent detonation, owing to freezing the firing device or isolating from pressure above. This can be mitigated with plastic laid {{over the top of the}} mine.|$|E

50|$|Frost heave {{is common}} in arctic tundra because the {{permafrost}} maintains <b>ground</b> <b>frozen</b> at depth and prevents snowmelt and rain from draining. As a result, conditions are optimal for deep ice lens formation with large ice accumulations and significant soil displacement.|$|R
25|$|Many of the Western Union {{workers were}} unaccustomed to severe {{northern}} winters {{and working in}} frigid conditions made erecting the line a difficult experience.

25|$|The {{next week}} saw the Bears {{drawn into the}} turmoil of the Vikings' 2010 season. As the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome's {{inflatable}} roof had collapsed the week before, the two teams had to play at TCF Bank Stadium at the University of Minnesota campus in frigid winter weather. Despite being a nominal home game for the Vikings, they were not a team prepared for outdoor play and Chicago overwhelmed them 40–14. It was here that Brett Favre took his final snap in the NFL after he was knocked into the <b>frozen</b> <b>ground</b> and suffered a concussion, ending a 20-year career that included 297 consecutive starts.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{exploratory}} dig, and of the earlier investigations, Jones' contract was extended and she was appointed director of the full scale excavations. She was joined by her husband Tom and in 1965 (after the crops had been harvested) they began the mammoth task that was to last for the next 14years on the Mucking hill top. The excavation was unusual in that it continued through the winter, unlike most excavations which only took place in the summer. The need to stay ahead of the gravel extraction sometimes meant softening the <b>frozen</b> <b>ground</b> with a blow torch to enable a find to be lifted in time.|$|E
25|$|Tactics – Defensive {{positions}} are highly advantageous {{because of the}} ability to maintain warmth and protection, compared to attacking in extreme cold. Mobility and logistical support are often restricted by snow, requiring plowing or compacting it to accommodate wide-tracked vehicles or sleds. Infantry movement in deep snow requires skis or snowshoes to avoid exhaustion. Sound carries well over crusted snow, diminishing the element of surprise. Explosives are useful for excavating foxholes and larger shelters in <b>frozen</b> <b>ground.</b> Attacking field kitchens and encampments deprives the enemy of food and shelter. Rapid removal of the wounded from the battlefield is essential to their survival in the cold.|$|E
