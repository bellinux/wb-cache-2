500|$|After Voyager ended, UPN {{produced}} , a prequel TV {{series to}} the original show. Enterprise did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series' third season. Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the Original Series. Paramount renewed Enterprise for a fourth season, but moved it to the Friday night death slot. Like the Original Series, Enterprise ratings dropped during this time slot, and UPN cancelled Enterprise {{at the end of}} its fourth season. Enterprise aired its final episode on May 13, 2005. Fan groups, [...] "Save Enterprise", attempted to save the series and tried to raise $30 million to privately finance a fifth season of Enterprise. Though the effort garnered considerable press, the <b>fan</b> <b>drive</b> failed to save the series. The cancellation of Enterprise ended an eighteen-year continuous production run of Star Trek programming on television. The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film , cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise. Paramount relieved Berman, the franchise producer, of control of Star Trek.|$|E
2500|$|The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center is {{the largest}} wind tunnel test section in the world. This open circuit leg was added and a new <b>fan</b> <b>drive</b> system was {{installed}} in the 1980s. The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel is used to support an active research program in aerodynamics, dynamics, model noise, and full-scale aircraft and their components. The aerodynamic characteristics of new configurations are investigated, {{with an emphasis on}} estimating the accuracy of computational methods. Aeromechanical stability boundaries of advanced rotorcraft and rotor-fuselage interactions are explored. The acoustic characteristics of most of the full-scale vehicles are also determined, as well as acoustic research aimed at discovering and reducing aerodynamic sources of noise. In addition to the normal data gathering methods (e.g., balance system, pressure measuring transducers, and temperature sensing thermocouples), state-of-the-art non-intrusive instrumentation (e.g., laser velocimeters and shadowgraphs) are available to help determine flow direction and velocity in and around the lifting surfaces of models or aircraft undergoing investigation. Some of the test programs that have come through the 80 by 120 Foot include: F-18 High Angle of Attack Vehicle, DARPA/Lockheed Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter, XV-15 Tilt Rotor, and Advance Recovery System Parafoil.

50|$|Access to {{the motor}} room on an {{autoclave}} with an internal <b>fan</b> <b>drive</b> {{is through the}} back door or a manway. The autoclave working space is not reduced, as the pressure vessel is made slightly longer to accommodate the <b>fan</b> <b>drive.</b> The accessibility of the hardware in the back is of the essence. Eventually, the maintenance personnel will need to get at it, and access then suddenly becomes very much an issue.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fan</b> <b>drive</b> {{determines the}} speed of the fan wheel (impeller) {{and the extent to which}} this speed can be varied. There are three basic types of fan drives.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fan</b> <b>drive</b> must be sized for the {{conditions}} creating the greatest {{load on the}} fan, i.e., lowest temperature and highest pressure, even though this combination of conditions rarely occurs. Ideally, this means backward-incline fans; these are more efficient than radial impeller and forward-curve types.|$|E
50|$|The BR710 {{comprises}} a 48-inch-diameter single-stage <b>fan,</b> <b>driven</b> by a two-stage LP turbine, supercharging a ten-stage HP compressor (scaled {{from the}} V2500 unit) and {{driven by a}} two-stage, air-cooled, HP turbine.|$|R
50|$|Simple {{mechanical}} machines {{consist of}} a very basic setup, involving an enclosed fan and (optionally) a speed switch. This <b>fan</b> <b>drives</b> air through small slots in the machine's casing, producing the desired sound.|$|R
5000|$|Examples of zero-staging for {{land-based}} {{gas turbines}} are the aeroderivative GE LM2500+ and the heavy-duty GE MS5002B. An alternative to zero-staging {{used by some}} OEMs is supercharging the compressor with a <b>fan</b> <b>driven</b> by an electric motor.|$|R
50|$|The {{fan wheel}} {{can be linked}} {{directly}} to the shaft of an electric motor. This means that the fan wheel speed {{is identical to the}} motor's rotational speed. With this type of <b>fan</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism, the fan speed cannot be varied unless the motor speed is adjustable. Air conditioning automatically provides faster speed because colder air is denser.|$|E
50|$|The Leyland L60 {{engine is}} a {{two-stroke}} opposed piston design intended for multi-fuel use {{so that it}} could run on whatever fuel was available. In practice the engine did not deliver the expected power and was unreliable, estimated to have a 90% breakdown rate but improvements were introduced to address this. Primary problems included cylinder liner failure, <b>fan</b> <b>drive</b> problems and perpetual leaks due to vibration and badly routed pipework. However, as the engine power improved the tank itself became heavier.|$|E
50|$|Mounted in {{the long}} hood is the prime mover, a six-cylinder inline {{turbocharged}} diesel engine of type K6 S 230 DR (bore 230 mm x stroke 260 mm), directly connected to the TD 805 traction generator. In {{the front of the}} hood there is a mechanical compressor, the cooling unit for the traction motors of the front bogie, and the cooling <b>fan</b> <b>drive</b> motors that power a pair of 800 mm fans which remove heat from the diesel engine's water cooling system.|$|E
50|$|The PW530 has {{a single}} stage <b>fan,</b> <b>driven</b> by a 2-stage LP turbine, {{supercharging}} a 2A/1CF axial-centrifugal HP compressor, driven by a single stage HP turbine. Rated at 2,887 pounds of thrust, it entered service in February 1997.|$|R

50|$|A vacuum's suction {{is caused}} by a {{difference}} in air pressure. A <b>fan</b> <b>driven</b> by an electric motor (often a universal motor) reduces the pressure inside the machine. Atmospheric pressure then pushes the air through the carpet and into the nozzle, and so the dust is literally pushed into the bag.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant in}} Berlin was {{dismantled}} {{and taken to}} the Soviet Union after the German Surrender in 1945, following orders of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. In 1947, the brothers Günther and Heinz Ziehl re-established the company in the Künzelsau castle mill, this time in West Germany. In 1960 began the production of an external rotor motor as a <b>fan</b> <b>drive.</b> The internalisation of the company started in 1973 and, in 2001, it became a family owned, joint-stock company.|$|E
50|$|An often {{overlooked}} aspect of autoclave access is the rear end. In many instances, the best autoclave {{is that which}} has two doors. In the typical industrial autoclave, there is mechanical hardware in the rear, including the circulation <b>fan</b> <b>drive.</b> An autoclave with a rear door will cost more initially. Over its service life, however, it will cost less to maintain, largely because the easy accessibility of components inside will encourage their more frequent inspection. In any autoclave, as in any machine, all major and minor components should be accessible for inspection, repair, and replacement. Overlook this, and the owner will eventually regret it.|$|E
5000|$|The STOVL F-35B is {{outfitted}} with the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem, designed by Lockheed Martin and developed by Rolls-Royce. This system more resembles the German VJ 101D/E than the preceding STOVL Harrier Jump Jet and the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine. The Lift System {{is composed of}} a lift <b>fan,</b> <b>drive</b> shaft, two roll posts and a [...] "Three Bearing Swivel Module" [...] (3BSM). The 3BSM is a thrust vectoring nozzle which allows the main engine exhaust to be deflected downward at {{the tail of the}} aircraft. The lift fan is near the front of the aircraft and provides a counterbalancing thrust using two counter-rotating blisks. It is powered by the engine's low-pressure (LP) turbine via a drive shaft and gearbox. Roll control during slow flight is achieved by diverting unheated engine bypass air through wing-mounted thrust nozzles called Roll Posts.|$|E

50|$|Whereas the RE used {{a complex}} stepped frame on bus variants. Seddon {{decided to use}} a {{straight}} frame using 8in channel longitudinals and mainly tubular cross-members which was oriented to rise from front to rear at about 5 degrees from the horizontal. Wheelbases offered were either 16 ft 6in for 33 ft coachwork or 18 ft 6in for 36 ft bodies. Instead of the complex drive-line arrangement of the RE a straightforward T-drive layout was employed. The rear end of the 10.45-litre Gardner 6HLX (the 8.6 litre 6HLW was optional) was mounted below and hard against the rear cross member on the short version, driving directly via a fluid flywheel into a Self-Changing Gears 4 or 5-speed direct-operating epicyclic gearbox, air-operated with electrical control. The Eaton spiral-bevel rear axle, {{to a variety of}} different final drive ratios, was just ahead of the power pack and a very short drive shaft was fitted with resilient rubber-based joints. Originally on the long-wheelbase version a similar arrangement was employed but with the engine further {{from the rear of the}} frame. Conventional leaf springs were used, but the spring shackle-pins were fitted with polyurethane bushes, which would not require greasing and so reduce maintenance costs. The braking was full air-operated using Girling wedge-type drum brakes. A spring operated air parking-brake was employed, power steering for the Seddon-designed front-axle was optionally available. Unlike the RE and the Leyland Panther the radiator was not carried at the front but hung from the offside of the chassis in mid-wheelbase, ahead of the rear axle. A combined saloon heating and ventilation system with a thermostatically-controlled heat-exchanger and reversible <b>fan</b> <b>drive</b> was announced but this was never made available to customers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to design and {{implement}} a model of wind tunnel. The model can be controlled in various ranges of standardized signals in both analog and digital form. The model consists two fans - an electrically <b>driven</b> <b>fan</b> and <b>fan</b> <b>driven</b> by air stream.

50|$|Morozov's {{new medium}} tank design {{received}} a skeptical response. It {{was believed that}} putting a high-speed 12-cylinder engine with a working displacement of almost 40 liters perpendicular to the direction of travel would cause problems, including breaking the connecting rods. It was believed that decreasing the displacement of the engine compartment {{for the purpose of}} enlarging the fighting compartment was unnecessary and that moving the turret rearwards would limit the elevation angle of the main gun. However, it turned out that even though rotating the engine complicated the transmission by introducing an additional reduction gear - gear-train and <b>fan</b> <b>drive,</b> it also solved many problems. The cover of the engine and transmission compartment turned along with the radiator; this allowed easier access to the engine, transmission and batteries. The significant decrease in the length of the engine compartment allowed the turret to be moved rearwards, which in turn moved its rotation axis and the center of mass {{to the center of the}} hull, increased the accuracy of the main gun and decreased a chance that the turret could get stuck after getting hit in the turret ring with a projectile that ricocheted. The thickness of the frontal armor protection more than doubled without disturbing the center of mass or drastically increasing the weight of the tank. At the beginning of World War II the thickness of T-34 armor was considered enough. Improvements made to the T-34 during World War II included increasing the caliber of the gun (from 76.2 mm to 85 mm) and thickening the armor of the turret. No significant improvements were made to the hull. Increasing the size of the fighting compartment allowed the removal of floor ammunition stowage. The height of the tank was decreased by 300 mm, even though the turret remained almost the same. Removal of the conical pair in the transmission permitted fitting a more compact gear box and improved the control of the brakes and the steering clutch. Visibility from the driver's position was improved. The driver was protected from being splashed by water while the vehicle was fording. The new torsion bar suspension allowed easier crossing of rough ground.|$|E
