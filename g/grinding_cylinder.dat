40|$|Abstract. The motion {{equation}} of the <b>grinding</b> <b>cylinder</b> is deduced, {{which is based}} on the dynamic analysis of the <b>grinding</b> <b>cylinder</b> of the ball mill coupled with vertical vibration. Numerical model of vertical vibration ball mill is built and used to study the motion of grinding cavity media and grinding efficiency. The simulation results show that the distribution status of the grinding media in each region is changed, the grinding fragmentation of the grinding media to the material is enhanced, and the efficiency of fine grinding is improved with the coupled vertical vibration in a ball mill...|$|E

The use of an ontology-based virtual factory, continuously synchronized with the real plant, is proposed to guarantee digital continuity and enable in situ simulation during the operating phase of a factory. This digital counterpart of the system can be used for integrated shop-floor simulations to assess future impact of production and maintenance planning decisions. An industrial application is provided in the context of roll shops, i. e., systems devoted to the <b>grinding</b> of <b>cylinders</b> for rolling mills...|$|R

30|$|All rock preparation, measurement, and {{analysis}} {{were carried out}} in the rock mechanics laboratories, at the Department of Geological Sciences, University of Canterbury (Cant 2015). Samples were taken from core supplied by Mercury NZ Limited and Tauhara North No. 2 Trust. A drill press was used to extract 25 – 20  mm diameter cylinders from the core using a diamond tipped coring bit. The cylinders were all oriented parallel to the long axis of the core samples, making them approximately vertical within the stratigraphic column. A small piece of each cylinder was removed for thin section preparation for petrophysical analysis and void structure investigation. The cylinders were cut for a length-to-diameter ratio between 1 : 1.8 and 1 : 2.2, and ground flat for parallel ends as recommended by Ulusay and Hudson (2007) to allow for future unconfined compressive strength (UCS) testing. After coring and <b>grinding</b> the <b>cylinders,</b> they were placed in an ultrasonic bath with distilled water to clean and remove loose fractured material or clays formed during core drilling and grinding, then oven dried.|$|R
5000|$|Beyond the arm, {{the west}} bank {{contained}} Canal Street Dye Works and a dockyard with a dry dock in 1851. The end of the basin was quite large, and the Manchester Flint Glass Works was located beyond it. The {{eastern side of the}} basin is marked as a brick field, where clay would have been extracted. By 1891, the brick field had become a Bedstead and Safe Works, with an electric engineering works and St Jude's Church occupying {{the east side of the}} plot. The glass works had expanded to cover the former docks, and the basin had been reduced to a narrow finger. By 1951, the site to the north of the side arm was occupied by a shirt factory, the Corporation Cleansing Department's garage and an engineering works, where <b>cylinder</b> <b>grinding</b> and welding were carried out by 1953. The whole area north of Mill Street bridge had been redeveloped by the time the 1972/1981 map was published.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Grinding</b> {{wheels are}} <b>cylinders</b> that are rotated at high speed. While once {{worked with a}} foot pedal or hand crank, the {{introduction}} of electric motors has made it necessary to construct the wheel to withstand greater radial stress to prevent the wheel flying apart as it spins. Similar issues arise with cutting wheels which are often structurally reinforced with impregnated fibres. High relative speed between abrasive and workpiece often makes necessary {{the use of a}} lubricant of some kind. Traditionally they were called coolants as they were used to prevent frictional heat build up which could damage the workpiece (such as ruining the temper of a blade). Some research suggests that the heat transport property of a lubricant is less important when dealing with metals as the metal will quickly conduct heat from the work surface. More important are their effects upon lessening tensile stresses while increasing some compressive stresses and reducing [...] "thermal and mechanical stresses during chip formation".|$|R
5000|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in precision grinding machines in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] In Great Britain the grinding process is now being used extensively on passenger car axles (particularly the journals) passenger railway carriage axle bearing units, crosshead guide bars, links, piston rods, chilled rolls, granite rolls, brass rolls, rubber rolls, paper rolls, crankshafts, camshafts, piston rings, planer knives, ball race rings, aluminium pistons, lenses, plate glass edges, glass tubes. Experiments are being carried out on the <b>grinding</b> of <b>cylinders</b> for locomotive and other engines. [...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|R
40|$|During the {{production}} process development for the manufacture of an experimental supersonic aircraft, an unusual and difficult grinding problem was encountered. Arising from the experimental work carried out to solve this problem, a method of numerically evaluating the efficiency of grinding wheels and coolants, was developed. This evaluation {{is based on the}} fact that under constant and limited grit load conditions which can be set up in a surface grinding operation, the edge of the grinding wheel which makes initial contact with the workpiece breaks down and forms an approach angle as shown in Fig. 1. Once this angle is established, its dimensions remain almost constant, and with continued use of the wheel the angle recedes across the face of the wheel. It is the recognition of the variables which control the dimensions of this approach angle (alpha) together with the rate at which it recedes across the wheel face, and the amount of work done at each increment of recession, on which the numerical evaluation of the efficiency of the grinding wheel and the causes of the limitations are based. A description of the methods used for determining the characteristics of grinding wheels and coolants are included together with the calculations which are necessary when the data obtained from tests carried out on the surface grinding machine are to be interpreted and applied to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>grinding</b> internal grinding or form grinding processes...|$|R
40|$|Milling is used widely as an {{efficient}} machining {{process in a}} variety of industrial applications, such as the complex surface machining and removing large amounts of material. Flutes make up {{the main part of the}} solid end-mill, which can significantly affect the tool’s life and machining quality in milling processes. The traditional method for end-mill flutes design is using try-errors based on cutting experiments with various flute parameters which is time- and resources-consuming. Hence, modeling the flutes of end-mill and simulating the cutting processes are crucial to improve the efficiency of end-mill design. Generally, in industry, the flutes are ground by CNC grinding machines via setting the position and orientation of grinding wheel to guarantee the designed flute parameters including rake angle, relief angle, flute angle and core radius. However, in previous researches, the designed flute profile was ground via building a specific grinding wheel with a free-form profile in in the grinding processes. And the free-form grinding wheel will greatly increase the manufacturing cost, which is too complicated to implement in practice. In this research, the flute-grinding processes were developed with standard grinding wheel via 2 -axis or 5 -axis CNC grinding operations. For the 2 -axis CNC flute-grinding processes, the flute was modelled via calculating the contact line between the grinding wheel and cutters. The flute parameters in terms of the dimension and configuration of grinding wheel were expressed explicitly, which can be used to planning the CNC programming. For the 5 -axis CNC flute-grinding processes, the flute was obtained with a <b>cylinder</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel via setting the wheel’s position and orientation rather than dressing the dimension of grinding wheel. In this processes, optimization method was used to determine the wheel’s position and orientation and evaluating the machined flute parameters. Beside, based on the proposed flute model, various conditions for grinding wheel’s setting were discussed to avoid interference of flute profile. A free-form flute profile is consequently generated in its grinding processes. However, in the end-mill design, the flute profile is simplified with some arcs and lines to approximate the CAD model of end-mills, which would introduce errors in the simulation of cutting processes. Based on the proposed flute-grinding methods, a solid flute CAD model was built and a CAD/CAM/CAE integration approach for the end-mill was carried out to predict the cutting forces and tool deflection. And also, the prediction results with various methods are verified to demonstrate the advantage of proposed approach. This work lays a foundation of integration of CAD/CAM/CAE for the end-mill design and would benefit the industry efficiently. ...|$|R
