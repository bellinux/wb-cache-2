500|$|Many {{conditions}} {{affect the}} human integumentary system—the organ system covering {{the entire surface}} of the body and composed of skin, hair, nails, and related muscle and glands. [...] The major function of this system is as a barrier against the external environment. [...] The skin weighs an average of four kilograms, covers an area of two square meters, and is made of three distinct layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. [...] The two main types of human skin are: <b>glabrous</b> <b>skin,</b> the hairless skin on the palms and soles (also referred to as the [...] "palmoplantar" [...] surfaces), and hair-bearing skin. [...] Within the latter type, the hairs occur in structures called pilosebaceous units, each with hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and associated arrector pili muscle. [...] In the embryo, the epidermis, hair, and glands form from the ectoderm, which is chemically influenced by the underlying mesoderm that forms the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.|$|E

50|$|In <b>glabrous</b> (hairless) <b>skin,</b> {{there are}} four {{principal}} types of mechanoreceptors, each shaped according to its function. The tactile corpuscles (also known as Meissner corpuscles) respond to light touch, and adapt rapidly to changes in texture (vibrations around 50 Hz). The bulbous corpuscles (also known as Ruffini endings) detect tension deep in the skin and fascia. The Merkel nerve endings (also known as Merkel discs) detect sustained pressure. The lamellar corpuscles (also known as Pacinian corpuscles) in the skin and fascia detect rapid vibrations (of about 200-300 Hz).|$|R
50|$|Lamellar corpuscles, or Pacinian corpuscles, {{are one of}} {{the four}} major types of {{mechanoreceptor}} cell in <b>glabrous</b> mammalian <b>skin.</b> They are nerve endings in the skin responsible for sensitivity to vibration and pressure.

Lamellar corpuscles are also found in the pancreas, where they detect vibration and possibly very low frequency sounds. Lamellar corpuscles act as very rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors. Groups of corpuscles respond to pressure changes, e.g. on grasping or releasing an object.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{technique}} of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) {{is commonly used}} to have a peripheral view of the cardiovascular system. To better understand the microvascular perfusion signals, the authors herein propose to analyze and compare the complexity of LDF data recorded simultaneously in <b>glabrous</b> and nonglabrous <b>skin.</b> <b>Glabrous</b> zones are physiologically different from the others partly due to the presence of a high density of arteriovenous anastomoses. Methods: For this purpose, a multifractal analysis based on the partition function and generalized fractal dimensions computation is proposed. The LDF data processed are recorded simultaneously on the right and left forearms and on the right and left hand palms of healthy subjects. The signal processing method is first tested on a multifractal binomial measure. The generalized fractal dimensions of the normalized LDF signals are then estimated. Furthermore, for the first time, the authors estimate the generalized fractal dimensions from a range of scales corresponding to factors influencing the microcirculationflow(cardiac, respiratory, myogenic, neurogenic, and endothelial). Results: Different multifractal behaviors are found between normalized LDF signals recorded in the forearms and in the hand palms of healthy subjects. Thus, the variations in the estimated generalized fractal dimensions of LDF signals recorded in the hand palms are higher than those of LDF signals recorded in the forearms. This shows that LDF signals recorded in glabrous zones may be more complex than those recorded in nonglabrous zones. Furthermore, the results show that the complexity in the hand palms could be more important at scales corresponding to the myogenic control mechanism than at the other studied scales. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the multifractality of the normalized LDF signals is different on <b>glabrous</b> and nonglabrous <b>skin.</b> This difference may rely on the density of arteriovenous anastomoses and differences in nerve supply or biochemical properties. This study provides useful information for an in-depth understanding of LDF data and a more detailed knowledge of the peripheral cardiovascular system...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to introduce Merkel cells (MCs), to provide a basic overview on the theoretical background of function, development and clinical importance of MCs. The origin of human MCs have been controversial. Some investigators {{believe that it is}} a neural crest derivate, whereas others have proposed that it is a differentiation product of the fetal epidermal keratinocytes. MCs are cells primarily localized in the epidermal basal layer of vertebrates and concentrated in touch-sensitive areas in <b>glabrous,</b> hairy <b>skin</b> and in some mucosa. In routine light microscopy, human MCs can hardly be identified. Cytokeratin 20 (CK 20) is a reliable marker with highest degree of specificity. MCs can be also distinguished by electron microscopy.

50|$|The <b>glabrous</b> (hairless) <b>skin</b> on {{the front}} of the hand, the palm, is {{relatively}} thick and can be bent along the hand's flexure lines where the skin is tightly bound to the underlying tissue and bones. Compared to the rest of the body's skin, the hands' palms (as well as the soles of the feet) are usually lighter — and even much lighter in dark-skinned individuals, compared to the other side of the hand. Indeed, genes specifically expressed in the dermis of palmoplantar skin inhibit melanin production and thus the ability to tan, and promote the thickening of the stratum lucidum and stratum corneum layers of the epidermis. All parts of the skin involved in grasping are covered by papillary ridges (fingerprints) acting as friction pads. In contrast, the hairy skin on the dorsal side is thin, soft, and pliable, so that the skin can recoil when the fingers are stretched. On the dorsal side, the skin can be moved across the hand up to 3 cm; an important input the cutaneous mechanoreceptors.|$|R

5000|$|Touch messages, in {{comparison}} to other sensory stimuli, have a large distance to travel {{to get to the}} brain.

[...] Mechanoreceptors are situated in highly vascularized skin, and appear in both <b>glabrous</b> and hairy <b>skin.</b> Each mechanoreceptor is tuned to a different sensitivity, and will fire its action potential only when there is enough energy. [...] The axons of these single tactile receptors will converge into a single nerve trunk, and the signal is then sent to the spinal cord where the message makes its way to the somatosensory systems in the brain.|$|R

Actinidia arguta and A. kolomikta were common, and their habitat ranges overlapped. Actinidia polygama was less common, and its habitat was mostly limited to lowland deciduous forests. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that all wild collections of A. kolomikta and A. polygama were diploid, and that A. arguta was tetraploid, suggesting a lack of intraspecific ploidy variation. Fruit shape varied from round to ovoid in A. arguta, ranged from ovoid to ellipsoidal in A. kolomikta, and was ellipsoidal in A. polygama. The fruit skin of all species was <b>glabrous,</b> and <b>skin</b> color was orange in A. polygama, green to dark green in A. kolomikta, and light to dark green in A. arguta.

40|$|International audienceThe present review focusses on how tactile {{somatosensory}} afference is encoded and processed, and {{how this}} information is interpreted and acted upon in terms of motor control. We relate the fundamental workings of the sensorimotor system to the rehabilitation of amputees using modern prosthetic interventions. Our sense of touch is central to our everyday lives, from allowing us to manipulate objects accurately to giving {{us a sense of}} self-embodiment. There are a variety of specialised cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents, which differ in terms of type and density according to the skin site. In humans, there is a dense innervation of our hands, which is reflected in their vast over-representation in somatosensory and motor cortical areas. We review the accumulated evidence from animal and human studies about the precise interplay between the somatosensory and motor systems, which is highly integrated in many brain areas and often not separable. The <b>glabrous</b> hand <b>skin</b> provides exquisite, discriminative detail about touch, which is useful for refining movements. When these signals are disrupted, such as through injury or amputation, the consequences are considerable. The development of sensory feedback in prosthetics offers a promising avenue for the full integration of a missing body part. Real-time touch feedback from motor intentions aids in grip control and the ability to distinguish different surfaces, even introducing the possibility of pleasure in artificial touch. Thus, our knowledge from fundamental research into sensorimotor interactions should be used to develop more realistic and integrative prostheses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Pain {{is a major}} symptom {{associated}} with chronic inflammation. In previous work from our laboratory, we have shown that in animal models of neuropathic pain there is a sprouting of sympathetic fibers into the upper dermis, a territory normally devoid of them. However, {{it is not known}} whether such sympathetic spouting, which is likely trophic factor mediated, also occurs in chronic inflammation and arthritis. In the present study, we used a rat model of chronic inflammation in which a small single dose of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected subcutaneously, unilaterally, into the plantar surface of the hindpaw. This led to a localized long-term skin inflammation and arthritis in all joints of the hindpaw. Animals were perfused with histological fixatives at 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks after the injection. Experimental animals treated with CFA were compared to saline-injected animals. We then investigated the changes in the pattern of peripheral innervation of the peptidergic nociceptors and sympathetic fibers in rat <b>glabrous</b> hindpaw <b>skin.</b> Antibodies directed towards calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) were used for the staining of peptidergic and sympathetic fibers, respectively. Immunofluorescence was then used to analyze the different nerve fiber populations of the upper dermis. At 4 weeks following CFA treatment, DBH-immunoreactive (IR) fibers were found to sprout into the upper dermis, in a pattern similar to the one we had observed in animals with a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve in a previous publication. There was also {{a significant increase in the}} density of CGRP-IR fibers in the upper dermis in CFA treated animals at 2, 3 and 4 weeks post-injection. The increased peptidergic fiber innervation and the ectopic autonomic fibers found in the upper dermis may have a role in the pain-related behavior displayed by these animals...|$|R

40|$|Currently many thermoregulatory models {{incorporate}} cutaneous perfusion, as {{it plays}} a major role in heat transport. The magnitude of perfusion is generally described as a function of temperature. Some physiological models, such as formulated by Stolwijk, Tanabe and Fiala, incorporate central tonus and local sensitivity explicitly. However, used perfusion control parameters have been estimated and are not based on physiological measurements. Therefore, their applicability might not be justified. In this research a method is proposed to measure central sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone and local cutaneous vasoconstrictor sensitivity. Together, the protocol was performed on males and females, young adults (18 - 28 yr) and elderly (68 - 78 yr) and on both <b>glabrous</b> and non-glabrous <b>skin.</b> Local cutaneous perfusion is measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Through iontophoresis of Bretylium tosylate (10 mM) sympathetic nerve terminals are blocked, such that local endogenous release of sympathetic neurotransmitters is abolished. Afterwards a superphysiological dose noradrenaline (2. 5 mM) is administered through iontophoresis. The reduction in perfusion is used as a measure for vasoconstrictor sensitivity at maximal vasoconstrictor tone. This is repeated over a range of local temperatures. Then the whole body is cooled and the decrease in perfusion at a non-bretylium site is measured. Combining perfusion and local sensitivity, vasoconstrictor tone is described as a function of temperature...|$|R
40|$|Chemotherapeutic-induced {{peripheral}} neuropathy (CIPN) {{is associated with}} a unique stocking-glove distribution of signs and symptoms. CIPN starts with numbness and tingling and proceeds to ongoing pain. The potential impact of target of innervation on CIPN has been largely ignored despite the tremendous heterogeneity among sensory neurons regarding their resting and injury-induced properties. Moreover, there is compelling evidence from other neuropathy models indicating that dysregulation of intracellular Ca 2 + in sensory neurons contributes to the signs and symptoms of the neuropathy. Therefore, the central hypothesis I pursued in this thesis was that both the positive and negative signs of CIPN are due to subpopulation-specific changes in Ca 2 + regulation, which I tested in a paclitaxel-induced {{peripheral neuropathy}} model. Paclitaxel was associated with a persistent decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold in response to stimuli applied to the <b>glabrous</b> hindpaw <b>skin,</b> but not the other areas that were tested. While paclitaxel had no detectable influence on either resting or depolarization-evoked Ca 2 + transients in putative non-nociceptive neurons, there was a significant paclitaxel-induced decrease in the evoked Ca 2 + transient duration in putative nociceptive glabrous neurons, which correlated with the paclitaxel-induced nociceptive behavior. This paclitaxel-induced change in Ca 2 + regulation was not due to increased activity of Na+-Ca 2 +-exchanger (NCX), which contributes to the regulation of evoked Ca 2 + transient durations in this subpopulation of neurons. However, the paclitaxel-induced decrease in the duration of the evoked Ca 2 + transient did appear to be due to both direct and indirect influences of mitochondria. The direct influence reflected an increase in mitochondria volume, enabling an increase in total Ca 2 + uptake, while the indirect influence reflected an increase in the activity of ATP-dependent Ca 2 + regulatory mechanisms, such as the sarco-endoplasmic-reticulum-ATPase (SERCA). The results generated in this dissertation expand the current view of CIPN mechanisms and constitute an important step towards understanding the roles of intracellular Ca 2 + as well as mitochondrial changes to the pain associated with CIPN, paving the road for novel therapeutic strategies to limit the side effects of chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Sensory {{disturbances}} {{are part}} of the clinical picture of Parkinson’s disease. Abnormalities in sensory processing, through a basal ganglia involvement, are thought to be responsible for the sensory dysfunction since sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) is usually normal. However, NCVdoes not examine small fibres or terminal endings of large sensory fibres, whereas skin biopsy is more suitable for these purposes. To evaluate peripheral sensory nerves in Parkinson’s disease, we studied cutaneous free and encapsulated sensory nerve endings in 18 patients and 30 healthy controls using 3 -mm punch biopsies from <b>glabrous</b> and hairy <b>skin.</b> Ten patients had additional skin biopsies from the contralateral side. Further evaluation included NCVand Quantitative Sensory Testing. Parkinson’s disease patients showed a significant increase in tactile and thermal thresholds (P _ 0. 01), a significant reduction in mechanical pain perception (P _ 0. 01) and significant loss of epidermal nerve fibres (ENFs) and Meissner corpuscles (MCs) (P _ 0. 01). In patients with bilateral biopsies, loss of pain perception and ENFs was higher on the more affected side (P _ 0. 01). We found evidence suggesting attempts at counteracting degenerative processes as increased branching, sprouting of nerves and enlargement of the vascular bed. Morphological and functional findings did not correlate with age or disease duration. Disease severity correlated with loss of MCs and reduction in cold perception and pain perception.
