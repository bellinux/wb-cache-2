He chose the squad number 16, due to the fact he often wore it when on international duty, and later claimed he never wanted to leave Liverpool but that the chance to work with André Villas-Boas, with whom he had spent {{a short period of time}} at Porto, was too good an opportunity to turn down.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 2017, {{parent company}} DRB-HICOM {{announced}} plans to sell a 49.9% stake in Proton to Geely Automobile Holdings. Additionally, DRB-HICOM intend to sell a 51% controlling-stake in Lotus to Geely, and the remaining 49% stake to Etika Automotive. The definitive agreement will be signed in July 2017. Proton had owned Lotus since 1996, and largely struggled to turn {{the fortunes of the}} sports car maker around. Nonetheless, in late 2016, Lotus announced their first operating profit in over 40 years.

25|$|Unemployed Arthur {{lives in}} Walford {{with his wife}} Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), their two {{children}} Mark Fowler (David Scarboro and Todd Carty) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and Pauline's mother Lou Beale (Anna Wing). Pauline is pregnant with her third child, and gives birth to a son, Martin Fowler (Jon Peyton Price and James Alexandrou).

Lou dies in 1988. Arthur initially has a distant relationship with Mark and is unable to keep him in check when he turns to crime.|$|E

Specifically, could the Red Cross utilize its monopoly over one jointly produced good (scrubbed plasma) to extend market power to a non-monopolized good (red blood cells) when competing with the Blood Centers of America? The case considers {{the potential for a}} dual monopoly (by <b>the</b> Red Cross <b>in</b> both markets), limit pricing on the part of <b>the</b> Red Cross <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> red blood cells, and a shared <b>market</b> <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> Red Cross is a monopoly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> plasma but competes with the Blood Centers of America <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> red blood cells. ...|$|R
25|$|Scotsman James Stokes {{had arrived}} in Western Australia in 1834 {{at the age of}} 24. He saw the {{opportunity}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brewery, and investigated potential sites. Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe had set aside a small triangular lot for use as a brewery; this block was bounded by Spring Street, Mount Street and St Georges Terrace. Stokes preferred the much larger block across Spring Street, which extended almost {{all the way to the}} riverfront. The site was more suitable because it featured a natural spring, there was a sufficient different in elevation to enable the use of gravity in the brewing process without the need for a large tower. The proximity to the river also made river transport an attractive option. Stokes bought this land from George Leake, and was operating his brewery by 1837. Although the brewery was named the Albion Brewery after the ancient name for Great Britain, it was more popularly known as Stokes' Brewery. It was the colony's first major stand-alone brewery.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{leather shoes}} and boots became {{affordable}} to the masses, and with the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the demand for large numbers of polished army boots led to a need <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> product that would allow boots to be polished quickly, efficiently and easily. [...] The polish was also used to shine leather belts, handgun holsters, and horse tack. This demand led to a rapid increase in the sales of shoe and boot polish. The popularity of Kiwi shoe polish spread throughout the British Commonwealth and the United States. Rival brands began to emerge, including Shinola and Cavalier (United States), Cherry Blossom (United Kingdom), Parwa (India), Jean Bart (France), and many others. Advertising became more prominent; many shoe polish brands used fictional figures or historical characters to spread awareness of their products. [...] In the German documentary of 1927 Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, a scene focuses on shoe shining with a polish called Nigrin sporting the face of a Negro.|$|E

However, he had been attempting to play with a ruptured ligament in his right thumb, which became aggravated, necessitating surgery which ruled him out of United's title run-in, the Champions League Final against Barcelona and England's 2010 World Cup qualifiers in June. Following speculation that United were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new goalkeeper to replace the soon-to-retire Edwin van der Sar, Foster signed a new four-year contract with the club.

The factory used some novel manufacturing techniques, including British ALCAN's [...] "Supral" [...] (a superplastic aluminium alloy), adhesives (to {{reduce the number of}} rivets and mass), and a bespoke new British engine, the Hewland AE75.

[...] Some of these companies sell multiple virtual goods for multiple games, and others sell services for single games. Virtual real estate is earning real world money, with people like 43-year-old Wonder Bread deliveryman, John Dugger, purchasing a virtual real estate for $750, setting him back more than a weeks wages. This virtual property includes nine rooms, three stories, rooftop patio, wall of solid stonework in a prime location, nestled {{at the foot of}} a quiet coastal hillside.

Such trading of real money for virtual goods simply represents the development of virtual economies where people come together where the real and the synthetic worlds are meeting within an economic sphere.|$|E
