However the crash did result in a recurrence of myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) from which he had suffered for 20 years but was then in remission.

40|$|In view of {{developments}} in reproductive medicine, clinical mishaps in this domain {{are beginning to}} give rise to 'injuries' not easily accommodated within the English law of negligence. While 'personal injury' is typically understood as manifesting a deleterious 'physical' dimension, cases involving the negligent destruction of cryopreserved sperm, as recently litigated in Yearworth & Ors v Bristol NNN Trust (2009), and other media reported mishaps in fertility treatment do not straightforwardly possess this quality. Without modification, the traditional tortious conception of 'personal injury' in English law {{will not be able}} to address novel claims. Critically, however, nor do alternative modes of redress seem to offer ease of application. Focusing upon the controversial Yearworth case and exploring what is seen as an unpromising framing of loss, the note argues that there is now an urgent need to rethink what counts as 'personal injury'. Arguing for the formal recognition of'reproductive injury' as an independent <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> in negligence, and illustrating the presence of judicial support for that approach, the comment suggests that in light of the difficult challenges that lie in the wake of Yearworth, such a development may be not only desirable but necessary...|$|E
50|$|In {{certain areas}} of the law another <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> has long been available, whereby the {{defendant}} is made to give up the profits made through the civil wrong in restitution. Doyle and Wright define restitutionary damages as being a monetary remedy that is measured according to the defendant's gain rather than the plaintiff's loss. The plaintiff thereby gains damages which are not measured by reference to any loss sustained. In some areas of the law this <b>heading</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> is uncontroversial; most particularly intellectual property rights and breach of fiduciary relationship.|$|R
40|$|When {{preparing}} neuropsychological expert reports, the neuropsychologist {{is asked}} to make a precise assessment of the victims' cognitive dysfunction, generally after traumatic head injury. The expert is usually required to assess {{the nature of the}} neuropsychological deficits, their correlation with any brain lesions and their imputability to the accident or crime in question, to estimate a possible date of stabilisation and to evaluate the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage.</b> The basic principle of compensation for personal injury is to consider the circumstances in which the victim would have been if the prejudicial event (for example, the accident) had not occurred and to assess, on the basis <b>of</b> these various <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> compensation for the injury suffered. While it is not the neuropsychologist's role to evaluate the compensation as such, he or she has however to specify which aspects of cognitive function are deficient and what impact this dysfunction has on a personal and occupational level. Until recently, compensation for personal injury, and notably for cognitive deficits, was assessed with reference to nine principal <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> in particular the conventional concepts of total temporary disability (incapacite temporaire totale [ITT]), defined as the period during which the victim was temporarily unable to carry out their usual occupational and personal activities, and partial permanent disability (incapacite partielle permanente [IPP]), defined as a percentage and corresponding to the reduction, after stabilisation, in the victim's functional capacity that is, their physical and psychological potential here again from an occupational and personal viewpoint. However, concretely, the emphasis had shifted to take into account only the pecuniary aspects of injury relating to the domain of "having", that is the loss of income due to cessation of work, while the non-pecuniary aspects relating to the domain of "being" were often ignored. New classification. - The Dintilhac report has established a new classification <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> physical <b>damage</b> which abandons these two ambiguous concepts of ITT and IPP. Damage now includes three categories: pecuniary and non-pecuniary; temporary and permanent and damage to direct and indirect victims. We define the new <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to direct victims, illustrate them with examples from neuropsychological expert reports, compare {{the old and the new}} classifications and discuss the implications of the Dintilhac report for expert assessment. The report appears to remove the ambiguities previously mentioned, since ITT has been replaced by two new <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> which are clearly defined as pecuniary and non-pecuniary: "loss of present occupational income" (pertes de gains professionnels actuels [PGPA]) and "temporary functional deficiency" (deficit fonctionnel temporaire [DFT]), respectively. Similarly, IPP is replaced by two new <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> which are also clearly defined as pecuniary and non-pecuniary and are the poststabilisation equivalents of PGDA and DFT: these are "loss of future earnings" (pertes de gains professionnels futurs [PGPF]) and "permanent functional deficiency" (deficit fonctionnel permanent [DFP]). Concerning the other <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage,</b> the amendments introduced by the new classification do not basically modify the earlier concepts but are nevertheless more precise in certain respects. The "pretium doloris", or "price of pain", is replaced by "suffering sustained" (souffrances endurees [SE]) with little fundamental change. The same is true of "loss of amenity" (prejudice d'agrement [PA]). The term of "aesthetic impairment" (prejudice esthetique [PE]) also remains the same, but whereas it previously related only to permanent impairment, it now includes temporary impairment, before stabilisation. What was formerly termed "loss of sexual function" now consists of "loss of sexual function" (prejudice sexuel [PS]) as well as "loss of the prospect of founding a family" (prejudice d'etablissement [PE]), allowing a finer distinction to be made between the damages sustained. The former "third party" (tierce personne) is now covered under the headings of "assistance by a third party" (assistance par tierce personne [ATP]), "expenses of accommodation conversion" (frais de logement adapte [FLA]) and "expenses of vehicle conversion" (frais de vehicule adapte [FVA]), which here again provides greater precision in the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> compensation. Lastly, what was previously known as "loss of opportunity" (perte de chance) is divided into three different categories: "loss of education, whether at school, university or in training" (prejudice scolaire, universitaire ou de formation [PSU]), "loss of future occupational earnings" (perte de gains professionnels futurs [PGPF]) and in part the "occupational impact" (incidence professionnelle [IP]). Conclusion. - In summary, these various <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> concerning direct victims that are proposed by the Dintilhac report result in a more detailed evaluation of compensation for personal injury. Assessment of a certain number <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> is an integral part of the preparation of a neuropsychological expert report and the fact that these <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> are now better defined makes the expert's task easier. As the neuropsychologist, generally called upon to give an expert opinion, now has better knowledge of this new classification, he or she will be able to give clearer and fuller answers to the questions raised and so comply with the principle of civil law relating to compensation for personal injury: "compensate the injury, all the injury, but nothing except the injur...|$|R

40|$|Reform of the {{illegality}} defence in {{tort law}} was {{proposed by the}} Law Commission (England and Wales) in its 2009 Consultative Report on The Illegality Defence and more importantly, the House of Lords weighed in on this debate with its recent landmark rulings in Gray v Thames Trains [2009] 1 AC 1339 and Moore Stephens v Stone Rolls Ltd (in liq) [2009] 1 AC 1391.

40|$|Trade between Britain and China {{is rapidly}} expanding, and {{shipping}} law {{plays an important}} role in facilitating economic activity. This thesis provides an exemplification on the measure <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> in the carriage of goods by sea in both countries. It will help practitioners as well as scholars from both countries to understand the peculiar features and dynamics of the topic in the otherâs shipping laws. The Chinese law <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> and shipping law are not as detailed or as well-structured as its English counterpart. Over the years, some articles in the Chinese Maritime Code (CMC) have been interpreted inconsistently, e. g., art. 55, and there is contradiction among different laws on the said topic, resulting in considerable confusion about the law. Bizarre and arguably unjust applications of legal rules continue to surface in claims for damages. A large number of contradictory decisions have been produced in Chinese shipping cases. Similar <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> are accepted or rejected in a process which at times seems alarmingly random. It is time to revisit the CMC and the law <b>of</b> <b>damages</b> and to urge their reform. England is a well-established centre of shipping litigation and arbitration in the world and its shipping laws are more influential on Chinese maritime courts than those of any other country. Several senior Chinese scholars suggest that English law is the model on which the reformed CMC should be based. This thesis is written with a view to encouraging a revision of the defects in the CMC and to changing aspects of the current Chinese law <b>of</b> <b>damages.</b> It expounds on the English law part, provides a principled explanation for legal rules in cargo claims, reviews relevant Chinese law, makes comparisons between English and Chinese law at length, addresses the problems in Chinese shipping law and seeks a solution. It is hoped that this thesis can provide instructive recommendations to Chinese lawmakers and clarify the chaos inherent in interpreting the relevant law. In a few aspects, Chinese law seems fairer than the English position, which English scholars may find refreshing and enlightening. This thesis also proposes to increase the awareness of national decision-makers, especially the Chinese, of the international tenor of existing and proposed international maritime laws, as well as the concomitant duty to interpret and implement them as such.

40|$|Loss {{of earning}} {{capacity}} {{is a concept}} that is relevant to actions in which a wrongdoer is held liable for the detrimental effect of his actions on a claimantâs capacity to generate an income. Take the example of a claimant who had worked as a shift leader in a mine but after a damage-causing event is only capable of working above ground as a clerk. By comparing his salary pre-morbid with his salary post-morbid, it is possible to calculate the difference. This difference, if the former is the greater, constitutes the damage suffered by the claimant and, as such, the amount constitutes what he can claim as compensation. In an instance where a person is {{not in a position to}} furnish evidence about his earnings pre- and post-morbid, nevertheless, the court may award compensation for the claimantâs loss of earnings. Essentially, the compensation is payment for loss of earning capacity and not for loss of earnings. In making such an award, the court recognises that the claimant experiences a partial or total impairment of his capacity to generate an income. Koch states that in such problematic cases the courts often shy away from quantifying a claimantâs estimated annual income. Instead of employing the sum-formula approach,the courts opt for a general assessment using the âsome-how-or-otherâ approach. What seems at first like a straightforward pre- and post-morbid calculation therefore is fraught with intricate theoretical questions. Although this problem is more evident in cases of unemployed claimants and children, it may also occur in other cases where loss of earning capacity is one <b>of</b> the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>damages.</b> Prof. J.

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} vindicatory damages should be {{available}} in the child welfare tort cases against public authorities.

This thesis argues in support of the availability <b>of</b> a separate <b>head</b> <b>of</b> vindicatory <b>damages</b> in tort law, including negligence, and explores some of the liability issues which arise in these cases, including vicarious liability, liability for omissions and liability in negligence for the way in which a statutory power is exercised or for a breach of a statutory duty.

50|$|This was so too for John Ogilby in {{the context}} of the troubled history of 17th century England. The only member on view in Wenceslas Hollar's {{illustration}} of the fable (see above) is the broken <b>head</b> <b>of</b> a statue <b>damaged</b> by the blind, sword-wielding belly. The reference to the Parliamentary beheading of King Charles I and the breakdown of government during the subsequent republican period could not be clearer. At the start of the 19th century, La Fontaine's English translator, John Matthews, was to expand the fable to even greater length. Beginning with the Roman context, he pictures the social strife in more or less contemporary terms and so hints that the fable supports the power of the aristocratic parliament of his day without needing to say so outright.|$|R
50|$|Deba bÅchÅ (åºååä¸, literally: pointed carving knife) are Japanese style kitchen carvers {{primarily}} used to cut fish, though {{also used}} when cutting meat. They come in different sizes, sometimes up to 30 cm (12 inches) in length. The deba bÅchÅ first {{appeared during the}} Edo period in Sakai. It is designed to behead and fillet fish. Its thickness, and often a more obtuse angle {{on the back of}} the heel allow it to cut off the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> fish without <b>damage.</b> The rest <b>of</b> the blade is then used to ride against the fish bones, separating the fillet. Traditionally, these are made of carbon steel, which needs regular maintenance and oiling to prevent rust. However, many modern knives are also available as stainless steel, which may be dishwasher safe. The carbon steel blades, however, can be sharpened into a sharper cutting edge.|$|R

A specific type of mannequin was placed vicinity to dipole emitter {{in order to measure}} Electromagnetic (EM) emission effects <b>of</b> human <b>head,</b> radiation pattern and EM energy. Generally, assessment of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value is taken from numerical analysis and experimental measurement. This study evaluated RF emission energy including scattering and power absorption of Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) by environmental measurement. In order to simplify computational complication, the uniform Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) tissue was used in this paper for assessment of RF radiation energy. The concept of Poynting vector is applied to derivate the level <b>of</b> human <b>head</b> <b>damage</b> <b>of</b> RF radiation energy. The method is proved to be a valuable way...|$|R
