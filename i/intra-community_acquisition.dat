But if the recipient of the services is not a taxable person (i.e. a final consumer), the supplier must generally charge VAT at the rate applicable in its own member state.|$|R

40|$|Romania's {{accession}} to the European Union has required {{significant changes in}} many fields of activity, thefield of taxation {{is one of the}} most affected as taxation is fully harmonized with the European laws after January 1, 2007. Therefore, the export and import concepts disappeared in the relationship between the Member States, beingreplaced by new concepts such as <b>intra-Community</b> <b>acquisition</b> (instead of import) and intra-Community supply(instead of export). Given the intra-Community commercial transactions and hence their taxation, in this article I intend toaddress the tax treatment of non-transfers. I started from the fact that that the proper determination of tax treatments specific to intra-Communitycommercial transactions is of particular importance in establishing the reporting and payment obligations concerningthe value added tax for entities from different EU Member States, significantly affecting the registration procedure inaccounting of such transactions. To clarify the tax issues in terms of value added tax, I found it necessary, after identifying the operationsconsidered as non-transfers, to answer several questions based on which the tax treatment of such operations will bedetermined, questions that relate to the taxable person, taxable operation, the place of acquisition, the exemption or notof the operation and the obligation to pay VAT. For this I took into account several specific situations that arise in trade relations between EU Member Stateswhich fall within non-transfers, examples that allowed some conclusions to be drawn on the tax issues arising in intra-Community trade relations...|$|E

40|$|With {{a view to}} our country's {{accession}} to the Community space, the Romanian legislation has undergone many changes, and {{we should point out}} among others those in the tax system, that primarily aims to ensure the functioning of the national economy in the globalization of the economic and social activities worldwide. Although at first sight the new procedures {{have a positive impact on}} the development of intra-Community commercial businesses, due to the elimination of customs formalities and hence of the fees paid to customs officials, however there are costs generated by the application of EU law, which should not be neglected.

Since the accession date, the legislation in the VAT field is repealed and replaced with the legislation harmonized with the Community acquis. The elimination of customs barriers between the 27 Member States of the European Union brings news as concerns the application of the "reverse charge" procedure that is applied in Romania as from the year 2005 for residue transactions and transactions with ferrous and non-ferrous metal waste, with grounds or buildings or building parts or living animals among VAT payers. Thus, starting with 1 January 2007, the reverse charge is binding and applicable to all <b>intra-Community</b> <b>acquisitions.</b> At the same time the reverse charge was also applied for imports until 15 April 2007. In this paper I shall present aspects concerning the history of reverse charge in our country, accounting of operations and advantages and disadvantages of application of this procedure in the context of accession to the European Union. ...|$|R
