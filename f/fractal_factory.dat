40|$|European {{industries}} are facing massive challenges from global competitors such as USA and Japan. Optimization of production processes, especially their informational aspects, {{is becoming a}} crucial part in this race. The optimization is best based on cooperation and standards, such as provided e. g. by KCIM of DIN. EXPRIT/CIME is contributing to increased cooperation among European individuals and companies, {{while at the same}} time supporting the implementation of standardization results. Future challenges for Europe will not be overcome by copying foreign concepts, but only through development of new approaches such as the <b>Fractal</b> <b>Factory</b> of the European Engineering Community...|$|E
40|$|European {{industry}} has {{to recognize that}} its lead in the world market has been caught up with, particulary through Asian competition. High deficits in costs and productivity exist due to rigid, Tayloristic structures. Companies cannot react flexibly to changing conditions. "Fractal factory" methods necessary to solve the structure crisis are illustrated. The <b>fractal</b> <b>factory</b> possesses dynamism and vitality, and can react independently to changing circumstances. The methods and conditions such as structuring, human networking, hierarchy formation and models for remuneration and working time are explained, based on IPA's work with the automobile industry, their suppliers and the engineering industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{marginal}} {{restrictions on}} manufacturing have changed considerably, {{especially during the}} past five years. In order to be successful, today's business have to stand up to turbulent market conditions in which large and frequent fluctuations in sales and demand lead to higher pressure in competition and price determination. Many tactics have been applied to prepare companies for these challenges. Some firms have introduced a cost reduction scheme or have been through one or more re-engineering programmes. Successful companies have made initial steps towards finding and introducting new organistaional structures. The inception of the <b>fractal</b> <b>factory</b> has been proved to be a very successful policy. In the <b>fractal</b> <b>factory</b> the role of each worker has been newly defined. Fractals are created to provide each worker with a wider scope of responsibility and duties in a less hierarchical organisation. Through a target system, a framework is given in which each fractal and each worker is able to organise himself/herself with more autonomy. In order to aid the application of the fractal principle the Fraunhofer IPA has developed the IPA Business Took-kit, an object-oriented method, which enables the user to carry out coordinated modelling, planning, simulation, optimization and realization. The operational potential of this system includes the following: - The presentation of technical methods, business processes and other organizational events supporting the fractal structure. By visualizing existing structures and building up on them using simulation, it is possible to create new forms of fractals optimized to suit the planned situation. - The compilation of product and software specifications required for the project on hand. Assuming that a system expansion or a new software development has already been decided upon, it is then possible to initiate the software engineering process with this toolkit. The formation of generic masks and the direct derivation from the source co de is also feasible...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} are found increasingly under international competitive pressure. In {{order to achieve}} long-term success, companies must {{have the ability to}} adapt dynamically, both by leaps and bounds through innovation as well as through continuous improvement processes. Because companies structured according to the principles of Taylorism do not have the necessary dynamics, IPA has designed the concept of the "fractal factory" for their restructuring. As an instrument for the transformation of the conceptual rudiments of the <b>fractal</b> <b>factory,</b> operational navigation was developed for the company and its staff. Operational navigation aims at the initiation, control and coordination of a continuous improvement process in its entirety. A satisfactory result with the continuous improvement process can only be achieved if it sets the right goals for the staff. Benchmarking supplies the strategic goal standards for navigation. Benchmarking and operational navigation are two parallel pr ocesses which correlate closely through a constant exchange of information...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work reported in this thesis offers a novel basis for the realisation of specifications for information requirements to meet the distinct operational requirements of metalworking SMEs. This has been achieved {{through the development of}} a reference SME enterprise model based on fundamental ideas of the holon and <b>fractal</b> <b>factory</b> concepts. The novel concept of a node holon is introduced, which allows the representation of the human dominated interactions in a company based on the fundamental concepts of the holon. This offers a competitive alternative to the methods for enterprise modelling and information specification which are based solely around business processes and procedural rules. A new representation for the organisation of the SME has been based on identifying the major zones of activity within the enterprise, which is seen to provide a more appropriate representation for companies whose basis for operation is informally structured. Two classes of zones have been identified, these are the business support zone and manufacturing zone. The relationship between a top down description of the enterprise as zones and the complementary bottoms up modelling of the enterprise based on concepts of the node holon are described in detail. A critical study of two candidate modelling architectures, namely CIN 40 SA and ARIS will show the applicability of the individual architectures for the task information specification. The constituents of the SMEE enterprise reference model is placed within the context of contemporary enterprise modelling practice by mapping against one of the architectures. This will demonstrate how the architectures can readily accommodate new modelling approaches whilst retaining their major advantages, thereby increasing their applicability and potential uptake. The reference SME enterprise model has been readily applied in the study of an SME, where a representation of the company has been achieved solely on the current organisation of its business support and manufacturing activities. The holonic aspects of the enterprise have also been successfully modelled. This process is supported by a CASE tool which has it constructs underpinned by the reference SME enterprise model...|$|E
