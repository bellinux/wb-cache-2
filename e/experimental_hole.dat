40|$|The hole {{transport}} {{in various}} poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivatives {{has been investigated}} in field-effect transistors (FETs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{as a function of}} temperature and applied bias. The discrepancy between the <b>experimental</b> <b>hole</b> mobilities extracted from FETs and LEDs based on a single disordered polymeric semiconductor originates from the strong dependence of the hole mobility on the charge carrier density. The microscopic charge transport parameters are directly related to the chemical composition of the analysed polymers. By chemically modifying the PPV, the hole mobility in both FETs and LEDs can be changed by orders of magnitude. For highly disordered PPVs it is demonstrated that the exponential density of states (DOS), which is used to describe the charge transport in FETs, is a good approximation of the tail states of the Gaussian DOS, which describes the charge transport in LEDs. Increase of the directional order in the PPV film enhances the mobility but also induces a strong anisotropy in the charge transport, thereby obscuring a direct comparison between sandwich and field-effect devices.

40|$|It was {{recently}} {{demonstrated that the}} hopping mobility in disordered organic semiconductors depends both on the charge carrier concentration and on the density of states but their relative influence is still an open question. The mobility is almost constant below a certain concentration and increases at large concentration where the density of states is conventionally assumed exponential. Hence the <b>experimental</b> <b>hole</b> mobility in polymer FETs {{is at least one}} order of magnitude larger than the hole mobility in LEDs based on the same materials. In order to investigate this issue, the mobility of disordered organic semiconductors is calculated by numerically solving the variable range hopping (VRH) equations {{in a wide range of}} carrier concentrations ranging from low concentrations, typical of hole-only diodes, to high concentrations, typical of field effect transistors. The exact mobility is numerically calculated for various density of states (DOS) and it is compared with the experimental data in order to investigate the dependence of the hole mobility on the DOS. Our calculations show that the strong dependence of the hole mobility on the charge carrier density is strictly correlated to the shape of the DOS and that a single gaussian, in general does not explain the mobility behavior in the whole range of concentrations; depending on the material, it could be accurately approximated by a single gaussian, an exponential, or by a combination of both functions...|$|E
40|$|The optical {{conductivity}} of the CuO_ 3 -chains, a subsystem of the 1 - 2 - 3 materials, {{is dominated}} by a broad peak in the mid-infrared (ω≈ 0. 2 eV), and a slowly falling high-frequency tail. The 1 D t-J-model is proposed as the relevant low-energy Hamiltonian describing the intrinsic electronic structure of the CuO_ 3 -chains. However, due to charge-spin decoupling, this model alone cannot reproduce the observed. We consider two additional scattering mechanisms: (i) Disregarding the not so crucial spin degrees of freedom, the inclusion of strong potential disorder yields excellent agreement with experiment, but suffers from the unreasonable value of the disorder strength necessary for the fit. (ii) Moderately strong polaronic electron-phonon coupling to the mode involving Cu(1) -O(4) stretching, can be modeled within a 1 D Holstein Hamiltonian of spinless fermions. Using a variational approximation for the phonon Hilbert space, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian exactly on finite lattices. As {{a result of the}} <b>experimental</b> <b>hole</b> density ≈ 1 / 2, the chains can exhibit strong charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations, driven by phonon-mediated polaron-polaron interactions. In the vicinity of half filling, charge motion is identified as arising from moving domain walls, defects in the CDW. Incorporating the effect of vacancy disorder by choosing open boundary conditions, good agreement with the experimental spectra is found.

The experiments measured the time response with a thrust and torque sensor, data acquisition system and CNC drilling machine. The research was used to locate points of interest among the previous statistical setup.

40|$|ObjectiveChronic ischemic mitral {{regurgitation}} {{is associated}} with mitral annular dilatation in the septal-lateral dimension and flattening of the annular 3 -dimensional saddle shape. To examine whether these perturbations are caused by the ischemic insult, mitral regurgitation, or both, we investigated the effects of pure mitral regurgitation (low pressure volume overload) on annular geometry and shape. MethodsEight radiopaque markers were sutured evenly around the mitral annulus in sheep randomized to control (CTRL, n = 8) or <b>experimental</b> (<b>HOLE,</b> n = 12) groups. In HOLE, a 3. 5 - to 4. 8 -mm hole was punched in the posterior leaflet to generate pure mitral regurgitation. Four-dimensional marker coordinates were obtained radiographically 1 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Mitral annular area, annular septal-lateral and commissure–commissure dimensions, and annular height were calculated every 16. 7 ms. ResultsMitral regurgitation grade was 0. 4 ± 0. 4 in CTRL and 3. 0 ± 0. 8 in HOLE (P <. 001) at 12 weeks. End-diastolic left ventricular volume index was greater in HOLE at both 1 and 12 weeks; end-systolic volume index was larger in HOLE at 12 weeks. Mitral annular area increased in HOLE predominantly in the commissure–commissure dimension, with no difference in annular height between HOLE versus CTRL at 1 or 12 weeks, respectively. ConclusionIn contrast with annular septal-lateral dilatation and flattening of the annular saddle shape observed with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation, pure mitral regurgitation was associated with commissure–commissure dimension annular dilatation and no change in annular shape. Thus, infarction is a more important determinant of septal-lateral dilatation and annular shape than mitral regurgitation, which reinforces the need for disease-specific designs of annuloplasty rings...|$|E
40|$|Using hybrid density {{functional}} theory, {{we address}} point defects susceptible to cause charge compensation upon Mg doping of GaN. We determine the free energy of {{formation of the}} nitrogen vacancy and of several Mg-related defects. The entropic contribution {{as a function of}} temperature is determined within the quasiharmonic approximation. We find that the Mg interstitial shows a noticeably lower free energy of formation than the Mg substitutional to Ga in p-type conditions. Therefore, the Mg impurity is amphoteric behaving like an acceptor when substitutional to Ga and like a double donor when accommodated in an interstitial position. The hybrid-functional results are then linked to experimental observations by solving the charge neutrality equations for semiconductor dominated by impurities. We show that a thermodynamic equilibrium model is unable to account for the <b>experimental</b> <b>hole</b> concentration as a function of Mg doping density, due to nitrogen vacancies and Mg interstitials acting as compensating donors. To explain the experimental result, which includes a dropoff of the hole concentration at high Mg densities, we thus resort to nonequilibrium models. We show that either nitrogen vacancies or Mg interstitials could be at the origin of the self-compensation mechanism. However, only the model based on interstitial Mg donors provides a natural mechanism to account for the sudden appearance of self-compensation. Indeed, the amphoteric nature of the Mg impurity leads to Fermi-level pinning and accounts for the observed dropoff of the hole concentration of GaN samples at high Mg doping. Our work suggests that current limitations in p-type doping of GaN could be overcome by extrinsically controlling the Fermi energy during growth...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study low {{dimensional}} hole systems fabricated on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures without any modulation dopants. The electrical transports of holes in two dimensions (2 D), one dimension (1 D) and zero dimension (0 D) are studied. Two types of {{field effect transistor}}s are fabricated and studied. The first type is a semiconductor insulator semiconductor field effect transistor (SISFET) in which 1 D hole wires and a hole quantum dot are studied. The second type is a metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor (MISFET) in which devices {{with the ability to}} switch the type of charge carriers in the conduction channel between electrons and holes are fabricated (ambipolar devices). The 1 D hole wires are fabricated on the crystal plane of (100). The 1 D hole wires show strong Zeeman splitting when the in-plane magnetic field is applied parallel to the 1 D wires, and very small Zeeman splitting when the in-plane magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the 1 D wires, regardless of the crystallographic orientation ([011] or [011 &# 773;]). This effect is different compared to 1 D hole wires fabricated on the crystal plane of (311) A, where there is an interplay between anisotropies due to the low crystal symmetry and 1 D confinement resulting in different Zeeman splitting measured in wires oriented in different crystallographic orientations. We then move onto the fabrication and study of a single hole transistor in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. The Coulomb blockade oscillations resulting from single hole charges tunnelling on/off the quantum dot are observed and we also measure the charging energy of the quantum dot with source-drain bias spectroscopy. The quantum dot is found to be more stable and has less electrical noise compared to a single electron transistor fabricated on silicon, and compares favourably with an electron quantum dot fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure with modulation dopants. We also fabricated the first ambipolar devices on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure with the MISFET design and characterised these devices at low temperatures. Firstly the charge transport of electrons and holes are compared directly in a 2 D ambipolar device by measuring the density dependence of the carrier mobility. It is observed that the electron mobility can be modelled with charge scattering theories taking into account background impurity scattering, interface roughness scattering and screening. However, when the same fitting parameters are used to model the hole mobility by switching the effective mass of electrons to holes, the theory cannot fit the <b>experimental</b> <b>hole</b> mobility. Several possibilities for the deviation of the calculations are discussed but further experimental and theoretical works need to be conducted {{in order to determine the}} exact cause for this deviation.

40|$|Maternal {{reproductive}} strategies should {{optimize the}} quality and quantity of surviving offspring. In Megaloprepus caerulatus, a damselfly that exhibits male-biased size dimorphism, larval siblicide, and a disproportionate fitness advantage from large sons, mothers lay many more eggs in water-filled tree holes than can survive to emergence. Using field experiments, I tested the siblicide advantage of excess offspring (i. e., faster development and/or larger survivors) in small and large holes and 2 alternative functions of excess offspring (predator satiation and insurance against nonpredator mortality). In small pots, the sole siblicidal survivors emerged larger than noncannibals but no sooner. However, doubling or even quadrupling a modest clutch of 25 failed to produce larger offspring. In large tubs, the size advantage that survivors gained from siblicide was constrained by a trade-off between offspring size and number. A clutch of 20 produced half as many but larger offspring than one of 100. When multiple females contributed eggs to a large nursery, size of survivors was independent of the mother's clutch size. Finally, large clutches failed to satiate dragonfly predators, and although 25 neonates were better than 2 as insurance against nonpredator mortality, a clutch of 50 provided no additional benefit. In natural and <b>experimental</b> <b>holes,</b> survivorship was female biased, suggesting that sons suffered greater mortality than daughters. Because mothers seemed unable to adaptively bias offspring sex ratio, excess offspring may compensate for the lower survivorship of sons, particularly in large nurseries where males garner a disproportionate size advantage relative to females.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{experimental}} work has uncovered {{some of the}} genetic components required to maintain the Arabidopsis thaliana root stem cell niche (SCN) and its structure. Two main pathways are involved. One pathway depends on the genes SHORTROOT and SCARECROW and the other depends on the PLETHORA genes, which have been proposed to constitute the auxin readouts. Recent evidence suggests that a regulatory circuit, composed of WOX 5 and CLE 40, also contributes to the SCN maintenance. Yet, {{we still do not}} understand how the niche is dynamically maintained and patterned or if the uncovered molecular components are sufficient to recover the observed gene expression configurations that characterize the cell types within the root SCN. Mathematical and computational tools have proven useful in understanding the dynamics of cell differentiation. Hence, to further explore root SCN patterning, we integrated available experimental data into dynamic Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) models and addressed if these are sufficient to attain observed gene expression configurations in the root SCN in a robust and autonomous manner. Results We found that an SCN GRN model based only on experimental data did not reproduce the configurations observed within the root SCN. We developed several alternative GRN models that recover these expected stable gene configurations. Such models incorporate a few additional components and interactions in addition to those that have been uncovered. The recovered configurations are stable to perturbations, and the models are able to recover the observed gene expression profiles of almost all the mutants described so far. However, the robustness of the postulated GRNs is not as high as that of other previously studied networks. Conclusions These models are the first published approximations for a dynamic mechanism of the A. thaliana root SCN cellular pattering. Our model is useful to formally show that the data now available are not sufficient to fully reproduce root SCN organization and genetic profiles. We then highlight some <b>experimental</b> <b>holes</b> that remain to be studied and postulate some novel gene interactions. Finally, we suggest the existence of a generic dynamical motif that can be involved in both plant and animal SCN maintenance. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{a summary of}} the physics design work {{performed}} on the Engineering Test Reactor. The ETR presents computational difficulties not found in other reactors because of the large number of <b>experimental</b> <b>holes</b> in the core. The physics of the ETR depends strongly upon the contents of the in-core experimental facilities. In order to properly evaluate the reactor&#x 27; taking into account the experiments in the core, multi-region, two-dimensional calculations are required. These calculations require. the use of a large computer such as the Remington Rand Univac and are complex and expensive enough to warrant a five-stage program: 1. In the early stages of design, only preliminary two-dimensional calculations were performed. in order to obtain a rough idea of the general behavior of the reactor and its critical mass with tentative experiments in place. 2. A large amount of work was carried out in which the reactor was approximated as one with a uniform homogeneous core. With this model, detailed studies were carried out to investigate the feasibility and to obtain general design data on such points as the design and properties of the gray and black �control rods, the design of the beryllium reflector, gamma and neutron heating, the use of burnable poisons, etc. In performing these calculations, use was made of the IBM 650 PROD code obtained from KAPL. 3. With stages 1 and 2 carried out, two-dimensional calculations of the core at start-up conditions were performed on the Univac computer. 4. Detailed two-dimensional calculations of the properties of the ETR with a proposed first set of experiments in place were carried out. 5. A series of nuclear tests were performed at the reactivity measurements facility at the MTR site in order to confirm the validity of the analytical techniques in physics analysis. In performing the two-dimensional Univac calculations, the MUG code developed by KAPL and the Cuthill code developed at the David Taylor Model Basin were utilized. In order to reduce as much as possible the cost of the physics analysis and in order to obtain information otherwise unavailable, considerable use was made of perturbation techniques. These perturbation computations were initially performed using the one-dimensional approximation and were extended to two dimensions in stages 3 and 4. To do this a method of obtaining adjoint fluxes; using available reactor computer codes, was developed. Only the physics which bears on the final design of the ETR is summarized.

Shive is best known for inventing the phototransistor in 1948 (a device that combines the sensitivity to light of a photodiode and the current gain of a transistor), and for the Shive wave machine in 1959 (an educational apparatus used to illustrate wave motion).|$|R
40|$|We use a surface-enhanced {{infrared}} absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy, a useful sensing and surface analysis method complimentary to the Raman scattering spectroscopy, {{for the individual}} enhancement of specific molecular vibration bands and fingerprinting of molecular vibrations. SEIRA spectroscopic measurement using the metal hole array (MHA) is demonstrated with high spectral selectivity. The molecular IR absorption peaks are enhanced up to 10 times at the transmission peak of MHA structure when electromagnetic field enhancement is localized on the walls inside the <b>holes.</b> <b>Experimental</b> and numerical simulations results are in a good qualitative agreement. Selective IR band enhancement {{can be used for}} identification of specific molecules within complex mixtures and it can be extended to the longer wavelengths at THz molecular bands.

40|$|Time-resolved Kerr {{rotation}} measurement in the (Ga,Mn) As diluted {{magnetic semiconductor}} allows direct {{observation of the}} dynamical properties of the spin system of the magnetic ions and the spin-polarized <b>holes.</b> <b>Experimental</b> {{results show that the}} magnetic ions can be aligned by the polarized holes, and the time scales of spin alignment and relaxation take place in tens and hundreds of picoseconds, respectively. The Larmor frequency and effective g factor obtained in the Voigt geometry show an unusual temperature dependence {{in the vicinity of the}} Curie temperature due to the exchange coupling between the photoexcited holes and magnetic ions. Such a spin coherent precession can be amplified or destructed by two sequential excitation pulses with circularly copolarized or oppositely polarized helicity, respectively.
