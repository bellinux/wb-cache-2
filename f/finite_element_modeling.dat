40|$|One of {{the main}} problems, which solved during the design of {{transport}} category aircraft, is problem of analysis of the stress distribution in the strengthened fuselage frames structure. Existing integral methods of stress analysis {{does not allow for}} the mutual influence of the deformation {{of a large number of}} elements. The most effective method of solving the problem of analysis of deformations influence on the stress distribution of structure is <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> method, which is a universal method for analyzing stress distribution arbitrary constructions. This article describes the features of the <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> synthesis of the strengthened fuselage frames structure of the aircraft fuselage transport category. It is shown that the <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> of strengthened frames can be synthesized by attaching additional <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> of the reinforcing elements to the base <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> which is built by algorithm which is developed for normal frame. For each reinforcing element developed a separate class of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> synthesis algorithm. The method of synthesis of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> of strengthened frame, which are described in this article, developed for object-oriented information technology implemented in an object-oriented data management system "SPACE". Finite-element models of the reinforcing elements are included in the <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> of the fuselage box after the formation of a regular <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> of the fuselage box. As the source data for the synthesis of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> of the reinforcing elements used the coordinates of the boundary sections nodes of existing <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> of conventional frames. Reinforcing elements belong to the group of irregular structural elements that connect regular elements of the cross set with different elements that are not intended for the perception and transmission of loads. The only exceptions are the vertical amplification increasing the stiffness of frames in a direction parallel to the axis OY. Source data input for the synthesis of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> of the reinforcing elements can occur only through the individual user interfaces that supported by objects of the corresponding classes. Structure of user interfaces depends on the number and type of additional data that required for the synthesis of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> of the reinforcing elements. For example, for the synthesis of structures of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> of horizontal beams that support the floor of cargo cabin, you must specify the distance between the upper surface of the beam and the horizontal axis of the fuselage, as well as the height of the beam section. For the synthesis of the structure of the <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> of vertical reinforcing element is enough to specify the distance between the its inner belt and the a vertical axis of symmetry of the fuselage. And in both cases you must to specify a reference to the basic <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model,</b> by selecting from a list of frame designations. List of frames, as well as links to objects containing the appropriate finite-element models, must be transmitted from an object which references to the level of decomposition, in which the general model of the fuselage box is created. Finite-element models of the reinforcing elements include two groups of nodes. The first group is taken from an array of nodes, which is transmitted from the base <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model.</b> The second group is formed by the synthesis algorithm of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> of the selected class reinforcing element. Therefore, the synthesis of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>models</b> of the reinforcing elements starts with the formation of their local model versions. On the basis of these models are formed temporary copies, which are transmitted to the general <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> of the box. This should be considered when developing of data conversion algorithm of data copying from a local <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>model</b> to the temporary copy. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that this method improves the quality of the design of the aircraft fuselage, increasing the amount of structure variant number and reduce the likelihood of errors. ??????????? ????? ??????? ????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????, ????? ????????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????. ?????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????????? ? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ????? ???????? ????? ?????? ??????? ????????...|$|R

50|$|Heaton is {{particularly}} interested in understanding the origins of spatially heterogeneous slip in earthquakes. There is compelling evidence that slip in earthquakes and stress in the earth’s crust are spatially heterogeneous, and perhaps fractal.

One of the approaches is the 3D <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>modeling</b> for regions in the crust with ruptures occurring on fault planes controlled by dynamic friction and looking for conditions that are required to sustain the observed heterogeneous characteristics of stress and slip in cycles of earthquakes.

Smith, they generated those fractal stress tensors and used them to produce catalogs of earthquake locations and focal mechanisms. They could explain several field observations with this model. Also the model predicts that the strength of the crust should be a scale dependent property, a topic which is currently being further investigated in Heaton's group.|$|E

NTSB review of the cockpit voice recorder records, and post-incident interviews, showed that the flight crew acted appropriately {{in response to the}} emergency.

The aircraft was delivered to Southwest Airlines in June 1994, and {{at the time of the}} accident flight, had accumulated approximately 42,500 takeoff/landing cycles, and 50,500 airframe hours. Highly magnified inspections found that a long metal fatigue crack had developed at the boundary of two different manufacturing processes used by Boeing in creating the fuselage crown skin assembly. Boeing <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> <b>modeling</b> had suggested that stress forces in this boundary region are higher due to differences in stiffness, indicating that a failure was more likely to occur in this area after a certain number of pressurization-depressurization cycles.
