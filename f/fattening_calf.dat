40|$|Integration {{of cattle}} and palm fruit (SISKA) has known as {{programme}} to improve cattle production and population in indonesia. Palm fruit plantation not only provide area for cattle to wander but also provide feeds as forage and stem-midrib of palm. However, this system seem fails {{to meet their}} objections. There are very few palm fruit plantation in indonesia aplied this system volunterilly. Main reason for that were technical and management problems. This study will explore problems and answer related to application of integration of cattle and palm fruit plantation, and also aplied the systems in <b>fattening</b> <b>calf</b> program using palm fruit by products. Tweenty steers with average of body weight 153 + 5, 3 kg were grouped into two groups. Each group consists of 10 BX steers. Control group were given forages while treatment group has feed ration consists of stem-midrib of palm, CPO sludge and salt. Each rations were formulated to have same dry matter percentage. They were treated 2 month. Observed parameters were dry matter consumption, dry matter digestibility, average daily gain and body condition score. The result shows {{that there were no}} significant result on dry matter digestibility, dry matter consumption (P> 0, 05). However, treatment group has better average daily gain and body condition score. Key Word : integration, cattle,palm fruit...|$|E

40|$|About 80 % of Albanian {{small scale}} farms farming 1 - 2 dairy cows. The small {{agriculture}} land surface on farm property (1 - 1, 5 ha) {{is the main}} limiting factor for cow’s number increasing. So the farmer interest is not to {{increasing the number of}} cows in their farm but to <b>fattening</b> of <b>calf’s</b> born both for nutritive need of the family and market. The main objective {{of the study was to}} show the effect of industrial crosses (F 1) of Holstein Frison cows with meat breeds like as Piementese(P), Limousine(L), Kianina(C), Sharole(Sh) and Markixhana(M) on meat production increasing on small scale farms. To carried out this objective, two study methods were used: (i) The survey - 284 small scale farms was observed in the Albanian coastal field and (ii) Comparative essay of fattening calves (F 1) in semi intensive small scale farm condition - 32 calves, F 1 crosses of Holstein cows with above mentioned meat breeds were put in fattening in semi intensive small scale farm condition. 6 Holstein breed (H) calves of 3 - 4 months age was used as control group. The feeding of animals was based on forages produced in farm: corn silage 30 % D. M, fresh alpha-alpha and its hay. 35 % of dry matter requirements were supplied by bought concentrate feedstuffs with 15 % crude protein on dry matter bases. The fattening period lasted 8 months. The average daily body weight increasing for each crosses and control group were respectively 889 g (PxH), 998 g (LxH), 850 g (KxH), 1010 g(ChxH), 953 g (MxH) and 702 g (HxH). Multivariate analyses according to a linear model with constant factors (genotype, sex, genotype x sex) and covariance “live body weight in the beginning of experiment” showed that: (i) The effect of crossbreds on average daily gain is evident under the small-scale farms conditions, also, (ii) The average daily gain increases with 23 - 38 %, depending on the type of crosses, (iii) The crosses of dairy cattle with Limousine and Sharole result as most effective. The differences between F 1 crosses of Markigiana, Kianine and Piemonteze are not statistically significant, (iv) In semi intensive small scale farms the <b>calf</b> <b>fattening</b> can start from second month of life, (v) The farmers even though small scale farm condition can produce more meat though the crossing of dairy cattle with meat breeds in comparison with pure dairy breed calves...|$|R
40|$|Dairy farms produce {{significant}} {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) emissions {{and are therefore}} a focal point for GHG-mitigation practices. To develop viable mitigation options, we need robust (insensitive to changes in model parameters and assumptions) predictions of GHG emissions. To this end, we developed a stochastic model to estimate the robustness of predictions based on input parameters (GHG emission factors and production traits) and their uncertainties. In our study we explored how sensitive predictions of GHG emissions are to three factors: (1) system boundaries of the emission model (2) the uncertainty of input parameters due to quality of data or methodological choices (epistemic uncertainty) and (3) inherent variability in input parameters (variability uncertainty). To assess the effect of system boundaries, we compared two different boundaries: the “dairy farm gate” boundary (all GHG emissions are allocated to milk) and “system expansion” (the model gives a GHG credit to beef derived from culled cows and bull, heifer and <b>calf</b> <b>fattening</b> of surplus dairy calves outside the farm). Results using the farm-gate boundary provide guidance to dairy farmers to reduce GHG emissions of milk production. The results using system expansion are important for defining GHG abatement policies for milk and beef production. We found that the choice of system boundary had the strongest impact on the level and variation of predicted GHG emissions. Model predictions were least robust for lower-yielding dairy cow production systems and when we used system expansion. We also explored which GHG-abatement strategies have the most leverage by assessing the influence of each input parameter on model predictions. Predicted GHG emissions were least sensitive to variability-related uncertainty in production traits (i. e. replacement rate, calving interval). Lower-yielding production systems had the highest variation, indicating the highest potential for GHG mitigation of all production systems studied. Variation in predicted GHG emissions increased substantially when both epistemic and variability uncertainty in emission factors and variability uncertainty in production traits were included in the model. If the system boundary was set at the farm gate, the emission factor of N 2 O from nitrogen input into the soil had the highest impact on variation in predicted GHG emissions. This variation stems from uncertainties in predicting N 2 O emissions (epistemic uncertainty) but also from inherent variability of N 2 O emissions over time and space. The uncertainty of predicted GHG emissions can be reduced by increasing the precision in predicting N 2 O emissions. However, this additional information does not reduce GHG emissions itself. Knowing site specific variability of N 2 O emissions can help reduce GHG emissions by specific management (e. g. reduce soil compaction, adopted manure management, choice of suitable crops). In case of system expansion, uncertainty in GHG emission credit for dairy beef contributed the most to increasing the variation in predicted GHG emissions. The stochastic-model approach gave important insights into the robustness of model outcomes, which is crucial in the search for cost-effective GHG-abatement options. Despite the high degree of uncertainty when using system expansion, its results help identifying global GHG mitigation options of combined milk and beef productio...|$|R
