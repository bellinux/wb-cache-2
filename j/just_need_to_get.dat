In the networks that use MAC address based filtering approach to authenticate the clients, the spoofer <b>just</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a valid MAC address that belong to some authorized client in the network in order to gain an illegitimate advantage. Approach: In this article, it has proposed an algorithm that uses an additional authentication process beside MAC address filtering and periodically re-authenticates the client after sending every specific number of Data frames. The proposed additional authentication process is based on two parts. First: Using unique information that belongs to every client in the network such as computer name, CPU ID and the current time as inputs to a hash function (one-way function), then insert the hash value in the slack fields of the header of the frame (Steganography). Second: Make a modification to the access point access control list by adding that unique information belong to each client in addition to its MAC address in the access control list. Thus, when the AP receives an Authentication frame from a client, it will first check the MAC address, if it is legal; the AP will re-compute the Hash value depending on the corresponding identifiers stored in the access control list an...|$|R
