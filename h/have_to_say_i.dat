500|$|One of {{the reasons}} cited for Henry's {{impressive}} play up front {{is his ability to}} calmly score from one-on-ones. According to his father Antoine, Henry picked up his precision shooting from watching his idol Marco van Basten. He was also influenced by Romário, Ronaldo and African star George Weah, a new breed of strikers in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal. At his physical peak from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Henry's ability to dribble past opponents with exceptional pace, skill and composure, meant that he could get in behind defenders regularly enough to score. In 2004, former Arsenal striker Alan Smith commented on Henry: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> haven't seen a player like him. He's an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a perfect four-star rating, calling it [...] "the most cheerfully exciting, bizarre, goofy, romantic {{adventure}} movie since Raiders, {{and it is}} high praise to say that it's {{not so much a}} sequel as an equal. It's quite an experience." [...] Vincent Canby felt the film was [...] "too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. They just went on and on and on, which is what Temple of Doom does with humor and technical invention." [...] Neal Gabler commented that [...] "I think in some ways, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. In some ways it was less. In sum total, I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> enjoyed it more. That doesn't mean it's better necessarily, but I got more enjoyment out of it." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun." [...] Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, claimed it was [...] "one of the most sheerly pleasurable physical comedies ever made." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as a [...] "slow-starting adventure romp with much ingenuity and too much brutality and horror." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the UNICEF charity record [...] was released; it is a {{collection}} of seventeen eclectic remixes of [...] "Army of Me". All profits went directly to the charity, to assist the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Live at Shepherds Bush Empire was released as a VHS in November, 1998, containing the last performance of the Post Tour, which took place at Shepherds Bush Empire in February 1997. Post Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box. The 2002 box set Family Tree includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. Post has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set Surrounded, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of Debut and Post together as one compilation [...] In 2008, when asked how she felt about the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: [...] "I listened to [...] when we did the surround mixes of it like {{two or three years ago}} and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well. I was very aware of it at the time that I needed to be musically promiscuous and have almost every song [...] different mood/style and so on." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 14, Specter {{reported}} he {{had raised}} $1.8 {{million during the}} previous three-month period, bringing his total to about $8.7 million. The Senator {{said that he was}} aided in large part by his September 15 fundraiser hosted by Obama. In that same period, Sestak raised only $758,000, about a quarter million dollars lower than the previous quarter, making his total allocation about $4.7 million. Sestak continued working hard to overcome his name recognition problem, seldom turning down interview requests and asking his staff to work six 12-hour days a week. As a result, Sestak saw a large amount of turnover in his staff, going through nearly half a dozen press secretaries and several chiefs of staff. Sestak called on Specter participate in six debates, one for each media market in Pennsylvania, but Specter only agreed to participate in one because that was the amount of debates he participated in as a Republican. On December 7, Sestak was endorsed by Congressman Barney Frank, who said that he was impressed by Sestak's leadership on economic and military issues, as well as his positions against the military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy and the Defense of Marriage Act. The endorsement was important to Sestak {{because it was the first}} time a prominent member of Congress broke with the Democratic establishment to back him over Specter. Frank also said of Specter's switching parties, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> don't think it did our profession any good for someone to announce that he switched parties purely so he could survive." ...|$|E
500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, in my judgment, balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But I regret to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> cannot say the same about the wife's evidence. Having watched and listened to her give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain {{she must have been}} under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as I find them do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw a pitcher of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy {{but it sounds like}} it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown" [...] {{achieved}} great success, {{reaching the}} No. 1 {{position on the}} Billboard Hot 100. [...] "Time in a Bottle" [...] went from a relatively unknown album cut to a posthumous No. 1 after the boost it received from being featured in the ABC TV-movie She Lives. His fifth album, I Got a Name, was released in December 1973 and reached the No. 2 position in both the United States and Canada. This album would feature the title song [...] "I Got a Name", [...] "I'll <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Love You in a Song", and [...] "Workin' at the Car Wash Blues". The song, [...] "I Got a Name" [...] had been released as a single during Croce's lifetime, but [...] "I'll <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> <b>I</b> Love You in a Song" [...] became a posthumous number one release when it reached the top position on Billboard Adult Contemporary Singles in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|Neill {{starred in}} the {{historical}} drama The Tudors, playing Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> really enjoyed making The Tudors", Neill said, [...] "It was six months with a character that I found immensely intriguing, with a cast that I liked very much and with a story I found very compelling. It has elements {{that are hard to}} beat: revenge and betrayal, lust and treason, all the things that make for good stories." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Blogcritics, Barbara Bennett praised {{the changes in}} the storyline and unique twists in this episode and the {{upcoming}} season: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> really loved the way series creators Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis have merged bits of Arthurian legend into the Once Upon a Time landscape. From the Sword in the Stone to the introduction of Arthur and Lancelot, I think this just might work–and be far more integrated into the series narrative than Frozen had been. And for that I cheer!!" ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} reasons Pirès gave for leaving Arsenal was that he felt he was no longer a first choice under manager Arsène Wenger. Pirès was quoted saying: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> have had some disappointments this season. For instance, I was on the bench very often". Pirès {{additionally}} suggested that Wenger's decision to withdraw him in the UEFA Champions League Final showed he had slipped in the eyes of his French boss. Pirès said that he felt hurt by how Wenger did not trust him anymore, which was a major factor that convinced him {{that it was time to}} move on from Arsenal.|$|E
2500|$|The No. 88, {{according}} to NASCAR archives, {{was driven by}} Ralph Earnhardt, his paternal grandfather, in 1957. His maternal grandfather, Robert Gee, {{was one of the}} first employees of All Star Racing, initially a Late Model Sportsman (now Xfinity Series) team with Gee as Hendrick's partner, which is now Hendrick Motorsports. Hendrick said about Earnhardt and his uncles, [...] "I can look at Robert Gee Jr., or Jimmy Gee, or Dale Jr., and all I see is Robert Gee. They're the spitting image of him. I go back and look and pictures from when we did things together, and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> owe Robert a lot." [...] Starting in the 2008 season, Hendrick Motorsports merged its Nationwide Series team to Earnhardt's JR Motorsports, with the cars coming from Earnhardt's shop, which employs his mother and uncles.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson's third studio album, My December, was {{released}} on June 22, 2007. The album relied on darker themes and features a heavier rock sound. Clarkson replaced Davis as the executive producer and co-wrote all the tracks. She opted to collaborate with her band members rather than her previous producers and collaborators. Its production and release became a subject of a dispute with RCA, particularly with Davis. He noted the album's lack of professional production input and wanted her to re-record tracks with a more mainstream appeal, which she refused. Clarkson defended, [...] "I've sold more than 15 million records worldwide, and still nobody listens to what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't give a crap about being a star. I've always just wanted to sing and write." [...] The album received positive response, but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss Kwatinetz and Live Nation to cancel its accompanying tour, the My December Tour, and reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting acts Jon McLaughlin, Sean Kingston and Mandy Moore. Clarkson later hired the services of talent manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Management. Blackstock was the husband of country artist Reba McEntire, of whom Clarkson is a close friend. Clarkson later issued an apology to Davis, citing him as [...] "a key advisor" [...] in her success.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{controversy}} artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: [...] "As the guy who recorded the record I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> found your attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all." [...] Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that [...] "It sucks that Mr. Hale’s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can’t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to your initial actions." [...] Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that [...] "Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums. It's not just about the commerce; {{there are many people who}} work on an album like this one, it is fair for people to at least be compensated for the time they took away from other jobs, families and friends in order to put together an album for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{striking}} exterior {{design of}} A, which designer Starck had likened to being [...] "more {{like a fish}} than a building", polarized opinions from the outset. Jonathan Beckett, chief executive of London yacht brokers Burgess, was initially skeptical, but changed his mind after seeing the boat in person in the Caribbean: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> was impressed. It's a very exciting boat to watch. It's simply unlike anything that's ever been done before." [...] David Pelly of Boat International was also enamoured, saying she was [...] "...the most extraordinary yacht launched in recent memory. It is stunning." [...] And writing about the world's biggest mega yachts in the New York Times in 2011, Nazanin Lankarini argued that A was [...] "even more desirable than her larger sisters by virtue of lines reminiscent of a nuclear submarine". A {{was one of the}} featured vessels in the 2011 edition of The Superyachts, where she was described as [...] "bold and eccentric."By contrast, Power & Motoryacht magazine columnist Diane Byrne opined that [...] "overall she does not float my boat (sorry, kids, couldn’t resist), but I do quite like the inverted bow design", while Donald Starkey, a British yacht designer, commented that A [...] "...is aggressive, like a giant finger pointing at you. It seems to {{have nothing to do with}} the whole idea of yachting, which is about cruising around at a leisurely pace, and enjoying your friends and the sea". Maritime commentator Peter Mello was even more scathing in his assessment, deriding her as [...] "one of the most hideous vessels ever to sail the seas". The Wall Street Journals Robert Frank was initially also an outspoken critic, calling A [...] "one of the ghastliest megayachts ever created" [...] and [...] "more like a cruiser for Darth Vader's navy than a family pleasure boat for the Mediterranean" [...] when she was launched. However, in a follow-up blog several months later, he confessed: [...] "I've gained a bit more respect for it. Technically, it's impressive: Because of her inverted bow, the boat barely makes a splash in the front when it's speeding along at 24knots. And it's different in a way few yachts are...So even though I still think it's a monster, A gets a tip of the hat for taking a risk and being different".|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
