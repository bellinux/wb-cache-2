40|$|A {{navigation}} {{experiment was}} performed which establishes Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) frequency stabilized one way return link Doppler TDRSS tracking data as a feasible option for mission orbit determination support at the <b>Goddard</b> <b>Space</b> Center <b>Flight</b> Dynamics Facility. The {{study was conducted}} using both one way and two way Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) tracking measurements for the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) spacecraft. Tracking data for a 4 week period immediately follow the depletion of the helium supply was used. The study showed that, for both definitive orbit solution and short term orbit prediction (up to 4 weeks), orbit determination results based on one way return link Doppler tracking measurements are comparable to orbit determination results based on two way range and two way Doppler tracking measurements...|$|R
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2010, our team {{developed}} a thermoelectric cooler control system {{as part of the}} University of Maryland-Baltimore County and <b>Goddard</b> NASA <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center Radiation and Climate Branch Cloud CubeSat Project. Our control system was built for Dr. Vanderlei Martins of the University of Maryland-Baltimore County Physics Department. We implemented a unity gain, closed-loop feedback system that read from a temperature-measuring sub-system. The system was controlled by a combination of an integrator and gain compensation and included a current amplifier to drive the thermoelectric cooler. We used a less powerful thermoelectric cooler than the Marlow device housed on the Cloud CubeSat and a less accurate thermistor (rated for 1 % error) to read the temperature of the cold plate of the cooler. The thermoelectric cooler reached the set-point temperature voltage corresponding to- 30 ◦C in approximately 50 seconds. To our best knowledge–limited by the accuracy of our measuring devices–we achieved a steady-state error within ± 0. 1 K. We included a manual outlining the suggested changes to adjust our control system to the Marlow thermoelectric cooler...|$|R
40|$|A short {{overview}} {{is presented}} on low cost attitude sensors developed by Applied Research Corporation. More or less existing {{technology has been}} used, but major emphasis was directed to considerably {{reduce the cost of}} these units without compromising their quality and reliability. Horizon and sun aspect sensors have been developed and manufactured. They were successfully flown on the space shuttle Atlantis (STS 34, October 18, 1989). We have further manufactured 10 horizon sensors and 15 sun aspect sensors and delivered them to <b>Goddard</b> (Wallops) <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center for future use on sounding rockets. The angular errors are about ± 0. 12 ̆ 2 to 0. 22 ̆ 2 for the horizon and sun aspect sensors. Their mass is about 0. 3 to 0. 8 kg and their power requirement about 0. 1 to 1. 5 W. We have recently won a contract with Goddard to develop a low cost star tracker with an angular error of about ± 5 sec of arc. Our plan is to produce a protoflight unit of such a sensor in about 24 months. Some details of the results obtained from the shuttle flight and some system details will be presented...|$|R

40|$|Between 25 and 27 December 1999 {{two very}} intense cyclones, named Lothar and Martin, swept across {{northern}} and western France causing substantial life and property loss. In this work, the finite volume general circulation model and data assimilation system (fvDAS) {{developed at the}} Data Assimilation Office of the NASA <b>Goddard</b> <b>Space</b> and <b>Flight</b> Center {{is being used to}} investigate these storms.

Cloud-track winds provided by EUMETSAT and surface winds from QuikSCAT are being used. These data are assimilated with a range of different parameter settings of the forecast error covariance model. The results show that generally the additional wind data set have positive impacts on the analyses: particularly, the analysis of Lothar can be slightly improved by using the Eumetsat winds, and the analysis of Martin can be strongly improved by using the full-resolution QuikSCAT winds with a more localized influence. The third part of this article is focused on the forecast of Lothar which is very well predicted in the 1 - 5 day range by the fvDAS system...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand in solar and astrophysics for high resolution X-ray spectroscopic imaging. Such observations would present ground breaking opportunities to study the poorly understood high energy processes {{in our solar system}} and beyond, such as solar flares, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei. However, such observations require a new breed of solid state detectors sensitive to high energy X-rays with fine independent pixels to sub-sample the point spread function (PSF) of the X-ray optics. For solar observations in particular, they must also be capable of handling very high count rates as photon fluxes from solar flares often cause pile up and saturation in present generation detectors. The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) has recently developed a new cadmium telluride (CdTe) detector system, called HEXITEC (High Energy X-ray Imaging Technology). It is an 80 x 80 array of 250 micron independent pixels sensitive in the 2 - 200 keV band and capable of a high full frame read out rate of 10 kHz. HEXITEC provides the smallest independently read out CdTe pixels currently available, and are well matched to the few arcsecond PSF produced by current and next generation hard X-ray focusing optics. NASA's <b>Goddard</b> and Marshall <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Centers are collaborating with RAL to develop these detectors for use on future space borne hard X-ray focusing telescopes. We show the latest results on HEXITEC's imaging capability, energy resolution, high read out rate, and reveal it to be ideal for such future instruments...|$|R

5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the <b>Goddard</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E

5|$|On February 21, 2007, NASA and Nature {{released}} {{news that}} HD 209458 b {{was one of}} the first two extrasolar planets to have their spectra directly observed, the other one being HD 189733 b. This was long seen as the first mechanism by which extrasolar but non-sentient life forms could be searched for, by way of influence on a planet's atmosphere. A group of investigators led by Jeremy Richardson of NASA's <b>Goddard</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center spectrally measured HD 209458 b's atmosphere in the range of 7.5 to 13.2 micrometres. The results defied theoretical expectations in several ways. The spectrum had been predicted to have a peak at 10 micrometres which would have indicated water vapor in the atmosphere, but such a peak was absent, indicating no detectable water vapor. Another unpredicted peak was observed at 9.65 micrometres, which the investigators attributed to clouds of silicate dust, a phenomenon not previously observed. Another unpredicted peak occurred at 7.78 micrometres, for which the investigators did not have an explanation. A separate team led by Mark Swain of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reanalyzed the Richardson et al. data, and had not yet published their results when the Richardson et al. article came out, but made similar findings.|$|E

5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at <b>Goddard</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E
5|$|The mission's second spacewalk officially {{began at}} 12:49 UTC, and the pair {{set to work}} {{removing}} and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the guide pins, and they could not seat it into the equipment bay. Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into {{the third and final}} bay, but the unit again would not seat properly, and they were unable to install it. Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The spare unit was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical issues, and the other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at <b>Goddard</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests.|$|E
