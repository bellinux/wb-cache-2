The concept of maintaining an <b>equipotential</b> <b>line</b> along the bobbin and quiet node connections are justified by analysis.

40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the behavior of}} the height distributions of the equipotential lines in a region confined by two interfaces: a cathode with an irregular interface and a distant flat anode. Both boundaries, which are maintained at distinct and constant potential values, are assumed to be conductors. The morphology of the cathode interface results from the deposit of 2 × 10 ^ 4 monolayers that are produced using a single competitive growth model based on the rules of the Restricted Solid on Solid and Ballistic Deposition models, both of which belong to the Kadar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. At each time step, these rules are selected with probability p and q = 1 - p. For several irregular profiles that depend on p, a family of equipotential lines is evaluated. The lines are characterized by the skewness and kurtosis of the height distribution. The results indicate that the skewness of the <b>equipotential</b> <b>line</b> increases when they approach the flat anode, and this increase has a non-trivial convergence to a delta distribution that characterizes the <b>equipotential</b> <b>line</b> in a uniform electric field. The morphology of the equipotential lines is discussed; the discussion emphasizes their features for different ranges of p that correspond to positive, null and negative values of the coefficient of the non-linear term in the KPZ equation.

The experiment is done by using a silver pen for creating the conductor. On a carbon sheet two circles which have the same centre but different radius are drawn with silver pen. The <b>equipotential</b> <b>lines</b> between these circles are drawn and the electric field lines are drawn according to <b>equipotential</b> <b>lines.</b> The method is easy to apply. In this experiment, as much data as possible must be collected, because the deviations can be unexpectedly high. So to find the approximate result, the number of data must be very high. Using 4 different voltage values (40 V, 30 V, 20 V, 10 V) about 600 data is collected. The test results show that except some data the values are mostly close to each other. That means proper <b>equipotential</b> <b>lines</b> are drawn. Since the electric field lines are drawn according to <b>equipotential</b> <b>lines,</b> the electric field lines could be drawn.

In many power-supply designs, a variety of noise suppression schemes must be implemented in order to meet EMI requirements.

In this paper, a transformer construction technique is proposed that effectively reduces the CM noise current injecting across the isolated primary and secondary windings.

In semantic field, the equipotential lines present a natural nesting structure.

The roughness of the <b>equipotential</b> <b>lines</b> reflects the roughness of the profile, and causes a rapid variation in the electric field close to the surface. An ideal situation was considered, where a well known self-affine profile mimics the surface, while the <b>equipotential</b> <b>lines</b> are numerically evaluated using Liebmann's method. The use of an exact scale invariant profile helps to understand the dependency of the line roughness exponent α (ℓ) on both the value of the potential (or on the average distance to the profile) and the profile's length. Results clearly support previous indications that: (a) for a system of fixed size, higher values of α characterize less corrugated lines far away from the profile; (b) for a fixed value of the potential, α decreases with the length of the profile towards the value of the boundary. This suggests that, for a system of infinite size, all <b>equipotential</b> <b>lines</b> share the same value of α...|$|R

Then, due to the Lorentz force, the Hall current appears along the <b>equipotential</b> <b>line.</b> Introducing a local current operator {{at the edge of}} the potential, we derive the Hall conductance as a linear response coefficient. For a wide class of the models, we prove that if there exists a spectral gap above the degenerate ground state, then the Hall conductance of the ground state is fractionally quantized without averaging over the fluxes. This is an extension of the topological argument for the integrally quantized Hall conductance in noninteracting fermion systems on lattices. Comment: 52 pages. no figur...|$|E

A two-dimensional traffic flow model and a comprehensive evaluation model based on mechanical model and psychological field are established. The traffic flow model is simulated by creating coordinate system. We first establish queue theory model to analyze vehicles when entering toll plaza. Then, a two-dimensional steadily car-following model is established based on psychological field for the analysis of vehicles when leaving toll plaza. According to psychological field theory, we analyze the force condition of each vehicle. The force of each vehicle is contributed by the vehicles in its observation area and obstacles. By projecting these vehicles and obstacles via the <b>equipotential</b> <b>line</b> in the psychological field, {{the influence}} on the value and direction acceleration of following vehicles is obtained. Consequently, the changes of each vehicle's speed and position are obtained as well. Next, we establish simulation based on the states of vehicles and make the rules of vehicle state-changing. By simulating the system, we obtain the throughput of the toll plaza's input and output. Then we obtained the bearing pressure on the road by the max throughput and the demand of the roads. Using the number of cars in per unit area as the safety factor. Then a comprehensive evaluation model is established based on bearing pressure on the road, cost and safety factor.
