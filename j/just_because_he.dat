However, Goebbels acceded to Harlan's insistence on rewriting the script and Harlan spent from November 1939 to March 1940 revising the script although he kept much of what Metzger and Möller had written.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E

25|$|Zarifopol endures in {{cultural}} memory as an eccentric—not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> tackled and derided the literary establishment, {{but also because}} he refused to publish most of his work in book form, or take up employment in academia. Having lost a considerable fortune, he lived withdrawn from the public eye, surviving on his revenues as a literary columnist, mostly for Ibrăileanu's Viața Românească. Shortly before his death, he set up his own successful magazine, Revista Fundațiilor Regale. In such venues, Zarifopol defended his cosmopolitan philosophy against other philologists, but also against the emerging neotraditionalists at Gândirea journal. Zarifopol viewed modern traditionalism as a fabrication and, with his essays, came out as a non-traditionalist and anti-totalitarian conservative thinker.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

500|$|Asked in July 2006 {{what she}} hoped for Kyla {{in the long}} run, Ayola responded: [...] "Most of all I’d {{like to see her}} laugh, big belly laughs as she has not done much of that! ...I also would like her to find a man that she is with not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is {{attractive}} but someone who can work her out and understand her". [...] Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." [...] The two ultimately left Holby together, moving to Ghana.|$|E
500|$|The third quatrain {{continues}} {{the metaphor of}} the nightingale and seasonal imagery to further stress that the poet's silence is not because their love is less pleasant. The nightingale is used as a metaphor to explain that <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> doesn't flatter the Fair Youth, doesn't mean that he loves less. As one scholar put it, [...] "too much praise ceases to please". The poet explains his silence further in line 11, that the wild birds physically burden the tree branches as well as crowd the air with their songs. This may represent the myriad of love sonnets being published in attempt to flatter and please their muses. A similar interpretation of line 12 by Katherine Duncan-Jones is given, in which she claims that the poet is addressing the many circulating love sonnets as somewhat redundant, describes them as [...] "pleasures which have become familiar are no longer intensely enjoyable". This is a usage of another common proverb; [...] "Too much familiarity breeds contempt." ...|$|E
500|$|Bradley {{develops}} {{a theory about}} Hamlet's moral agony relating to a conflict between [...] "traditional" [...] and [...] "critical" [...] conscience: [...] "The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly {{that he ought to}} avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by cowardice or sloth or passion or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has this nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him". The opening words of Shakespeare's Sonnet 94 ("They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none") have been admired as a description of conscience. So has John Donne's commencement of his poem : [...] "Let man's soul be a sphere, and then, in this, Th' intelligence that moves, devotion is;" ...|$|E

500|$|Barker {{began using}} the {{pseudonym}} Gerald Wiley when writing sketches because he wished the pieces {{to be accepted}} on merit and not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he,</b> as a star of the programme, had written them; he continued this tradition with the material he wrote later in his career. Barker brought his sketches in, claiming they had come from Wiley through Barker's agent Peter Eade, {{and they were very}} well received. To maintain the deception, Barker had criticised material he himself had submitted under the pseudonym; when a Wiley-credited sketch about a ventriloquist had been poorly received by the audience Barker told Corbett [...] "Well, Gerald Wiley let us down there", and on another occasion, when looking at a script, [...] "I don't understand this line. What's he getting at?" [...] One of the first sketches he wrote was called [...] "Doctor's Waiting Room", with the main part written for Corbett. Barker encouraged Corbett to buy the rights to the sketch and, further maintaining the myth, told him to reject Wiley's 'request' for £3,000 as too expensive, before giving Corbett the sketch for free. Speculation began about Wiley's identity, with Tom Stoppard, Frank Muir, Alan Bennett and Noël Coward all rumoured. After the second series of Frost on Sunday, the cast and crew were invited to a Chinese restaurant, while Wiley said that he would reveal himself. Barker, who had told Corbett earlier in the day, stood up and announced he was Wiley, although initially nobody believed him.|$|E

According to historian Z. Ornea, Negulescu stood further apart from Maiorescu not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> questioned the more detailed aspects of his agenda, but also {{because he was a}} moderate, whereas Dragomirescu was a man of [...] "rigid convictions" [...] and [...] "systematic dogmatism".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century Marcel Duchamp {{exhibited}} a urinal as a sculpture. His {{point was to}} have people look at the urinal {{as if it were}} a work of art <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as [...] "Readymades". The Fountain was a urinal signed with the pseudonym R. Mutt, which shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp's other works are generally labelled as Dada. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art. Some critics question calling Duchamp—whose obsession with paradox is well known—postmodernist on the grounds he eschews any specific medium, since paradox is not medium-specific, although it arose first in Manet's paintings.|$|E

His policy of radical moralization of public life, {{based on the idea that}} Sicily needed to present itself with 'the papers in order', had upset the system of public procurement, with stunning moves, never seen before in the Island". Judge Giancarlo Caselli, Chief Prosecutor in Palermo for many years, described Mattarella as [...] "a honest and courageous Christian democrat, killed <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was honest and courageous".|$|E
