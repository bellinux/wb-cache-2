In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even <b>destroyed.</b> <b>His</b> defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E

5|$|A {{speculator}} to {{his very}} core, Little never put away {{any of his}} fortune {{to prepare for a}} rainy day; any money he made on the stock market, he immediately invested back into it. Thus when the Panic of 1857 <b>destroyed</b> <b>his</b> investment fortune, Little was left penniless. He would live out {{the rest of his life}} under the wing of his last protége, David Groesbeck. Little was only ever able to make small trading returns to the market in his later years, and the magnitude of his fall was often the target of mockery from his former peers. He died a broken man. Little died on March 28, 1865, and his funeral was held on March 31 at New York's Grace Church. His pall-bearers included Jesse Hoyt and Edward Prime; Reverend Thomas House Taylor officiated at his funeral.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Kemp's {{endorsement}} {{was highly}} coveted. Forbes {{had tried to}} get Kemp {{to run in the}} 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had <b>destroyed</b> <b>his</b> own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E
5|$|Graf saw {{his first}} {{aircraft}} {{when he was}} twelve years old. This sight created a conflict between his passion for football and a new obsession with flying. From 1930, {{he worked at the}} Engen town hall and saved all his money to buy a glider. Before his 20th birthday, he provided a homemade glider to the new Engen Sailplane Club. Every Sunday he would go out to the nearby Ballenberg mountain until a heavy crash <b>destroyed</b> <b>his</b> glider in the fall of 1932. In 1935, after Adolf Hitler officially revoked the Treaty of Versailles, Graf applied for flight training in the newly created Luftwaffe.|$|E
