The level of skin protection afforded by five creams was tested using a panel of 5 volunteers. A fluorescent tracer was used as the test substance. The difference in skin protection between the five products was evaluated. Our findings suggest that Hands First Barrier Cream was the most protective of the four barrier cream products tested in this study, covering between 9 - 11 % more of the participant’s hands than the three other BCs tested. However, the control emollient cream seemed to perform better than the barrier creams tested. Given the small difference in protective ratings between the Hands First Cream and the other BCs and the small sample size of this study there is some degree of uncertainty and the results should be interpreted with care.

40|$|During hair {{coloring}} {{a number}} of disulfi de bonds in cystine are oxidized (1) to create cysteic acid, forming binding sites for metal ions such as Ca 2 + and Cu 2 + from tap water (2). The increased uptake of these metals can have a detrimental impact on fi ber properties—for example, reducing shine and causing a poor wet and <b>dry</b> <b>feel</b> (3). In addition, the increased uptake of copper can also contribute to further fi ber damage during subse-quent coloring due to its ability {{to take part in}} metal-induced radical chemistry (4). It is important to know where in the fi bers these metals are located in order to either effectively remove these metals or control their chemistry. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) has been used to locate the calcium and copper within hair that has been treated with a colorant and washed multiple times in tap water containing these ions. Untreated hair is used as a baseline standard material. Images with up to 50 -nm spatial resolution of the preferential locations of calcium uptake were obtained, showing a high concentration of calcium in the cuticle region of colored hair, specifi cally in the sulfur-rich regions (A-layer and exocuticle) ...|$|E

40|$|An acidophilic {{xylanase}} of Aureobasidium pullulans (XAPI) was recombinantly produced, characterised and its functionality in bread making {{compared with}} that of Bacillus subtilis Xyn A xylanase (XBS), an enzyme frequently used in bread making. Prominent characteristics of XAPI were its high specific activity towards arabinoxylan (AX), its relative preference for hydrolysis of water-unextractable AX (WU-AX), its optimal activity under acidic conditions and its sensitivity towards TAXI (Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor) and XIP (xylanase inhibiting protein). Optimally developed dough containing XAPI had a considerably <b>drier</b> <b>feel</b> after mixing and was less sticky after fermentation than dough treated with XBS. Both xylanases improved bread loaf volume by 24 % under the conditions of the process. In spite of the higher dosage of XAPI necessary to obtain this result, the similar loaf volume increase coincided with less solubilisation of WU-AX and even lesser degradation of solubilised AX (S-AX) and water-extractable AX (WE-AX) by XAPI than by XBS during the bread making process. This is probably due to different dynamics and extent of xylanase inhibition in the dough matrix for both xylanases. AX solubilisation by the acidophilic XAPI was not boosted by the drop in pH in the dough during fermentation. Results show that significant bread loaf volume increase {{goes hand in hand with}} excellent dough properties when a limited solubilisation of WU-AX during mixing is coupled to retention of a high molecular mass of S-AX and WE-AX during the rest of the process.

This {{process can be}} sensitive to noise, especially at high sampling rates. In audio-haptic acoustic simulations, often characterized by friction-induced, relaxation-type stick-slip oscillations, this gives a gritty, <b>dry</b> haptic <b>feel</b> and a raspy, unnatural sound.

In an effort to compare fairly, each of thirteen methods considered {{in the present study was}} automatically optimized and evaluated; finally a subset of these were compared subjectively. Results suggest that no one method is ideal for all gain levels, though the best general performance was found by using a sliding-mode differentiator as input to a Kalman integrator. An additional conclusion is that estimators do not approach the quality available in physical velocity transduction, and therefore such sensors should be considered in haptic device design.

With sugar bloom, the droplet quickly flattens and spreads, as the water dissolves the microscopic sugar particles on the surface (Seguine, 2001). Alternatively, gentle warming of the surface (with a hairdryer, for example) will cause the crystals of fat bloom to melt, removing the appearance of bloom, while leaving sugar bloom unchanged.|$|R

They usually appear as thick, scaly, or crusty areas that often <b>feel</b> <b>dry</b> or rough. In fact, AKs are often felt before they are seen, and the texture is often compared to sandpaper.

They often appear on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, forearms, or lips. Because they are related to sun-damage on the skin, most people who have an AK have more than one. Often, large areas of sun-exposed skin are diagnosed with a continuum of multiple clinically visible AKs of different sizes and severities, typically accompanied by subclinical lesions that become apparent only in biopsies. This concept of a skin area showing multiple AKs is termed field cancerization.|$|R

50|$|Qanats used in {{conjunction}} with a wind tower can provide cooling as well as a water supply. A wind tower is a chimney-like structure positioned above the house; of its four openings, the one opposite the wind direction is opened to move air out of the house. Incoming air is pulled from a qanat below the house. The air flow across the vertical shaft opening creates a lower pressure (see Bernoulli effect) and draws cool air up from the qanat tunnel, mixing with it. The air from the qanat is drawn into the tunnel at some distance away and is cooled both by contact with the cool tunnel walls/water and by the transfer of latent heat of evaporation as water evaporates into the air stream. In dry desert climates this can result in a greater than 15 °C reduction in the air temperature coming from the qanat; the mixed air still <b>feels</b> <b>dry,</b> so the basement is cool and only comfortably moist (not damp).

Research on students’ alienation due to technology alienation is rarely found, or done in the aspect of students’ readiness for e-learning. But this sort of alienation indeed exists.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Producing a plant protein preparation comprises: introducing a protein-containing plant raw material for extraction of proteins in an aqueous extraction medium having a salt content, to obtain a salt containing plant protein solution; precipitation of proteins from the salt containing plant protein solution by lowering the temperature and/or ionic strength of the plant protein solution; and removing the precipitated proteins as protein-rich moist mass from the aqueous extraction medium, where the plant protein solution before or after the step of precipitation of proteins or the protein-rich mass before or after its introduction into the food and prior to completion of the food is heated to greater than or equal to 45 degrees C and held at that temperature for a time period, where the time period and the temperature are chosen in such a way that the application and processing properties of the protein-rich mass are not altered by these steps. USE - The plant protein preparation is useful as an ingredient for foodstuffs. ADVANTAGE - The plant protein preparation: causes a lower proportion of undesirable off-flavors on heating of the foodstuff in which it is processed; provides improved texture to foods with improved organoleptic properties. The use of plant proteins in foods provides good eco-efficiency and has low manufacturing cost with the elimination of the drying process. The protein preparations added to foods as functional ingredients have health-promoting effects. The moist protein mass can be incorporated into a pasty or viscous form, e. g. as a replacement of fat in various foods. The food will thus have nutritional benefits with a soft, creamy texture including consistency and homogeneity without creating a <b>dry</b> rough <b>feel.</b> The plant protein preparation has decreased viscosity, which facilitates mixing with the recipe ingredients...|$|R
