The film stars Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson, Jake Lacy, and Kyle Chandler.

5|$|In 1973 the LPO {{was caught}} up in a {{recurring}} phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge. On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, {{the club}} {{decided that it}} would build a new 2,400-seat stand on the eastern long side. A low {{construction}} cost was secured because the construction industry was <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> slump. The costs were covered by NOK2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK2 million in loan, which was planned to be repaid through increased sponsor and ticket revenues from increased attendance. The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. The boxes and the vestibule became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} {{communities were}} unable to access produce {{that the majority of}} Britain would such as peppers or aubergines. Artisan Welsh produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and Welsh wine was of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical Welsh foods were <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, Welsh organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear in supermarkets. Other modern Welsh characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering salty butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E

5|$|Spider-Man Unlimited is {{an endless}} runner {{game in which}} Spider-Man runs across New York rooftops, {{including}} that of the Oscorp building, as well as Sinister Six spaceships and a giant Doctor Octopus machine, as he dodges obstacles, defeats enemies, and collect power-ups and vials. Regular enemies are defeated by slide attacks and punches, while bosses requires the player to fling projectiles at them. Players earn combos by overthrowing enemies; almost hitting an obstacle or <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> ring also increases the player's combo count. Sections in which Spider-Man swings through streets, climbs the sides of buildings and free-falls from buildings are interspersed with the running portions of the game.|$|E
