5|$|The small {{geographic}} {{ranges of}} the sea otter populations in California, Washington, and British Columbia mean a single major spill could be catastrophic for that state or province. Prevention of oil spills and preparation to rescue otters if one <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> a major focus for conservation efforts. Increasing the size and range of sea otter populations would also {{reduce the risk of}} an oil spill wiping out a population. However, because of the species' reputation for depleting shellfish resources, advocates for commercial, recreational, and subsistence shellfish harvesting have often opposed allowing the sea otter's range to increase, and there have even been instances of fishermen and others illegally killing them.|$|E

25|$|Modern Kabbalah {{developed}} by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, {{in his writings}} about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.

25|$|For Friedrich Nietzsche, life {{is worth}} living {{only if there}} are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw {{nihilism}} ("all that <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective.|$|E
25|$|Adult blow flies are {{occasional}} pollinators, being {{attracted to}} flowers with strong odors resembling rotting meat, {{such as the}} American pawpaw or dead horse arum. Little doubt remains that these flies use nectar {{as a source of}} carbohydrates to fuel flight, but just how and when this <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> unknown. One study showed the visual stimulus a blow fly receives from its compound eyes is responsible for causing its legs to extend from its flight position and allow it to land on any surface.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.|$|E

25|$|As a {{main-sequence star}} {{increases}} in size during its evolution, it may {{at some point}} exceed its Roche lobe, meaning that some of its matter ventures into a region where the gravitational pull of its companion star is larger than its own. The result is that matter will transfer from one star to another through {{a process known as}} Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), either being absorbed by direct impact or through an accretion disc. The mathematical point through which this transfer <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> called the first Lagrangian point. It is not uncommon that the accretion disc is the brightest (and thus sometimes the only visible) element of a binary star.|$|E
25|$|Instead, what <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> that {{rotating}} {{a magnet}} causes subatomic {{particles in the}} magnet to acquire a change in velocity. However, in the rotated magnet, the velocities of electrons would vary ahead or behind {{those of the other}} particles, due to their lower mass compared to nuclei. There is length contraction of fields propagating from moving charges, and the length contraction of the electric fields E of the electrons would be greater or lesser than the contraction of the E fields of the positive nuclei depending on whether the rotation of the magnet was aligned to, or opposed to, the electron spins which give rise to the magnetism.|$|E

Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardships. In the prologue, he explains how {{he managed to get}} another story about Oz, even though it is isolated from all other worlds. He explains that a child suggested he make contact with Oz with wireless telegraphy. Glinda, using her book that records everything that <b>happens,</b> <b>is</b> able to know that someone is using a telegraph to contact Oz, so she erects a telegraph tower and has the Shaggy Man, who knows how to make a telegraph reply, tell the story contained in this book to Baum.|$|E

25|$|In deep marine environments, {{the water}} current working the sea bottom is small. Only fine {{particles}} can be transported to such places. Typically sediments depositing {{on the ocean}} floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-organisms. At 4km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically (the depth zone where this <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> called the lysocline). Calcareous sediment that sinks below the lysocline dissolves, as a result no limestone can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of silica (such as radiolarians) are not as soluble and still deposit. An example of a rock formed of silica skeletons is radiolarite. When {{the bottom of the sea}} has a small inclination, for example at the continental slopes, the sedimentary cover can become unstable, causing turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are sudden disturbances of the normally quite deep marine environment and can cause the geologically speaking instantaneous deposition of large amounts of sediment, such as sand and silt. The rock sequence formed by a turbidity current is called a turbidite.|$|E

It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!" [...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say that what <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first wave}} of punk rock was aggressively modern, {{distancing}} itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 1970s rock.

Unfortunately, what <b>happens</b> <b>is</b> that people who could not hold a candle {{to the likes of}} Hendrix started noodling away. Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere.

[...] John Holmstrom, founding editor of Punk magazine, recalls feeling [...] "punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [...] like Billy Joel and Simon and Garfunkel were being called rock and roll, when to me and other fans, rock and roll meant this wild and rebellious music." [...] In critic Robert Christgau's description, [...] "It was also a subculture that scornfully rejected the political idealism and Californian flower-power silliness of hippie myth." ...|$|E

[...] In a July 2016 interview, Pixar president Jim Morris said that while demand for a sequel is high, the company has committed its resources to several original movie concepts from June 7, 2019 onward, and that no sequels to any of Pixar's other films including Inside Out were being contemplated at this time.|$|E
