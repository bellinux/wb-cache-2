Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once.

By June 1994, Sega Channel had gained a total of 21 cable companies signed up to carry the service. Fees in the United States <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> varied depending on location, but were approximately US$15 monthly, plus a $25 activation fee, which included the adapter. The Sega Channel expanded into Canada in late 1995, with an approximately Can$19 monthly fee. During the planning stages of the service, Sega looked {{to capitalize on the}} rental market, which had seen some success with the Sega CD being rented through Blockbuster, Inc., and was looking to base the service's offering of games and demos to help sell more cartridges.|$|E

5|$|By 1889, Manmohan had {{determined}} {{to pursue a}} literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations {{but to do so}} when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College. Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

Having been in planning since 2004, a preview {{service of the}} British Rail Class 395 trains, popularly known as Javelins, started in June 2009, and regular services began on 13 December 2009. The quickest journey time from Ashford to London St Pancras is 35 minutes, compared with 80 minutes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> to London Charing Cross via Tonbridge. This service on Section 2 of the CTRL, known previously as CTRL-DS, {{was a factor in}} London's successful 2012 Olympic Bid, promising a seven-minute journey time from the Olympic Park at Stratford to the London terminus at St Pancras. Although the Class 395 has a maximum speed of , for timetabling purposes a 10% lower speed is assumed. These trains have faster acceleration than the Eurostar units.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after its}} {{foundation}} the LNC used existing firms of London undertakers to arrange funerals, {{but over time}} took over {{all aspects of the}} arrangements from coffin-making to masonry. LNC funerals were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers, with the exception that a railway carriage was used in place of a hearse. On being commissioned to provide a funeral, invitations would be sent out either by the deceased's family or from the LNC offices. These letters specified the waiting room to be used, the time of the train to Brookwood, and the expected return time to London. If the funeral was to be held in London, a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> and then on to the London railway terminus; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, NSB {{announced}} {{that they wanted to}} discontinue their operations in Narvik, hoping they could leave operation of passenger trains on the Ofot Line to Ofotbanen. In May, NSB signed an agreement with Ofotbanen, where the latter would take over NSB's responsibilities to operate trains from Narvik to Riksgränsen along the Ofot Line. The initial contract would last until 2006, and NSB paid NOK 13 million <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> From 15 June, Ofotbanen took over all passenger transport on the line, including employing all former NSB employees in Narvik. On the same day, Connex Tåg took over the operations on the Swedish side of the border after winning a public service obligation contract with the Swedish government, and dismissing SJ of the right to offer the service. An operating and security license was granted from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate to Ofotbanen on 11 June.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bondevik's Second Cabinet and Liberal Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm {{decided that}} all ferry {{services}} in Norway would become subject {{to public service}} obligation (PSO). Innherredsferja held a concession {{until the end of}} 2006, but would have to bid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> from 1 January 2007. The company would need expertise in both bidding and increased share capital to succeed in the bidding. By then, Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25% of the company, and the county and the municipality sold their shares to Fosen. Following this, a meeting was held on Ytterøy, where Fosen succeeded in securing a sufficient number of shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company. This valued the company at NOK23.1 million. Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares. From 1 July 2005, Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen, but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board.|$|E

5|$|In a {{retrospective}} interview, Rare designers Jens Restemeier and Nick Burton took interest in the-then upcoming Xbox Live Arcade {{and offered to}} develop a new game <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> after the release of Rare's Xbox 360 launch titles Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo. Rather than simply porting the original ZX Spectrum title to the Xbox 360, the development team decided to expand Jetpac and experiment with new elements. The team ensured to keep the original core mechanics of the Jetpac whilst designing new features for the game. Restemeier also stated that the development process for an Xbox Live Arcade game differed from a retail title, owing to processing power limitations that had to be constantly synced over Xbox Live. Burton asserted that one of the differences with development on the Xbox Live Service was the way optimisations shifted from graphics and game logic, stating that this was more difficult {{than it would have been}} for an Xbox 360 title such as Kameo.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 732, Marwan led 40,000 men north into Khazar lands. The {{accounts}} of this campaign are confused: Ibn A'tham records that he reached Balanjar and returned to Derbent with much captured livestock, but the campaign is described in terms strongly reminiscent of Maslama's expeditions in 728 and 731, and its veracity is open to doubt. Ibn Khayyat {{on the other hand}} reports that Marwan led a far more limited campaign on the country immediately to the north of Derbent and then retired there to spend the winter. Marwan was more active in the south, where he raised Ashot III Bagratuni to the position of presiding prince of Armenia, effectively granting the country broad autonomy in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of its soldiers alongside the Caliphate's armies. This unique concession points, according to Blankinship, to the worsening manpower crisis faced by the Caliphate. At about the same time, the Khazars and Byzantines strengthened their ties and formalized their alliance against their common enemy with the marriage of Constantine V to the Khazar princess Tzitzak.|$|E

5|$|On February 25, 1970, the 11 Westinghouse-powered cars {{intended}} for Harrisburg service completed their performance testing. Penn Central {{refused to accept}} the cars, citing numerous technical issues with the cars and their general unsuitability <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> They had worse acceleration than the Silverliners already in service, tended to overheat when making numerous closely spaced stops, and had difficulty climbing the grade out of Suburban Station. Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use the cars, and 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease the cars for use on the core New York - Washington service. They were moved back to the Budd plant for modifications in April. In July, the state authorized $100,000 to upgrade Silverliners for the Harrisburg service instead.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz was {{generally}} admired for the superb coup d'œil {{that allowed him}} to utilize the cavalry to its full potential. His 19th century biographer, K. A. Varnhagen von Ense, related that Seydlitz lived above all <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> and promoted the training of his hussars before all else. According to Anton König, who wrote in 17801790, Seydlitz performed best at taverns and excelled in practical jokes: one would gather that Seydlitz was a drunkard, a rake, and a savage, but another of his biographers, Bernhard von Poten, cited conflicting descriptions offered by Seydlitz's contemporaries, particularly Warnery, as more accurate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to support König's assertion, at least of Seydlitz's excesses: Seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years, although he smoked a pipe rather than using snuff, as many officers did; he was indeed reckless, as his career testified; he enjoyed the company of women; and Seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness.|$|E
