The other picture is of a hotel sitting-room in the Strand, where a man is hunched up over the fire. He is a cousin who has speculated with another cousin's money and has fled from Ireland in danger of arrest. My father has brought us to spend the evening with him, to distract him from the remorse my father knows that he must be suffering.|$|R

40|$|While {{flying on}} an {{airplane}} to Germany, heading to my new appointment as a visiting scholar, <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>myself</b> that there would likely be some cultural differences upon embarking on this new journey. But after I began my sojourn there, I still found myself surprised by the cultural shock I was experiencing. I had taken for granted that my English education and some reading on German culture and society could provide me adequate knowledge {{to get along with}} these “Westerners”. Germans are unique, as they describe themselves, and interaction in everyday routine as well as in a professional setting gradually allowed me to learn about the characteristics of this country’s culture and its people’s lifestyle and mentality. To be very serious and forthright is one of the qualities in Germans which left me with a profound impression. As an example, one interesting experience occurred during an academic presentation I delivered. Upon completing my talk, I expected some routine or polite appreciation for my well-prepared presentation, but my German audience immediately focused on asking questions of a critical nature after my talk. “In many aspects, we are even much more straightforward than Americans, ” I was told by my German colleagues. After a series of similar experiences, I gradually came to believe that these attitudes of critical inquiry, curiosity and earnestness embedded in their culture and national spirit help promote Germans to progress in science and technology. They are modest and unpretentious in the way they seek to improve their products and service, and meanwhile, they are also very proud of their country, as exemplified in a famous German song "Deutschland" originally by the band "Die Prinzen": Wir können stolz auf Deutschland (We can be proud of Germany).

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} constructivist learner roles in acquisitions {{in the secondary}} education chemistry curriculum of the province of Québec / Canada. This research used document analysis as a qualitative research method. According to our findings; the “learner roles” in curriculum correspond with the “student roles” emphasized by the program. We found that these overlaps mostly cohere with “constructive learner roles”. These cohering constructive learner roles are i) the individual takes {{the control of the}} learning process, ii) the individual is selective, constructive and active in the learning process, iii) the individual carries out his/her responsibilities in constructive learning environments,iv) the individual, constructs a meaning in his/her mind for knowledge acquired in the construction process and appropriates that knowledge, v) the individual communicates and discusses issues with other learners and teachers. Moreover, a clue indicating that a History-Technology-Society perspective was used as a background framework for generating the special approaches and goals for science learning has been encountered in the assumption of the constructivist learner roles. This clue is a quote from Albert Einstein: “Every day <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving” This clue can be generalized to  contribution of education programs to teaching programs / the contribution of chemistry program to the educational program...|$|R

60|$|The abeyance, {{not to say}} the desuetude, {{that the}} novella fell into for several centuries is very curious, and fully as {{remarkable}} as the modern rise of the short story. It began to prevail in the dramatic form, for a play is a short story put on the stage; it may have satisfied in that form the early love of it, and it has continued to please in that form; but in its original shape it quite vanished, unless we consider the little studies and sketches and allegories of the Spectator and Tatler and Idler and Rambler and their imitations on the Continent as guises of the novella. The germ of the modern short story may have survived in these, or in the metrical form of the novella which appeared in Chaucer and never wholly disappeared. With Crabbe the novella became as distinctly the short story as it has become in the hands of Miss Wilkins. But it was not till our time that its great merit as a form was felt, for until our time so great work was never done with it. <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> of Boccaccio, and of the Arabian Nights, without the wish to hedge from my bold stand.
