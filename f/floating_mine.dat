500|$|Departing from Cattaro on {{her third}} patrol on 10 December, Krsnjavi steered {{the boat to}} her patrol area: {{cruising}} the Mediterranean between Alexandria and Malta. The {{first day of the}} new year brought U-40s next success. On 1 January 1918, the [...] Sandon Hall, a British steamer headed from Basra to London with a cargo of linseed oil and dates, was sent to the bottom [...] north-northeast of Linosa. A torpedo attack two days later on another steamer produced no result. Having exhausted her supply of torpedoes, U-40 headed back to port. On 6 January, the U-boat's deck gun was used to destroy a <b>floating</b> <b>mine.</b> The following day the boat was fired upon by three drifters of the Otranto Barrage but safely returned to Cattaro on 8 January.|$|E
2500|$|While {{maneuvering}} {{and making}} smoke {{to mask the}} convoy, the destroyer escort spotted a <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> which she sank with gunfire. Soon thereafter, another [...] "Jill" [...] passed through the area and drew fire from Willmarth. Unfortunately, the shells were not observed to hit; and the plane escaped.|$|E
2500|$|At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916, V4 {{remained}} {{part of the}} 10th Half-Flotilla, 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, {{operating in}} support of the main German battle fleet. At about 03:15 hr CET (i.e. 02:15 hr GMT) the 5th Flotilla was accompanying the German Fleet on its journey back to base [...] when a large underwater explosion, probably due to a <b>floating</b> <b>mine,</b> blew the bows off V4, killing 18 and wounding four. After the survivors were rescued, sister ship [...] scuttled V4 with shellfire and a torpedo.|$|E

2500|$|On September 11, 1952, {{batteries}} on Umi-do fired eighteen 105-millimeter {{rounds at}} the USS Lewis, no damage or casualties. On September 13, aircraft from the [...] attacked a 130-foot naval like vessel near Wonsan and sank it with rockets and 20 millimeter strafing. The enemy ship {{was one of}} the few sunk by UN forces during the war. Two days later, the Barton hit a suspected of being a <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> while sailing 100 miles due east of Wonsan Harbor. Five enlisted men were counted missing and later presumed dead, six other men were wounded. The fire room flooded and there was other less severe damage. Flooding was brought under control and she set a course for Sasebo under her own power.|$|E

60|$|The ship lay {{within two}} hundred yards of us, and {{it was easy to}} see that she had her death-blow. She was already {{settling}} down by the stern. There was a sound of shouting and people were running wildly about her decks. Her name was visible, the Adela, of London, bound, as we afterwards learned, from New Zealand with frozen mutton. Strange as it may seem to you, the notion of a submarine had never even now occurred to her people, and all were convinced that they had struck a <b>floating</b> <b>mine.</b> The starboard quarter had been blown in by the explosion, and the ship was sinking rapidly. Their discipline was admirable. We saw boat after boat slip down crowded with people as swiftly and quietly as if it were part of their daily drill. And suddenly, as one of the boats lay off waiting for the others, they caught a glimpse for the first time of my conning-tower so close to them. I saw them shouting and pointing, while the men in the other boats got up to have a better look at us. For my part, I cared nothing, for I took it for granted that they already knew that a submarine had destroyed them. One of them clambered back into the sinking ship. I was sure that he was about to send a wireless message as to our presence. It mattered nothing, since, in any case, it must be known; otherwise I could easily have brought him down with a rifle. As it was, I waved my hand to them, and they waved back to me. War is too big a thing to leave room for personal ill-feeling, but it must be remorseless all the same.|$|E
50|$|Her first duty {{assignment}} {{was in the}} autumn of 1945 in a three-month tour as part of the overall occupation forces following the surrender of Japan. This included clearing Allied <b>floating</b> <b>mines</b> from Japanese waters.|$|R
50|$|The {{remainder}} of March proved relatively unproductive. In {{the absence of}} targets worthy of torpedoes, the submarine contented herself with the destruction of <b>floating</b> <b>mines</b> and with the sinking of two tiny trawlers on 28 March.|$|R
50|$|The {{bouquet mine}} {{is a single}} anchor {{attached}} to several <b>floating</b> <b>mines.</b> It is designed so that when one mine is swept or detonated, another takes its place. It is a very sensitive construction and lacks reliability.|$|R

50|$|On March 22, a <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> or {{a suicide}} attack off the {{northern}} coast of Sri Lanka claimed {{the lives of}} 10 Sri Lankan seamen. None of their bodies were ever recovered.|$|E
50|$|After Lady Cory-Wright sank {{many of her}} mines {{were left}} {{floating}} in the area, and her one survivor reportedly was found clinging to a <b>floating</b> <b>mine.</b> In 2009 her wreck still contained many unexploded mines and detonators.|$|E
50|$|The system's {{primary purpose}} is to defend against anti-ship missiles, {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles and other precision guided weapons. It can also be employed against conventional and rotary-wing aircraft, surface ships, small water-crafts, coastal targets and <b>floating</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Second Circle. The {{business}} district. More regulated {{than the}} first circle. <b>Floating</b> <b>mines</b> keep the traffic in order. However, businessmen flinging themselves from their buildings when the stock exchange crashes can cause a hazard to traffic.|$|R
50|$|To {{accomplish}} the goal Mistel long-range bombers {{were to be}} employed. To destroy water turbines special <b>floating</b> <b>mines</b> called Sommerballon ("summer balloon") were to be dropped {{into the water and}} then pulled by the current straight into the turbines.|$|R
50|$|The {{ascending}} mine is {{a floating}} distance mine that may cut its mooring {{or in some}} other way float higher when it detects a target. It lets a single <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> cover a much larger depth range.|$|E
50|$|During the phoney war, MIR(c) {{was engaged}} in {{developing}} the <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> required for Churchill's planned Operation Royal Marine which aimed to disrupt German shipping in their inland waterways by dropping these mines into the river at Strasbourg.|$|E
50|$|The {{schooner}} Virgen de Covadonga was a {{ship that}} participated in the Chincha Islands War and the War of the Pacific, under Spanish and Chilean flags. She was launched in 1859. Covadonga hit a <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> and sank off Chancay in 1880.|$|E
50|$|Throughout November, Threat {{operated}} off France's southern coast. She cleared {{fire support}} channels and patrolled for <b>floating</b> <b>mines</b> {{in the area}} between Cannes and Sanremo, before departing Cannes on 27 November 1944 for provisioning and ammunition replenishment at Bizerte.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{completion}} of the repairs, she was again dispatched to active service, this time patrolling the Bulgarian Coast. This work entailed danger from <b>floating</b> <b>mines,</b> shore batteries and Bulgarian aircraft, against which at first, the Snaefell had little or no defence.|$|R
5000|$|Churchill {{promoted}} [...] "Operation Royal Marine" [...] in 1940 {{and again}} in 1944 where <b>floating</b> <b>mines</b> were put into the Rhine in France to float down the river, becoming active after a time calculated to be long enough to reach German territory.|$|R
50|$|The ship′s luck ran out on 29 November 1916, {{while she}} was {{travelling}} from Alexandria, Egypt to Saloniki with 1,600 troops. She struck a <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> 1.5 nmi km southeast of Dentero Point, Suda Bay, Crete which tore a large hole in the hull.|$|E
5000|$|While {{maneuvering}} {{and making}} smoke {{to mask the}} convoy, the destroyer escort spotted a <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> which she sank with gunfire. Soon thereafter, another [...] "Jill" [...] passed through the area and drew fire from Willmarth. Unfortunately, the shells were not observed to hit; and the plane escaped.|$|E
50|$|On 13 September 1880, while {{enforcing}} {{a blockade}} {{in the port}} of Chancay, Peru, the sailors of Covadonga saw an unmanned boat loaded with fresh fruit and produce being carried by the currents. When they tried to lift the boat it exploded as the Peruvians had rigged it as a <b>floating</b> <b>mine.</b> Covadonga sank in less than 10 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|On 16 October, Thompson, {{in company}} with MineDiv61, headed to sea from Buckner Bay to {{commence}} sweeping operations in area [...] "Rickshaw" [...] in the Yellow Sea. En route the following day, Thompson sighted several <b>floating</b> <b>mines</b> and destroyed them by gunfire.|$|R
50|$|Drifting mines were {{occasionally}} {{used during}} World War I and World War II. However, {{they were more}} feared than effective. Sometimes <b>floating</b> <b>mines</b> break from their moorings and become drifting mines; modern mines are designed to deactivate in this event. After several years at sea, the deactivation mechanism might not function as intended and the mines may remain live. Admiral Jellicoe's British fleet did not pursue and destroy the outnumbered German High Seas Fleet when it turned away at the Battle of Jutland because {{he thought they were}} leading him into a trap: he believed it possible that the Germans were either leaving <b>floating</b> <b>mines</b> in their wake, or were drawing him towards submarines, although neither of these was the case.|$|R
50|$|Hang: Appears in episodes 9, 10, and 11. Powers include flight, a sword, a red club, a javelin, and swimming. In episode 37 it is {{depicted}} that Hang {{was one of}} Emperor Galfa's earliest minions. In the game it was also armed with <b>floating</b> <b>mines</b> orbiting it.|$|R
50|$|Next day she put to sea {{to evade}} a typhoon, and {{that same day}} struck a <b>floating</b> <b>mine,</b> which caused the death of three men and damaged the ship extensively. Towed back to Okinawa 18 September, she was later towed to Guam, Pearl Harbor, and San Francisco for repairs, {{reaching}} the U.S. West Coast 30 January 1946.|$|E
50|$|She was leased to Waterman Steamship Company and {{delivered}} on 31 July 1942. On 5 May 1946, the Thomas Heyward hit an unswept <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> off of Europe. Although damaged, the vessel made it safely back to port for repairs. The vessel {{was placed in}} the Mobile Reserve Fleet in 1949, but was reactivated in 1951 for duty during the Korean War.|$|E
50|$|The {{starboard}} screw and rudder {{were once}} damaged by a <b>floating</b> <b>mine</b> in the Cua Viet River. She continued operations on one screw until another could be fitted at Da Nang. She suffered serious enough storm damage during a typhoon during a voyage to Okinawa in 1969, to require emergency repairs while beached and more complete repairs in a graving dock at Sasebo, Japan.|$|E
50|$|Kossol Passage {{ultimately}} {{proved to}} be unsuitable for ammunition handling owing to chronic heavy swells, the lack of storage facilities ashore, and the shortage of personnel to unload the supplies, {{as well as its}} proximity to Japanese-held Babelthuap Island. <b>Floating</b> <b>mines</b> from that island were a constant danger.|$|R
50|$|Though {{their primary}} mission {{continued}} to be attack on surface ships and craft, PT boats were also used effectively to lay mines and smoke screens, coordinate in air-sea rescue operations, rescue shipwreck survivors, destroy Japanese suicide boats, destroy <b>floating</b> <b>mines,</b> and to carry out intelligence or raider operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{termination}} of hostilities occurred while Blackfin {{was on her}} fifth war patrol. After occupying a lifeguard station and destroying 61 <b>floating</b> <b>mines,</b> she retired to Guam, arriving in Apra Harbor 5 September 1945. After receiving voyage repairs and fuel she proceeded to San Diego where she joined Submarine Squadron 1.|$|R
