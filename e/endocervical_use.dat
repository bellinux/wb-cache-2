40|$|To {{evaluate}} whether the endocervical brush (ECB) is better accepted by patients {{and health care}} providers for endocervical evaluation {{when compared to the}} endocervical curette (ECC), without a decrease in the quality of sampling. Two hundred patients with cervical dysplasia were randomized at the colposcopy clinic of the University Hospital of Geneva into two groups according to technique. Patients and physicians' preference regarding the technique as well as the quality of samples were assessed. ECB samples were analyzed using both cytological (cell block) and histologic analysis, while ECC samples were analyzed using standard histologic analysis. Of the 200 patients, 89 were randomized to ECC, 101 to ECB and 10 were excluded due to incomplete information or cervical stenosis. Physicians preferred ECB against ECC, classifying it more frequently as an easy technique (94. 1 % vs. 61. 4 %, p< 0. 001). Physicians more frequently evaluated the ECB as little or not uncomfortable for patients (28. 7 % vs. 10. 2 %, p< 0. 001), though patients themselves didn't express a preference for either technique. From a quality standpoint, the brush allowed for a better quality of samples, with a lower rate of inadequate samples (2. 0 % vs 14. 3 %, p = 0. 002) and greater amount of material. <b>Endocervical</b> sampling <b>using</b> ECB seems to be easier to perform and provides better quality samples.

40|$|BackgroundCertain {{types of}} human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{are associated with}} cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical carcinoma. The study addressed the expression and detection of HPV genotypes in cervical and vaginal specimens of women with normal and abnormal cytology by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), each woman serving as her own control. MethodsStudy participants (127) were subgrouped into CIN-positive and CIN-negative, based on cytology screening, and endocervical and vaginal scrapes were collected by a gynecologist and placed immediately in saline. HPV DNA was assessed by PCR, and HPV genotypes were determined by hybridization of PCR products with type-specific biotinylated probes. ResultsOf the 127 participants, 55 tested positive and 72 tested negative for HPV DNA. While {{there was no difference}} between the two groups with regards to age or to number of pregnancies, higher numbers of smokers and of women with multiple sexual partners and abnormal cytology were seen in the HPV-positive group (P < 0. 001). HPV DNA was detected in the vaginal scrapes of all HPV-positive, but in none of the HPV-negative women (sensitivity and specificity = 1. 0). Furthermore, the HPV genotype was the same in vaginal and endocervical specimens in all the HPV-positive women.

First-void urine (FVU) and endocervical and urethral swab specimens were collected from 1, 015 unselected patients attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic and a clinic for adolescents in Helsinki, Finland. Chlamydia trachomatis was cultured from samples from the endocervix or urethra. PCR was performed with fresh and frozen urine and the culture transport medium. LCR was performed with fresh and frozen urine and LCx swab transport medium. Diagnostic consistency and diagnostic accuracy were statistically tested. The test results were identical for 984 patients (97 %). Discrepant results were observed for 31 patients. Overall, LCR and PCR showed excellent kappa coefficients of consistency for both swab and FVU specimens (0. 93 and 0. 95, respectively). Sixty-one patients (6 %) were culture positive. Testing of FVU by LCR or PCR increased the overall positivity rates to 7. 0 and 7. 7 %, respectively. While PCR of FVU detected {{the greatest number of}} C. trachomatis infections (sensitivity, 96. 1 %), for some PCR-positive FVU specimens the results could not be confirmed (specificity, 99. 6 %). PCR and LCR were more sensitive than culture (sensitivities, 92 and 93 % versus 79 % for culture) in the diagnosis of genital C. trachomatis infection.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} in cytology, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions with endocervical glandular extension {{in cases}} previously diagnosed as atypical glandular cells (AGC), analyse possible {{reasons for the}} diagnostic pitfall and document the frequency of glandular pathology coexisting with high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesion in histology. METHODS: Thirty-nine ThinPrep cervical smear (Pap) tests reported as AGC of undetermined significance and showing high-grade lesions on histology [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3, endometrial or extrauterine adenocarcinoma] were reviewed retrospectively to identify the cases of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion with <b>endocervical</b> glandular extension, <b>using</b> the Bethesda 2001 system. Cyto-histological correlation was performed. RESULTS: A high frequency of diverse glandular pathologies coexisted with high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions on histology. This included endocervical glandular extension in 63 %, benign glandular pathology in 33 % and pre-neoplastic or malignant glandular pathology (endocervical glandular dysplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ and metastatic breast carcinoma) in 17 % cases. On cytology, the sensitivity was 40 %, specificity was 80 % and positive predictive value was 86 % for endocervical gland extension in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Special efforts to recognize endocervical glandular extension in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and glandular neoplasia coexisting with squamous intraepithelial lesions from the heterogeneous category of AGC can contribute to increasing the diagnostic accuracy. The identification of endocervical glandular extension on cervical cytology would alert the gynaecologist to perform a thorough assessment of the endocervix during colposcopy. This could also help {{to decide on the}} need to perform deeper conization rather than loop electrosurgical excision procedure to ensure negative margins when colposcopic biopsy shows CIN 2 or 3...|$|R

In developed countries, routine cervical cytology tests {{resulted in}} a large decline in cervical cancer incidence. This study is a descriptive- analytical research to evaluate the order of cell sampling from exocervix and endocervix and compare final cytological diagnosis. Materials and methods: Totally, 1129 smears were obtained by an Ayre spatula and an endocervical brush from patients who referred to Tehran health and birth control clinic. patients {{were divided into two}} groups. In 563 cases, the <b>endocervical</b> brush was <b>used</b> first, but in 565 cases the spatula was used first for sampling. Results: Statistical testing showed that there is not any difference between groups regarding their age, age of marriage, partity, and type of contraception. More smears were obscured by blood when brush was used first (78 or 13 / 8 % compared with 48 or 8. 5 %, P= 0. 004) but we observed an insignificant difference between two groups and cytologic diagnosis. We observed higher proportion of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) detection in the spatula- first group (33 cases, 59 %) compared with brush- first group (20 cases, 3. 6 %) which is insignificant (P= 0. 09). This study showed that the ability of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) detection in spatula- first group (27 cases, 4. 8 %), was comparable to brush-first group (23 cases, 4. 1 %). Conclusions: Because reported SIL cases are higher when samples are first taken from exocervix and rate of blood contamination increases when samples are taken from endocervix (p= 0. 004), it is better to take samples first from exocervix for Pap Smear. This strategy increases the chance of diagnosis of cellular lesions of cervix...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{further the}} accuracy of the COBAS AMPLICOR (Roche) (CA) PCR-based system in detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in endocervical specimens. Endocervical specimens collected for any indication for testing for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae among a university hospital health system population were included. Testing for C. trachomatis was done by two PCR methods, CA and manual microwell AMPLICOR (Roche) (MWA), and by culture; testing for N. gonorrhoeae was done by CA and culture. Discrepancy resolution was performed. Reproducibility testing and hands-on labor time measurements for CA were done. Among 654 C. trachomatis samples, the prevalence of true positivity was 9. 2 %, and among the 618 N. gonorrhoeae samples, the prevalence of true positivity was 4. 4 %. For detection of C. trachomatis, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values were, respectively, as follows for each test: CA, 93. 3, 99. 7, 99. 3, and 96. 4 %; MWA, 91. 7, 99. 7, 99. 2, and 96. 5 %; and culture, 65. 0, 100, 96. 6, and 100 %. For detection of N. gonorrhoeae those values were as follows: CA, 96. 3, 100, 99. 8, and 100 %; and culture, 92. 6, 100, 99. 7, and 100 %. Hands-on labor time for each clinical result was estimated to be at 7. 5 min.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{quality of}} the <b>endocervical</b> swab specimen <b>used</b> {{for the detection of}} Chlamydia trachomatis may dramatically impact the sensitivity of the diagnostic assay used. An evaluation of the adequacy of 319 endocervical swab specimens from women attending two inner-city sexually transmitted disease and family planning clinics, as well as five high school-based family planning clinics, was performed, and the resulting data were compared with the diagnostic results obtained by both Amplicor PCR and Microtrak direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) staining. The swab from each patient was rolled across the open circular area of a DFA slide and then used to inoculate a transport tube for PCR (Roche), after which the swab was discarded. The slides were stained and examined by epifluorescence microscopy for the presence of C. trachomatis elementary bodies and for the presence and number of cell types to determine specimen adequacy. Cellular adequacy for a cervical swab specimen was defined as the presence of one or more columnar epithelial or metaplastic epithelial cells or the presence of more than 100 erythrocytes per high-power microscopic field. Of the 319 specimens read by DFA, 204 (63. 9 %) were determined to be adequate. There were 34 (10. 7 %) positive specimens by DFA and/or PCR. Twenty-nine (9. 1 %) specimens were positive by PCR, 20 (6. 3 %) specimens were DFA positive, and 15 (4. 7 %) were concordantly positive by both tests.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} an inoculation model of Walker 256 carcinoma on cervix uteri and vagina of rats. METHODS: Fifteen female rats were used, and assigned to three groups each one with five rats: group A - rats with 4 x 10 (6) cells of Walker 256 carcinoma without acid acetic inoculation; group B - rats with 2 x 10 (6) cells of Walker 256 carcinoma with acid acetic inoculation and group C: rats with 4 x 10 (6) cells of Walker 256 carcinoma with acid acetic inoculation. The day before tumor cells inoculation the rats from groups B and C were anaesthetized with diethylether and 0, 3 ml of acetic acid was inoculated into their vaginas. Tumor cell inoculation into the vagina and cervix was done under general anesthesia with diethylether. Then a <b>endocervical</b> brush was <b>used</b> to scrape the vaginal wall {{and after that}} 0, 3 ml of the liquid containing tumor cells was inoculated on the vagina and cervix. For the tumor analysis, animals were euthanized at day 12 following tumor cell implantation by an excessive inhalation of diethylether. Tumor was resected entirely and weighed and the tumors were then sectioned and counter stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathologic evaluation. It was also calculated the percentage of tumor equivalent to the body weight by the formula: P= tumor weight / body weight x 100. Data were analyzed by {{one-way analysis of variance}} - ANOVA. P values < 0. 05 were taken to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Implantation and growth on GB and GC was 100 % and on GA 20 %.

CONCLUSION: According to the methods used, the Walker 256 carcinoma inoculation model into vagina and cervix have an implantation and growth rate of 100 % when associated with previous acid acetic inoculation and there is no behavioral difference between using 2 x 10 (6) or 4 x 10 (6) cells on its inoculation...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial {{cells are}} part of {{the first line of defense}} against {{microbial}} infections. One of the crucial mechanisms of defense against infectious diseases employed by epithelial cells is the production of antimicrobial peptides such as defensins. Previous studies have shown that human defensin 5 (HD 5) is increased in the female genital tract during sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Thus, we hypothesized that HD 5 is regulated by microbial products and proinflammatory cytokines in <b>endocervical</b> epithelial cells. <b>Using</b> two epithelial cell culture models for the endocervical epithelial cell line A 2 EN, we quantified the production of HD 5 at the mRNA and the protein level in the presence and absence of the microbial products, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PG), and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 β), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and interleukin 17 A (IL- 17 A). Total RNA extracts were subjected to reverse transcription and quantitative PCR analysis using SYBR green technique with β-actin as a reference RNA. Plasmid-encoded HD 5 and β-actin were utilized to determine the copy number of target and housekeeping mRNAs per reaction. Cell culture supernatants from apical and basolateral compartments were analyzed by western immunoblot for HD 5 protein expression. We found that HD 5 was not upregulated by microbial product or proinflammatory cytokines when submerged cell culture was used. However, when air-liquid interface cell culture was used HD 5 appeared to be upregulated by all stimulants but PG. IL- 17 A-stimulated cell extracts showed the highest HD 5 upregulation. Because we could not reproduce this finding and we were concerned about the responsiveness of the cells to microbial products overall, we quantified the activation of other epithelial cell markers, IL- 8 and HBD- 2. IL- 8 mRNA was expressed, but not upregulated, in response to all stimulants except for the combination of proinflammatory cytokines, for which IL 8 gene expression was no longer detectable. HBD- 2 mRNA was detected only in extract from cells stimulated with IL- 17 A. Future experiments should involve optimization of the cell culture model to ensure proper cell polarization and receptor expression on the cell surface for warranted cell response...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to compare}} vulvovaginal swabs with endocervical swabs as optimal {{diagnostic}} sample for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Design: a diagnostic test study. Setting: an urban sexual health centre. Participants: 3973 women aged ≥ 16 years requesting testing for sexually transmitted infections. Interventions: participants took a vulvovaginal swab before routine examination, and clinicians took an endocervical swab during examination. Main outcome measure: diagnosis of chlamydia infection with samples analysed using the Aptima Combo- 2 assay; positive results confirmed with the Aptima CT assay. Results: of the 3973 participants, 410 (10. 3 %) were infected with C trachomatis. Infected women were significantly younger (22 v 25 years, P< 0. 0001) {{and more likely}} to have symptoms suggestive of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (53 % v 41 %, odds ratio 1. 63 (95 % CI 1. 30 to 2. 04)), be a contact of someone with a sexually transmitted infection (25 % v 5 %, odds ratio 6. 18 (4. 61 to 8. 30)), clinically diagnosed with cervicitis (17 % v 4 %, odds ratio 4. 92 (3. 50 to 6. 91)), and have pelvic inflammatory disease (9 % v 3 %, odds ratio 2. 85 (1. 87 to 4. 33)). When women co-infected with gonorrhoea were included in the analysis, there was an association with mixed ethnicity (10 % v 7 %, odds ratio 1. 53 (1. 07 to 2. 17)); but when those with gonorrhoea were removed, women of white ethnicity {{were significantly more likely to}} have chlamydia (85 % v 80 %, odds ratio 1. 40 (1. 03 to 1. 91)). On analysis of complete paired results, vulvovaginal swabs were significantly more sensitive than endocervical swabs (97 % (95 % CI 95 % to 98 %) v 88 % (85 % to 91 %), P< 0. 00001); corresponding specificities were 99. 9 % and 100 %. In women with symptoms suggestive of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection, vulvovaginal swabs were significantly more sensitive than endocervical swabs (97 % (93 % to 98 %) v 88 % (83 % to 92 %), P= 0. 0008), as they were in women without symptoms (97 % (94 % to 99 %) v 89 % (84 % to 93 %), P= 0. 002). Conclusions: vulvovaginal swabs are significantly better than endocervical swabs at detecting chlamydia in women with and without symptoms suggestive of sexually transmitted infections.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} the extent to which testing of multiple sites and samples is required to define whether a woman is Chlamydia trachomatis-positive. DESIGN [...] One-hundred and fifty women attending the Genitourinary Medicine clinic at St Mary's Hospital were enrolled; they had not received antichlamydial antibiotics in the previous three months, were not in a high-risk group for HIV infection, or pregnant, or using an intrauterine contraceptive device. Thirty-two women were re-examined three months after recruitment. METHODS [...] An urethral specimen was Gram stained (smear) and cultured for gonococci. Another urethral specimen was taken to detect C trachomatis elementary bodies (EBs) by the MicroTrak direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test (Syva). An endocervical swab specimen was Gram stained (smear) and cultured for gonococci. One of two other <b>endocervical</b> swabs was <b>used</b> for the DFA test and was then placed in medium which was centrifuged in a MicroCentaur at 13, 000 rpm for 10 min; the deposit was examined by using the DFA test. The first 15 - 20 ml of voided urine (first pass urine; FPU) was also centrifuged and the deposit tested similarly. RESULTS [...] Of 182 cervical smears and/or deposits tested for C trachomatis, 38 were positive; more cervical deposits (37) than smears (26) were positive and, of these, one-fifth of the deposits and one-third of the smears contained fewer than 10 elementary bodies. Of 162 paired urethral smears and FPU deposits available, one or other specimen of 36 pairs was chlamydia-positive, that is 31 smears and 32 deposits; of these, two-fifths of the smears and half of the deposits contained fewer than 10 EBs. Of 150 sets of cervical and urinary tract samples tested, 31 were chlamydia-positive at both sites, six in the cervix alone and four in the urinary tract alone. Of 139 women for whom there were valid first visit sample results, 36 (26 %) were chlamydia-positive in the cervix, 34 (25 %) in the urinary tract and 41 (29 %) had at least one sample from either site positive. Overall, DFA tests of deposits from centrifuged cervical specimens achieved the highest sensitivity (88 %) and those of cervical smears the lowest (70 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] Deposits from centrifuged cervical specimens were C trachomatis-positive more often than were cervical smears. Testing deposits from centrifuged urines was as successful as testing urethral smears. One-fifth (cervical deposits) to one-half (urine deposits) of specimens contained fewer than 10 EBs. The urinary tract was chlamydia-positive almost as frequently as the cervix but both sites needed to be tested to define whether a woman was chlamydia-positive...|$|R

MÉTODOS: realizou-se um estudo caso-controle com mulheres com HPV em colo do útero atendidas em serviço de Ginecologia de referência vinculado ao SUS, em Recife, Nordeste do Brasil. No grupo de casos (72 mulheres com lesão intraepitelial de alto grau ou carcinoma cervical) e de controles (176 mulheres com colpocitologia normal ou com alterações benignas), foram pesquisados seis genótipos virais (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 6 e 11) em material da ecto- e endocérvice com primers MY 09 /MY 11. As variáveis independentes foram hierarquizadas em três níveis de determinação: distal (sociodemográficas), intermediário (comportamentais) e proximal (realização anterior de colpocitologia). A homogeneidade das proporções foi testada (&# 967; 2). Obtiveram-se ORs não ajustadas e, na modelagem final, realizou-se regressão logística hierarquizada com o ajuste do efeito de cada variável sobre o desfecho pelas variáveis do mesmo nível e de níveis anteriores de causalidade. RESULTADOS: em 76, 6 % das 248 mulheres participantes do estudo, o genótipo viral da infecção cervical foi identificado. Predominaram genótipos de alto risco oncogênico (83, 4 % nos casos e 67, 1 % nos controles), principalmente HPV 16 e 31. Foram identificados como fatores de risco (a) distais: residir em zona rural (OR= 2, 7; IC 95 %: 1, 1 - 6, 2), menos de três anos de estudo (OR= 3, 9; IC 95 %: 2, 0 - 7, 5) e renda familiar inferior a dois salários mínimos (OR= 3, 3; IC 95 %: 1, 0 - 10, 5); (b) intermediário: número de gestações igual ou superior a quatro (OR= 2, 0; IC 95 %: 1, 0 - 3, 7); (c) proximal: ausência de colpocitologia anterior (OR= 9, 7; IC 95 %: 2, 4 - 38, 2). CONCLUSÕES: em mulheres usuárias do SUS do Nordeste do Brasil predominam os genótipos virais 16 e 31 em infecções cervicais por HPV, sendo que fatores socioeconômicos, reprodutivos e relacionados à ausência de rastreamento citológico representam risco para lesão intraepitelial de alto grau e câncer cervical. PURPOSE: {{to analyze}} the characteristics of viral infection and the risk factors for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and cervical carcinoma in women with cervical HPV infection. METHODS: a case-control study was conducted on women with cervical HPV at a Gynecology reference service enrolled at the Public Health System, located in Recife, Northeastern Brazil. The groups of cases (72 women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or cervical cancer) and controls (176 women with normal Pap smear or benign alterations) were investigated for six viral genotypes (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 6, 11) in ecto- and <b>endocervical</b> material <b>using</b> MY 09 /MY 11 primers. The independent variables were ranked in three levels of determination: distal (sociodemographic), intermediate (behavioral) and proximal (previous Pap smear). The homogeneity of proportions was tested (&# 967; 2), unadjusted Odds Ratios (OR) were obtained and hierarchical logistic regression {{was applied to the}} final model, with adjustment of the effect of each variable to the outcome based on the variables in the same and previous levels of causality. RESULTS: the viral genotype of cervical infection was identified in 76. 6 % of the 248 women participating in the study. High-risk HPV genotypes (83. 4 % of cases and 67. 1 % of controls) were predominant, especially HPV 16 and 31. The distal risk factors identified were: living in a rural area (OR= 2. 71, 95 %CI: 1. 18 - 6. 23), less than three years of study (OR= 3. 97, 95 %CI: 2. 09 - 7. 54) and family income below two minimum wages (OR= 3. 30, 95 %CI: 1. 04 - 10. 51); intermediate: four or more pregnancies (OR= 2. 00, 95 %CI: 1. 06 - 3. 76); and proximal: absence of a previous Pap smear (OR= 9. 74, 95 %CI: 2. 48 - 38. 28). CONCLUSIONS: genotypes 16 and 31 of cervical HPV infection are predominant among women assisted by the Public Health System in Northeastern Brazil. Socioeconomic and reproductive factors, as well as the absence of cytological screening, represent risk factors for the progression of infection to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and cervical cancer...|$|R
