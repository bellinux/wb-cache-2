500|$|... "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] is a {{moderate}} R, soul and quiet storm ballad pacing in medium time. It {{was written in}} the key of F major, and moves at {{a moderate}} tempo set at 100 beats per minute. Vocal elements of the song range from E3 to D5. [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] is backed by piano and thumping drum instrumentation. Many music critics noted it to be musically similar to the original Destiny's child version. Lyrically, the song is about being romantically obsessed, as indicated in the chorus: [...] "I am in love with you / You set me free / I can't <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> called life without you here with me". According to Lisa Verrico of The Times, [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] bears resemblance to Janet Jacksons work if viewed from a [...] "flirty" [...] perspective.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1924, Darrow took {{on the case of}} Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb, the teenage sons of two wealthy Chicago {{families}} who were accused of kidnapping and killing Bobby Franks, a 14-year-old boy, from their stylish southside Kenwood neighborhood. Leopold was a law student at the University of Chicago about to transfer to Harvard Law School, and Loeb was the youngest graduate ever from the University of Michigan; they were 18 and 17, respectively, when they were arrested. When asked why they committed the crime, Leopold told his captors: [...] "The thing that prompted Dick to want to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> and prompted me to want to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> was a sort of pure love of excitement... the imaginary love of thrills, doing something different... the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boyce {{was charged}} with conspiring {{to blow up the}} concentrator. Boyce had been in Wardner conferring with local union {{officers}} only a week before the explosion. In 1906, former union member and Boyce business associate Harry Orchard told a court that he knew Boyce had planned and approved the bombing of the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mine. Governor Steunenberg told a United States House of Representatives Committee on Military Affairs that he was convinced Boyce had [...] "inaugurated or perfected this conspiracy by, choosing 20 men from different organizations in that county and swearing them. These 20 men chose one each and swore him, and the 40 each chose a man and swore him, and the 80 each chose a man and swore him. In that way there were at least 160 men in this conspiracy to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> sworn to secrecy." ...|$|E

2500|$|When not {{contributing}} to others' scripts, O'Brien managed to craft what {{are regarded as}} some of the series' most memorable and finest episodes: [...] "Marge vs. the Monorail" [...] and [...] "Homer Goes to College". Generally, critics, fans and even those who worked on the show agree that its sensibilities changed following [...] "Marge vs. the Monorail." [...] The show was initially a highly realistic family sitcom; after O'Brien's debut, the show took a rapid shift {{in the direction of the}} surreal. Along with those episodes, he has sole writing credits on [...] "New Kid on the Block" [...] and [...] "Treehouse of Horror IV", on which he wrote the episode wraparounds. Wallace Wolodarsky described a [...] "room character" [...] Conan put on for the writers: [...] "Conan used to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> called the Nervous Writer that involved him opening a can of Diet Coke and then nervously pitching a joke. He would spray Diet Coke all over himself, and that was always a source of endless amusement among us." [...] Occasionally, fellow writers from the show would stop by O'Brien's Beverly Hills apartment.|$|E
2500|$|The Tom Leykis Show had {{its last}} regular {{terrestrial}} broadcast on Friday, February 20, 2009, and ended at 5 p.m., {{the middle of}} its usual time slot. Leykis took calls until the last five minutes. At that point, the host mentioned that people had {{asked him how he}} was going to end the show. Saying [...] "Let's tell the truth", Leykis commented that he knew since the previous summer that it was possible the flagship station (KLSX, which originated the broadcast of the show) would switch format. Saying he [...] "tossed and turned", he thought about it and asked himself: [...] "What could I say that would wrap this all up? And then I one day heard this song … and I realized – the lyrics of this song … are about me." [...] With that, Leykis rolled into Joe Jackson's [...] "I'm the Man" [...] (the title track of Jackson's 1979 album). By the time the song was over, the studio was filled with people—as could be seen by the live online video broadcast on the station website. The host thanked his producers, the program director, the crowd in the studio, and everyone in southern California who made it [...] "12 great years", and he finished with [...] "Let's <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> one more time..." [...] The crowd yelled [...] "Blow me up, Tom" [...] one last time to end the show and mark the end of KLSX as [...] "The FM Talk Station" [...] in what coincidentally became a strikingly appropriate catch phrase to be had: The phrase [...] "blow up the station" [...] is a radio term for ending a particular format or station run. After a much longer than usual explosion sound effect, the crowd cheered and KLSX changed format from hot talk to CHR/Top 40.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yet {{not quite}} all. You <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> But the {{inspection}} of the company's books is past. The danger of discovery, at least, is averted. Or is it that your conscience compels you to make restitution?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Who were they?" [...] {{he asked}} himself, again and again. [...] "What {{kind of man}} <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing?</b> Was the leader a man like Ballard? Even so, he was hired. By whom? By ranchers covetous of the range; that was {{absolutely}} certain." ...|$|R
