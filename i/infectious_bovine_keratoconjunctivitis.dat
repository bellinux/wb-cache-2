40|$|Moraxella bovis pili {{have been}} shown {{to play a major role}} in both {{infectivity}} and protective immunity of <b>bovine</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>keratoconjunctivitis.</b> Sonicated M. bovis DNA from the piliated strain EPP 63 was inserted into the vector lambda gt 11 with EcoRI linkers. Recombinant phage were screened with an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino-terminal portion of the DNA sequence of a Neisseria gonorrhoeae pilin gene. Two candidate phages produced a protein that comigrated with EPP 63 beta pilin in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and bound anti-pilus antisera. The 1. 9 -kilobase insert from one of these, lambda gt 11 M 182, was subcloned in both orientations into pBR 322, forming the plasmids pMxB 7 and pMxB 9, both of which produced beta pilin, as did pMxB 12, a HindIII deletion derivative of pMxB 7. In HB 101 (pMxB 12), the M. bovis pilin protein was shown to be primarily localized in the inner membrane. The entire 939 -base-pair insert of pMxB 12 was sequenced, revealing a ribosome binding site just upstream of the coding region and an AT-rich region further upstream containing some potential RNA polymerase recognition sites. The translation of the sequence predicts a six-amino-acid leader sequence preceding the phenylalanine that begins the mature protein. Codon usage analysis of the M. bovis beta pilin gene revealed greater use of the CUA codon for leucine than usual for a well-expressed Escherichia coli gene. Comparisons of the M. bovis EPP 63 beta pilin protein sequence with other pilin gene sequences are presented...|$|R

50|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>keratoconjunctivitis,</b> or IBK, is a {{veterinary}} {{infection of}} cattle caused by Moraxella bovis, a Gram-negative, β-haemolytic, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. It is spread by direct contact or by flies serving as vectors. It {{is the most}} common ocular disease of cattle (mostly beef). IBK is similar to human pink eye and causes severe infection of the conjunctiva, edema, corneal opacity, and ulceration. This disease is highly contagious and occurs worldwide. Younger animals are more susceptible, but recovery with minimal damage is usual, if they are treated early. The disease is also known as pinkeye, New Forest eye or blight.|$|E
5000|$|Moraxella bovis is {{the cause}} of <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>keratoconjunctivitis,</b> known colloquially in the United Kingdom as New Forest eye. As a strict aerobe, M. bovis is {{confined}} to the cornea and conjunctiva, resulting in a progressive, nonself-limiting keratitis, ulceration, and - ultimately - rupture of the cornea. The disease is relatively common, infecting cattle only. Treatment is the use of either subconjunctival injection of a tetracycline, or topical application of cloxacillin, the former being more effective. The bacterium can be transmitted by flies, so fly control may be necessary on farms throughout the summer. Rupture of the eye is more serious, and requires immediate enucleation, though the procedure itself carries a good prognosis.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the carrier state of Moraxella bovis could be prevented under natural conditions of exposure by vaccination, purebred Hereford calves were vaccinated twice; once in June 1982, and again in September 1982.

When calves were compared {{on the basis of}} selection lines (four genetic groups), there were significant (P less than 0. 05) differences in the percentages of infection, disease and weight gain between selection line calves, regardless of their vaccination status. Results suggest that vaccination, in conjunction with clinical <b>infectious,</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>keratoconjunctivitis,</b> reduces the carrier state of M. bovis in the herd but the immunity lasted less than 9 months.

Some vaccinated lambs developed a persistent <b>infectious</b> <b>bovine</b> rhinotracheitis virus infection that was recrudesced by treatment with dexamethasone.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this paper two {{experiments}} are described in which cattle of different breeds or different lines of the same breed are subjected to varying levels of environmental stress. In the first trial three breeds with differing genetic growth potential were kept et three different levels of stress. It was shown that at the lowest level of stress the breed with highest genetic potential gained most, whereas at the highest level of stress the breed with lowest potential gained most. In the second experiment this Genotype X Environment Interaction was studded further by using a Control line and a Selected line of the same breed. The Selected line had been selected for growth rate under moderate to high levels of environmental stress. Both lines were subjected to the same poor environmental conditions and growth rate and stress parameters were measured. Gains were faster for the Selected line and the mean values for each stress parameter (rectal temperature, <b>bovine</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>keratoconjunctivitis</b> and helminth worm eggs), were lower for the Selected line. Thus in part the level of adaptation to the environment determines by how much potential growth rate is realised under field conditions. Unfortunately because of antagonisms which appear to occur between some components of adaptation and production potential, it may not be possible to create an animal which has both high production potential coupled with a high level of adaptation. In the second part of the work the domestic buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is cited as an animal with moderate growth potential but high adaptation to high stress conditions. Methods of increasing overall productivity of the buffalo by improving tolerances to the environmental stresses of heat, parasites and diseases are considered. m e relationship between environmental and genetic factors in determining milk yield, fertility, growth rate and survival rate are discussed...|$|R
