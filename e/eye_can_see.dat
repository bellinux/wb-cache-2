5|$|The first {{form of life}} {{to develop}} on the Earth were microbes, and they {{remained}} the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> <b>see.</b> They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, P. schultzi {{can take}} in only a small visual field at one time, as the most acute part of a main <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> all of a circle up to 12millimeters wide at 20centimeters away, or up to 18millimeters wide at 30centimeters away. A Portia spider takes a {{relatively}} long time to see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs, and mantises, which it often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{the peace}} between England and France, Pope Sixtus IV issued in 1483 a Papal bull {{granting}} the Privilege of Neutrality, by which the Islands, their harbours and seas, {{as far as the}} <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> were considered neutral territory. Anyone molesting Islanders would be excommunicated. A Royal Charter in 1548 confirmed the neutrality. Not that the French behaved, as they attempted to invade Jersey a year later in 1549 but were defeated by the militia. The neutrality lasted another century, until William III of England abolished the privilege due to privateering activity against Dutch ships.|$|E

500|$|Although other spiders {{can also}} jump, salticids {{including}} Portia fimbriata have significantly better vision than other spiders, and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a cat's and 10times more acute than a dragonfly's. Jumping spiders have eight eyes, the two large {{ones in the}} center-and-front position (the anterior-median eyes, also called [...] "principal eyes") housed in tubes {{in the head and}} [...] providing acute vision. The other six are secondary eyes, positioned along the sides of the carapace and acting mainly as movement detectors. In most jumping spiders, the middle pair of secondary eyes are very small and have no known function, but those of Portias are relatively large, and function {{as well as those of}} the other secondary eyes. The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately 2centimetres to infinity, and in practice can see up to about 75centimetres.

Wearers can also be detected by the [...] "Homenum Revelio" [...] spell. In Goblet of Fire, Moody's magical <b>eye</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> Harry under the cloak.
