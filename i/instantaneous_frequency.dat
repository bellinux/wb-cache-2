Moreover, based on the simultaneously sparsity approximation and fast Fourier transform, some efficient algorithms is developed. Since the information of multiple signals is used, this method is very robust to the perturbation of noise.

40|$|Changes in the {{performance}} of bearings can significantly vary the distribution of internal forces and moments in a structure as a result of environmental or operational loads. The response of a bearing has been traditionally idealized using a linear model but a non-linear representation produces a more accurate picture at the expense of modelling complexity and computational time. In this article, a lead rubber bearing is idealized using the hysteretic Bouc–Wen model. The Hilbert–Huang transform is then employed to characterize the features of the non-linear system from the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the bearing response to a time-varying force. <b>Instantaneous</b> <b>frequencies</b> are also shown to be a useful tool in detecting sudden damage to the bearings simulated by a reduction in the effective stiffness of the force-deformation loop...|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} mode decomposition (EMD) {{has been}} developed by N. E. Huang et al. in 1998 as an iterative method to decompose a nonlinear and nonstationary univariate function additively into multiscale components. These components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are constructed such that they are approximately orthogonal to each other {{with respect to the}} L 2 inner product. Moreover, the components allow for a definition of <b>instantaneous</b> <b>frequencies</b> through complexifying each component by means of the application of the Hilbert transform. This approach via analytic signals, however, does not guarantee that the resulting frequencies of the components are always non-negative and, thus, physically meaningful, and that the amplitudes can be interpreted as envelopes. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem which takes into account important features desired of the resulting EMD. Specifically, we propose a data-adapted iterative method which minimizes in each iteration step a smoothness functional subject to inequality constraints involving the extrema. In this way, our method constructs a sparse data-adapted basis for the input function as well as a mathematically stringent envelope for the function. Moreover, we present an optimization-based normalization to extract <b>instantaneous</b> <b>frequencies</b> from the analytic function approach. We present corresponding algorithms together with several examples.

50|$|In {{frequency}} modulation, {{the carrier}} wave {{is combined with}} video signal by varying the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>frequency</b> of the wave (the frequency of wave at a particular point). (Compare with amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the carrier wave varies, while the frequency remains constant.) From the picture above, if the video signal is at its peak, the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>frequency</b> of carrier wave will increase {{and as for the}} trough, the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>frequency</b> will decrease.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a time-frequency {{analysis}} method to obtain <b>instantaneous</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{and the corresponding}} decomposition by solving an optimization problem. In this optimization problem, the basis {{that is used to}} decompose the signal is not known a priori. Instead, it is adapted to the signal and is determined as part of the optimization problem. In this sense, this optimization problem {{can be seen as a}} dictionary adaptation problem, in which the dictionary is adaptive to one signal rather than a training set in dictionary learning. This dictionary adaptation problem is solved by using the augmented Lagrangian multiplier (ALM) method iteratively. We further accelerate the ALM method in each iteration by using the fast wavelet transform. We apply our method to decompose several signals, including signals with poor scale separation, signals with outliers and polluted by noise and a real signal. The results show that this method can give accurate recovery of both the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>frequencies</b> and the intrinsic mode functions...|$|R
