40|$|In some surveys, {{it is of}} {{interest}} to record geospatial data such as coordinates for housing unit locations, road networks, agricultural field boundaries, and water body boundaries {{as part of the}} survey data collection process. These data objects are represented as shape data (i. e., points, lines, polygons), and are inherently different from coded and <b>fixed</b> <b>format</b> <b>questionnaire</b> responses. Geographic information system (GIS) software can be used to record shape data, but the differences between a GIS software environment and that of a standard computer-assisted survey instrument are substantial. Questions arise in balancing the linear structure of protocol enforcement with the iterative interactions that occur when working with geographic information; how to represent and configure feature editing environments for unskilled users; and whether constraints should be placed on the digitizing process to balance the accuracy of geographical feature delineation with the time spent recording the data. GIS software environments for survey data collection were explored via investigations with two agencies in the US Department of Agriculture. One study was conducted with National Agricultural Statistics Service field interviewers, who had not previously been exposed to computer-assisted data collection. Enumerators used pen-based tablet computers and a simplified ESRI ArcView application to delineate field boundaries on digital photographs during interviews with farm operators. Data were collected from observers and enumerators on the interview experience and software use. In a second study, Natural Resource Conservation Service staff were trained in the use of GIS, but varied in th...|$|R
40|$|Study Design: Non-experimental lex post facto) survey {{research}} design involving {{the use of}} a <b>fixed</b> alternative <b>format</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Objectives: To investigate variables influencing vocational outcome, to identify barriers to gaining and sustaining employment and to identify the effects of variables on the type of work engaged in following spinal cord injury. The two sets of independent variables considered were, individual and injury-related factors (age at onset of injury, time since injury, extent/ level of injury, highest educational qualification achieved pre-injury, and pie-injury occupation) and circumstantial factors (means of transport, access difficulties, perceived workplace discrimination, financial disincentives to work and perceived level of skill). Setting: The Princess Alexandra Hospital Spinal Injuries Unit, Queensland, Australia. Methods: Data on the variables and the vocational outcomes of having ever worked or studied post-injury, current employment status and post-injury occupation were obtained from survey responses. Demographical and medical data were gathered from medical records. Results: Forward stepwise logistic regression revealed that having ever worked or studied post-injury was associated with all individual and injury-related factors except pre-injury occupation, and two circumstantial factors, namely means of transport and access difficulties, Current employment was associated with all circumstantial factors as well as age at injury and pre-injury occupation. Standard multiple regression analyses revealed that post-injury occupation was correlated with all individual and injury-related factors as well as means of transport and perceived workplace discrimination. Conclusions: Tailored rehabilitation programs for individuals with characteristics associated with less successful vocational outcomes may facilitate their employment status after injury...|$|R

40|$|Background: In large {{cohort studies}} of older children, self-report {{is the only}} {{practical}} way to assess physical activity. Assessing usual activity over the entire year is desirable, but children and adolescents may overestimate activities with high seasonal variability. Use of questionnaires in which individuals report each activity by season may improve accuracy. Methods: A total of 6782 girls and 5110 boys, aged 9 – 14 years in 1996, completed self-administered activity questionnaires in 1996 and in 1997. In 1996, participants reported the average time spent in each of 17 activities during the previous 12 months; in 1997, we also asked for the average {{time spent in the}} previous year, but within each of the four seasons. Results: Girls reported a median of 12. 8 hours/week total activity in 1996 and 10. 4 hours/week in 1997. For boys, the estimates were 15. 5 hours/week and 13. 4 hours/week, respectively. Girls and boys within 1 -year age strata (e. g., comparison of 10 -year olds in 1996 with 10 -year olds in 1997) reported an average of 3. 7 and 3. 1 fewer hours per week, respectively, on the 1997 seasonal format versus the 1996 annual <b>format</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> In longitudinal analyses, the difference between the annual and the seasonal estimates was greater if participants did the activity in fewer seasons in 1997. Conclusions: In comparison to an annual <b>format</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> a seasonal <b>format</b> <b>questionnaire</b> may improve accuracy of self-report of physical activity by reducing over-reporting of activities in which pre-adolescents and adolescents engage in fewer seasons...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—By {{combining}} {{statistical analyses}} and informa-tion retrieval techniques, an efficient way for knowledge dis-covery from questionnaires is discussed. Since usual ques-tionnaires include questions answered by a <b>fixed</b> <b>format</b> and those by a free format, {{it is important}} to introduce the viewpoints of both data mining and text mining, where the answers by the <b>fixed</b> <b>format</b> is called ”items”, and those by the free format, simply “texts”. In this paper, an algorithm for simultaneously processing answers with both the items and the texts is developed. An algorithm for extracting important sentences from documents is also developed. Us-ing these algorithms combined with statistical techniques, a method for analyzing the questionnaires is presented. The method is applied to a case of improvements for the quality of education for which the student questionnaire is executed to a class, and we obtain useful knowledge which leads to faculty developments.
