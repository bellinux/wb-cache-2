It is dated around the late 2nd to early 1st century BCE. The Coptic and Ethiopic versions of Esther are translations of the Greek rather than the Hebrew Esther.|$|E

25|$|The {{canonicity}} {{of these}} Greek additions {{has been a}} subject of scholarly disagreement practically since their first appearance in the Septuagint— Martin Luther, being perhaps the most vocal Reformation-era critic of the work, considered even the original <b>Hebrew</b> <b>version</b> to be of very doubtful value. Luther's complaints against the book carried {{past the point of}} scholarly critique and may reflect Luther's antisemitism, which is disputed, such as in the biography of Luther by Derek Wilson, which points out that Luther's anger at the Jews was not at their race but at their theology.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} Philo's {{knowledge}} of Hebrew is debated. His numerous etymologies of Hebrew names—which are {{along the lines}} of the etymologic midrash to Genesis and of the earlier rabbinism, though not modern Hebrew philology—suggest some familiarity. Philo offers for some names three or four etymologies, sometimes including the correct Hebrew root (e.g., , descent, as the origin of the name Jordan). However his works do not display much understanding of Hebrew grammar, and they tend to follow the translation of the Septuagint more closely than the <b>Hebrew</b> <b>version.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Septuagint bible, {{present in}} Eastern Orthodox churches, {{includes}} a Psalm 151; a <b>Hebrew</b> <b>version</b> {{of this was}} found in the Psalms Scroll of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Some versions of the Peshitta (the bible used in Syriac churches in the Middle East) include Psalms 152–155. There are also the Psalms of Solomon, which are a further 18 psalms of Jewish origin, likely originally written in Hebrew, but surviving only in Greek and Syriac translation. These and other indications suggest that the current Western Christian and Jewish collection of 150 psalms were selected from a wider set.|$|E

500|$|The term Gospel of the Ebionites is {{a modern}} convention; no {{surviving}} document of the early church mentions a gospel by that name. Epiphanius identifies the gospel only as [...] "in the Gospel used by them, called 'according to Matthew'" [...] and [...] "they call it 'the Hebrew '". As early as 1689 the French priest Richard Simon called the text [...] "Gospel of the Ebionites". The name is used by modern scholars as a convenient way to distinguish a gospel text that was probably used by the Ebionites from Epiphanius' mistaken belief {{that it was a}} <b>Hebrew</b> <b>version</b> of the Gospel of Matthew. [...] Its place of origin is uncertain; one speculation is that it was composed in the region east of the Jordan where the Ebionites were said to have been present, according to the accounts of the Church Fathers. It is thought to have been composed {{during the middle of the}} 2nd century, since several other gospel harmonies are known to be from this period.|$|E
500|$|Linn {{argued in}} 2004 that certain Israeli historians had {{misrepresented}} Vrba's story. Vrba {{believed they had}} sought to erase his story from Holocaust historiography because of his views about Kastner and the Hungarian Judenrat, some of whom went on to hold prominent positions in Israel. Linn wrote that Vrba's and Wetzler's names are omitted or their contribution minimized in Hebrew textbooks: standard histories refer to the escape by [...] "two young Slovak Jews", [...] "two chaps", or [...] "two young people", and represent Vrba and Wetzler as emissaries of the Polish underground in Auschwitz. Vrba's book was not translated into Hebrew until 1998, 35 years after its publication in English. Linn arranged for the publication of Vrba's memoir and the Vrba-Wetzler report in Hebrew by the Haifa University Press, after it was rejected by Yad Vashem. Before this there was no English or <b>Hebrew</b> <b>version</b> at Yad Vashem of the Vrba–Wetzler report, an issue the museum attributed to lack of funding. There was a Hungarian translation, {{but it did not}} note the names of its authors and, Linn wrote, could be found only in a file that dealt with Rudolf Kastner.|$|E

Both Hebrew versions refer to vows of the year just concluded, rather than vows made in the coming year. The two Hebrew versions are slightly different from each other. The Amram's version was apparently written unpointed but a pointed version of Amram's <b>Hebrew</b> <b>version</b> is given in Birnbaum. Amram's <b>Hebrew</b> <b>version</b> is the one used in Balkan (Romanian) and Italian liturgy. Otherwise, Ashkenaz and Sefardic liturgy has adopted Rabbenu Tam's Aramaic text.

2500|$|Of all {{the extant}} sources, the German manuscripts in Wolfenbüttel and Dresden are taken by {{scholars}} {{to be the}} authoritative texts.
