40|$|The {{body of work}} {{on natural}} <b>gas</b> <b>hubs</b> has been {{expanding}} rapidly in recent years, {{with most of the}} current work examining the creation of <b>gas</b> <b>hubs</b> focusing on either the European experience or the North American experience. In this paper, we adopt a different perspective and place the focus on experience of hub building from other international commodities. We analyse three commodities - crude oil, iron ore and coal, and draw experience on the role of governance in development of hub based prices. In particular, we propose that the role of governance is different at different stages of the pricing transition to market based pricing. Governance could play an important role at the initial stage, building the relevant soft and physical infrastructure which facilitates the reaping of first mover advantage. As the market develops, private sector players may prefer less involvement of governance, which may distort markets. With market stabilization, governance should be focused on maintaining stable rules and regulation for private sector development, as well as monitoring for further changes in global trends. To facilitate the building of a benchmark price, the public sector should adopt a long-term and overarching view on industry growth...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the informational {{efficiency}} of the European natural gas market is analyzed by empirically investigating price formation and arbitrage efficiency between spot and futures markets. Econometric approaches are specified that explicitly account for nonlinearities and the low liquidityframework of the considered <b>gas</b> <b>hubs.</b> The empirical results reveal that price discovery takes place on the futures market, while the spot price subsequently follows the futures market price. Furthermore, there is empirical evidence of significant market frictions hampering intertemporal arbitrage. UK's NBP {{seems to be the}} hub at which arbitrage opportunities are exhausted most efficiently, although there is convergence in the degree of intertemporal arbitrage efficiency over time at the hubs investigated...|$|R
40|$|The European {{markets for}} natural gas are {{characterized}} by a dual pricing structure which reflects the continents very significant import dependence: the price of imports fluctuates following different dynamics than the price determined by the domestic markets’ supply/demand balance. This thesis researches {{the reasons for this}} price duality and questions the sustainability and desirability of such a hybrid pricing structure in the future. The time frame varies between a short-term period (defined as roughly 3 years) to a long-term period (roughly 10 years). To answer the research question, the distribution of reserves, consumption and production as well as their historical development have to be analyzed to determine the emergence of possible new trends as well as the market power of the main exporters. Considering security of supply, geopolitical dimensions are also taken into account, namely the EU’s energy policy and import diversification strategy. Finally, the paper focuses on the emergence of domestic markets within the context defined previously, with a particular attention towards these markets’ role in comparison to the bulk of the volumes imported under long-term sales arrangements. The result of the above analyses is a framework for describing the evolution of the European markets within a globalizing context. Such framework allows discussing the potential development of EU natural <b>gas</b> <b>hubs</b> according to 7 variables as mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive as possible given the vastness of the matter and the interconnection between the different elements at hand. It aims therefore at being used as a map to follow the evolution of the growth of <b>gas</b> <b>hubs</b> within the considerably uncertain environment they are evolving in. Such framework also highlights how the complete preponderance of one pricing mechanism (hub versus long-term contracts) is more likely to happen over the medium to long term rather than the short term...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince 2010, the LNG {{importing}} {{price premium}} in the Asia–Pacific markets {{has become increasingly}} high, generating great effects on the economic development in China. In addition, the natural gas dependence degree is expanding continuously, making it extremely urgent to establish a natural <b>gas</b> trading <b>hub</b> in China, with the aim to ensure national energy security, to gain the pricing power, and to build the regional benchmark prices. Through a comparative analysis of internal strength/weakness and external competitiveness, we concluded that with intensively-issued supporting policies on the natural gas sector, the initiation of spot and futures markets, {{the rapid growth of}} gas production and highly-improved infrastructures, as well as Shanghai's advantageous location, China has more advantages in establishing an Asian Natural Gas Trading Hub than other counties like Singapore, Japan and Malaysia. Moreover, based on the SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity and threat) and the marketization process analysis, the following strategies were presented: to impel the establishment of a natural <b>gas</b> trading <b>hub</b> depending on the gas supply condition, to follow the policies to complete the gas storage system, to form regional communities by taking comparative advantages, and to reinforce the marketization reform and regulation system establishment with foreign experiences for reference. This study rationalized the necessity and practicality of establishing a natural <b>gas</b> trading <b>hub</b> in China and will help China make a proper decision and find a periodical strategic path in this sector...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{natural gas}} {{market is the}} big goal for the European countries. Deregulation started in Europe in the late 1990 s and three European packages {{for the creation of}} a single market for natural gas have already been issued. At the moment sixteen <b>gas</b> <b>hubs</b> are currently operating in the Euro Zone and three will be opened in the short term. They all trade natural gas at different prices, while only nine have higher liquidity. The aim of this paper is twofold, to verify if the natural gas prices are converging to a single price in Europe and to identify the trading hub, which can be considered the reference price for Europe. We investigate the natural gas price dynamics in the last decade among these hubs, study their statistical features and use a VECM framework to test the existence of cointegration among the various hubs. The Granger causality test is also used to identify TTF as the leading trading hub for Europ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper by}} Patrick Heather assesses the {{development}} of the European Continental Gas Trading Hubs. It is a natural successor to his 2010 paper ‘The Evolution and Functioning of the Traded Gas Market in Britain’. Although the drivers and challenges for gas trading on the European Continent have been different from those of Britain, the desire for change at an EU policy level, the catalyst of the economic recession and the sea-change in the acceptance of trading have all contributed to an astonishing development in European <b>gas</b> <b>hubs</b> over the past few years. Based on extensive research and discussion with the key actors intimately involved, the paper provides deep insights into the characteristics of the individual hubs, the reasons behind their particular evolutionary path and their characterisation as ‘Trading Hubs’ (NBP and TTF), ‘Transit Hubs (ZEE and CEGH) and ‘Transition Hubs’ (GPL, NCG, PEGs and PSV); a framework which assists the reader in better understanding the current and future role of each. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper by}} Patrick Heather {{is the third}} he has written on the {{development}} of European traded <b>gas</b> <b>hubs.</b> It is the culmination of extensive field research interviewing a range of market participants from regulators, TSOs, traders and government officials â from Spain to the Baltics, from Britain to the Balkans and many points in between. In addition to comparing national aspirations with EC goals and deadlines he has noted not just the infrastructure projects required to create the connectivity for traded market development, but equally importantly the political will, cultural acceptance of traded markets and the commercial appetite. Clearly to achieve the vision of the Gas Target Model there is certainly âmuch left to doâ. In terms of assessing the stage of development of the various hubs, Patrick presents not only an update of his own quantitative and subjective measures but also incorporates the work of other relevant surveys and academic analyses. Based on this substantial synthesis, the results, both intuitively and analytically compelling, highlight the limited progress made by other hubs in âcatching up withâ the Dutch and British hubs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Different {{hydrocarbon}} producer sales {{strategies have}} widely divergent {{implications for the}} value of Gazprom's gas exports to Europe. In particular, hydrocarbon producers have commonly pursued two alternative sales strategies: (i) pure commodity production (border sales) and (ii) integrated supply, trading and marketing (ISTM). The impact of these two strategies on Gazprom's export profits are examined under three sets of scenarios: (a) the possible entry of low-cost producers, (b) oil price dynamics and (c) the future of LTCs (pricing and volume structure). We also analysed how Statoil shifted its sales strategy in light of structural changes in European gas markets and conclude that the company began employing an ISTM strategy when the market in North-west Europe became liquid. Thus, when a market is mature, with an increasing number of buyers, the best sales strategy for a large hydrocarbon producer should be based on flexibility and increasing its use of market trading to maximise the value of its commodity. We conclude that an optimal export strategy for Gazprom should involve both a substantial and increasing portion of uncommitted volumes that can be traded in markets (<b>gas</b> <b>hubs)</b> and, if needed, some form of bilateral forward contract with a minimum take-or-pay level to secure infrastructure finance.

40|$|The {{global market}} {{for natural gas}} is dynamic, with {{increasing}} competition for world reserves, large scale infrastructure investments (LNG as well as pipelines), market entrants (countries as well as companies), an enhancement of the share of volumes traded under spot agreements, and changing contract structures. The past {{five to ten years}} have seen the development from an “infant ” towards a “maturing ” LNG industry (Ruester and Neumann, 2006) moving towards the globalization of natural gas markets; LNG has turned from being an expensive and only regionally traded fuel to a globally traded source of energy. Changes in the institutional framework of downstream markets (i. e. Continental Europe, some Asian importers such as Japan) have moved the industry away from monopolistic structures towards competition, thus stipulating fundamental changes in the organizational behavior of market participants. Recent years have been characterized by diverse developments: On the one hand we observe vertical integration and strategic partnerships becoming a common corporate behavior in the industry (e. g. ExxonMobil in cooperation with Qatar Petroleum controlling the entire value added chain for LNG deliveries from Qatar to the UK). But we also observe an increasing importance of (liquefied) natural gas spot trade with natural <b>gas</b> <b>hubs</b> gaining in liquidity.
