5000|$|Glidden Doman (January 28, 1921 - June 6, 2016) was an American {{aeronautical}} engineer and pioneer in helicopters and modern wind turbines. [...] He founded one of America’s original six helicopter companies (Doman Helicopters, Inc.) after making major {{contributions to the}} use of Sikorsky helicopters during World War II. [...] Doman Helicopters’ most prominent achievement was the Doman LZ-5/YH-31 eight-place helicopter, which received FAA certification on December 30, 1955. [...] The unique feature of this helicopter was its hinge-less but gimbaled, tilting rotor hub that greatly reduced stress and vibration in the blades and in the whole helicopter. Doman {{was one of the first}} to transfer knowledge of helicopter rotor dynamics technology to wind turbines. The 1973 arab oil embargo prompted NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio to lead a 7 year US wind energy program for the development of utility-scale horizontal axis wind turbines. [...] This program featured the creation of Boeing’s MOD-2 with the Doman conceived <b>flexible</b> <b>rotor</b> design, two-bladed wind turbine with a teeter hinge. [...] Following the NASA project, while working for Boeing, Hamilton Standard division of United Technologies, and Aeritalia (later known as Alenia) in Italy, Doman developed large two-bladed, teeter-hinged wind turbines, including the WTS-3, WTS-4, and the Gamma 60. [...] After testing the Gamma 60 in Sardinia for 7 years, Doman and Italian nuclear mechanical engineer Silvestro Caruso founded Gamma Ventures, Inc. to further develop and market this technology. [...] Gamma Ventures subsequently invested in, and sold a license to Seawind of the Netherlands, to commercialize the same two-bladed, teeter-hinge wind turbine concept.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{develops}} a novel balancing method named as Low-Speed Holo-Balancing (LSHB), which can balance the <b>flexible</b> <b>rotor</b> without test run at high speeds. The principle of LSHB is mainly {{based on the}} holospectrum technique with following specialties. Firstly, the vibration response of rotor is described by three-dimensional holospectrum using multi-sensor fusion, instead of information from a single sensor. Secondly, the variation rules {{of the first two}} modal components are studied through the information in run-up or run-down stages. Then we can deduce the vibration responses at high speed from that at low speed. Finally, the first two modal components can be corrected simultaneously at the speed below the first critical speed. The advantages of LSHB are that the safety of balancing increases because the rotor need not run at high speed or at critical speeds as the traditional modal balancing method do, also the number of test runs and corresponding wastages decrease. The effect of method was validated by the experiments on a <b>flexible</b> <b>rotor</b> test rig.

40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) {{are used}} in many high speed machinery applications because of their advantages of no contact, no wear, no need for lubrications and ability to operate in high rotational speeds. AMBs represent an alternative solution to traditional mechanical bearing due to their contactless working principle. Touchdown bearings are needed in AMBs to prevent system damage under certain conditions such as sudden impact or sudden change of unbalance. In these conditions, rotor may make contact with touchdown bearings.
