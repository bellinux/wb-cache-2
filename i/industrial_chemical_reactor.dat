40|$|Most of {{available}} gas–liquid mass transfer data in bubble column {{have been obtained}} in aqueous media and in liquid batch conditions, contrary to <b>industrial</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactor</b> conditions. This work provides new data more relevant for industrial conditions, including comparison of water and organic media, effects of large liquid and gas velocities, perforated plates and sparger hole diameter. The usual dynamic O 2 methods for mass transfer investigation were not convenient in this work (cyclohexane, liquid circulation). Steadystate mass transfer of CO 2 in an absorption–desorption loop has been quantified by IR spectrometry. Using a simple RTD characterization, mass transfer efficiency and kLa have been calculated {{in a wide range}} of experimental conditions. Due to large column height and gas velocity, mass transfer efficiency is high, ranging between 40...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The exact {{knowledge}} of hydrocarbon oxidation kinetics {{is very important}} {{due to the fact}} that this process is involved in many technological processes: combustion in engines and furnaces, flame synthesis of materials, partial oxidation processes in chemical technology, catalytic combustion, and exhaust gas treatment, etc. An overview is given on the present state of the art with respect to kinetic data on gas-phase and (shortly) surface oxidation of hydrocarbons. Furthermore, some applications are described in the areas mentioned above. Examples for the importance of the gas-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons are ignition and combustion in engines and furnaces and partial oxidation processes in <b>industrial</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reactors.</b> In many applications, both gas-phase and surface chemistry are taking place. Examples here are flame generation of diamonds and syngas generation...|$|R

They are often encountered in applications, for example, networks of reservoirs, <b>industrial</b> processes involving <b>chemical</b> <b>reactors,</b> heat exchangers, distillation columns, storage systems, hierarchical systems, compartmental systems used for modeling transport and accumulation phenomena of substances, see, e.g., [6, 10, 13].|$|R
30|$|The {{qualitative}} {{theory of}} dynamic {{systems such as}} oscillation criterion and stability property has been widely studied and many results have been reported [1 – 8]. As a special class of dynamic systems, positive systems are those systems whose states always take nonnegative values {{as long as the}} initial conditions are nonnegative. Examples of this type are frequently encountered in real word, such as populations levels in biology [9], <b>industrial</b> process involving <b>chemical</b> <b>reactors</b> [10]. In recent years, more and more researchers have focussed on the theory of positive systems because of their importance in applications [11 – 15]. In the literature on positive systems, the stability property takes an important position and it has been comprehensively studied from different fields [16 – 19].|$|R
40|$|Several control {{strategies}} are presented and studied for an <b>industrial</b> under-actuated tubular <b>chemical</b> <b>reactor.</b> This work presents a case-study {{of the performance}} of a decentralized versus centralized control strategy. The tubular reactor under consideration is characterized by nonlinear kinetic laws, and it has some structural constraints on the location of the heat exchangers and of the sensors. For this system, a set of PI controllers is considered and a multivariable LQR controller is constructed to optimally choose the gains. The performance of these control strategies is studied. Finally, a direct numerical treatment of optimal control of the partial di#erential equations is presented. Industrial results are given for the linear controllers. Simulations emphasize the possible relevance of a direct numerical treatment of the nonlinear partial di#erential equations...|$|R
40|$|Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) {{controllers}} {{are commonly}} used controllers in industry for their relative ease of use and it also provides the satisfactory performance in industrial processes. It exploits in case of tight performances by employing additional functionalities such as antiwindup, set-point weight, feedforward action. These functionalities are developed for Single-Input-Single-output (SISO) systems. A system with multi inputs and multi outputs are alloyed as MIMO system. <b>Industrial</b> systems like <b>Chemical</b> <b>reactors,</b> Heat exchangers and Distillation column etc. are {{the best examples of}} MIMO systems. To perform an operation in SISO system is easier than the operation in MIMO system. The cause of this complication occurs due to the coupling or interactions in between the input and output variables. Hence to minimize the interactions, in this paper we are going to discuss about Decoupling for a TITO system. And the feedforward controller is used for following the set-point...|$|R
40|$|Mixing and {{transport}} in turbulent flows, relevant {{in a huge}} variety of both natural and <b>industrial</b> systems including <b>chemical</b> <b>reactors,</b> combustion engines, warm clouds, and biological odor detection, depend strongly on local concentration fluctuations. Local concentration in turn is intimately tied to the longstanding problem of the average spreading rate of pairs of fluid elements. We have measured this separation rate in an intensely turbulent laboratory flow and have found excellent agreement with the seminal theoretical work of Batchelor, who predicted that the initial separation of the pair {{plays an important role}} in the subsequent spreading of the particles. When the initial separation is treated as a parameter, the power law scaling of the separation rate changes with surprising consequences for the decay of the concentration 1 fluctuations of substances carried along with the flow. Turbulent mixing of liquids and gasses is ubiquitous in nature (1) : it is the basis of all industrial fluid mixing processes, and it determines the spread of pollutants or bioagents in the atmosphere (2) and oceans (3). Biological organisms in marine ecosystems exploit it for thei...|$|R

As members of the Alliance Chemical Engineer-ing Application Technologies (AT) Team, we have developed a reactor simula-tion for the partial oxidation of ortho-xylene to phthalic anhydride, an important industrial compound.

Currently, none of the several kinetic models that have been proposed is able to reproduce both the temperature profile inside the reactor and the spectrum of products observed in industry. Practically, an ac-curate simulation of this reaction would allow <b>industrial</b> <b>chemical</b> engineers to optimize plant operations, while ensuring a safe working environment.
