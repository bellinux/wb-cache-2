5|$|In the {{commentary}} of the 1219 treaty with Galicia–Volhynia {{it is noted that}} Mindaugas took {{the wife of}} Vismantas from the Bulionis family for himself.

There is no consensus on how many children Morta had. The chronicles mention two sons, Replys and Gerstukas, in 1261. In 1263 two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, were assassinated together with Mindaugas. This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these are the same two sons, whose name got distorted by scribes, or they are <b>four</b> <b>sons.</b> There is no data on any rivals to the crown after the assassination, except for Vaišvilkas and Tautvilas; it would indicate that, whether there were two or <b>four</b> <b>sons,</b> they had perished in their youth.|$|E
