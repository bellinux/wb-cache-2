A common theme is overall power reduction by low idle power and low peak power, but their evaluation in terms of energy proportionality at the link, switch, router, cluster, and system-levels are more limited. Adaptive link rate is a popular method for energy-aware network links.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a novel architectural mechanism and a power management {{structure for the}} design of an <b>energy-efficient</b> Gigabit <b>Ethernet</b> controller. Key characteristics of such a controller are low-latency and highbandwidth required to meet the pressing demands of extremely high frame and control data, which in turn cause difficulties in managing power dissipation. We propose a flow-through-queue (FTQ) based power management method, which allows some of the tasks involved in processing the frame data to be offloaded. This in turn enables utilization of multiple clock rates and multiple voltages for different cores inside the Ethernet controller. A modeling approach based on semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and queuing models is employed, which allow one to apply mathematical programming formulations for energy optimization under performance constraints. The proposed Gigabit Ethernet controller is designed with a 130 nm CMOS technology that includes both high and low threshold voltages. Experimental results show that the proposed power optimization method can achieve system-wide energy savings under tighter performance constraints. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue to the ever-growing network capac- ity demand, {{energy-efficient}} and scalable networking {{solutions are}} needed in all networking segments. This paper focuses on the metro segment and compares the power consumption for four different technologies: Ethernet, Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplex- ers (ROADM), Optical Transport Networks (OTN), and an optical packet switching (OPS) solution called Packet Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers ("POADM"), which was recently proposed. A novel resource allocation strategy for POADM- based OPS multi-rate rings is proposed for the first time. The multi-rate POADM ring network resource allocation problem is shown to be NP-hard and solved using both an MILP formulation and a heuristic. The MILP formulation and the heuristic are compared, along with dimensioning results for Ethernet and ROADM/OTN ring networks. Results show that multi- rate POADM rings achieve savings up to 10 % with respect to single-rate design and can be enabled by assigning a different rate to each wavelength. Fur- thermore, POADM rings can be up to 5 times more <b>energy-efficient</b> than <b>Ethernet</b> rings and 30 % than ROADM rings, assuming similar network efficiencies...|$|R

The intention is to reduce power consumption by 50% or more, while retaining full compatibility with existing equipment. [...] The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), through the IEEE 802.3az task force developed the standard. The first study group had its call for interest in November 2006, and the official standards task force was authorized in May 2007. The IEEE ratified the final standard in September 2010. Some companies introduced technology to reduce the power required for Ethernet before the standard was ratified, using the name Green Ethernet.|$|E
50|$|Green Ethernet {{technology}} was a superset of the 802.3az standard. In {{addition to the}} link load power savings of <b>Energy-Efficient</b> <b>Ethernet,</b> Green Ethernet works {{in one of two}} ways. First, it detects link status, allowing each port on the switch to power down into a standby or ‘sleep’ mode when a connected device, such as a computer, is not active. Second, it detects cable length and adjusts the power accordingly. Previous standard switches provide enough power to send a signal up to 100 m. However, this is often unnecessary, especially in the home, where 5 to 10 m of cabling are typical between rooms.In addition to the pure power saving benefits of Green Ethernet, backing off the transmit power on shorter cable runs reduces alien crosstalk, and improves the overall performance of the cabling system.|$|E

In this paper, we explore network-level power saving mechanisms {{in the context of}} virtual local area networks (VLANs) given their importance and prevalence in enterprise, campus and Data Center Networks (DCNs). After investigating the disadvantages of current VLAN design method, we propose the GreenVLAN approach, which aims at reducing the power usage in the next generation <b>Energy-Efficient</b> <b>Ethernet.</b> The proposed GreenVLAN approach is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem with the total energy consumption as the objective to be minimized. Besides, we develop a practical heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed model and the complexity of the algorithm is analyzed. Our experiments on both simulated topology and real-world campus network demonstrate that Green-VLAN could achieve considerable power saving (reduce the power consumption of Ethernet links by about 27 %∼ 53 % for a typical VLAN configuration) compared with current VLAN practice.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} is {{an increasingly important}} requirement for computing and communication systems, especially with their increasing pervasiveness. The IEEE 802. 3 az protocol reduces the network energy consumption by turning active copper Ethernet links to a low power model when no traffic exists. However, the effect of 802. 3 az heavily depends on the network traffic patterns which makes system level energy optimization challenging. In clusters, distributed data intensive applications that generate heavy network traffic are common, and in turn the required network devices can consume large amounts of energy. In this research, we examined the 802. 3 az technology {{with the goal of}} applying it in clusters. We defined an energy budget calculator that takes <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>Ethernet</b> into account by including the energy models derived from tests of 802. 3 az enabled devices. The calculator is an integral tool in a global strategy to optimize the energy usage of applications in a high performance computing environment. We show a few practical examples of how real applications can better plan their execution by integrating this knowledge in their decision strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} bandwidth-intensive applications of modern vehicles overstrains traditional field buses and prompted {{the industry to}} consider alternative physical layers, most prominently Ethernet. Developed for consumer requirements, stringent constraints regarding energy consumption are hard to fulfill with standard Ethernet. An alternative is an Ethernet incarnation called <b>Energy-Efficient</b> <b>Ethernet</b> (EEEthernet). The savings on energy are achieved by a special sleep and wake-up pattern that, however, may seriously impact the timing behavior of applications. This paper presents a high-level virtual prototyping approach that models EEEthernet within a SystemC-based simulation framework. The energy consumption {{as well as the}} timing properties of EEEthernet are encapsulated using the concept of power state machines. By embedding the model in a complete model of the E/E architecture including sensors, actuators, ECUs, and other network systems, the system-wide implications of EEEthernet are analyzed in order to guide further design steps. The results show that for typical automotive applications, EEEthernet can tremendously decrease the consumed energy of the link without harmful effects on the timing. But, especially in case of time-critical and spontaneous control loops, guaranteeing a maximum delay requires a careful consideration of the additional wake-up time of EEEthernet. 1...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the energy}} {{consumption}} of network equipment {{has been both}} driven by a need to reduce the ecological footprint of the cloud {{as well as the}} immense energy costs of data centers. As data centers, core networks and consequently, the cloud constantly increase in size, their energy consumption should be mitigated. Ethernet, the most widely used access network still remains the biggest communication technology used in core networks and cloud infrastructures. The <b>Energy-Efficient</b> <b>Ethernet</b> or EEE standard introduced by IEEE in 2010, aims to reduce the energy consumption of EEE ports by transitioning Ethernet ports into a low power mode when traffic is not present. This research aims to assess the benefits of deploying EEE and create a power consumption model for network switches with and without EEE. Our measurements reveal that the energy savings from EEE are not sufficiently significant in medium to small sized networks. However, energy savings are at maximum when the network equipment have a lot of ports and traffic has large downtimes. Hence, we believe that the best use case for EEE is in medium-large computer networks where the equipment is very large and the traffic has a lot of downtime...|$|E
