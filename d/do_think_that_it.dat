6000|$|... "I can't {{give any}} opinion about it, at present," [...] Surajah replied. [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{will add to}} our difficulties, however we may go, but I don't say it cannot be managed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} too dreadful, Frank. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would kill me. I will trust it in your hands altogether. I have only one comfort in this dreadful affair, {{and that is that}} Bertha has Anna with her." ...|$|E
60|$|Jonas said <b>that</b> he <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could be}} set on fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{became very}} wroth, and said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a lie! I <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a lie. I did flatter myself {{that in a}} matter {{concerning}} my own business, and in which I was bound {{to look after the}} welfare of others, he could not have so deceived me; but I find myself as a child--as a baby--in his hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Countess," [...] he answered, [...] "it is {{very strange}} {{to me that you}} should so long have been ignorant of the truth. <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is for the sake of Theos I have planned for the {{overthrow}} of Ughtred of Tyrnaus? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is for your brother's sake that I have smoothed his way to the throne? No! My reward has always been clear before me. I have looked for it always at your hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Savage,' I said, 'I don't {{think much}} of your dreams about snakes that talk to you, but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be well to see Mr. Quatermain. To-day is Sunday and I believe that the African mail sails on Friday. Go to town early to-morrow and book passages.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{by a long}} way. However, {{we shall}} {{be able to look}} forward to the spring, Bertha, when I shall have you all to myself on board, and we shall go on a long cruise together; though I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is ridiculous that I should have to wait until then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am {{with you}} to some extent, Wilcox, and I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a risky thing going up the river. If we were to fill up with cocoa-nuts they would last us for a week anyhow, {{and then when we}} saw another grove of them we could land and load up again.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is, Ned. Your {{mother must}} be really fond {{of this man}} or {{she would not have}} married him. <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> conduces to the comfort of her home to see the {{constant}} antagonism which prevails between you and him? Is it not the fact that this ill temper under which she suffers {{is the result of the}} irritation caused to him by your attitude? Do you not add to her burden rather than relieve it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is at all}} {{necessary}} to keep pigs as dirty as they are usually kept," [...] returned Uncle Randolph.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are incomprehensible," [...] she declared. [...] "Are you, by any chance, {{playing a}} part with me? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is worth while?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is {{a little}} hard," [...] said Augusta with a stamp of her foot, [...] "that, after all that I have gone through, I should be taken off to have my unfortunate back stared at by a Doctor some one or other, and then be shut {{up with a lot}} of musty old wills in a Registry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} be angry {{with him in the}} morning," [...] Godfrey said, [...] "because I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is pardonable; but I shall talk seriously to him about it, and tell him that if he is coming home to England with me he must give up spirits. He has done without them so long that it can't be any hardship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once on the seashore, {{or on the}} Seine, {{it would}} be hard if we could not steal a fishing boat, and cross the Channel. However, one must of course be guided by circumstances. Still, I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be as well to buy the disguises Leigh suggests, without loss of time. I will ride over to Chatillon, tomorrow, and get them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Violet <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would have}} been a great comfort, but {{perceived}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be at some inconvenience; and further divined that to be extremely useful and important was Theodora's ruling desire. She was afraid of heart-burnings, and, as usual, yielded her own wishes, begged Lady Elizabeth not to disturb her plans, made many declarations of Theodora's kindness and attention; and in return, poor thing! was judged by Emma to be in dread of lectures! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "This scheme {{does not}} meet the {{criteria}} in terms of design quality set out in PPS1 and we <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should receive planning permission.".|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Brand at all," [...] Reist answered, fiercely. [...] "It is {{a plot of}} that accursed Russian. Way, good people, way!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is delightful!" [...] Harry said, as {{they sat}} in front of the hut that had been cleared for them, and looked over the plain. [...] "It must be twenty degrees cooler, here, than it was at Prome. I think I shall do nothing tomorrow, Stanley, but just sit here and enjoy myself. I know it is very lazy, for I am feeling quite myself again; still, after ten days' riding, I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will be {{pleasant}} to have a day's rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, {{trying to}} speak lightly. [...] "My boy Larry {{has been trying to}} scare me about the rapparees, and, {{although}} I do not think that there is any danger to be apprehended from them, I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be just as well to hurry on your preparations, as much as possible, and for you and Claire to go in to Limerick tomorrow afternoon. We can finish the packing up of the goods you wish to take, and any we cannot get off tomorrow can be sent in the next day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{want you}} to be hypocritical--if you shouldn't take our side; but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be sweet if the dear old thing could just cling to her illusion. She won't live so very long, probably; she told me the other day she was ready for her final rest; so it wouldn't {{interfere}} much with your freedom. She feels quite romantic about it--your being a Southerner and all, and not naturally in sympathy with Boston ideas, and your meeting her that way in the street and making yourself known to her. She won't believe but what I shall move you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That reminds me," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "of {{the golden}} key I {{picked up on}} the shore. <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would fit this key-hole, Billina?" ...|$|R
5000|$|People <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{the job of}} the {{national}} government to set up and control a police force. They thought it should be under local control.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} again, I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be {{suitable}} to convert this boat into the Company's office.--That unfortunate man, did you relieve him at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{more have}} I, lad," [...] said the captain, smiting his knee emphatically; [...] "the thought has only entered {{my head for}} the first time, but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is we who leave islands such as this to be abused by the human devils you speak of, and who, moreover, are not a whit worse--nay, not so bad--as many civilised human devils, who, in times not long past, and under the cloak of religion, have torn men and tender women limb from limb, and bound them at the stake, and {{tortured}} them on the rack, {{in order to make}} them swallow a false creed." ...|$|E
6000|$|March 23d.--I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the doom laid upon me, {{of murdering}} {{so many of}} the {{brightest}} hours of the day at the Custom-House, that makes such havoc with my wits, for here I am again trying to write worthily, [...] . yet with a sense as if all the noblest part of man had been left out of my composition, or had decayed out of it since my nature was given to my own keeping. [...] . Never comes any bird of Paradise into that dismal region. A salt or even a coal ship is ten million times preferable; for there the sky is above me, and the fresh breeze around me, and my thoughts, having hardly anything to do with my occupation, are as free as air.|$|E
6000|$|If {{all these}} things be true, what follows but a {{demonstration}} of the accursed condition of those among the religious in these nations whose notions put them far off from Jesus, and from venturing their souls upon his bloody death? I have observed such a spirit as this in the world that careth not for knowing of Jesus; the possessed therewith <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not material to salvation to venture upon a crucified Christ, neither do they trouble their heads or hearts with inquiring whether Christ Jesus be risen and ascended into heaven, or whether they see him again or no, but rather are for concluding {{that there will be no}} such thing: these men speak not by the Holly Ghost, for in the sum they call Jesus accursed; but I doubt not to say that many of them are anathematized of God, and shall stand so, till the coming of the Lord Jesus, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.[7] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--I {{have been}} hurt. I am in pain, though I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> signifies. I had better go to a surgeon, {{and then you}} shall hear from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a small}} favour, Meinheer, and I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will matter. Pretoria {{will not}} be besieged much longer; I am under an {{obligation}} to the people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! {{when that}} man gets I don't {{know how many}} guineas from mamma every time he comes, <b>do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is for his {{interest}} that I should get well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say that, Harry," [...] the lad {{said in a}} tone of alarm. [...] "You {{know how}} sympathizing I am, and I know what a comfort it is for you to unburden yourself; but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> won't be {{necessary}} to go into personal descriptions, you know, or to tell me what you said to her or she said to you, because you told me all that ten days ago, also what her tyrannical old father said. But really seriously I am awfully sorry about it all, and if there is anything that I can possibly do for you I shall be only too pleased. I don't see that it would be any advantage for me to go and give the old gentleman my opinion of him; but if you think it would, and can coach me in some of his sore points, we might see how we could work upon them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am very sorry, indeed,' said Mrs Nickleby, who, with Mrs Browdie, {{had stood}} crying and biting {{her fingers in}} a corner, while Kate (very pale, but {{perfectly}} quiet) had kept as near her brother as she could. 'I am very sorry, indeed, for all this. I really don't know what {{would be best to}} do, and that's the truth. Nicholas ought to be the best judge, and I hope he is. Of course, it's a hard thing to have to keep other people's children, though young Mr Snawley is certainly as useful and willing as it's possible for anybody to be; but, if it could be settled in any friendly manner--if old Mr Snawley, for instance, would settle to pay something certain for his board and lodging, and some fair arrangement was come to, so that we undertook to have fish twice a week, and a pudding twice, or a dumpling, or something of that sort--I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be very satisfactory and pleasant for all parties.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But for all that, Millicent," [...] Mark said, [...] "Mrs. Cunningham is right. We quite {{agree that}} there is no {{occasion}} whatever for you to go about labeled 'A good estate and over 70,000 pounds in cash,' but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is right that you should go into society. With the exception of Philip Cotter, Dick Chetwynd, and two or three other of my friends, you really know very few people. You have now gone out of mourning, and I think that Mrs. Cunningham's proposal that you should go down to Bath is a very good one. I shall not be sorry for a change myself, for I have been engrossed in my work for a long time now. I can go down a day or two before you, and get you comfortable lodgings, and will myself stay at a hotel. Although I have no intimate friends beyond those from Reigate, I know a large number of men of fashion from meeting them at the boxing schools and other places, and could introduce you both, and get you into society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was a {{great deal}} more disgusted than surprised," [...] she said rather indignantly. [...] "I <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was fair at all that I should step into Mark's shoes." ...|$|R
3000|$|Facilitator: So can we {{add this}} to {{our list of}} {{maintenance}} factors? Asking for evidence for students’ claims or arguments or explanations? <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> helped to maintain cognitive demand? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is such a}} {{very unusual}} thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through." ...|$|R
