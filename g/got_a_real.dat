500|$|AJ is a mechanic, who is {{described}} as a [...] who [...] "never misses an opportunity for excitement." [...] He is characterised as a free-spirited, fun-loving and carefree rebel, who does not always realise how his spontaneity affects other people. He {{is described}} as cheeky, irresponsible, a bad influence, a joker, a charmer and a talker. It is said that he does not plan or do what people expect of him, is fun to be around and could be running away from life. A writer for the BBC said that he lives [...] "like there's no tomorrow", and makes decisions {{based on the results of}} a coin flip. The coin, described as [...] "lucky", is inspired by the Bollywood film Sholay, in which two friends make decisions based on the flip of a coin, though one friend does not know that both sides of the coin are the same. Ganatra stated in an interview on This Morning that he did not think that the two sides of AJ's coin were the same. Sharma described AJ as [...] "the clown who loves to play" [...] and [...] "a little bit of a hippy", saying [...] "he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> wheeler-dealer, Del Boy aspect to his character." [...] He has twice compared AJ to a puppy dog, because he is nice but annoying, and he is fun but a nuisance.

They praised each of the [...] "superb" [...] guest actors, particularly Harry Enfield, David Baddiel and Sally Phillips, who she thought played Angela [...] "brilliantly". Digital Spy's Neil Wilkes gave the episode a positive review, describing it as [...] "probably the most outrageous of the series to date". He wrote that the tension between Effy and Freddie [...] "set things up nicely" [...] for the following episode, which focused on Freddie. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, thought that the episode included [...] "a lot of confusing straight relationship drama" [...] and {{felt like she was}} [...] "stuck in high school hell". She wrote, however, that the brownie-making scene was [...] "so ridiculous it's kind of funny" [...] and likened Skins to [...] "Gossip Girl on crack". Jason Hughes of TV Squad felt that within the ensemble cast [...] "most of these kids were so unlikable", though he attributed this to the series [...] "show us their weaknesses". He found Pandora to be more likable, however, believing that her innocence was [...] "more representative of youth than most of the other characters".

The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E

These events took place in 1084 and 1086 and the prior date formally figures as a beginning of Brody history in local historiography. Nathan Gelber writes also that Brody was originally a city called [...] "Lubeszów." [...] The last statement needs to be corrected as well. Naming Brody as Lubicz was an unlucky attempt undertaken by the same Stanisław Żółkiewski who used the [...] "Lubicz" [...] from his family's coat of arms.
