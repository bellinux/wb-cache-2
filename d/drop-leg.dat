50|$|The basic {{function}} of a trailer jack is to lift the trailer to a height that allows the trailer to be hitched or unhitched {{to and from the}} towing vehicle. Trailer jacks are also used for leveling the trailer during storage. The most common types of trailer jacks are A-frame jacks, swivel jacks, and <b>drop-leg</b> jacks. Some trailers, such as horse trailers, have a built-in jack at the tongue for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Tactical/military {{holsters}} {{are usually}} made of nylon or plastic. They {{may be made}} in a camouflage pattern to match the wearer's uniform. They are often of a <b>drop-leg</b> design and offer a retention device. Some military holsters still use the old flap design (also {{referred to as a}} [...] "suicide" [...] or [...] "widow maker" [...] holster, which is cumbersome and slow on the draw, but provides greater protection for the holstered firearm against the elements).|$|E
40|$|The RADS (Robust Aerobic Digestion System) {{is a novel}} {{activated}} sludge wastewater treatment plant, designed to treat and digest sludges from wastewater treatment processes. The unit comprises integrated reactor and clarifier chambers within a single vessel. Central to the RADS is a unique arrangement comprising a <b>drop-leg</b> and diffuser which provides process air to the plant and facilitates mixing via a draught tube. The aims {{of this study were}} to quantify the previously unknown operational limits of the system and identify design improvements where possible.
