Manufacturing control {{has been referred to}} as <b>the</b> engi ne <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> while detailed <b>production</b> planning steers <b>the</b> producti on. Manufacturing control ensures that basic operations perform as expec ted by management. Production planning allows management to set goals an d to translate these goals to concrete operational objectives. This thes is focuses on planning for day to day operations. Manufacturing companies are often confronted with cha nges, caused either by the client or the supplier. Examples are signific ant fluctuations in customer demand, business opportunities for new type s of production, mergers, lack or abundance of personnel, etc. Manufactu ring industry recognizes <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> a company to a dapt to these changes (sometimes also referred to as flexible <b>production).</b> <b>The</b> thesis proposes a number of software architectura l assets that are part of a product line for the holonic manufacturing e xecution systems developed at PMA K. U. Leuven. This product line facilita tes the development and maintenance of implementations for these holonic manufacturing execution systems. These execution systems predict future behavior and proactively take measures to prevent production problems from occurring. The thesis proposes and evaluates an integrated appro ach for manufacturing control and manufacturing planning. The approach a llows to construct a single system that fulfills both functionalities, w hile allowing for improved support for changes from either client or sup plier side. The system takes into account the output from a plann ing algorithm. It increases <b>the</b> usability <b>of</b> a planning (for instance by including transportation or warehouse management during execution). The system uses <b>the</b> capabilities <b>of</b> a holonic manufac turing execution system to execute the planning. The execution system pr ovides local short term <b>forecasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> and responds to unex pected events (such as machine breakdowns). The local short term <b>forecasts</b> make <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimisation concrete for the stakeholders involved in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> process. <b>The</b> thesis evaluates this integrated approach in a nu mber <b>of</b> experiments. <b>The</b> experiments show an improved responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holonic Manufacturing Execution Systems towards breakdowns. Both the variation and the average performance suffer less from a breakdown compared to an approach where the HMES only executes the planning or uses no planning at all. This responsiveness is achieved while maintaining a g ood separation <b>of</b> concerns. On <b>the</b> one hand, every planning system can be used unmodified. The HMES adds responsiveness to the functionality the planning system already off ers. On the other hand, the HMES compensates for possible simplification s in the planning system.

30|$|Hubbert was {{the first}} scholar to use forward curve fitting. Hubbert pointed out {{bell-shaped}} curve regularity of fossil energy development (Hubbert 1949). In 1956, Hubbert used a hand-drawn bell-shaped curve to forecast oil <b>production</b> in <b>the</b> 48 contiguous states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USA. According to his prediction, <b>the</b> US oil <b>production</b> would peak in the early 1970 s and then decrease (Hubbert 1956). This prediction was confirmed by <b>the</b> actual oil <b>production.</b> Because of this successful prediction and the social concern about oil shortage, using bell-shaped curves to predict oil production has become especially popular. More and more scholars have begun to join in <b>the</b> <b>forecasting</b> <b>of</b> oil <b>production.</b> <b>The</b> <b>forecasting</b> method used by Hubbert has been adopted by {{more and more people}} and is named the “Hubbert model.” Although many scholars used this method, Hubbert had not given <b>the</b> specific formula <b>of</b> <b>the</b> method and its derivation. Until 1982, for the first time, Hubbert published the full formula and derivation process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hubbert model (Hubbert 1982). Since then, Hubbert model has been widely used.|$|R

This paper investigates the possible synergy between these players to jointly improve <b>the</b> <b>production</b> predictability while ensuring a low carbon mobility.

Finally, a resolution method is presented which achieve an time-efficient optimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power flow for each vehicle, based on upstream computed charging policies.

This includes short term (few hours in advance) <b>forecast</b> errors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>production.</b> However their importance is subject to the so called aggregation effect and cannot be considered as a linear function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> installed capacity. Furthermore this aggregation effect highly depends on the considered geographical perimeter. In this paper we presents a methodology to estimate <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> short term <b>forecast</b> error at any spatial scale and we apply the methodology in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> France, and regions of France. Before simulating forecast error, we describe the methodology used to simulate hourly wind power and solar power production at any location. Wind power is simulated through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a statistically calibrated power curve a spatio-temporal field of win simulation obtained from <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a meteorological model in reanalysis mode.

40|$|The {{well known}} “Hubbert curve” assumes that <b>the</b> <b>production</b> curve <b>of</b> a crude {{oil in a}} free market economy is “bell shaped” and symmetric. The model was first applied in the 1950 s as a way <b>of</b> <b>forecasting</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> crude oil in the US lower 48 states. Today, {{variants}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model are often used for describing <b>the</b> worldwide <b>production</b> <b>of</b> crude oil, {{which is supposed to}} reach a global production peak (“peak oil”) and to decline afterwards. The model has also been shown to be generally valid for mineral resources other than crude oil and also for slowly renewable biological resources such as whales. Despite its widespread use, Hubbert’s modelis sometimes criticized for being arbitrary and its underlying assumptions are rarely examined. In the present work, we use a simple model to generate the bell shaped curve curve using the smallest possible number of assumptions, taking also into account the “Energy Return to Energy Invested” (EROI or EROEI) parameter. We show that this model can reproduce several historical cases, even for resources other than crude oil, and provide a useful tool for understanding <b>the</b> general mechanisms <b>of</b> resource exploitation and <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> energy <b>production</b> in <b>the</b> world’s economy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to develop a pragmatic system of a {{production}} throughput forecasting system for an automated test operation in a hard drive manufacturing plant. The accurate forecasting result is necessary for the management team to response to any changes in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> processes and <b>the</b> resources allocations. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we design a production throughput forecasting system in an automated test operation in hard drive manufacturing plant. In the proposed system, consists of three main stages. In the first stage, a mutual information method was adopted for selecting the relevant inputs into the forecasting model. In the second stage, a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) was implemented in the forecasting model development phase. Finally, forecasting accuracy was improved by searching the optimal smoothing parameter which selected from comparisons result among three optimization algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO), unrestricted search optimization (USO) and interval halving optimization (IHO). Findings: The experimental result shows that (1) <b>the</b> developed <b>production</b> throughput forecasting system using GRNN is able to provide forecasted results close to actual values, and to projected <b>the</b> future trends <b>of</b> <b>production</b> throughput in an automated hard disk drive test operation; (2) An IHO algorithm performed as superiority appropriate optimization method than the other two algorithms. (3) Compared with current forecasting system in manufacturing, the results show that the proposed system’s performance is superior to the current system in prediction accuracy and suitable for real-world application. Originality/value: <b>The</b> <b>production</b> throughput volume is a key performance index of hard disk drive manufacturing systems that need to be <b>forecast.</b> Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> throughput <b>forecasting</b> result is useful information for management team to respond to any changing in production processes and resources allocation. However, a practically forecasting system for production throughput has not been described in detail yet. The experiments were conducted on a real data set from the final testing operation of hard disk drive manufacturing factory by using Visual Basics Application on Microsoft Excel© to develop preliminary forecasting system on testing and verification process.
