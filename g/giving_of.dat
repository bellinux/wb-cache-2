5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali, also spelled Dakshinakaali, is {{the most}} popular form of Kaali in Bengal. There are various {{versions}} for the origin of the name Dakshinakaali. Dakshina refers to the gift given to a priest before performing a ritual or to one's guru. Such gifts are traditionally given with the right hand. Daksinakaali's two right hands are usually depicted in gestures of blessing and <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> boons. One version of the origin of her name comes from the story of Yama, lord of death, who lives in the south (daksina). When Yama heard Kali's name, he fled in terror, and so those who worship Kali are said to be able to overcome death itself.|$|E

Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E

5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} lies with the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{were highly}} ritualized, {{particularly}} for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife, but as a concubine. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered {{more important than the}} mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry. However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee. Her children {{would not be allowed to}} go with her.|$|E
5|$|Texas A {{provides}} {{many opportunities}} for students to participate in volunteer and service activities. Students at Texas A originated The Big Event, the largest one-day student-run service project in the nation. The annual event began in 1983 after the Texas A Student Government Association passed a resolution encouraging students to show their gratitude to the community by <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> their time. From its beginnings of sixindividual students wanting to contribute back to the local community, The Big Event has expanded to allow over twenty-two thousand students to participate in over 2500jobs, such as raking leaves, painting houses, and trimming trees. The concept for The Big Event has spread throughout the nation, and as of 2015, 110 schools across the nation participate each year including 1middle school, 2high schools, and 68universities. The 2008 Big Event attracted 10,600 students who worked a record number of 1,000 jobs.|$|E

5|$|Both Shaivism and Vaishnavism flourished {{during the}} Badami Chalukya period, though {{it seems the}} former was more popular. Famous temples were built {{in places such as}} Pattadakal, Aihole and Mahakuta, and priests (archakas) were invited from {{northern}} India. Vedic sacrifices, religious vows (vrata) and the <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> gifts (dana) was important. The Badami kings were initially followers of Vedic Hinduism and dedicated temples to popular Hindu deities in Aihole. Sculptures of deities testify to the popularity of Hindu Gods such as Vishnu, Shiva, Kartikeya, Ganapathi, Shakti, Surya and Sapta Matrikas ("seven mothers"). The Badami kings also performed the Ashwamedha ("horse sacrifice"). The worship of Lajja Gauri, a fertility goddess is known. Jainism too was a prominent religion during this period. The kings of the dynasty were however secular and actively encouraged Jainism. One of the Badami Cave temples is dedicated to the Jain faith. Jain temples were also erected in the Aihole complex, the temple at Maguti being one such example. Ravikirti, the court poet of PulakeshinII was a Jain. Queen Vinayavati consecrated a temple for the Trimurti ("Hindu trinity") at Badami. Sculptures of the Trimurti, Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva) and Ardhanarishwara (half Shiva, half woman) provide ample evidence of their tolerance. Buddhism was on a decline, having made its ingress into Southeast Asia. This is confirmed by the writings of Hiuen-Tsiang. Badami, Aihole, Kurtukoti and Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar in the Gadag district) were primary places of learning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, {{parliament}} usually met in Stirling Castle or the Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh, which was rebuilt on {{the orders of}} Mary Queen of Scots from 1561. King Charles I ordered the construction of Parliament Hall, {{at the expense of}} the Edinburgh burgesses, which was built between 1633 and 1639 and remained the parliament's home until it was dissolved in 1707. By the end of the Middle Ages the Parliament had evolved from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a 'colloquium' with a political and judicial role. The attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and burgh commissioners joined them to form the Three Estates. It acquired significant powers over particular issues, including consent for taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic. Much of the legislative business of the Scottish parliament was carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the Lords of the Articles, chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. Like many continental assemblies the Scottish Parliament was being called less frequently by the early sixteenth century and might have been dispensed with by the crown had it not been for the series of minorities and regencies that dominated from 1513. The crown was also able to call a Convention of Estates, which was quicker to assemble and could issue laws like parliament, making them invaluable in a crisis, but they could only deal with a specific issue and were more resistant to the <b>giving</b> <b>of</b> taxation rights to the crown.|$|E
