50|$|<b>King</b> <b>plank</b> - A flat, notched (nibbed) timber laid {{over the}} {{foredeck}} beams between {{the front of}} a cockpit or cabin and the stem. The notches or nibbs are designed so that the tapering deck planks do not end in a point which could be a weak point.|$|E
5000|$|The Lockwood's nine-log {{bottom is}} original, using locally-harvested pitch pine timbers. The keel log is 6 in thick, with four outer logs {{on each side}} {{tapering}} to 2.5 in. The logs are connected with wrought iron bolts. The hull form is round-bottomed with a sharp entry and stern making her double-ended, and derives its shape from the original log canoe prototype. A [...] "patent stern" [...] is framed above the sternpost to widen the rear deck area. Framing and planking is used above the logs to add freeboard, with oak transverse frames 24 in apart from the keel log to the top sheer strake supporting 1.5 in oak planking. The sheer strake is oak, 2.5 in by 8 in. Planking is fastened with galvanized bolts. The centerboard, which allows better performance to windward while retailing a shallow draft, {{is located in a}} pine trunk fastened to the keel log. Decking is 2¼" [...] × 4" [...] fir laid fore-and-aft, supported on beams joining the frames. A <b>king</b> <b>plank,</b> composed of two 3½" [...] × 4" [...] boards, runs beneath the deck from the stem to the hatch abaft the foremast. A main hatch is located amidships between the masts, and a small cabin is abaft the mainmast. A small box for the steering gear is at the extreme stern.|$|E
50|$|The Rebecca T. Ruark is {{a typical}} sloop-rigged skipjack, built for the shallow draft, low {{freeboard}} and high stability needed to work the Chesapeake Bay oyster beds. She has a rounded chine with a sharp, convex clipper bow on a sloop hull. The Ruark is fore-and-aft planked. Her wood plug rudder is carried well forward beneath the transom, astern of the centerboard. As part of her 2000 U.S. Coast Guard certification to carry passengers for hire she received a watertight bulkhead ahead of the mast. An aluminum hatch provides access into the new space, which is used for sail and line storage. The deck is 2 in fir forward of the main hatch and pressure-treated pine aft. Deck beams are oak, with two 11.5 in <b>king</b> <b>planks</b> running from the bow to the main hatch. A central hatch measures 55 in long by 64.75 in wide. Behind the hatch is a small trunk cabin with a three-sided doghouse aft, with double doors leading from the doghouse to the hold. A fuel tank for the push boat is on the starboard side of the cabin. Pipe rails have been added for passenger carriage.|$|R
