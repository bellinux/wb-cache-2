5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver <b>delegates</b> <b>to</b> {{nominate}} a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their <b>delegates</b> <b>to</b> vote for a specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention. With a two-thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have {{to vote for the}} same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E

Later that year, Darwaza resigned from the AHC due to the Mufti's unbending attitude towards wider representation.|$|E

5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the <b>delegates</b> <b>to</b> a party congress the power to elect the general secretary, the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} Central Committee from one-fourth to one-third, holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, empowering <b>delegates</b> <b>to</b> self-nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one. These suggestions, with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier, were rejected at the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee in January 2005.|$|E

5|$|LeMonde resurfaces in Pyongyang, where North Korean ruler Kym Zung-Lee invites several {{world leaders}} to a peace conference. The two plan to kidnap the world leaders, {{especially}} since Kim financed LeMonde's operations in Indocine {{and getting the}} nuclear weapon (stashed inside Kim Il-sung's statue on Mansudae Hill). Using a small helicopter and nonlethal weapons, the player is able to spirit the <b>delegates</b> <b>to</b> a French frigate somewhere in the Taedong River and {{get them out of}} the country; other delegates left behind are sent to bomb shelters or are evacuated by STRIKE Chinook transports.

5|$|Only Maryland and New York had yet {{to authorize}} {{independence}} {{towards the end of}} June. Previously, Maryland's delegates had walked out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the Annapolis Convention for instructions. On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its <b>delegates</b> <b>to</b> remain against independence. But Samuel Chase went to Maryland and, thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28. Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the New York Provincial Congress told the <b>delegates</b> <b>to</b> wait. But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.|$|E
