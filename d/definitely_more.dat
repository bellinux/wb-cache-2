25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is <b>definitely</b> <b>more.</b> I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is <b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E

500|$|Illmatic {{was one of}} {{the first}} major {{recordings}} to emerge from New York's burgeoning hardcore hip hop scene, at a time when much of East Coast hip hop was still dominated by alternative hip hop acts such as A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul (groups often known for their jazz-inspired production and playful sensibilities). Adam Heimlich of The New York Press comments on the appeal of alternative hip-hop in New York City's music scene, and points out that, [...] "In 1994, there appeared likely to be more money (and <b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> cultural rewards) in working with Arrested Development or Digable Planets." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the assault}} of Rihanna's boyfriend Chris Brown on her, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} as to whether any song featured on the upcoming album would be about him. Producer Chuck Harmony mused {{that no matter what}} song Rihanna released as the lead single from the record, it would immediately be looked at as referring to Brown. During an interview with Marc Malkin at the MTV Video Music Awards, American singer-songwriter Ne-Yo stated that listeners should expect an [...] "edgier" [...] and [...] "angrier" [...] Rihanna on the album. He later told In Touch Weekly that the album is <b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> menacing than Rihanna's prior work, describing the album as [...] "liberated". The album was released under the title Rated R in November 2009.|$|E
500|$|Film score {{composer}} James Newton Howard {{was approached}} by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense. [...] "He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me", Howard said. [...] "I've never had a director do that for me." [...] Shyamalan wanted a [...] "singularity" [...] tone for the music. [...] "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it," [...] Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. [...] "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, {{and it would have}} been great, but there is something about the sound of that church studio," [...] Howard remarked. [...] "It's <b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> misterioso." ...|$|E

Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said {{he did not want to}} hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E

Darren {{is due to}} go on a date he has arranged and Nancy comes to watch him, Darren's date does not arrive. As the evening continues, the pair realise there is an attraction between them and agree to go home together. Dawson said that the pair have [...] "always sort of hated each other" [...] as they are opposites, explaining that [...] "She's a feminist and he's a male chauvinist pig!" [...] He felt for the pair to begin {{a relationship}} is a [...] "case of opposites attracting - for some reason it works". Dawson added that through the pair's [...] "pompous ways" [...] they have both been through [...] "hard times and been through them with each other because they've known each other for so long". He commented that the pair have [...] "never seen eye-to-eye, but I think that when they sit down and chat they realise they have a lot more in common than they think. In the past they just didn't want to accept that". E4 described the relationship this way: [...] "She's chalk and he's <b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> than a bit cheesy, but there you have it; Darren and Nancy (Dancy) are now officially an item!

500|$|Supernova {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Bret Love of Allmusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of five, calling it [...] "a wonderful album of varying moods and textures." [...] Leila Cobo of Billboard magazine named the album an [...] "accomplished work that highlights a more introspective and versatile Rubalcaba." [...] On the album review, Cobo also commented that [...] "this [...] is a refreshing outing." [...] All About Jazz' Mark Corroto {{stated that the}} album proves that the performer [...] "has plenty of heart rooted in a traditional Cuban music past and a head pointed into a diverse North American future." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters stated that Supernova is a [...] "wonderful record, that proves that Rubalcaba {{is one of the}} greatest composers and pianist in the world," [...] but was critical about the lack of emotional commitment to his music, concluding that the album would work better on an audience that never heard the performer before. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ grade, arguing that it [...] "neatly showcases Rubalcaba's strengths: unerring yet playful rhythm, technical ferocity when required, burnished balladry, and Cuban swagger blended with jazz suavity." [...] George Tysh of Metro Times stated that Supernova [...] "incorporates both Rubalcaba personalities, being more percussively rhythmic (<b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> Latin) than Inner Voyage, but still as sensitive." [...] Jazz Review granted the album a perfect score of five stars, with Don Williamson stating that the album [...] "continues to prove that Rubalcaba is dedicated to the authenticity, the tradition and the spirit of the Cuban music he studied and which is part of his being." [...] The Rubalcaba's biography included on the book Jazz for Dummies (2006) by Dick Sutro, emphasizes that the album founds the performer on his peak form.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the focus}} was spent on {{updating}} Modern Warfares visuals {{in order to bring}} them up to modern standards. Enhancements of the environments and vistas were achieved using a procedure called [...] "Paint-over", with a larger amount of onscreen objects and effects being integrated into them. Raven also wanted to give the environments a sense of place and history to avoid feeling generic. The vast majority of objects were remodeled, with the game using improved texture depth, physically-based rendering, and light-reflection; and additional features such as realistic physics and joints employed for movable objects like character models. Raven paid close attention to improving all guns in the game because, as a developer explained, [...] "We needed to take the weapons up to the same level of personality as the characters"; each received better dynamics, alterations made to their firing mechanisms, and a new feature in the series that allowed each type to eject shell casings unique to that weapon. However, issues arose during the remastering of the game's graphics as the remaster used a heavily upgraded version of the series' engine. As a result, this meant that several of the original's visual assets were not compatible with the new technology, so the developers were necessitated to remake them. Most of the existing motion capture animation was redone for the same reason, as well as to provide further story exposition. The campaign saw a number of new first-person animations added for further immersion and emotional responses from players, and to improve how the camera made use of the player character's body, enhancing the [...] "body sense". Pellas said, [...] "I think that for [...] campaign, we were <b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> liberal with our animations and additions, as long as they enhanced the true intent of the moment." [...] The artificial intelligence of non-player characters was also improved to respond more realistically with the environment, and vice versa, such as long grass reacting to the player character's presence.|$|E

2500|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} Slade in Flame and commented: [...] "Because Flame {{is set in}} the 1960s, {{the album}} has a distinctive 1960's flavour, which should take a few of us hopping down memory lane. Because the songs have been taken out of context, a few of them have lost their charm and meaning but nevertheless, it is an enjoyable elpee." [...] In 1976, Record Mirror would voted the album No. 5 on their list of the Top 10 best albums of 1975. Disc said: [...] "This is the album from Slade's debut film. The group that's playing is not supposed to be them but the music included here certainly sounds like the Slade we all know and love. Only occasionally, do they stray from the usual mould. A touchy album but <b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> good than bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the goals}} of BioShock 2s {{developers}} was to capitalize or improve aspects of the first game that were received less positively. One such element was the Pipe Mania-inspired hacking minigame. Thomas said that even players who enjoyed the minigames became [...] "numb" [...] to it after repetition; {{the replacement of the}} mini game with hacking that didn't allow you to pause the game added more urgency to the gameplay. Another aspect was the choice to harvest or save Little Sisters; by allowing players to adopt the Little Sisters before deciding their fate, Thomas hoped it would help players form a bond with the characters and think about their choice. Among the other goals the developers had for the sequel was adding more unspliced characters and give players a greater chance to make decisions that impacted the course of the game. [...] "You make decisions about their fate as well, all of which play into the way the story ends," [...] Thomas said. [...] "There's <b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> granularity and dynamism in the narrative of BioShock 2." [...] The game uses Unreal Engine 2.5.|$|E

60|$|About {{four years}} and a quarter later--to be exact, it was {{four years and}} four months--Mr. and Mrs. Capes stood side by side upon an old Persian carpet that did duty as a {{hearthrug}} in the dining-room of their flat and surveyed a shining dinner-table set for four people, lit by skilfully-shaded electric lights, brightened by frequent gleams of silver, and carefully and simply adorned with sweet-pea blossom. Capes had altered scarcely at all during the interval, except for a new quality of smartness in the cut of his clothes, but Ann Veronica was nearly half an inch taller; her face was at once stronger and softer, her neck firmer and rounder, and her carriage <b>definitely</b> <b>more</b> womanly {{than it had been}} in the days of her rebellion. She was a woman now to the tips of her fingers; she had said good-bye to her girlhood in the old garden four years and a quarter ago. She was dressed in a simple evening gown of soft creamy silk, with a yoke of dark old embroidery that enhanced the gentle gravity of her style, and her black hair flowed off her open forehead to pass under the control of a simple ribbon of silver. A silver necklace enhanced the dusky beauty of her neck. Both husband and wife affected an unnatural ease of manner for the benefit of the efficient parlor-maid, who was putting the finishing touches to the sideboard arrangements.|$|E
