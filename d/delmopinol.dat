40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>delmopinol</b> and fluoride alone or in combination on acid adaptation and acid production in plaque biofilm bacteria in vitro. DESIGN: The effect of <b>delmopinol</b> and fluoride on acid adaptation was tested by exposing the biofilm bacteria, grown in a mini-flow cell system under static conditions, to pH 5. 5 overnight {{in the presence of}} 0. 16 mM <b>delmopinol,</b> 1 mF NaF or a combination of both. The following day, acid adaptation was evaluated by exposing the cells to an acid challenge for 2 h at a pH known to kill non-adapted cells (pH 2. 5). The cells were stained using LIVE/DEAD BacLight Viability stain and the number of viable (acid tolerant) cells was determined using confocal scanning laser microscopy. Control cells were treated in the same manner but without the exposure to <b>delmopinol</b> or fluoride. How <b>delmopinol</b> and fluoride affected acid production was assessed by measuring the pH-drop after glucose pulsing in the presence of <b>delmopinol</b> and/or different concentrations of fluoride. RESULTS: Fluoride alone or in combination with <b>delmopinol</b> affected the acid adaptation and significantly reduced the acid tolerance of the plaque biofilm. This effect was more pronounced when the two compounds were combined. <b>Delmopinol</b> alone did not affect acid adaptation. A combination of <b>delmopinol</b> and fluoride also reduced acid production at concentrations where neither of the compounds in isolation had an effect. CONCLUSION: Fluoride and <b>delmopinol</b> can work synergistically to affect acid adaptation and acid production in plaque biofilm bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Background: Denture-related {{stomatitis}} {{is probably}} {{the most common form of}} oral candidiasis and its reported prevalence varies widely ranging up to 65 %. In this thorough study, we evaluate the effect of <b>Delmopinol</b> application on Candida albicans adherence on heat cured denture base acrylic resin. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 specimens of heat-cured acrylic resin were made, 20 specimens were contaminated before <b>Delmopinol</b> treatment and 20 specimens were contaminated after <b>Delmopinol</b> treatment. The each specimen in each tube was individually transferred to a spectrophotometer at 530 nm wavelength in order to measure the turbidity degree, through the transmittance. Aliquots of 10 μL of each tube was then collected and inoculated into agar sabouraud plates containing 500 mMol/L of sucrose, which was incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C, in order to check microbial growth. Results: Mean of the turbidity Degree of contamination after <b>Delmopinol</b> application (1440. 80, colony-forming unit [CFU] [× 10 6 /ml]) was significantly higher than the mean of the turbidity degree of contamination before <b>Delmopinol</b> application (550. 85 CFU [× 10 6 /ml]). Conclusion: Heat-cured acrylic resin shows greater reduction in adherence of Candida albicans by contamination after <b>Delmopinol</b> application as compared with contamination before <b>Delmopinol</b> application...|$|E
40|$|Context: Mouthrinses are used, {{by many of}} our patients, as a {{complement}} to daily dental hygiene routine. The use of a toothbrush and an interproximal cleaning method {{may not be enough}} to control dental plaque. Essential oils and <b>delmopinol</b> mouth rinses are effective for the prevention of dental caries and gingivitis. To study the effect of an essential oil and a <b>delmopinol</b> mouth rinse on dental plaque bacteria, an in vitro study was developed. Aims: The objective of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity of an essential oil and a <b>delmopinol</b> mouth rinse on Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacilli, and aerobic and anaerobic dental plaque nonspecific bacteria. Design: Samples of human dental plaque were collected from consenting participants and bacteria isolated. Disk-diffusion tests were performed to obtain the minimum concentration of the mouth rinses necessary to inhibit bacterial growth. The ability of the commercial mouth rinses to inhibit bacterial growth was studied in comparison to a positive control (0. 2 % chlorhexidine) and a negative laboratorial control (sterilized water). Results: The minimum inhibitory concentration was found to be inferior to the commercial essential oils and <b>delmopinol</b> mouth rinses concentrations. <b>Delmopinol</b> and essential oils have significant antibacterial properties shown in vitro only for aerobic bacteria, and for S. mutans, Lactobacillus, and anaerobic bacteria, the results were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Essential oils and chlorhexidine are statistically similar and better than <b>delmopinol</b> for aerobic bacteria growth inhibition. For the other bacteria, essential oils and <b>delmopinol</b> are not statistically promising. Results show that essential oils only may help patients to maintain good oral health as {{a complement}} to daily brushing and interproximal cleaning...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} a possible dose-response effect of <b>delmopinol</b> hydrochloride, on the development of plaque and on the healing of gingivitis. 64 healthy male volunteers, aged 18 - 40 years with healthy gingivae and clean teeth, participated. During a 2 -week period, the participants refrained from all oral hygiene and rinsed 2 x daily with a placebo solution. On day 14 of the study, they received professional toothcleaning, and were randomly assigned to 4 groups. For the following 2 weeks, they rinsed 2 x daily for 1 min with 10 ml of 0. 05 % (15 subjects), 0. 1 % (17) or 0. 2 % (16) <b>delmopinol,</b> respectively. 16 subjects rinsed with 0. 2 % chlorhexidine. No oral hygiene procedures were performed during the test period. On days 0, 14 and 28, gingival bleeding index and the presence of stainable plaque were determined. Periodic identical photographs were used for planimetric determination of buccal plaque extension. No significant difference for the reduction in gingival bleeding index was found between 0. 2 % <b>delmopinol</b> and chlorhexidine rinsing. The mean plaque index showed its most significant reduction on lingual surfaces of both upper and lower jaws when rinsing with 0. 2 % <b>delmopinol.</b> Mean plaque extension was reduced by 23 % for 0. 05 %, 39 % for 0. 1 % and 55 % for 0. 2 % <b>delmopinol.</b> A significant dose-response effect for 0. 05 %, 0. 1 % and 0. 2 % <b>delmopinol</b> was found for gingival bleeding index, plaque index and plaque extension. The results show that <b>delmopinol</b> favors the healing of gingivitis and reduces plaque formation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Delmopinol</b> is a {{tertiary}} amine surfactant {{that is used}} {{to counteract}} dental plaque formation. As it is of interest to understand the interfacial behavior from both fundamental and applied perspectives the adsorption of <b>delmopinol</b> to model surfaces was investigated. Adsorption on Teflon, titanium and stainless steel was studied by radioactive labeling and adsorption on silica was studied by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), ellipsometry and particle electrophoresis. It was shown that the adsorption of <b>delmopinol</b> was complex and strongly influenced by pH and concentration. Pronounced peak values were detected in the adsorption curves (adsorbed amount versus concentration) exceeding the expected value for a bilayer type of structure. To account for this behavior two surface active component were assumed to be present. Accordingly, the high amounts result from the deposition of the component with lower solubility and the decrease at the critical micelle concentration can be explained by solubilization of this component. Based on data from several experimental methods and the pH dependence of the effect we propose an explanation in which the protonated and non-protonated forms of <b>delmopinol</b> represent the two components. However, it cannot be excluded that the component with the lower solubility could be a compound chemically different from <b>delmopinol</b> in the sample...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, 6 -month {{clinical}} trial with parallel group design in 162 patients with gingivitis {{divided into three}} rinsing groups was conducted in order to study the efficacy and safety of a flavoured solution of <b>delmopinol</b> hydrochloride 2 mg ml- 1 (0. 2 % w/v, Decapinol Mouthwash®) used for supervised mouthrinsing in one rinsing group, in comparison with chlorhexidine digluconate 2 mg ml- 1 (0. 2 % w/v, Hibitane Dental®) in a second rinsing group, and placebo in the third group. The criteria of the Plaque Index (PI) {{were used to assess}} plaque formation. Bleeding on probing (BOP) {{to the bottom of the}} pocket with a standard pressure was used as the primary gingivitis assessment. The occurrence of supragingival dental calculus and extrinsic tooth staining were also assessed. In addition, patients were asked to report adverse events at each visit. RESULTS: <b>Delmopinol</b> and chlorhexidine exhibited lower scores of the mean PI and the BOP percentage than placebo, both at the 3 -month and 6 -month examinations. Furthermore, both active solutions showed a higher extent of staining of the teeth than placebo during these two observation periods. Rinsing with chlorhexidine resulted in more dental calculus than placebo after 6 months. Chlorhexidine showed lower scores for plaque formation and gingivitis development but higher scores of supragingival dental calculus (after 6 months) and tooth staining than did <b>delmopinol.</b> Both active solutions were reported by the patients-approximately to the same extent but more frequently than placebo- to induce taste alterations and a transient anaesthetic sensation of the oral mucosa. However, subjective staining of the teeth and tongue was reported by 16 % of the <b>delmopinol</b> patients, but by 86 % of the patients rinsing with chlorhexidine for 6 months. Furthermore, 24 % of the patients in the chlorhexidine group, 9 % in the <b>delmopinol</b> group and 4 % in the placebo group wished to withdraw from treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this {{clinical trial}} indi- cate that supervised rinsing with 0. 2 % <b>delmopinol</b> hydrochloride or with 0. 2 % chlorhexidine digluconate twice daily for 60 s as a supplement to normal mechanical oral hygiene procedures resulted in less plaque formation and gingivitis than rinsing with placebo. Although chlorhexidine was more effective than <b>delmopinol</b> regarding plaque formation and gingivitis, it was considered by the patients as less tolerable. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Several {{chemical}} agents {{have been used}} to aid in the removal of dental plaque and to prevent or decrease the occurrence of oral diseases, Defining the interactions of {{chemical agents}} and saliva contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms involved in chemical plaque control. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the salivary interactions between two antiplaque agents and saliva and microorganisms at defined solid/liquid and air liquid interfaces. The plaque control agents used in this study were <b>delmopinol</b> and chlorhexidine in varying concentrations. Sample of polled whole saliva collected from 16 subjects were used for adsorption experiments to solid surfaces. Whole saliva from one individual was used to study the adsorption of chemical agents to bacterial cell walls. Whole saliva samples from five subjects were used to study the binding or precipitation of salivary components by the antiplaque agents in solution. The interactions between the chemical antiplaque agents and the salivary components were investigated with ellipsometry, tensitometry, electrophoresis, video-densitometry, electrobloting, and radiolabeling. The results indicate that chlorhexidine is a surface active compound that has the capability to adsorb onto bare solid surfaces of well-defined chemical characteristics and onto surfaces preconditioned with salivary films. Chlorhexidine and <b>delmopinol</b> were shown to have binding sites for salivary proteins and to induce precipitation of salivary proteins. <b>Delmopinol</b> appears to precipitate more high molecular weight salivary proteins than chlorhexidine. It was also demonstrated that the composition of saliva as well as the concentration of chlorhexidine or <b>delmopinol</b> play a role in the amount of salivary proteins precipitated. In addition, chlorhexidine and <b>delmopinol</b> were round to bind to the salivary films coating the tested bacteria. The substantivities of both agents are related to their binding capabilities to salivary proteins. Thus, interactions between chemical agents and salivary components influence the availability of salivary components to the biofilms...|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{clinical}} part of {{this study}} aimed to investigate whether the racemate of <b>delmopinol</b> [(+/-) -delmopinol] is equivalent to its two enantiomers [(+) -delmopinol and (-) -delmopinol] with respect to efficiency and to determine and compare their pharmacokinetic properties. The purpose of the pre-clinical part was to elucidate possible differences in antimicrobial efficiency. Materials and methods The compounds were tested clinically in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study comprising three treatment periods of 4 days each. The antimicrobial efficacy of the enantiomers was compared in vitro with respect to planktonic and biofilm bacteria of different species. Results No statistically significant differences in prevention of plaque formation were observed. Except for a somewhat higher systemic exposure in terms of AUC and C-max indicated for (-) -delmopinol compared to (+) -delmopinol, the pharmacokinetic properties were similar. The most common adverse event was a transient anaesthetic feeling in the mouth. This event was reported with the same frequency for all three test solutions. The enantiomers showed similar antimicrobial effects on planktonic bacteria and their biofilms. Conclusions The enantiomers {{were found to be}} equally effective with respect to inhibition of plaque development and only minor differences were observed with respect to their pharmacokinetic properties. No differences could be observed in the adverse events reports. There is, therefore, no reason to use one of the enantiomers of <b>delmopinol</b> instead of the racemate. This was further supported by the antimicrobial tests. It is suggested that the combined action of cationic and neutral <b>delmopinol</b> is important for its effect on biofilms...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of human}} whole saliva (HWS) onto silica and hydroxyapatite surfaces (HA) {{was followed by}} quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and ellipsometry. The influence of different surface properties and adsorption media (water and PBS) on the HWS adsorption was studied. The viscoelastic properties of the saliva films formed onto the solid surfaces were estimated {{by the use of}} the Voigt-based viscoelastic film model. Furthermore, the efficiency of SDS and <b>delmopinol</b> to elute the adsorbed saliva film from the surfaces was investigated at different surfactant concentrations. It was observed a biphasic kinetic regime for the adsorption of saliva on the silica and HA surfaces, indicating the formation of a rigidly coupled first layer corresponding to an initial adsorption of small proteins and a more loosely bound second layer. The results further showed a higher adsorption of HWS onto the HA surfaces compared to the silica surfaces in both adsorption media (PBS and water). The adsorption in PBS led to higher adsorbed amounts on both surfaces as compared to water. SDS was found to be more efficient in removing the saliva film from both surfaces than <b>delmopinol.</b> The salivary film was found to be less tightly bound on to the silica surfaces since more saliva film could be removed with both SDS and <b>delmopinol</b> compared to from the HA surface. When saliva was adsorbed from PBS a higher energy dissipation was determined implying that a softer saliva layer is build up in PBS as opposed to in water. In the same media (water) a softer saliva layer was formed onto the HA surfaces, while in PBS the saliva layer formed at both surfaces seems to have similar structure...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Poor {{oral hygiene}} {{is a major}} risk factor for oral diseases. Regular home-based care is {{essential}} to maintain good oral hygiene. In particular, mouthrinses can support conventional tooth brushing in reducing accumulation of oral plaque. Areas covered: The most common molecules contained in mouthrinses (chlorhexidine, essential oils, cetyl pyridinium chloride, triclosan, octeneidine, <b>delmopinol,</b> polyvinylpyrrolidone, hyaluronic acid, natural compounds) are discussed, together with relevant clinical and in vitro studies, focusing on their effects on periodontal health. Currently, chlorhexidine is the most efficacious compound, with both antiplaque and antibacterial activities. Similar results are reported for essential oils and cetyl pyridinium chloride, although with a somewhat reduced efficacy. Considering the adverse effects of chlorhexidine and its time-related characteristics, this molecule may best be indicated for acute/short-term use, while essential oils and cetyl pyridinium chloride may be appropriate for long-term, maintenance treatment. Expert opinion: The literature has not clearly demonstrated which compound is the best for mouthrinses that combine good efficacy and acceptable side effects. Research should focus on substances with progressive antibacterial activity, prompting a gradual change {{in the composition of}} oral biofilm and mouthrinses that combine two or more molecules acting synergistically in the mouth.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present series of experiments was to study healing after treatment of experimental peri-implantitis lesions. The dog model was used. In order to establish recipient sites for implants in the mandible, the premolars and 1 st molars were extracted. After a proper healing period, dental implants were installed. Standard and specially designed "test fixtures" of the Brånemark system® (Nobel Biocare AB, Göteborg, Sweden) and implants of the ITI Dental system® designed with turned and SLA surfaces (Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland) were used. Ligature induced breakdown of the peri-implant tissue was performed. The treatment protocol included systemic antibiotics (Metronidazole and Amoxicillin) and local therapy. The implants were cleaned with a detergent (<b>delmopinol),</b> an abrasive (pumice) or saline. The surgical procedure included excision of granulation tissue and installation of barrier membranes. The implants were left either submerged or non-submerged. After 4 - 7 months of healing block biopsies were harvested and prepared for light microscopy. It was observed that treatment of a peri-implantitis lesion, {{according to the above}} protocol resulted in the resolution of the peri-implantitis lesion and allowed for a substantial regrowth of bone within the defect. In animals receiving systemic antibiotics but no local therapy, the plaque associated lesion lingered and remained, in some sites, in contact with the adjacent bone tissue. Treatment of a peri-implantitis lesion, including a comprehensive systemic and local antimicrobial therapy and a submerged surgical technique resulted in the elimination of the inflammatory process in the peri-implant tissues and the establishment of a dense connective tissue capsule in direct contact with the previously exposed surface of the implant. When a new (pristine) implant part was introduced in the bone defect, new bone was frequently laid down on this surface. Treatment of a peri-implantitis lesion adjacent to an implant with a SLA surface, including systemic antibiotics combined with local therapy resulted in a substantial re-osseointegration, i. e. de novo bone formation on the titanium surface...|$|E
40|$|Careful {{quantitative}} assessment of data regarding use of mouthwash and risk of common oral conditions reveals {{that there is a}} clear evidence of beneﬁ t from use in terms of reducing the risk of dental plaque, gingivitis, dental caries and that there are no major adverse effects including no evidence of an increased risk of oral cancer among users of mouthwash containing alcohol. Despite limitations in the quality of many studies conducted, there is a signiﬁ cant reduction of both dental plaque and gingivitis associated with use of mouthwash preparations containing chlorhexidine or essential oils as an adjunct to standard care. The effect of mouthwash containing essential oils on both plaque and gingivitis is less than chlorhexidine in studies of less than 3 months duration but improves with increasing duration of use and equals or exceeds the effect of chlorhexidine when use is 6 months of longer. Mouthwash preparations containing cetylpyridinium or triclosan may also be effective, but less than the two former, while mouthwashes containing <b>delmopinol</b> are not effective for plaque and gingivitis control. How- ever, there is a large degree of heterogeneity and strong evidence of publication bias: {{there is a lack of}} small studies with a small effect of mouthwash. This results in a biased estimate of effect (over-estimated) because there is a tendency to publish mainly positive studies (those showing a strong decrease). Compared with ﬂ uoride toothpaste used alone, topical ﬂ uorides (mouthrinses, gels or varnishes) used in addition to ﬂ uo- ride toothpaste reduce caries by 10 % on average. Topical ﬂ uorides (mouthrinses, gels, or varnishes) used in addition to ﬂ uo- ride toothpaste achieve a modest reduction in caries compared to toothpaste used alone. No conclusions about any adverse effects can be reached, because such data were rarely reported in the trials. It is possible to conclude that mouthwash contain- ing ﬂ uoride is a useful adjunct to ﬂ uoridated toothpaste in reducing caries in children. As regards oral malignancy, quantitative analysis of mouthwash use and oral malignancy revealed no statistically signiﬁ - cant association between mouthwash use and risk of oral cancer including no signiﬁ cant trend in risk with increasing daily use; and no association between use of mouthwash containing alcohol and oral cancer risk. Most recent estimates of the population attributable risk for alcohol consumption and oral cancer put the ﬁ gure at 1 %. The dose of acetaldehyde from mouthwash is minute compared to that from other sources notable cigarette smoking, alco- hol drinking and certain foodstuffs including yoghurt and peas. It is extremely unlikely from a theoretical viewpoint that mouthwash could be a cause of oral cancer and this is substantiated from the lack of evidence of carcinogenicity found in epidemiological studies in humans. In summary, there is evidence supporting the use of mouthwashes in terms of preventing or reducing the risk of develop- ing a number of common conditions notably dental plaque, gingivitis and dental caries without any adverse effects. There is also evidence that mouthwash use does not increase the risk of oral cancer even when it contains a signiﬁ cant percentage of alcohol. Mouthwash use makes a signiﬁ cant contribution to public health...|$|E
