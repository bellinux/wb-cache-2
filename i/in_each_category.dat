5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} {{standard}} {{form of the}} periodic table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours. Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours, {{as is the case}} (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic nonmetals, such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, have none. This gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. The distinction between the three categories of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>category</b> show (or begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.|$|E

5|$|The Minnesota {{franchise}} {{began its}} {{life as the}} Washington Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 1901 to 1960. In the early 20th century, the Senators were managed consecutively by three future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, bookended by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson, who {{was inducted into the}} Hall of Fame as a player, managed the team for four seasons from 1929 to 1932, and he was followed by Joe Cronin, also inducted as a player, who led for the next two seasons (1933–1934). Clark Griffith is the only other Hall of Famer to manage the Senators/Twins franchise. In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota, and Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play in Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager Cookie Lavagetto. Harris and Tom Kelly are the two managers to win a World Series championship with the franchise, one in the Senators era (Harris) and two during the team's tenure in Minnesota (Kelly). Kelly is also the franchise leader in wins and losses, the only manager to exceed 1,000 <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>category</b> (1,140–1,244 in 16 seasons).
