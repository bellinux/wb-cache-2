5000|$|... #Caption: The {{combined}} {{port anchor}} windlass and winch {{of the modern}} ferry [...] The hydraulically <b>operated</b> <b>brake</b> and pawl allows the anchor to be dropped from the ship's bridge.|$|R
50|$|On most roller coasters, {{the brakes}} are {{controlled}} by a computer system, but some older wooden roller coasters have manually <b>operated</b> <b>brakes.</b> These {{are controlled by}} large levers operated by the ride operators.|$|R
50|$|The Heberlein brake {{is still}} {{permitted}} as an <b>operating</b> <b>brake</b> on German railways due to it being both continuous and automatic, {{and at the}} low speeds on narrow gauge lines this means it is perfectly safe.|$|R
50|$|The {{chain brake}} was soon {{superseded}} by air operated or vacuum <b>operated</b> <b>brakes.</b> These brakes used hoses connecting all the wagons of a train, so the driver could apply or release the brakes {{with a single}} valve in the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic {{disc brakes}} use rotors {{attached}} to the hubs with hydraulically <b>operated</b> <b>brake</b> mechanisms that force ceramic pads against the rotors to effect braking. Advantages include high braking power and reliability. Disadvantages include cost, vulnerability of the discs, heat build up, and weight.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic Rim Brakes use the hub, or preferably, a bolt {{on metal}} disc as the braking surface for {{hydraulically}} <b>operated</b> <b>brake</b> mechanisms that push polyurethane blocks against the braking surface. Advantages include good braking power, and good modulation. Disadvantages include possible damage to bearings.|$|R
50|$|The chassis was {{designed}} by Charles King and consisted of steel sections bolted together. The engine was connected to a four-speed preselector gearbox with right-hand change lever and the Girling system rod <b>operated</b> <b>brakes</b> had large 13 in drums. Half-elliptic springs provided the suspension controlled by friction dampers.|$|R
5000|$|As train loads, {{gradients}} and speeds increased, braking {{became a}} problem. In the late 19th century, significantly better continuous brakes started to appear. The earliest type of continuous brake was the chain brake [...] which used a chain, running {{the length of}} the train, to <b>operate</b> <b>brakes</b> on all vehicles simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Scenic Railway at Luna Park, Melbourne Australia Built in 1912, the Scenic Railway is {{the oldest}} continually-operating roller coaster in the world, and one of only 8 in {{existence}} requiring a brakeman to <b>operate</b> <b>brakes</b> whilst the train. For these reasons, it is regarded as an American Coaster Enthusiasts Coaster Classic.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{with air}} <b>operated</b> <b>brakes</b> {{sometimes}} use pneumatic wipers, powered by tapping {{a small amount}} of pressurized air from the brake system to a small air operated motor mounted on or just above the windscreen. These wipers are activated by opening a valve which allows pressurized air to enter the motor.|$|R
40|$|Ninged {{structure}} prevents inadvertent use. Forward {{motion of}} foot on yoke plate necessary to <b>operate</b> <b>brake</b> pedal. Downward force on yoke plate turns locking/releasing laver, which then pushes locking pin into indexing hole. New pedal improves both productivity {{and safety of}} power brakes and such other machines as metal shearers and punch presses...|$|R
50|$|A {{single centre}} stick {{controls}} the ailerons and elevators. Electrical pitch trim {{is controlled by}} two buttons {{on the top of}} the stick, operated by the thumb. A push to talk button is on the front of the stick, operated by the index finger, together with a vertical hand <b>operated</b> <b>brake</b> lever similar to a motorcycle front brake lever.|$|R
50|$|Before {{computerized}} control existed, operators used a lever to <b>operate</b> the <b>brake</b> {{system and}} dispatch trains. The operator {{near the end}} of the station controlled the main brakes at the end of the circuit; the operator at the front of the station <b>operated</b> the <b>brakes</b> at the station platform only and worked to dispatch trains to the lift.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front of}} the car had a sloping, curved, false hood and radiator. The car was advertised as having [...] Power was {{transmitted}} the rear wheels by chain-drive through a planetary transmission. Pedal <b>operated</b> <b>brakes</b> on rear axles were supplemented by engaging reverse gear. The 22-inch wood wheels had 12 spokes and the car's wheelbase was 72 in.|$|R
5000|$|Other - tachometer, {{mechanical}} front disc brake, {{and rear}} cable <b>operated</b> drum <b>brake</b> ...|$|R
50|$|All road wheels {{as well as}} the easily {{adjusted}} {{steering gear}} and the steering-heads have ball-bearings. There is no mention of suspension or braking systems. The omission of a mention of brakes was remedied in the advertisement displayed below - there was a pedal <b>operated</b> <b>brake</b> on the countershaft and a hand operated lever on internal acting brakes on the back wheels.|$|R
50|$|Its {{fuselage}} {{was built}} from GRP/balsa sandwich. The FVA-20 had a T-tail, their planes built {{as those of}} the wings. The tailplane was fixed, carrying elevators fitted with Háhnle trim tabs. Its single seat cockpit was enclosed by a single-piece, forward hinged canopy. It landed on a retractable, unsprung, monowheel undercarriage aided by a tail bumper. The mainwheel had a foot <b>operated</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
50|$|RediAuto Sport was {{marketed as}} “America’s only {{supplier}} of sports cars for disabled drivers.” Products included a “RediAuto System” {{consisting of a}} hand operated clutch for manual shift vehicles, a steering wheel mounted accelerator ring, and a hand <b>operated</b> <b>brake.</b> Soft Touch was advertised as a luxury product line and had only one product: an expensive gas and brake controller.|$|R
5000|$|The simple vacuum system. An ejector on the {{locomotive}} created a vacuum {{in a continuous}} pipe along the train, allowing the external air pressure to <b>operate</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders on every vehicle. This system was very cheap and effective, but it had the major weakness that it became inoperative if the train became divided or if the train pipe was ruptured.|$|R
50|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration, with hydraulically <b>operated</b> wheel <b>brakes</b> and nose-wheel steering.|$|R
5000|$|... had a foot <b>operated</b> parking <b>brake</b> (whereas the Australian {{production}} {{featured a}} conventional lever design) ...|$|R
5000|$|Other - tachometer, (1978 change) - {{hydraulic}} front disc <b>brake,</b> rear cable <b>operated</b> drum <b>brake</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Locomotives and {{carriages}} {{each have}} a hand <b>brake</b> which <b>operates</b> <b>brake</b> blocks that clasp drums {{on either side of}} the pinions. On the steam locomotives the hand brake is applied manually; two identical hand brake levers are fitted, one for the driver and one for the fireman. On the diesel locomotives, the hand brake is applied by a powerful spring and held off by a hydraulic system.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and characteristics of}} an electrically <b>operated</b> <b>brake</b> are discussed. The action of the brake depends on energizing a solenoid which causes internally spaced sprockets to contact the inner surface of the housing. A spring forces the control member {{to move to the}} braking position when the electrical function is interrupted. A diagram of the device is provided and detailed operating principles are explained...|$|R

50|$|The {{hydraulically}} controlled drum <b>brakes</b> <b>operated</b> on {{all four}} wheels while the hand <b>brake</b> <b>operated</b> via a cable linkage to the rear wheels. Steering was of the then common worm and roller type.|$|R
50|$|The gearbox {{of the car}} {{was also}} novel, having dual {{epicyclic}} gears and being bolted directly to the engine. This allowed four speeds, with direct drive in top gear. All the gears were helical, and enclosed in an oil bath, making for very silent transmission. Reverse gear was built into the rear axle, as was the foot <b>operated</b> <b>brake</b> drum, all of which was housed in a substantial aluminium casing.|$|R
50|$|Dual {{controls}} were provided, and the hydraulically operated double-slotted wing flaps were supplemented by an hydraulically <b>operated</b> air <b>brake.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Power for {{the system}} from a {{regulated}} high pressure hydraulic pump which also <b>operates</b> the <b>brakes</b> and suspension system.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brakes</b> are air <b>operated</b> S-cam <b>brakes</b> {{with two}} circuits. The braking system is {{equipped}} with front axle braking power reducing system.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{standard}} gauge superheated steam tank locomotive with 5 coupled axles, {{which is similar to}} the Henschel-Type E800 but with some notable exceptions. Therefore it is called Henschel-Type Bochum. During World War II the firebox could not be made from copper, and steel was used instead. In 1956 it was modified by installing roller bearings and a mixing pre-heater by Henschel. The steam <b>operated</b> <b>brake</b> was replaced by a pneumatic brake with compressed air.|$|R
50|$|It {{was mainly}} built for {{operation}} outside London and overseas. It could be fitted with AEC's 9.6-litre diesel engine (except a minority with 7.7-litre ones), 'Wilson' preselective epicyclic gearbox (except for a minority with crash gearboxes; a synchromesh option also became {{available in the}} early 1950s) and air-pressure <b>operated</b> <b>brakes</b> (except a minority with vacuum brakes). The Regent III was available with bodies {{from a number of}} manufacturers including Park Royal, Metro Cammell Weymann and Charles H. Roe.|$|R
