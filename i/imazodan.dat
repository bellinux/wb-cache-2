40|$|A 12 -week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, {{placebo-controlled}} {{trial of}} <b>imazodan,</b> a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, {{was conducted in}} 147 patients with congestive heart failure to determine clinical efficacy and safety. Patients were randomized to placebo or 2, 5 or 10 mg of <b>imazodan</b> administered twice daily. Patients were maintained on their standard therapy including diuretics, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The mean ejection fraction was 23 +/- 10 %. Exercise time increased from baseline in all 4 groups. There {{was no significant difference}} observed between the placebo group and any of the treated groups with regard to exercise time, ejection fraction, frequency of ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia. When analyzed by intent to treat, the placebo mortality was 7 % (3 of 44) and the <b>imazodan</b> mortality was 8 % (8 of 103) (p = not significant). This study failed to demonstrate that <b>imazodan</b> provided any benefit in exercise performance when compared with placebo...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} isozyme-spe-cific inhibitors of cAMP-selective phosphodiesterases (PDEs) induce bronchodilation without the cardiovascular side effects known to be produced by nonselective PDE inhibitors. The abilities of PDE inhibitors to reverse the bronchoconstriction induced by serotonin in a beta-blocked anesthetized dog were compared simultaneously with their effects on cardiac contractile force (+dP/dt), heart rate and blood pressure. Aminophylline and enprofylline, two antiasthma drugs with nonselective PDE inhib-itory activity, produced dose-dependent (EDs = 2. 3 and 0. 58 mg/kg, respectively) and complete (95 - 1 00 %) bronchodilation accompanied by profound increases in cardiac force, tachycardia and decreases in blood pressure. Similar effects were observed with forskolin, a potent adenylate cydase activator. <b>Imazodan</b> and CI- 930 (inhibitors of the cGMP-inhibitable cAMP-selectiv...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{interaction}} of Cardiac Troponin C (cTnC) and Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) plays {{a critical role}} in transmitting the Ca 2 + signal to the other myofilament proteins in the activation of cardiac muscle contraction. As such, the cTnC-cTnI interface is a logical target for cardiotonic agents such as levosimendan that can modulate the Ca 2 + sensitivity of the myofilaments. Evidence indicates that drug candidates may exert their effects by targeting a site formed by binding of the switch region of cTnI to the regulatory N domain of cTnC (cNTnC). In this study, we utilized two-dimensional 1 H- 15 N HSQC NMR spectroscopy to monitor the binding of levosimendan and its analogues, CMDP, AMDP, CI- 930, <b>imazodan,</b> and MPDP, to cNTnC Â·Ca 2 + in complex with two versions of the switch region of cTn...|$|E
