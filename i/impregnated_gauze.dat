30|$|There is also {{controversy}} over {{which kind of}} dressing to use after pin tract cleaning. Regardless of the dressings chosen, their main purpose is to keep pin sites clean and dry and to absorb any blood and exudates [70]. Many authors consider that pins should be dressed with sterile gauze {{in the presence of}} exudates, but left uncovered in their absence [4, 40]. Others advocate <b>impregnating</b> <b>gauzes</b> with antiseptic solutions in order to decrease the rates of PTI, such as benzalkonium chloride antiseptic solution [14], polyurethane [74], polyhexamethylene biguanide [75] or an alcoholic solution [17]. Paley reported using antibiotic-soaked sponges over pin sites [3]. We do not recommend the use of betadine-soaked gauzes as they induce crust formation and probably induce the skin to stick to the pins. New gauzes have been developed to promote skin healing and decrease PTI. In the presence of abundant exudates, hydrofibre dressings are useful due to their absorptive capacity. Antimicrobial silver dressings have also gained popularity due to the increase in antibiotic-resistant pathogens [76, 77, 78]. These are also interesting for their capacity to reduce the microbial contamination of wounds from environmental sources [79, 80] and, above all, because these dressings may be left in place for up to 7 days [81].|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{objective}} of this prospective randomised blind controlled clinical trial was to appraise the effectiveness of topical application of autologous platelet gel (PG) in canine chronic non-healing wounds. Material and Methods Dogs with bilateral chronic wounds caused by protracted decubitus ulcers (n = 18) were considered in the study. For each dog, the wound side was randomised to receive either platelet gel (group G) every 5 days for 5 dressing changes, or paraffin gauze dressings (group C), as a negative control. Wound healing and wound surfaces were compared at admission and then evaluated every 5 th day, until the 25 th day. The following outcome variables were measured: open wound area, reduction of open wound area compared to admission and to each preceding dressing change and time to complete epithelialisation. Results Significant differences in the healing process were observed at day 5 and throughout the entire study period (P< 0. 0001). The final mean percentage value of surface reduction was 93. 5 % in group G and 13. 2 % in group C (P< 0. 0001).

40|$|Objective: The {{treatment}} {{costs for}} pressure ulcers and venous leg ulcers were estimated {{based on the}} hospital administrator's perspective in Germany. Design: A spreadsheet model using input data from various hospitals in Germany was developed. Interventions: Five currently used treatment strategies were analysed: gauze, <b>impregnated</b> <b>gauze,</b> calcium alginate and hydroactive wound dressing with enzymatic ointment. Participants: All cases used for and in the analysis were treated in the inpatient setting (4 hospitals and 120 patients were included). Main outcome measures and results: The outcome distributions were calculated using the Monte Carlo method. For the whole treatment process, the attributable costs for the hospital were calculated for different cases (severity) and all treatment strategies (1997 values). The costs for treatment with gauze were the highest, whereas the costs for treatment with hydroactive wound dressings and enzymatic ointment were the lowest. The relation between personnel and material costs for gauze is approximately 95 to 5 % and for hydroactive wound dressings 67 to 33 %, respectively. The cost savings per case were between 1196 deutschmark (DM) and DM 9826 using hydroactive wound dressings instead of gauze dressings (depending on {{the severity of the}} pressure ulcer), and between DM 135 and DM 677 for venous leg ulcers. The results were robust and did not change in any performed sensitivity analysis (parameter: `personnel costs per minute', `time required for changing a wound dressing', `total number of wound dressing changes'). Conclusions: Despite the higher material costs of the hydroactive wound dressings in combination with enzymatic wound cleaning compared with other wound dressings, they should be recommended for the treatment of pressure ulcers and venous leg ulcers. This therapy alternative brings about significant reductions in total costs for hospitals because of significant reductions in personnel costs and the duration of treatment.

Experimental hut observations showed that Anopheles darlingi greatly reduced their biting activity (99 - 100 %) during the first 5 months after impregnation. A model assay showed high mortality both of mosquitoes repelled by the gauze as well as of those that succeeded in getting through it. A field application test in 270 huts showed good acceptance by the population and good durability of the applied gauze. After introducing the method in the entire working area, replacing DDT residual housespraying, the malaria prevalence, of 25 - 37 % before application dropped and stabilized at between 5 and 10 % within one year. The operational costs were less than those of the previously used DDT housespraying program, due to a 50 % reduction in the cost of materials used.

Study Design: A prospective study was conducted between October 2006 and March 2009. Patients subjected to root surgery, who completed the questionnaire and who consented to the postoperative instructions were included in the study. The subjects were divided into two groups according to the hemostatic agent used: A) <b>gauze</b> <b>impregnated</b> with anesthetic solution with vasoconstrictor; or B) aluminum chloride. The patients were administered a questionnaire, and were asked to record the severity of their pain and swelling on a plain horizontal visual analog scale (VAS). Data were recorded by the patients on the first 7 postoperative days. In addition, the patients were asked to record analgesic consumption. Results: A total of 76 questionnaires (34 in group A and 42 in group B) were taken to be correctly completed. Pain was reported to be most intense two hours after surgery. At this point 52. 6 % of the patients had no pain. Seventy-five percent of the patients consumed analgesics in the first 24 hours.

40|$|Onychocryptosis is a {{relatively}} common condition that can cause significant pain and discomfort. Partial nail avulsion (PNA) with phenolisation is a straightforward procedure performed by podiatrists on a daily basis. The procedure has shown {{a high rate of}} efficacy and low recurrence rate, and can be performed on high risk patients with close post-operative monitoring and those with concomitant infection. PNA with phenolisation of the nail matrix is a non-invasive procedure that does not require the use of an operating theatre and can be carried out in the podiatrist’s rooms. Pre-operative measures do need to be taken, a local sterile field should be set up and the toe and forefoot should be scrubbed. Once the procedure has been completed healing can be expected in 4 - 8 weeks. The PNA procedure has been taught to undergraduate podiatrists since the late 1970 ’s and has developed many small variations in how the procedure is carried out. Variations vary from pre-operative management (type of antisepsis used), phenolisation time (reported to be between 1 to 5 minutes), type of post phenol irrigation (saline, isopropyl alcohol or no irrigation) and post-operative dressing regimen. These variations however are usually operator dependant and based on personal experience. Post-operative management of PNA wounds have attracted a lot of interest, with the use of different dressings (provodone-iodine <b>impregnated</b> <b>gauze</b> and paraffin gauze) and topical medicaments (manuka honey, intrasite gel) aimed at increasing the healing rate and reducing the rate of infection, but quantitative analysis of the colonisation of the wound bed shows a bacterial count of zero after the use of phenol. The case of the phenolised wound is an interesting one, an acute wound that heals by secondary intention and freely discharges for 2 - 4 weeks postoperatively. After the application phenol and the destruction of all microbiological matter the post-operative focus should be in nurturing the recolonisation of the nail bed. Wounds that have a high as well as a low bacterial count have been shown to have an effect healing rates, but no studies have investigated the microbiological behaviour of a phenolised PNA wound...|$|E
30|$|All {{patients}} were treated by 15 fellowship-trained, pediatric orthopedic surgeons at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. General indications for surgical treatment were patients aged 12 {{or more years}} with Neer–Horowitz grade four fractures or angulation of 40 ° or more; however, the treating attending surgeon made the ultimate determination for surgical intervention. Patients {{were taken to the}} operating room for attempted CR and fixation with either PP (buried or exposed) or IMN. If CR could not be obtained, OR using a deltopectoral approach was performed to facilitate reduction prior to internal fixation. All patients received preoperative antibiotics between 30 and 60  min prior to procedure and a total of 24  h of antibiotics was administered for those patients who underwent open reduction and fixation. For PP fixation, 2 or 3 pins were placed [average 2.4 pins (5 / 64 or 3 / 32 inch diameter)]. Pins were placed through the lateral metaphysis of the distal fracture fragment and passed superomedially across the fracture site into the humeral head fragment. Pins were started inferiorly and only after careful blunt spreading of the subcutaneous tissues so as to avoid iatrogenic injury to the axillary nerve. In rare situations, a third pin was started in the greater tuberosity and passed inferomedially across the fracture site and into the medial humeral cortex of the distal fragment. Pins were cut beneath the skin in 35  % (17 / 49) of cases. The decision to bury pins or leave them through the skin was based on surgeon preference. IMN fixation was employed with 1 or 2 titanium flexible nails (Synthes, West Chester, PA), through a distal lateral entry site. Nails were introduced by making a small incision and spreading bluntly down to bone, where a drill was used to make an entry portal into the intramedullary canal superior to the olecranon fossa. The nails were then driven retrograde until they entered the proximal fragment. If necessary, rotation of the nail was used to optimize reduction. IMN implants were then trimmed and buried under the skin in all cases.

40|$|T wo {{events in}} 2012, the centen-nials {{of both the}} birth of theMedical Council of Canada {{and the death of}} Joseph Lister — the {{originator}} of antiseptic/aseptic sur-gery, 1 can be serendipitously con-nected through the surgeon, Thomas Roddick, especially by his presidential speech delivered in 1897 to the British Medical Association (BMA) in Mon-tréal, Que. One can include a third commemoration, the Diamond Jubilee of the reigning British monarch, which had been celebrated only once before, in 1897 — in which Roddick also played a role. Born in Harbour Grace, Newfound-land, a son of the town’s Scottish school-master, Thomas Roddick (1846 – 1923), graduated MD CM from McGill Univer-sity in 1868. 1 In the 1870 s, he visited Scotland, England and Europe on a self-funded program of continuing medical education during which he acquired the latest surgical ideas, equipment and tech-niques. Exemplary was his experience of Listerism — the surgical wound man-agement system devised by Joseph Lister to inhibit the growth of germs by car-bolic acid, sprayers, <b>impregnated</b> <b>gauze</b> and other “antiseptic ” dressings, and lig-atures. At Edinburgh and London where Lister taught and practised, Roddick learned “antiseptic surgery ” from the master. Roddick was not the only Cana-dian to learn directly from Lister, but given his teaching position at McGill and his surgical experience at the Montréal General Hospital he was well placed to influence colleagues and students and “convert ” them to the tenets of the new antiseptic technique. 2 In addition to being a successful sur-geon, Roddick was cultured and ambi-tious; he was elected to Parliament (1896 – 1904); served as McGill’s med-ical dean (1901 – 08); and was knighted in 1914. Nestled among these achieve-ments were Roddick’s presidency of the BMA and his hosting of the annual con-ference of this group in Montréal in 1897, {{the first time that the}} BMA had met outside of Britain. The success of this event was pivotal to Roddick’s career as he became the public face of this august gathering of American, British and Canadian doctors. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) leading up to the September meeting encour-aged BMA members to make the trans-Atlantic trip, noting the many events and attractions that Canada and the con-ference had to offer. About 1100 people attended, most of whom were British. This was a landmark event for Cana-dian medicine. The year marked th...|$|E
40|$|Sanarelli (1891) is {{believed}} to have been the first to employ collodion sacs in animal experimentation. Subsequently, sacs of different types have been used in various in vivo experiments by a number of investigators (see bibliography). Alcohol-ether collo-dion was employed in each case for the preparation of the semiper-meable membranes. In order to withstand the distorting effect of the intestinal movements, the collodion had to be of rather high concentration, with correspondingly low permeability. In under-taking the present work, it was felt that certain investigations could be made much more satisfactorily if sacs could be prepared that were more permeable and at the same time more rugged than those that had been previously described. According to Elford (1931), acetic-acid collodion membranes are not only of a higher order of permeability than those of alcohol-ether collodion, but they are also highly heteroporous. The use of this fragile material necessitated the finding of a practical support. Fouard (1909) <b>impregnated</b> wire <b>gauze</b> with collodion. This type of support was tried and was found to be highly practical. The description by Gates (1921) was used as the point of departure in trying to prepare a highly permeable yet sturdy modification of his type of sac. After a considerable number of failures, a satisfactory sac has been evolved which is quite different from that of Gates. However, many of his practices, particularly those concerning the handling of sacs, have been incorporated...|$|R

40|$|Infected {{superficial}} wounds were traditionally {{controlled by}} topical antibiotics until {{the emergence of}} antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Silver (Ag) is a kernel for alternative antibacterial agents to fight this resistance quandary. The present study demonstrates a method for immobilizing small-sized (~ 5 nm) silver nanoparticles on silica matrix to form a nanosilver–silica (Ag–SiO 2) composite and shows the prolonged antibacterial effects of the composite in vitro. The composite exhibited a rapid initial Ag release after 24 h and a slower leaching after 48 and 72 h and was effective against both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Ultraviolet (UV) -irradiation was superior to filter-sterilization in retaining the antibacterial effects of the composite, through the higher remaining Ag concentration. A <b>gauze,</b> <b>impregnated</b> with the Ag–SiO 2 composite, showed higher antibacterial effects against MRSA and E. coli than a commercial Ag-containing dressing, indicating a potential for the management and infection control of superficial wounds. Transmission and {{scanning transmission electron microscope}} analyses of the composite-treated MRSA revealed an interaction of the released silver ions with the bacterial cytoplasmic constituents, causing ultimately the loss of bacterial membranes. The present results indicate that the Ag–SiO 2 composite, with prolonged antibacterial effects, is a promising candidate for wound dressing applications. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Keratinocyte {{stem cell}} {{is one of}} the adult stem cells that inhabits the skin and {{contributes}} to skin function and renewal. Adult stem cells are best defined by their capacity to self-renew, and to maintain tissue function {{for a long period of}} time. These findings indicate the importance of these cells for clinical applications including regenerative medicine, tissue engineering and gene therapy. In full-thickness damage or injury including burns, the  cultured epidermal autografts (CEAs) may be placed directly onto muscle or fascia. Methods: A small split thickness skin biopsy (1 12 أ—'> 2 cm) was obtained aseptically to isolate stem cells. The biopsy was cut into thin pieces and treated with trypsin at 4 ° C overnight (cold trypsin method) to obtain a single-cell suspension. The cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm 2 onto a preformed mitomycine-C treated 3 T 3 cell as feeder  layer  in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % fetal  bovine serum (FBS) and other special supplements. Clonogenic keratinocytes divided and colonies quickly expanded and pushed away the 3 T 3 feeder layer cells, which then detached from the culture vessel and eliminated with medium changes. Primary cultures were usually subcultured when the cells were in exponential growth phase. Colonies of keratinocytes were expanded and after 7 - 10 days fused and formed a coherent stratified epithelium. Confluent  cultured  epithelia were detached enzymatically as coherent sheets from the surface of  the culture flasks and transferred onto petrolatum- <b>impregnated</b> <b>gauze.</b> Histological studies of cultured epithelium were also carried out. Results: In our experience from 1 cm 2 of skin sample, 2, 5 - 4 × 106 cells were obtained. It resulted in keratinocytes suspensions which consisted at least 90 % single cells. Cultured keratinocytes proliferated and after 8 - 10 days became confluent. The area of cultured epithelium detached from T- 25 and T- 75 culture flasks was approximately 12 - 15 cm 2 and 35 - 40 cm 2 respectively. Histological studies showed that 10 -day old cultured epithelium had 3 - 4 cell layers consisting of small basal cells and big scquamous cells with large nucleus. Also in the basal layer few melanocytes with melanin pigments in the cells cytoplasm were found. The 20 -day old cultured epithelium had 8 - 10 layers consisting of small and round basal cells, scquamous cells and 2 - 3 layers of keratinized cells. Conclusion: Culture of keratinocyte stem cells could result in multilayer epithelium that creates a good cosmetic appearance upon transplantation. This could re-generate an epidermis that is resistant to trauma and infections. It can be considered as an appropriate substitution in skin loss conditions.   Keywords: Epidermal Sheets, Skin Adult Stem cells, Keratinocyte. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Anxiety is {{the most}} common {{psychological}} response to labor in women. Aromatherapy is a type of alternative medicine which by using essential oils and fragrant, stimulates the olfactory system, induces relaxation and reduces anxiety. This study aims to determine the effect of aromatherapy with Boswellia Carteri in reducing anxiety during the first stage of labor. Methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 126 nulliparous women, referred to Kamali hospital (Karaj, Iran). Samples were divided into two groups of aromatherapy and control. In intervention group, <b>gauzes</b> <b>impregnated</b> with 2 ml normal saline and 0. 2 mL Boswellia essence, and in control group only with 2 ml normal saline were attached to the collar of subjects. Gauzes were changed every 30 minutes. Level of anxiety in both groups were measured at baseline and after the intervention at dilations of 3 - 4 and 6 - 8 cm. Data was collected using a demographic and obstetric information questionnaire, an observationexamination checklist, and Spielberger state-trait anxiety questionnaire. Results: Before the intervention; gestational age, Bishop Score, contraction length and level of anxiety was the same in both groups. After the intervention, mean of anxiety in the intervention group at dilations of 3 - 4 (18. 4 ± 5. 18) and 6 - 8 cm (20. 3 ± 6) was significantly lower than control group at dilations of 3 - 4 (22. 3 ± 7. 98) and 6 - 8 cm (22. 9 ± 5. 55), (P= 0 / 014,P= 0 / 002). Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed aromatherapy with Boswellia Carteri essence as a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and effective intervention to reduce anxiety during labor. ...|$|R

However, these therapeutic strategies {{often lead to}} a reduced neutrophilic granulocyte count or loss of more blood after surgical tumor resection. In this study, we developed a formulation of hemostatic <b>gauze</b> <b>impregnated</b> with sustained-release granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with increasing of the neutrophilic granulocyte count in the blood following chemotherapy and decreasing blood loss after surgical tumor resection. Methods: We designed a formulation with both hemostatic properties and increased neutrophil content {{to be used in}} cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and tumor resection, comprising a hemostatic gauze as a scaffold and (G-CSF) -loaded dextran nanoparticles coated with polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) solution fabricated by direct spray-painting onto the scaffold and then vacuum-dried at room temperature. The performance of this system was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: Nearly zero-order release of G-CSF was recorded for 12 &ndash; 14 days, and the cumulative release of G-CSF retained over 90 % of its bioactivity in a NFS- 60 cell line proliferation assay when the scaffold was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7. 4) at 37 &deg;C. The in vivo hemostatic efficacy of this formulation was greater than that of native G-CSF, the scaffold directly spray-painted with G-CSF solution or PLGA organic solution as a coating, or when a blank scaffold was covered with the coating. Conclusion: Our results suggest that this formulation has both hemostatic properties and increased neutrophil activity.

40|$|Background: Some of {{the studies}} {{confirmed}} the effectiveness of platelet rich plasma (PRP) {{in the treatment of}} diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). However, these studies had small sample size and used different methods such as PRP gel or PRP injections. The results are also contraversial. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effect of PRP dressing on healing of DFUs. Patients and Methods: A randomized, controlled trial was conducted on 50 patients with DFUs referred to Kashan’s Shahid Beheshti hospital. Patients were randomly allocated to control (n = 25) and experimental (n = 25) groups. Data collection instrument consisted of two checklists; one for gathering demographic information and the other one included questions about ulcer characteristics and its treatment. After surgical debridement, ulcers depth and surface area were measured. Then, the ulcers of the control group were irrigated and dressed with sterile gauzes. However, in the intervention group, ulcers were dressed with sterile <b>gauzes</b> <b>impregnated</b> with PRP. Ulcers depth and surface area of all ulcers were measured on the days 0, 7, 14 and 21 after debridement. Independent-samples t-test, Mann–Whitney U and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to analyze data. Results: At baseline, the mean ulcer depth were 15. 08 ± 10. 43 and 19. 08 ± 14. 01 mm in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = 0. 26), which decreased to 13. 03 ± 14. 1 and 4. 560 ± 5. 76 after three weeks (P = 0. 04). Moreover, the mean ulcer surface area were 14. 17 ± 8. 52 and 12. 791 ± 14. 86 mm 2 in control and intervention groups respectively (P = 0. 69), which decreased to 11. 88 ± 13. 65 and 2. 68 ± 5. 94 after three weeks (P = 0. 03).
