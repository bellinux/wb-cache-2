500|$|Computing the {{interactions}} between the stars within a globular cluster requires solving what is termed the N-body problem. That is, each of the stars within the cluster continually interacts with the other N−1 stars, where N is {{the total number of}} stars in the cluster. The naive CPU computational [...] "cost" [...] for a dynamic simulation increases in proportion to N 2 (each of N objects must interact pairwise with each of the other N objects), so the potential computing requirements to accurately simulate such a cluster can be enormous. An efficient method of mathematically simulating the N-body dynamics of a globular cluster is done by subdividing into small volumes and velocity ranges, and using probabilities to describe the locations of the stars. The motions are then described by means of a formula called the <b>Fokker–Planck</b> <b>equation.</b> This can be solved by a simplified form of the equation, or by running Monte Carlo simulations and using random values. However the simulation becomes more difficult when the effects of binaries and the interaction with external gravitation forces (such as from the Milky Way galaxy) must also be included.|$|E

We {{design and}} analyze up to third order {{accurate}} discontinuous Galerkin (DG) meth-ods satisfying a strict maximum principle for <b>Fokker–Planck</b> <b>equations.</b> A procedure is established to identify an effective test set in each computational cell {{to ensure the}} desired bounds of numer-ical averages during time evolution.

Based on this result, a scaling limiter for the DG method with first order Euler forward time discretization is proposed to solve the one-dimensional <b>Fokker–Planck</b> <b>equations.</b> Strong stability preserving high order time discretizations will keep the maximum principle. It is straightforward to extend the method to two and higher dimensions on rectangular meshes.
