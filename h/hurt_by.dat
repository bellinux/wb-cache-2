5|$|Both the Holt Manufacturing Company and C.L.Best were <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> the {{depression}} of 1920–21 which further inhibited sales. Both companies streamlined their over-lapping product lines. The two companies had spent about US$1.5 million (about $ today) {{in legal fees}} fighting each other in various contractual, trademark and patent infringement lawsuits since 1905, but, {{on the advice of}} investors, the two companies merged in 1925 to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. , Caterpillar Inc. was the 229th largest company in the world.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hurt</b> <b>by</b> {{losses to}} the Akron Pros, the Triangles did not contend for the APFA trophy in 1920.

5|$|In 1931, Prince Nicholas eloped with Ioana Doletti, a {{divorced}} woman. Marie strongly disapproved of her son's actions and felt <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> Doletti's repeated attempts to keep Nicholas from communicating with his mother. Although she blamed {{the women in}} her sons' lives for a while, she also came to blame herself, for failing to educate them properly. However, she stubbornly and continually refused to meet Magda Lupescu, even after Carol's pleas. Until her last years, Marie seldom even mentioned Lupescu's name.|$|E
5000|$|Christians seek {{to uphold}} the {{seriousness}} of wedding vows. Yet, they respond with compassion to deep <b>hurts</b> <b>by</b> recognizing that divorce, though less than the ideal, is sometimes necessary to relieve one partner of intolerable hardship, unfaithfulness or desertion. While the voice of God had said, [...] "I hate divorce", some authorities believe the divorce rate in the church is nearly {{comparable to that of}} the culture at large.|$|R

Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E

Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E

5|$|That night Halverson, his copilot, and his {{engineer}} pooled their candy rations for {{the next}} day's drop.

In the morning when Halverson and his crew made regular supply drops, they also dropped three boxes of candy attached to handkerchiefs. They made these drops once a week for three weeks. Each week, the group of children waiting at the Tempelhof airport fence grew significantly.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> the simple {{lack of information}} available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
