40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{main point}} {{of this paper is}} a {{suggestion}} about the proper treatment of the photon gas in a theory of stellar structure and other plasmas. This problem arises in the study of polytropic gas spheres, where we have already introduced some innovations. The main idea, already advanced in the context of neutral, homogeneous, polytropic stellar models, is to base the theory firmly on a variational principle. Another essential novelty is to let mass distribution extend to infinity, the boundary between bulk and atmosphere being defined by an abrupt change in the polytropic index, triggered by the density. The logical next step in this program is to include the effect of radiation, which is a very significant complication since a full treatment would have to include an account of ionization, thus fields representing electrons, <b>ions,</b> <b>photons,</b> gravitons and neutral atoms as well. In way of preparation, we consider models that are charged but homogeneous, involving only gravity, electromagnetism and a single scalar field that represents both the mass and the electric charge; in short, a non-neutral plasma.

This paper is concerned with the principles governing the performance of FPDs and the types of FPD available. It is focused on magnetic sector mass spectrometry but is relevant to all applications in which spatially dispersed particles can be detected using a microchannel plate electron multiplier, e. g. <b>ions,</b> <b>photons</b> of wavelength Æ 200 nm, electrons and energetic neutrals. Although it has proved possible to produce mass spectra with a high resolution, this has not been matched by an ability to detect them efficiently. Given that highly resolved spectra are available at the detector but are inaccessi-ble efficiently, it is in the development of high-performance FPDs where there are enormous gains in efficiency to be achieved. Limitations of FPD performance of two fundamental types are discussed: the position of impact of an ion on the FPD cannot be measured exactly, and the upper and lower count rates of the FPD are both restricted. These limitations are not simply characterized but are sometimes determined by the electron multiplier stage, sometimes by the properties of the array and sometimes by the data acquisition system. 1997 by John Wiley &...|$|E
40|$|Interstellar dust grains exhibit complex {{dynamics}} {{which is}} essential for understanding many key interstellar processes that involve dust, including grain alignment, grain growth, grain shattering etc. Grain rotational and translational motions are affected not only by gaseous collisions, but also by interactions with <b>ions,</b> <b>photons,</b> magnetic fields etc. Some of those interactions, e. g. interactions of ions with the dipole electric moment of dust grains, require the quantum nature of the process to be accounted for. Similarly, coupling of rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom in a grain happens due to relaxation processes, among which the process related to nuclear spins frequently is the dominant one. This coupling modifies substantially both the dynamics of rotational and translational motions by inducing grain flips. The flipping averages our certain systematic torques and forces that act on grains. As the rate of flipping is larger for smaller grains, these grains can be ``thermally trapped'', i. e. rotate at a thermal rate {{in spite of the}} presence of systematic torques. Moreover, a subset of small grains with high dipole moments may rotate at subthermal rates due to high damping arising from grain emission in microwave range of frequencies. Translational dynamics of grains is mostly dominated by grain interactions with magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Efficient turbulent mixing of dust grains limits the degree to which grains of different sizes may be segregated in space.

40|$|The {{interest}} in plasma-assisted ALD has increased significantly in recent years, which is mainly catalyzed by the additional freedom in material properties and process parameters compared to thermal ALD [1]. A plasma contains a large variety of species, such as <b>ions,</b> <b>photons</b> and radicals, which can {{all have a}} contribution to the growth process and resulting film properties [2]. The presence and importance of ions during the ALD process, however, has not extensively been addressed yet. In this contribution we will therefore consider the role of the ions during ALD. The presence of ions can be characterized by two parameters, namely the ion energy and the ion flux. Both parameters are mainly determined by the type of plasma configuration employed (see Fig. 1.) and the processing conditions such as the gas pressure and the plasma power. In a reactor with a capacitively-coupled plasma (CCP) source, the plasma is generated between two electrodes where the substrate is typically placed on the grounded bottom electrode. In a reactor with an inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) source, the plasma is generated by supplying power to a coil wrapped around a dielectric tube which is mounted on the reactor. In both setups the ion energy can be up to several tens of eV when operating at pressures up to several tens of mTorr. Consequently, these ions can have a positive contribution to the deposition process by promoting ligand-desorption, adatom migration and displacement of lattice atoms [3...|$|E
40|$|Quantum data is {{susceptible}} to decoherence induced by the environment and to errors in the hardware processing it. A future fault-tolerant quantum computer will use quantum error correction (QEC) to actively protect against both. In the smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a two-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits. For each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed stabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing the encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped <b>ions,</b> <b>photons,</b> superconducting qubits, and NV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers {{at the cost of}} decoding {{at the end of a}} QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable to physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for fault tolerance. Using a five-qubit superconducting processor, we realize the two parity measurements comprising the stabilizers of the three-qubit repetition code protecting one logical qubit from physical bit-flip errors. We construct these stabilizers as parallelized indirect measurements using ancillary qubits, and evidence their non-demolition character by generating three-qubit entanglement from superposition states. We demonstrate stabilizer-based quantum error detection (QED) by subjecting a logical qubit to coherent and incoherent bit-flip errors on its constituent physical qubits. While increased physical qubit coherence times and shorter QED blocks are required to actively safeguard quantum information, this demonstration is a critical step toward larger codes based on multiple parity measurements.
