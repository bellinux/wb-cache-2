5|$|The spores of C.stercoreus {{are roughly}} spherical and {{relatively}} large, with typical dimensions of 20–35x20–25µm, although great variability in spore size has been noted. The spores are sessile (growing directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basidium, without attachment via a sterigmata), and {{are separated from}} the basidia after it collapses and gelatinizes. This is accompanied by the gelatinization of the inner walls of the peridiole.|$|E
40|$|Mannose-labeled glycopeptides <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> {{growing and}} nongrowing human diploid cells (KL- 2) were {{separated}} into neutral glycopeptides and acidic glycopeptides by paper electrophoresis.

30|$|To {{investigate}} the quantitative change of terpenes in sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) board caused by moderate-temperature drying treatments, extracts of sugi board dried by vacuum, conventional kiln, electric heat and air {{were analyzed by}} gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). Extract samples were prepared at 0 – 1, 1 – 2 and 17 – 18  mm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> dried boards using a planer. The results were as follows. Total content of the extracts detected by GC/MS was less in vacuum-dried board than in air-dried board at all three <b>surface</b> depths. Content <b>of</b> sesquiterpene hydrocarbon at 0 – 1, 1 – 2 and 17 – 18  mm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> vacuum-dried board, at 0 – 1 and 1 – 2  mm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> conventional kiln-dried board and at 0 – 1  mm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> electric heat-dried board was less than in air-dried board.

Content of diterpene hydrocarbon: {{there were no significant}} differences between drying treatments. Content of oxygenated diterpene at 17 – 18  mm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> electric heat-dried board was less than in air-dried board. In conclusion, we showed that a portion of terpenes in sugi board exposed to different moderate-temperature drying treatments was less than that in air-dried sugi board.|$|R

5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} solar wind. Venus and Mars do not have {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E
5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In {{some parts of the}} developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} forms of {{deterioration}} in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of silver chloride due to long-term immersion in salt water, {{as well as}} reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver {{can be used to}} date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.|$|E
5|$|Through {{studies of}} carbon isotope ratios (similar to the {{methodology}} used in carbon dating, except with the stable isotopes C-12 and C-13), {{it has been}} shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources. Some diamonds, known as harzburgitic, are formed from inorganic carbon originally found deep in the Earth's mantle. In contrast, eclogitic diamonds contain organic carbon from organic detritus that has been pushed down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth's crust through subduction (see plate tectonics) before transforming into diamond. These two different source of carbon have measurably different 13C:12C ratios. Diamonds that have come to the Earth's surface are generally quite old, ranging from under 1billion to 3.3billion years old. This is 22% to 73% of the age of the Earth.|$|E

5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, {{in which it was}} converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E
5|$|No {{body parts}} were {{recovered}} by the Soviet search team <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea in their territorial waters, though they would later turn over clothes and shoes {{to a joint}} U.S.–Japanese delegation to Nevelsk on Sakhalin. On Monday, September 26, 1983, a delegation of seven Japanese and U.S. officials arriving aboard the Japanese patrol boat Tsugaru, had met a six-man Soviet delegation {{at the port of}} Nevelsk on Sakhalin Island. KGB Major General A. I. Romanenko, the Commander of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands frontier guard, headed the Soviet delegation. Romanenko handed over to the U.S. and the Japanese, among other things, single and paired footwear. With footwear that the Japanese also retrieved, the total came to 213 men's, women's and children's dress shoes, sandals, and sports shoes. The Soviets indicated these items were all that they had retrieved floating or on the shores of Sakhalin and Moneron islands.|$|E
5|$|One of SSI's first grants {{funded the}} {{development}} of the mass driver, a device first proposed by O'Neill in 1974. Mass drivers are based on the coilgun design, adapted to accelerate a non-magnetic object. One application O'Neill proposed for mass drivers was to throw baseball-sized chunks of ore mined <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon into space. Once in space, the ore could be used as raw material for building space colonies and solar power satellites. He took a sabbatical from Princeton to work on mass drivers at MIT. There he served as the Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace during the 1976–77 academic year. At MIT, he, Henry H. Kolm, and a group of student volunteers built their first mass driver prototype. The eight-foot (2.5m) long prototype could apply 33g (320m/s2) of acceleration to an object inserted into it. With financial assistance from SSI, later prototypes improved this to 1,800g (18,000m/s2), enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet (160m) long could launch material off the surface of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Some bats prey on vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, {{birds and}} mammals. The fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus,) for example, is {{particularly}} skilled at catching frogs. These bats locate {{large groups of}} frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water with their sharp canine teeth. Another example is the greater noctule bat, which can catch birds in flight. Some species, like the greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus) hunt fish. They use echolocation to detect small ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it. At least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the spectral bat, {{also known as the}} American false vampire bat, and the ghost bat of Australia.|$|E
