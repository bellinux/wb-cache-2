There are numerous applications where bearings are susceptible to water ingresses such as in the steel, food, and pulp and paper industries. A grease can absorb water to different degrees depending upon the type of grease. The ability of a grease to either absorb or reject water can influence the service life of rolling bearings. Two parameters that determine the performance of a grease at very low temperature are the yield stress and startup torque.

During the fight Palhares {{went for a}} heel-hook however Marquardt slipped his leg free and quickly turned the tables for a first-round TKO victory. However, this came with some controversy. Once Marquardt pulled his leg free, Palhares looked at his hand and signalled to officials and seemingly complained that Marquardt was greased. Marquardt capitalized on the opening and pounded Palhares with a quick barrage of punches. The ending, though, wasn't due to any illegal circumstances. UFC broadcaster Joe Rogan immediately announced that Marquardt had passed an inspection from the ringside physician and the referee. Marquardt explained that before the fight; [...] "I came out really warm because I wanted a good sweat," [...] which explains why he was slippery and managed to remain elusive.Marquardt’s trainer Greg Jackson stated that officials checked Marquardt before the fight for any <b>greasing</b> <b>type</b> substance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fat, oil {{and grease}} are the three {{elements}} usually found in the municipal sewage systems as the results of improper disposal from the sink. These elements come from domestic and commercial kitchens. The absent or inefficient of a plumbing device known as grease trap has caused the trapped of fat, {{oil and grease}} in the sewage systems.

Tests were conducted using two different emergency lubricant types: (1) an oil mist system (two different misted lubricants) and (2) a grease injection system (two different <b>grease</b> <b>types).</b> Tests were conducted using a NASA Glenn test facility normally used for conducting contact fatigue. Tests were run at rotational speeds up to 10000 rpm using two different gear designs and two different gear materials.

The tests allowed an elevated steady state temperature to be established. A basic 2 -D heat transfer simulation has been developed to investigate temperatures of a simulated gear {{as a function of}} frictional behavior.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} the parameters influencing the grease film thickness in a rolling elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact under fully flooded conditions at medium speeds. Film thickness measurements were taken under pure rolling for six commercial greases and their bled oils. The grease film thickness was found to be higher than corresponding bled oil, suggesting the presence of thickener in the contact. No rheological properties (characterized by steady and dynamic shear) showed any direct relation to the film thickness of the studied greases. AFM measurements of the thickener microstructure, from which the dimensional properties of the thickener particles (fibers/platelets/spheres) were estimated, showed that the relative increase in the film thickness due to entrainment of the thickener was proportional to the ratio of thickener volume fraction {{to the size of the}} fibers/platelets/spheres. Hence, with the same concentration, smaller thickener particles lead to the generation of thicker films than larger thickener particles. Next, this relation was used to establish the percentage of the thickener particles passing through the contact. Depending on the <b>grease</b> <b>type,</b> between about 1 and 70 % of the thickener particles were found to travel through the contact...|$|E
40|$|Microparticle image {{velocimetry}} (µPIV) is used {{to measure}} the grease velocity profile in small seal-like geometries and the radial migration of contaminant particles is predicted. In the first part, the influence of shaft speed, <b>grease</b> <b>type,</b> and temperatures on the flow of lubricating greases in a narrow double restriction sealing pocket is evaluated. Such geometries can be found in, for example, labyrinth-type seals. In a wide pocket the velocity profile is one-dimensional and the Herschel-Bulkley model is used. In a narrow pocket, it is shown by the experimental results that the side walls have a significant influence on the grease flow, implying that the grease velocity profile is two-dimensional. In this area, a single empirical grease parameter for the rheology is sufficient to describe the velocity profile. In the second part, the radial migration of contaminant particles through the grease is evaluated. Centrifugal forces acting on a solid spherical particle are calculated from the grease velocity profile. Consequently, particles migrate to a larger radius and finally settle when the grease viscosity becomes large due to the low shear rate. This behavior is important for the sealing function of the grease in the pocket and relubrication...|$|E
40|$|Lubricating grease is {{commonly}} applied to lubricate e. g. rolling bearings, sealsand gears. Grease has some clear advantages over lubricating oil: it is a semisolidmaterial, which prevents it from flowing/ leaking {{out from the}} bearingsystem and gives it sealing properties, and it also protects the system fromcontaminants and corrosion. Due to its consistency, lubricating grease has manyadditional advantages over lubricating oil: {{it does not require}} pumps, filters andsumps. However, the rheology of grease makes it more difficult to measure andstudy its flow dynamics. This study focuses on the influence of rheology ongrease flow in different geometries involving a straight channel with restrictions,concentric cylinder geometry, and free-surface flow on a rotating disc. To better understand grease flow in bearings and seals, two types of flowrestrictions were applied into the straight channel in order to simulate the flowof grease near a seal pocket. In the case of a single restriction, the horizontaldistance required for the velocity profile to fully develop is approximately thesame as the height of the channel. In the corner before and after the restriction,the velocities are very low and part of the grease is stationary. For the channelwith two flow restrictions, this effect is even more pronounced in the narrowspace between the restrictions. Clearly, {{a large part of the}} grease is not moving. This condition particularly applies in the case of a low-pressure gradient andwhere high-consistency grease is used. In practice this means that grease may belocally trapped and consequently old/contaminated grease will remain in theseal pockets. A configuration comprising a rotating shaft and two narrow gap sealing-likerestrictions (also called Double Restriction Seal, DRS) was designed to simulatea sealing contact. Two different gap heights in the DRS have been used tocompare the grease flow. It is shown that partially yielded grease flow isdetected in the large gap geometry and fully yielded grease flow in the small gapgeometry. For the small gap geometry, it is shown that three distinct grease flowregions are present: a slip layer close to the stationary wall, a bulk flow layer,and a slip layer near the rotating shaft. The shear thinning behaviour of thegrease and its wall slip effects have been determined and discussed. Free-surface flow of grease occurs in a variety of situations such as during relubrication and inside a rolling element bearing which is filled to about 30 %with grease in order to prevent heavy churning. Here the reflow of lubricant tothe bearing races is a key point in the lubricant film build-up, and centrifugalforces have a direct impact on the amount of available grease. Understanding ofthe free-surface flow behaviour of grease is hence important for theunderstanding of the lubrication mechanism. Adhesion and mass loss aremeasured for greases with different rheology on different surfaces andtemperatures. It is shown that the critical speed at which the grease starts tomove is mostly determined by <b>grease</b> <b>type,</b> yield stress and temperature ratherthan surface material. A developed analytical model covers a stationary analysisof the flow resulting in solutions for the velocity profile of the grease as well as asolution for the thickness of the viscous layer remaining on the disc.

50|$|A true grease {{consists}} of an oil and/or other fluid lubricant that is mixed with a thickener, typically a soap, to form a solid or semisolid. <b>Greases</b> are a <b>type</b> of shear-thinning or pseudo-plastic fluid, {{which means that the}} viscosity of the fluid is reduced under shear. After sufficient force to shear the grease has been applied, the viscosity drops and approaches that of the base lubricant, such as the mineral oil. This sudden drop in shear force means that grease is considered a plastic fluid, and the reduction of shear force with time makes it thixotropic. It is often applied using a grease gun, which applies the grease to the part being lubricated under pressure, forcing the solid grease into the spaces in the part.|$|R

40|$|Grease is {{a mixture}} of a fluid {{lubricant}} usually petroleum oil and a thickener (soap) dispersed in the oil. The base oil (petroleum) can be changed by using the castor waste.

40|$|Lipids (fat, oil and grease) cause {{disturbances}} in both public sewer pipes and wastewater treatment plants. The pretreatment of sewages with high lipid loads is absolutely important {{in order to}} prevent damages. Bioaugmentation technology, i. e. the use of microorganisms, {{turned out to be a}} means to increase the performance of conventional grease traps. Various microorganisms were evaluated regarding their ability to degrade fat oil and grease within a grease trap. Subsequently the biological degradation of waste fats was studied in different experimental scales. Lab scale experiments in batch culture showed that a mixture of different microorganisms (Yarrowia spp., Candida sp., Rhodococcus spp. and Pseudomonas sp.) eliminated 70 % of applied waste fat within 24 h and 90 % in 14 d, respectively. Thus, the mixed culture eliminated 7. 2 g FOG/l* 5 d- 1 at a volumetric loading of 8 g FOG * l- 1. In comparison, autochthone microorganisms eliminated 57. 4 % (129. 5 mg) of the applied FOG within 14 d. In contrast to the work of (Brooksbank et al. 2007), the abiotic controls showed only a minor decrease of extractable FOG over the experimental time, i. e. 7. 5 % (15 mg FOG) of the applied waste fat within 14 d. In summary, the lab-scale experiments demonstrated that pure cultures are less suited for the degradation of fat than complex mixed cultures. In a fat separator model (scale 1 : 10) developed for this purpose a number of improvements were tested in order to modify a conventional grease separator in order to provide a system suitable for successful bioaugmentation. The tests showed that Rhodococcus erythropolis and Candida cylindracea were able to establish themselves inside the simulator. The FOG loads were almost completely eliminated over the test period of 147 d. Although the COD increased in effluent samples over the time, the content of FOG decreased (600 mg FOG/L at the beginning of the test period, 280 mg FOG/L after 90 days). Bioaugmentation studies were carried out in pilot scale using a modified <b>grease</b> separator, <b>type</b> „TOPO SF/E 2 / 200 “ downstream of a restaurant kitchen facility. The pilot plant worked without technical disturbances over the whole test period of six months. Unfortunately, the first two bioaugmentation campaigns were not successful. Contrary to the results obtained in lab scale experiments, the microorganisms were not able to establish themselves in the system due to drastic changes of pH (3 - 12) in all compartments of the grease separator. These extreme pH levels were not expectable, because they are illegal and prohibited by constitutions and prescriptive limits of the municipal administration. The pilot scale studies displayed that the prescriptive limits were neither attained with nor without the bioaugmentation system. As of now, the technical practice prevents the successful operation of implemented bioaugmentation. The use of neutral detergents and a separated disposal of disinfectants should allow for the future use of bioaugmentation processes to eliminate grease loads within a grease separator...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a formulation of high performance grease from waste oils and red gypsum. The objectives {{for this study}} are to develop high performance <b>grease</b> from different <b>types</b> of waste oils and red gypsum and also {{to determine the best}} quality of grease based on different ratio of red gypsum and fumed silica. Grease is a semi-solid lubricant that the composition comprising of three major components, a lubricating base oil, a thickener and an additive. The grease formulated using four different waste oils as base oil which is recovered oil from waste emulsions, waste cooking oil, used oil and silicone oil, while fumed silica and red gypsum are used as thickener, molybdenum disulphide as additive and iron octoate as anti-oxidant agent. Different ratios of fumed silica and red gypsum were tested in this research to determine which ratio will formulate the best grade of grease based on National Lubricating Grease Institute (NLGI) number grade grease. The proportions of fumed silica and red gypsum involves are (100 % red gypsum), (80 % red gypsum, 20 % fumed silica), (60 % red gypsum, 40 % fumed silica) and (50 % red gypsum and 50 % fumed silica). Evaluation is carried out using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) to characterise the new formulation of grease in term of penetration test, dropping point test, type of thickener and amount of oil separated. This test is important to find the best formulation of grease from waste oils and red gypsum, by comparing it with greases that available in markets. It was discovered that the formulated grease has no dropping point even after 240 °C of heating which proves that the grease has a stable structure at higher temperature. When the amount of fumed silica and red gypsum increases, oil separation decreases while the consistency of the grease increases. Grease properties are not only dependent on the composition of the base oil but also on the size and configuration of particles of the thickening agent. The more fumed silica contains in the grease, better the grease‟s quality. Greases with a higher grade number are firmer, tend to stay in place and are a good choice when leakage is concern. From the result of the experiment, grease was well made using base oil from silicone oil, following by waste emulsion. Smooth grease was made by using waste cooking oil, while grease cannot form when using used oil...|$|R
