5|$|In Falls the Shadow (1988) Penman {{chronicles the}} family {{relationships}} of King Henry III and his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. Falls the Shadow is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead {{her to the}} conclusion of the trilogy in The Reckoning. As Penman explains: '“After I’d finished Here Be Dragons, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to continue the story… At first I’d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr’s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon’s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this was too much to tackle in one book, that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. So I decided to devote Falls the Shadow to Simon and The Reckoning to Llewelyn".|$|E
5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do a song with her. It finally happened, {{and it turned out}} hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

She said that [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be sexy, so I thought no pants, because that's sexy, And I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to be futuristic, so I thought shoulder pads, because that's my thing." [...] The music video premiered on MTV UK on February 17, 2009. In some versions of the song, the words [...] "muffin" [...] (being a slang term for the woman's vagina), [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "gun" [...] are censored out (bleeped). On June 21, 2009, the video won the Best International Artist Video at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards. The video received four nominations at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, in the categories of Video of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Female Video and Best Pop Video. Along with five other nominations for [...] "Paparazzi", Gaga was tied with Beyoncé for most nominations each for that year.|$|E

500|$|During {{his stay}} in New York, Karthi {{worked as a}} {{part-time}} graphic designer. He then decided {{to pursue a career}} in film-making; he attended two courses in basic film-making at State University of New York. He stated, [...] "I always <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be in films but I did not know exactly what I wanted to do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them. But my father insisted that I get a good education before I joined the film industry".|$|E
500|$|During the film's {{pre-production}} at Paramount, Boorman cast Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton in {{the lead}} roles of Hank and Jacob Mitchell, respectively. A Simple Plan marked the second on-screen collaboration between Paxton and Thornton after One False Move (1992). Thornton recalled, [...] "I {{got a call from}} one of my agents who said, 'John Boorman wants you to do a script that I sent you a year ago and you never read,' I said, 'Send it to me again, and this time I'll really read it.' Within the first two pages, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Nine Inch Nails' {{earliest}} influences include Ministry and Skinny Puppy, {{which helped}} shape what became 1989's Pretty Hate Machine. The album's liner notes also {{paid tribute to}} the hip-hop group Public Enemy and Prince. Another large influence on the band's sound is Gary Numan, which is evident as Reznor once said that [...] "after hearing 'Cars' I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to make music with synthesizers". The 2005 single [...] "Only" [...] exemplifies the disco-style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan's persuasion. Other artists of significance to Nine Inch Nails encompass late 70s and 80s acts such as Queen, Devo, Joy Division, Adam Ant, and Soft Cell.|$|E

500|$|Perry's {{decision}} to write [...] "E.T." [...] came after its beat was accidentally played during a recording session {{she had with}} Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo. It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. However, after hearing it, Perry chose {{to work with the}} track. She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this. I know this seems like a long shot, but I think I have the perfect material to put on top of this sound.' And I did, and it really worked out perfectly." ...|$|E

In the video, Gaga walks from New York City to Nebraska to get her boyfriend back. According to Gaga: [...] "I'm walking with no luggage and no nothing and it's just me and my ankles are bleeding {{a little bit and}} there's grass stuck in my shoes and I've got this outfit on and it's real sort of New York clothing and I'm sprinting... And the [...] idea that when you're away from someone you love, it's torture," [...] she continued. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> the video to be about me sprinting back and walking hundreds of thousands of miles to get him back." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By that time, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to write games." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{studying}} cinema at the University of Southern California, Dan O'Bannon {{had made}} a science-fiction comedy film, Dark Star, with director John Carpenter and concept artist Ron Cobb. The film featured an alien created by spray-painting a beach ball; the experience left O'Bannon [...] "really wanting to do an alien that looked real." [...] A [...] "couple of years" [...] later he began work on a similar story that would focus more on horror. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do a scary movie on a spaceship with {{a small number of}} astronauts", he later recalled, [...] "Dark Star as a horror movie instead of a comedy." [...] Ronald Shusett, meanwhile, was working on an early version of what would eventually become Total Recall. Impressed by Dark Star, he contacted O'Bannon and the two agreed to collaborate on their projects, choosing to work on O'Bannon's film first as they believed it would be less costly to produce.|$|E
500|$|The {{compilation}} album includes 19 {{songs by}} various artists. Thirteen {{of the tracks}} were previously unreleased; the six existing recordings were: [...] "Wish for You" [...] by Faith Hill, Sade's [...] "The Sweetest Gift", [...] "I Remember" [...] by Lauryn Hill, Seal's [...] "Secret", [...] "Fragilidad" [...] (1988) by Sting, and David Bowie's [...] "Everyone Says 'Hi'". Turlington said of the album: I went to friends first, as I did with the first CD. Bono and Chris Martin were great supporters of the project the first time around, and when I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to include men on this album they were obvious choices. They are also both fathers to daughters. Others, such as Patti Smith and Rita Wilson, I've {{known for a long}} time, and some, like Edie Brickell and Paul Simon, I only met briefly but was a huge admirer. I generally wanted a diverse group of artists who were parents, {{or in the case of}} Edward Sharpe, who will be soon. We wanted to reach a broad audience on this issue with this particular project and with a range of perspectives.|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E

500|$|After meeting George Lamb on {{a holiday}} in Ibiza, Allen made him her manager. Lamb later {{introduced}} the singer to production duo Future Cut, {{with whom she}} had written and produced demos, which were sent to various labels. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records, who gave her £25,000 to produce an album. The singer considered it to be a [...] "small development idea", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases. Taking advice from Lady Sovereign, the singer created an account on MySpace and began posting demo songs in November 2005. By March 2006, they attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" [...] vinyl singles of one of the demos, a song titled [...] "LDN", were rush-released and sold for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly took interest. Few people outside of her label's A department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to [...] "more mainstream producers and top-line writers". After that, they finally approved some of her songs, being confident of their inclusion on the album. [...] "Smile" [...] was among the chosen ones, that Allen claimed she was happy with. It was the first song she had ever written, claiming:When I set out to do this I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to make songs that sounded a) up to date and now and b) really organic. Because you can't get really good players without spending loads of money these days, the only other option is to sample. The first song I ever wrote was 'Smile'. We just went through about seven or eight sample lyrics, found a beat, put it all in... Then when it comes to writing lyrics I write... like a rapper would, I suppose, with absolutely no melody involved whatsoever, I'm just getting my flow sorted. Then I write the whole text of the song and then ad lib the melody into the microphone. It's not terribly clever! ...|$|E

[...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be in movies… So I thought I wanted to be in special effects, like model-making and {{prosthetic}} effects." [...] The combination of knowing he would find a career in the visual effects area and the advancement of technology allowing better computer graphics capabilities led him to work at a Canadian post-production company as a visual effects artist. The aliens in District 9 were designed by Weta Workshop, and the design was executed by Image Engine.|$|E

2500|$|The show's creators {{claim that}} they weren't {{engaging}} in a product placement strategy for commercial gain.
