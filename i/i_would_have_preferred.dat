500|$|Upon the single's release, Derek Johnson of the NME wrote: [...] "The {{intriguing}} {{features of}} 'Hey Jude' are its extreme length and the 40-piece orchestral accompaniment – and personally <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> it without either!" [...] While he viewed the track overall as [...] "a beautiful, compelling song", {{and the first}} three minutes as [...] "absolutely sensational", Johnson rued the long coda's [...] "vocal improvisations on the basically repetitive four-bar chorus". Time magazine described the coda as [...] "a fadeout that engagingly spoofs the fadeout as a gimmick for ending pop records". The same reviewer contrasted [...] "Hey Jude" [...] with its B-side, [...] "Revolution", saying that [...] "The {{other side of the}} new disk urges activism of a different sort", due to McCartney [...] "liltingly exhort a friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love". Rolling Stone also attributed the song's meaning as a message from McCartney to Lennon to end his negative relationships with women: [...] "to break the old pattern; to really go through with love". Other commentators interpreted [...] "Hey Jude" [...] as being directed at Bob Dylan, then semi-retired in Woodstock.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

The referee did not whistle 'hand' but I can't say there wasn't hand."

2500|$|On 28 September, Reina {{declared}} that his Liverpool career was over: [...] "At the moment it's difficult {{to think about}} being a Liverpool player next year.

There's no reason to think I'll be a Liverpool player from now on but we'll see where the future takes us.

Morse was accused of flip-flopping on whether or not he would run.|$|E
2500|$|Izzy Stradlin, {{who left}} the band in November 1991, later stated that {{replacing}} Adler with Matt Sorum of The Cult had {{a big impact on}} the band's sound. In response to an interviewer's suggestion that the line-up change had turned Guns N' Roses from a rock 'n' roll band into a heavy metal one, Stradlin said, [...] "Yeah, a big musical difference. ... were written with Steve playing the drums and his sense of swing was the push and pull that give the songs their feel.

2500|$|A street art {{memorial}} called [...] "RIP Jill" [...] {{was created}} in Hosier Lane, Melbourne, by an unknown artist in September 2012. In early November 2012 the 20 metre mural was painted almost completely over by other street artists. The Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Robert Doyle, said that [...] "The street art community painted the original message and have now painted over it. Personally <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> just the name Jill to remain as a more permanent gesture but that is obviously no longer possible." [...] Of the transient nature of such works, the Premier of Victoria, Ted Baillieu, said that [...] "The tribute to Jill Meagher was created {{very much in the}} spirit of Hosier Lane, an iconic part of Melbourne, and no doubt that will continue." ...|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{shortcomings}} of The Goddess Pose, Goldberg weaves an interesting, albeit casual, narrative of Devi’s complicated, and often reckless, life.

5000|$|Like Algren's {{previous}} novel, Never Come Morning, The Man {{with the}} Golden Arm drew fire from leaders of Chicago's Polish community, who criticized {{the portrayal of}} their community in the story. Royko wrote of these critics, [...] "They believed that...

6000|$|... § 9. If {{the reader}} sees {{nothing in this}} drawing (Fig. 108) that he can like,--although, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> him <b>prefer</b> the work of Turner,--let him be assured {{that he does not}} yet {{understand}} on what Titian's reputation is founded. No painter's name is oftener in the mouth of the ordinary connoisseur, and no painter was ever less understood. His power of color is indeed perfect, but so is Bonifazio's. Titian's supremacy above all the other Venetians, except Tintoret and Veronese, consists in the firm truth of his portraiture, and more or less masterly {{understanding of the nature of}} stones, trees, men, or whatever else he took in hand to paint; so that, without some correlative understanding in the spectator, Titian's work, in its highest qualities, must be utterly dead and unappealing to him.|$|R

60|$|I began immediately. When Dora {{was very}} childish, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{infinitely}} <b>preferred</b> to humour her, I {{tried to be}} grave--and disconcerted her, and myself too. I talked {{to her on the}} subjects which occupied my thoughts; and I read Shakespeare to her--and fatigued her to the last degree. I accustomed myself to giving her, as it were quite casually, little scraps of useful information, or sound opinion--and she started from them when I let them off, {{as if they had been}} crackers. No matter how incidentally or naturally I endeavoured to form my little wife's mind, I could not help seeing that she always had an instinctive perception of what I was about, and became a prey to the keenest apprehensions. In particular, it was clear to me, that she thought Shakespeare a terrible fellow. The formation went on very slowly.|$|R
60|$|I {{caught the}} ball, for Melissa never turned her head. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to be scornful, too, and reject the food altogether; but I was so dreadfully thirsty that I put my pride {{in my pocket}} and hauled the basket up.

60|$|I was not bold in '67, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to {{take any}} other seat rather than face this divine apparition; {{but there was no}} help for it, since all the others were filled: so I sat down a little sheepishly, I dare say.

60|$|As for me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> much <b>preferred</b> to jump {{overboard}} at once, {{instead of}} waiting in this cold-blooded manner; but as my companions had so far preserved their presence of mind, I {{did not wish to}} do anything which might throw them into a panic. <b>I</b> believed there <b>would</b> be no danger from the suction caused by the sinking of a small boat like this, and if we took care not to entangle ourselves with it in any way, we might as well follow Mrs. Lecks's advice as not. So we all stood up, Mrs. Lecks in the stern, I in the bow, and Mrs. Aleshine on a thwart between us. The last did not appear to have quite room enough for a steady footing, but, as she remarked, it did not matter very much, as the footing, broad or narrow, would not be there very long.|$|R
500|$|Cameron sketched Jack's nude {{portrait}} of Rose for a scene which he feels has {{the backdrop of}} repression. [...] "You {{know what it means}} for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason," [...] he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. [...] "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," [...] Cameron stated. [...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, <b>I</b> probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." [...] Cameron said he and his crew [...] "were just trying to find things to shoot" [...] because the big set [...] "wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot." [...] After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.|$|R
5000|$|Becky Lea of Den of Geek wrote, [...] "The wider season arc is {{developing}} nicely, especially {{the focus on}} how the Darkness is affecting {{the world as we}} know it, both actively and indirectly. Although <b>I</b> personally <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> a singular episode, using a seemingly straightforward case to illustrate what Amara is up to and clue the boys in on to how she {{is developing}} is a streamlined way of advancing that narrative arc. Sam and Dean are now as up to speed as Crowley and it gives the show a template to move forward with as they 'follow the bodies' {{to catch up with the}} speedily growing Amara. 'Thin Lizzie' is a bit of a mixed episode then, but there's still some entertaining stuff in there. I think I was perhaps a little spoiled by how good Baby was. Next week sees Castiel contact Metatron for help with the Darkness so we're back in deep season Big Bad territory." ...|$|R
60|$|It is an inane town, {{filled with}} sham, and petty fraud, and snobbery, but the baths are good. I spoke with many people, {{and they were}} all agreed in that.

I fully believe I left my rheumatism in Baden-Baden. Baden-Baden is welcome to it.

Tom and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to sleep in the woods near by, with our feet to the blaze; this was partly from motives of economy, and partly because Tom, in common with other pioneers, held an inn in contempt.

60|$|This matter arranged, George, and Jos, and Dobbin, held {{a council}} of war over their cigars, and agreed that a general move {{should be made}} for London in Jos's open {{carriage}} the next day. Jos, <b>I</b> think, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> staying until Rawdon Crawley quitted Brighton, but Dobbin and George overruled him, and he agreed to carry the party to town, and ordered four horses, as became his dignity. With these they set off in state, after breakfast, the next day. Amelia had risen {{very early in the}} morning, and packed her little trunks with the greatest alacrity, while Osborne lay in bed deploring that she had not a maid to help her.

2500|$|The {{following}} {{report of}} a South Melbourne v Melbourne game appeared in The Australasian of 14 July 1894: Someone told them (Melbourne) that McKnight, Windley and Waugh were {{the backbone of the}} Southern team and they immediately conceived the idea of telling men off to block these players. [...] Moysey was directed to shadow McKnight, young Wardill had to prevent Windley getting possession ... and Lewis was appointed to control the movements of Waugh. [...] Their instructions were very definite. [...] They were all three told that it did not matter whether they got a kick themselves at all in the match, if they only succeeded in spoiling the play of the three South cracks. [...] Those who were present at the match can say how well these instructions were carried out. [...] There was nothing in the tactics adopted that infringed a solitary rule of the game and the plan was singularly effective, but I own to feeling a shade of doubt concerning the manliness of the whole proceeding. [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> certainly <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to see the representatives of the grand old Melbourne win ... purely upon their superior prowess as players.|$|R
2500|$|Nadal's {{withdrawal}} {{elevated the}} first alternate, Gilles Simon, into the draw, {{making him the}} second Frenchman of the eight-men field, alongside Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and marking {{the first time that}} two Frenchmen participated in the year-end event since the Masters Grand Prix event of 1986, in which Yannick Noah and Henri Leconte competed. Simon was ranked eighth in the ATP Race entering the Paris Masters thanks to his final in Madrid and his semifinal at the Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon, where he lost to eventual champion Robin Söderling, but was knocked out of the Top Eight when he lost to Andy Roddick in the third round, and Tsonga qualified by winning the title. Simon, who flew to Shanghai with countryman and friend Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on November 5, commented on Nadal's withdrawal and his first selection for the year-end event: [...] "I was unhappy that he had to pull out. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> really <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to qualify directly by finishing eighth. It's not in my nature to wish that another player can't play. [...] I'm really happy to be going there and I really want to experience this." ...|$|R
