25|$|RBMK reactor fuel {{was used}} in Soviet-designed and built RBMK-type reactors. This is a low-enriched uranium oxide fuel. The fuel {{elements}} in an RBMK are 3 m long each, and two of these sit back-to-back on each <b>fuel</b> <b>channel,</b> pressure tube. Reprocessed uranium from Russian VVER reactor spent fuel is used to fabricate RBMK fuel. Following the Chernobyl accident, the enrichment of fuel was changed from 2.0% to 2.4%, to compensate for control rod modifications {{and the introduction of}} additional absorbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{refueling}} {{machine is}} mounted on a gantry crane and remotely controlled. The fuel assemblies can be replaced without shutting down the reactor, a factor significant for production of weapon-grade plutonium and, in a civilian context, for better reactor uptime. When a fuel assembly has to be replaced, the machine is positioned above the <b>fuel</b> <b>channel,</b> mates to it, equalizes pressure within, pulls the rod, and inserts a fresh one. The spent rod is then placed in a cooling pond. The capacity of the refueling machine with the reactor at nominal power level is two fuel assemblies per day, with peak capacity of five per day.|$|E

50|$|During further {{pre-operational}} testing, severe vibration of the <b>fuel</b> <b>channel</b> gags was detected. The <b>fuel</b> <b>channel</b> gags are valves {{which are}} gradually closed {{to restrict the}} flow of gas through a <b>fuel</b> <b>channel</b> {{in order to maintain}} the channel gas outlet temperature as the nuclear fuel is used up. Modifications to produce a fluidically generated bias force to stop the gags vibrating took time to design, test and implement, delaying the planned start up date.

50|$|The UNGG and the Magnox are the {{two main}} types of gas cooled reactor (GCR). A UNGG reactor is often {{referred}} to simply as a GCR in English documents, or sometimes loosely as a Magnox. It was developed independently of and in parallel to the British Magnox design, and to meet similar requirements. The first UNGG reactors at Marcoule used horizontal <b>fuel</b> <b>channels</b> and a concrete containment structure. Chinon A1 used vertical <b>fuel</b> <b>channels,</b> as did the British Magnox reactors, and a steel pressure-vessel.|$|R
50|$|According to {{observers}} outside Unit 4, burning {{lumps of}} material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor. Some of them fell onto {{the roof of the}} machine hall and started a fire. About 25 percent of the red-hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the <b>fuel</b> <b>channels</b> was ejected. Parts of the graphite blocks and <b>fuel</b> <b>channels</b> were out of the reactor building. As a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core. The air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire.|$|R

40|$|Remote Visual Inspection (RVI) of Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) {{nuclear power}} {{stations}} allows engineers {{to gain an}} understanding of the AGR graphite core health by investigating the incorporated <b>fuel</b> <b>channels.</b> During planned, periodic outages, video footage of the pre-selected <b>fuel</b> <b>channels</b> is acquired using specialist inspection tools and is subsequently taken offline for further analysis using visualization techniques.

This paper introduces a new bespoke 3 -D reconstruction framework to recover lost depth information to produce 3 -D point cloud reconstructions of <b>fuel</b> <b>channels</b> from inspection videos. We also present here a new, lab based, experimental rig setup with which we effectively captured data under lab controlled conditions to verify our 3 -D reconstruction algorithms. Our proposed method is tested on 2 -D in core inspection videos in addition to the footage captured within laboratory conditions and outperforms state-of-the-art incremental reconstruction frameworks whilst producing a more representative 3 -D point cloud for improved in-core visualization...|$|R

The paper describes the problems encountered during the ISI, the experimental methods adopted and the results obtained.

50|$|Operators {{tried to}} examine the pile with a remote scanner but it had jammed.

40|$|During planned, {{periodic}} outages, {{a selection}} of <b>fuel</b> <b>channels</b> within the UK fleet of Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) cores are inspected using specialist tools which record video footage and other sensory data for each channel which undergoes inspection. Current visualization techniques comprise of manually produced montages by inspection engineers of points of interest (i. e. structural defects) and 2 -D panoramic images of the <b>fuel</b> <b>channels</b> automatically produced using bespoke image stitching software. Both techniques however provide limited structural information due {{to the loss of}} depth data {{as a result of the}} image formation process. By recovering the depth information from the footage, a 3 -D model could be constructed and subsequently, allow for more accurate profiling of specific defects observed during inspection in addition to obtaining the <b>fuel</b> <b>channels</b> structure using existing footage. This work explores the preliminary application of a 3 -D visualization technique known as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) which aims to obtain 3 -D information by exploiting image correspondences across multiple viewpoints of the same scene in the RVI footage. This paper investigates the difficulties of applying state-of-the-art SfM to RVI footage and we present new techniques to improve feature correspondence searching in repetitive, non-descript environments...|$|R

With respect to the control rod-fuel channel interference, the reference letter contained a commitment to provide interim recommendations for surveillance actions to detect control rod-fuel channel interference and determine when the friction associated with the interference is sufficient to cause a concern with control rod insertion, fuel bundle lift or loads on reactor internals. The control rod-fuel channel interference evaluation has been completed. It determined that BWR/ 6 and BWR/ 4 & 5 C-lattice plants with GNF thick/thin channels potentially have increased channel bow that can impact fuel bundle lift, loads on reactor internals...|$|R
