The {{aim of this study}} was to compare H 3 PO 4 and Carisolv in vitro treatments of human dentin applying microradiography, SEM examination and X-ray microanalysis to evaluate the capacity of these products to clean dentin surface for glass ionomer cement (GCI) application. Forty extracted permanent molars with dentin caries were treated with 35 % H 3 PO 4 or Carisolv gel according to manufacturer instructions. Ten teeth of each group were filled with GCI and then embedded in methyl-methacrylate (PMMA). The PMMA blocks were sectioned, polished and microradiographed. The remaining teeth were dehydrated and desiccated in a critical point <b>dryer.</b> <b>Sections</b> and teeth were then prepared for SEM and X-ray microanalysis. H 3 PO 4 treatment produced unpolished surfaces (probably due to mineral re-precipitation), demineralization of dentin, exorbitant tubule widening, highly irregular dentin surface of cavities, and dentin fragments embedded by GCI. Carisolv treatment produced polished dentin surfaces with open tubules, little crystal re-precipitation, good GCI adhesion and penetration inside tubules.

40|$|Drying is an {{important}} unit operation in process industry. Results {{have suggested that the}} energy used for drying has increased from 12 % in 1978 to 18 % of the total energy used in 1990. A literature survey of previous studies regarding overall drying energy consumption has demonstrated that there is little continuity of methods and energy trends could not be established. In the ceramics, timber and paper industrial sectors specific energy consumption and energy trends have been investigated by auditing drying equipment. Ceramic products examined have included tableware, tiles, sanitaryware, electrical ceramics, plasterboard, refractories, bricks and abrasives. Data from industry has shown that drying energy has not varied significantly in the ceramics sector over the last decade, representing about 31 % of the total energy consumed. Information from the timber industry has established that radical changes have occurred over the last 20 years, both in terms of equipment and energy utilisation. The energy efficiency of hardwood drying has improved by 15 % since the 1970 s, although no significant savings have been realised for softwood. A survey estimating the energy efficiency and operating characteristics of 192 paper <b>dryer</b> <b>sections</b> has been conducted. Drying energy was found to increase to nearly 60 % of the total energy used in the early 1980 s, but has fallen over the last decade, representing 23 % of the total in 1993. These results have demonstrated that effective energy saving measures, such as improved pressing and heat recovery, have been successfully implemented since the 1970 s. Artificial neural networks have successfully been applied to model process characteristics of microwave and convective drying of paper coated gypsum cove. Parameters modelled have included product moisture loss, core gypsum temperature and quality factors relating to paper burning and bubbling defects. Evaluation of thermal and dielectric properties have highlighted gypsum's heat sensitive characteristics in convective and electromagnetic regimes.

The theoretical model was based on mass and energy balance equations about a slice of paper composing pulp fibres, free and bound water, water vapour and air. Time-varying boundary conditions, corresponding to the movement of the paper sheet over the 40 - 50 drying cylinders, were assigned and the equations were converted to finite difference form and solved by computer using standard linear algebra methods.

The paper produced was made of kraft softwood pulp with basis weights of 60 - 120 g/m(2). The roll surface temperature ranged from ambient temperature to 350 degreesC and the press loads were between 400 - 800 kN/m. The paper was produced at machine speeds: of 300 - 800 m/min. Two different impulse drying efficiencies were defined, the total specific energy use (TSEU) and the impulse drying specific energy use (ISEU).

Equality constraints of the optimization model were obtained from specified process blocks considering mass and energy balance relationships in drying and heat recovery sections.

For a corrugating machine, optimized parameters show the total steam use can be reduced by about 11 % due to improvement of the heat recovery performance and optimization of the operating conditions such as inlet web dryness, evaporation rate, and exhaust air humidity, accordingly total steam consumption can be decreased from about 1. 71 to 1. 53 tonnes steam per tonne paper production.
