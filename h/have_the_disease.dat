5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} pneumothorax or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|Those at {{high risk}} of {{infection}} should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, {{men who have sex with}} men, and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E

25|$|To get an {{appropriate}} example in a real-world problem, consider a diagnostic test {{that seeks to}} determine whether a person has a certain disease. A false positive in this case occurs when the person tests positive, but does not actually <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> A false negative, on the other hand, occurs when the person tests negative, suggesting they are healthy, when they actually do <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

25|$|Herd {{immunity}} also decreases risk {{to people}} who have a compromised immune system. Some people who have a compromised immune system cannot get certain vaccines and thus are at increased risk if those around them are not vaccinated for those diseases. If the immunocompromised person is surrounded by people who have not been vaccinated and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> that person will likely contract the disease. The outcome for people with compromised immune systems who subsequently get infected is often worse than that of the general population. Herd immunity decreases this risk.|$|E

25|$|A typeI error (or {{error of}} the first kind) is the {{incorrect}} rejection of a true null hypothesis. Usually a type I error leads one to conclude that a supposed effect or relationship exists when in fact it doesn't. Examples of type I errors include a test that shows a patient to have a disease when in fact the patient does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> a fire alarm going on indicating a fire when in fact there is no fire, or an experiment indicating that a medical treatment should cure a disease when in fact it does not.|$|E
25|$|Atherosclerosis is {{asymptomatic}} {{for decades}} because the arteries enlarge at all plaque locations, thus {{there is no}} effect on blood flow. Even most plaque ruptures do not produce symptoms until enough narrowing or closure of an artery, due to clots, occurs. Signs and symptoms only occur after severe narrowing or closure impedes blood flow to different organs enough to induce symptoms. Most of the time, patients realize that they <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> only when they experience other cardiovascular disorders such as stroke or heart attack. These symptoms, however, still vary depending on which artery or organ is affected.|$|E

25|$|The {{identification}} of genetic disorders of copper metabolism leading to severe copper toxicity (i.e., Wilson disease) has spurred {{research into the}} molecular genetics and biology of copper homeostasis (for further information, refer to the following section on copper genetic diseases). Much attention {{has focused on the}} potential consequences of copper toxicity in normal and potentially susceptible populations. Potentially susceptible subpopulations include hemodialysis patients and individuals with chronic liver disease. Recently, concern was expressed about the potential sensitivity to liver disease of individuals who are heterozygote carriers of Wilson disease genetic defects (i.e., those having one normal and one mutated Wilson copper ATPase gene) but who do not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> (which requires defects in both relevant genes). However, to date, no data are available that either support or refute this hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Rabies {{is caused}} by lyssaviruses, {{including}} the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. Rabies is spread when an infected animal scratches or bites another animal or human. Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes {{into contact with the}} eyes, mouth, or nose. Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved. More than 99% of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> are caused by dog bites. In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs. Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies. The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves. The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{cause is}} unclear; however, it is {{believed}} to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. A person {{is more likely to}} be affected if they have a family member with the disease. If one twin is affected, a 30% chance exists that the other twin will also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> The onset of disease may be triggered by stress, infection, or giving birth. Those with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to be affected. Smoking increases the risk of disease and may worsen eye problems. The disorder results from an antibody, called thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), that has a similar effect to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). These TSI antibodies cause the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormone. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with blood tests and radioiodine uptake. Typically, blood tests show a raised T3 and T4, low TSH, increased radioiodine uptake in all areas of the thyroid, and TSI antibodies.|$|E
25|$|The Corrupted Blood {{incident}} {{was described as}} a fascinating yet accidental case study of modeling disease origins and control at the Games for Health conference in Baltimore, Maryland by Gamasutra. They compared it to a real-life epidemic, in that it originated in a remote, uninhabited region and was carried by travelers to larger regions; hosts were both human and animal, comparing it to the avian flu; was passed through close contact; and there were people, in this case non-playable characters, who could contract it but were asymptomatic. However, there were elements that differed from a real-world epidemic, including an indicator for carriers that they <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> and how much risk they are at, which cannot be done in the real world. One aspect of the epidemic that was not considered by epidemiologists in their models was curiosity, describing how players would rush into infected areas to witness the infection and then rush out. This was paralleled to real-world behavior, specifically with how journalists would cover an incident, and then leave the area.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} regarding EEC {{syndrome is}} focused on the genetic components contributing to the presented traits found in patients with EEC. A normal human karyotype includes 22 pairs of autosomal or non-sex chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, constituting a total of 46 chromosomes. During reproduction, each parent contributes 23 chromosomes; 22 autosomal chromosomes and one sex chromosome. As stated above, EEC syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that there is an abnormal gene on one of the autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes from either parent. Because the gene is dominant, only one parent must contribute the abnormal gene for the child to inherit the disease and the contributing parent will usually <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> due to the expression of the dominant gene in the parent. Some characteristics of autosomal dominant inheritance patterns include a vertical transmission pattern, meaning that the disease phenotype is seen in generation after generation. Also, the recurrence risk is 50% and there are an equal number of affected males and females. Though we can calculate the chance of inheritance of the gene, the degree of expression cannot be calculated.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{importance}} of anomalous experiences such as benign hallucinations to theoretical psychology lies in their {{relevance to the}} debate between the disease model versus the dimensional model of psychosis.

[...] According to the dimensional model, by contrast, the population at large is ranged along a normally distributed continuum or dimension, which has been variously labelled as psychoticism (H.J.Eysenck), schizotypy (Gordon Claridge) or psychosis-proneness.|$|E
