In this production (1970-1971) he used a new pictorial language of symbolical and magic value of elements and their mixture of materials and acids (glue-earth-bone-blood-acids). Claudio explained the acid canvases writing, [...] "I used three acids and a sulfate; nitric acid, which corroded the support almost immediately, <b>iron</b> <b>chloride</b> which gave a brownish colour, and cupper sulphate, which reminded me of the wonderful color of vine leaves when they are sprayed and which I needed to obtain a light blue base".

GST is mainly involved in the conjugation of electrophilic compounds with glutathione (GSH), although some of its isoenzymes display peroxidase activity.

40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} for the direct determination of glutathione reductase (GOR) activity in Vero cells cultured in microtitre plates, avoiding cell-free extract preparation. The cells in each well were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with Triton X- 100, and assayed in 0. 1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7. 0. After subtracting oxidase activity, which increased with NADPH concentration, the net GOR activity was similar at different oxidised glutathione (GSSG) and NADPH concentrations, thus confirming enzyme saturation. The optimised GOR assay used 2. 5 mM GSSG and 0. 12 mM NADPH; 5 mM EDTA was also added to prevent the enzyme from redox inactivation. The GOR activity was directly proportional {{to the number of}} cells per well {{for a wide range of}} cell densities, thus supporting the assay's validity for use with cultured cells. The effects on GORactivity of three chemicals which induce oxidative stress, namely, paraquat, <b>iron</b> (11) <b>chloride</b> and <b>iron</b> (111) <b>chloride,</b> were examined to validate the assay under experimental conditions.
