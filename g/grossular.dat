25|$|<b>Grossular</b> is a calcium-aluminium garnet {{with the}} formula Ca3Al2(SiO4)3, though the calcium may in part be {{replaced}} by ferrous iron and the aluminium by ferric iron. The name <b>grossular</b> {{is derived from the}} botanical name for the gooseberry, grossularia, in reference to the green garnet of this composition that is found in Siberia. Other shades include cinnamon brown (cinnamon stone variety), red, and yellow. Because of its inferior hardness to zircon, which the yellow crystals resemble, they have also been called hessonite from the Greek meaning inferior. <b>Grossular</b> is found in contact metamorphosed limestones with vesuvianite, diopside, wollastonite and wernerite.|$|E
25|$|The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all Al2SiO5 – are {{structurally}} {{composed of}} one 4− tetrahedron, and one Al3+ in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al3+ {{can be in}} six-fold coordination (kyanite), five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as tephroite, Mn2SiO4. The garnet group has a general formula of X3Y2(SiO4)3, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al3+ in the Y position: pyrope (Mg3Al2(SiO4)3), almandine (Fe3Al2(SiO4)3), and spessartine (Mn3Al2(SiO4)3). The ugrandite garnets have Ca2+ in the X position: uvarovite (Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3), <b>grossular</b> (Ca3Al2(SiO4)3) and andradite (Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.|$|E

40|$|Although {{conventional}} wisdom {{has been that}} irradiation will not alter the color of garnets, exposure of some colorless to pale-hued African <b>grossulars</b> to either ^(60) Co or ^(137) Cs gamma rays turns them light yellow-green. The resulting color is unstable and fades within hours to days in sunlight, and within weeks in the dark. The spectra of the radiation-enhanced garnets {{differ from those of}} similar-appearing naturally colored <b>grossulars.</b> In the dark, the irradiation-related absorption features undergo two stages of fading: an initial period of relatively rapid fading, followed by a longer period of slow fading. In daylight, a single rate of even faster fading is observed...|$|R
5000|$|Wiluite {{is a dark}} green, brownish, {{or black}} blocky {{silicate}} mineral with formula: Ca19(Al,Mg,Fe,Ti)13(B,Al,)5Si18O68(O,OH)10. It has a Mohs hardness of 6 and a specific gravity of 3.36. It has a vitreous lustre, poor cleavage and an irregular brittle fracture. It crystallizes in the tetragonal system and occurs as well-formed crystals with good external form. It is isostructural with the vesuvianite group and is associated with wollastonite and olive-green <b>grossulars</b> (viluites) in a serpentinized skarn.|$|R
