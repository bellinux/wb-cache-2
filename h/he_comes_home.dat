2500|$|The song title [...] "Yellow Ledbetter" [...] {{is derived}} from the actual name of an old friend of Vedder from Chicago, named Tim Ledbetter.

[...] On the official bootleg release of 5/3/03 - State College, Pennsylvania, Vedder sings [...] "I'd like to wish this war away, and I tried, but it just, just don't happen, don't happen that way/And my brother...they sent him off to fight for the flag.
