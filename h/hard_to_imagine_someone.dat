He admitted that one reason for his acceptance of the offer was that he felt possessive of the role of Poirot, considering he had been portraying the character for so long.

40|$|Key {{to design}} ability {{is said to}} be a {{characteristic}} form of cognition, generally described as ‘visual thinking’. Therefore, it seems <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> that <b>someone</b> can design in the absence of sight. Blindness seems at odds with the visual modes of thinking and communicating that are considered to be at the core of design ability. Even more so, designing might even seem impossible without sight as the key ‘tool’ to assist design cognition—the traditional sketch—loses its power. Several studies have emphasized freehand sketching’s inherent power to facilitate the uncertain, ambiguous and exploratory nature of conceptual design activity. In the absence of sight, making a sketch may still be possible to some extent, recognizing emergent features by reading off information from it is certainly not. Nevertheless, this chapter builds upon a study of an architect who lost his sight and continues designing. Studying his work offers a unique opportunity to expand our understanding of design and design research. The fact that this architect does design in the absence of sight, raises questions as to what extent ‘visual thinking’ — or other prevailing notions of design ability, for that matter — may be complemented with alternatively articulated propositions about design. Moreover, combined with other studies, it raises questions about sketching as the key ‘tool’ to assist design cognition, and about whether other ‘tools’ may be central in assisting it too. Therefore, part 1 of this chapter investigates where design researchers’ outspoken attention for these aspects comes from and addresses both how human cognition is understood in most design research, i. e., in a predominantly cognitivist way, and how designing is researched, thereby pointing at the in some respects ill-articulated statements it comes with. The observation that other, more contemporary understandings of cognition and approaches to research it receive relatively little attention from design researchers in turn raises questions about how design research is produced, which are addressed in part 2. In view of this, we call for a better articulation in researching design, both epistemologically and methodologically. By presenting three studies that allow for and enact alternative design realities (in part 3), we invite researchers to conduct design research that keeps the discussion open by staying ‘available’ to register or become sensible to differences in new and unexpected ways, and thus allowing for other articulations of what design may or can be—be it by adopting other epistemologies or by researching in other ways. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|FULL TEXT: Like {{many people}} {{one of my}} {{favourite}} pastimes over the holiday season is to watch the great movies that are offered on the television channels and new releases in the movie theatres or catching up on those DVDs {{that you have been}} wanting to watch all year. Recently we had the new ‘Star Wars’ movie, ‘The Force Awakens’, which is reckoned to become the highest grossing movie of all time, and the latest offering from James Bond, ‘Spectre’ (which included, for the car aficionados amongst you, the gorgeous new Aston Martin DB 10). It is always amusing to see how vision correction or eye injury is dealt with by movie makers. Spy movies and science fiction movies have a freehand to design aliens with multiples eyes on stalks or retina scanning door locks or goggles that can see through walls. Eye surgery is usually shown in some kind of day case simplified laser treatment that gives instant results, apart from the great scene in the original ‘Terminator’ movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger's android character encounters an injury to one eye and then proceeds to remove the humanoid covering to this mechanical eye over a bathroom sink. I suppose it is much more difficult to try and include contact lenses in such movies. Although you may recall the film ‘Charlie's Angels’, which did have a scene where one of the Angels wore a contact lens that had a retinal image imprinted on it so she could by-pass a retinal scan door lock and an Eddy Murphy spy movie ‘I-Spy’, where he wore contact lenses that had electronic gadgetry that allowed whatever he was looking at to be beamed back to someone else, a kind of remote video camera device. Maybe we aren’t quite there in terms of devices available but these things are probably not the behest of science fiction anymore as the technology does exist to put these things together. The technology to incorporate electronics into contact lenses is being developed and I am sure we will be reporting on it in the near future. In the meantime we can continue to enjoy the unrealistic scenes of eye swapping as in the film ‘Minority Report’ (with Tom Cruise). Much more closely to home, than in a galaxy far far away, in this issue you can find articles on topics much nearer to the closer future. More and more optometrists in the UK are becoming registered for therapeutic work as independent prescribers and the number is likely to rise in the near future. These practitioners will be interested in the review paper by Michael Doughty, {{who is a member of}} the CLAE editorial panel (soon to be renamed the Jedi Council!), on prescribing drugs as part of the management of chronic meibomian gland dysfunction. Contact lenses play an active role in myopia control and orthokeratology has been used not only to help provide refractive correction but also in the retardation of myopia. In this issue there are three articles related to this topic. Firstly, an excellent paper looking at the link between higher spherical equivalent refractive errors and the association with slower axial elongation. Secondly, a paper that discusses the effectiveness and safety of overnight orthokeratology with high-permeability lens material. Finally, a paper that looks at the stabilisation of early adult-onset myopia. Whilst we are always eager for new and exciting developments in contact lenses and related instrumentation in this issue of CLAE there is a demonstration of a novel and practical use of a smartphone to assisted anterior segment imaging and suggestions of this may be used in telemedicine. It is not <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>someone</b> taking an image remotely and transmitting that back to a central diagnostic centre with the relevant expertise housed in one place where the information can be interpreted and instruction given back to the remote site. Back to ‘Star Wars’ and you will recall in the film ‘The Phantom Menace’ when Qui-Gon Jinn first meets Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine he takes a sample of his blood and sends a scan of it back to Obi-Wan Kenobi to send for analysis and they find that the boy has the highest midichlorian count ever seen. On behalf of the CLAE Editorial board (or Jedi Council) and the BCLA Council (the Senate of the Republic) we wish for you a great 2016 and ‘may the contact lens force be with you’. Or let me put that another way ‘the CLAE Editorial Board and BCLA Council, on behalf of, a great 2016, we wish for you!...|$|E
