50|$|Modern systems use {{hydraulic}} rams {{powered by a}} heavy alternating current electric motor. High strength carbon steel blades and dies of various shapes are used to work the metal. The machine itself is made of very heavy steel to handle the enormous force that can be generated during use. Ironworkers are rated according to the force they can generate in tons; ratings usually start at 20 tons and {{go as high as}} 220 tons.Mechanical ironworkers are mostly used in productions with low temperature in winter (up to -20 C) and are considered to be faster. Another reason to choose the mechanical construction is when cutting of large profiles (up to 300 mm (12 in) and bigger) is needed. Most <b>hydraulicals</b> can't cut this size.

30|$|Two cap rocks can be {{identified}} from the estimated vertical profiles of K_int and λ. The <b>hydraulical</b> cap rock is associated at its base to the high contrast of permeability and the thermal cap rock to the discrepancy of thermal conductivity. Here, {{the bottom of the}} <b>hydraulical</b> cap rock (i.e., the top of the convection cells, see Fig. 3) is identified at the interface between the upper and lower sediments. The contrast of permeability is associated here with the high fracture density in the lower sediments and the granite compared to the upper sediments (Vidal et al. 2016 b, 2017). The change of the rock property does not correspond to a contrast in terms of lithology. On the contrary, the contrast of thermal conductivity is located at the interface between the sediments and the granitic basement. The whole sedimentary cover associated with a lower thermal conductivity than in the basement contributes to a thermal blanketing of the insulating sediments. The effect has been already identified as a key factor to explain the higher geothermal gradient at depth than the average European one (Freymark et al. 2017; Scheck-Wenderoth et al. 2014). The discrepancy in terms of depths between the permeability and thermal conductivity contrast highlights a decoupling of the cap rocks: the whole sedimentary cover corresponds to the thermal cap rock, whereas only the upper sediments behave as a hydraulic cap rock.|$|E

The goal {{of this study is to}} manage and monitor the debris flows in a vast area. Thus, the strategy is to collect <b>hydraulical</b> and in-situ data easily and quickly through our spatial information system. Then, a novel Data Mining technique will be developed to find a rule-based knowledge system of debris flow. The entire study can be divided into two parts. In the first part, using spatial information the debris flow image is extracted from the outbreak area. The system provides precise positional information pertaining to the debris flow events. Attributes such as effective watershed area, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and slope are automatically obtained from the system. In the second part of this study, K-mean theory is used to classify the observed <b>hydraulical</b> and in-situ data into different categories. Then, the 'Effective Rough Set' method is successfully used to analyze the factors influencing the debris flow phenomenon and delivers rational knowledge rules. The contribution of this study is presented that NDVI, slope and effective watershed area are the major factors influencing debris flow in the study area. The knowledge rules can provide better understanding on the elevation of high potential debris catchments. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|E

The recovery of the mine water level covers a wide area of about 490 km² on german and dutch territory. The development of the mine water recovery in such a complex mining district with a mining history of over 800 years is influencend by interactions of many <b>hydraulical</b> und hydrogeological factors. Particulary relevant factors are the hydraulic connections between the different mines and the interactions between carboniferous base rock and the overlying cap rock of cretaceous and tertiary age. This dissertation documents the development of mine water recovery in the mining district of Aachen and South Limburg. The relevant geological-hydrogeological boundary conditions are compiled in an analogue model. On this basis at first the relevant hydrogeological factors and mining structures are identified and their changeability is described. Furthermore the impacts of the interactions between the mine and the cap rock on the velocity of mine water level rising, the development of mine water quality, {{the formation of a}} “soft water cap”, the migration of mine gas, the development of ground movements as well as the change of hydraulic heads und water quality in the cap rock are shown. The hydrogeolocial and <b>hydraulical</b> processes described in this dissertation mostly are of fundamental character and therefore applicable to other hard coal mining districts. Knowledge about the described interdependencies are of fundamental significance for the compilation and assessment of predictions about mine water recovery.
