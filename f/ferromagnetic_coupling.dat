While 1, 3 -cyclobutane and m-phenylene are good <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> units under these conditions, the <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> ability of 1, 3 -cyclopentane is poor, and 1, 3 -cyclohexane is apparently an antiferromagnetic coupling unit. In addition, this is the first report of <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>coupling</b> between the spins of localized biradical SCs. The poor coupling of 1, 3 -cyclopentane has enabled a study of the variable temperature behavior of a 1, 3 -cyclopentane FC-based tetraradical in its triplet state. Through fitting the observed data to the usual Boltzman statistics, {{we have been able to}} determine the separation of the ground quintet and excited triplet states. From this data, we have inferred the singlet-triplet gap in 1, 3 -cyclopentanediyl to be 900 cal/mol, in remarkable agreement with theoretical predictions of this number. The ability to simulate EPR spectra has been crucial to the assignments made here. A powder EPR simulation package is described that uses the Zeeman and dipolar terms to calculate powder EPR spectra for triplet and quintet states. Methods for characterizing paramagnetic samples by SQUID magnetometry have been developed, including robust routines for data fitting and analysis. A precursor to a potentially magnetic polymer was prepared by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and doped samples of this polymer were studied by magnetometry.

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{addresses the}} study of nano-magnetic devices configured to produce logic machines through magnetostatic coupling interactions. The ability for single domain magnets to reliably couple through magnetostatic interactions {{is essential to the}} proper functionality of Magnetic Cellular Automata (MCA) devices (p. 36). It was significant to explore how fabrication defects affected the coupling reliability of MCA architectures. Both <b>ferromagnetic</b> and anti-ferromagnetic <b>coupling</b> architectures were found to be robust to common fabrication defects. Experiments also verified the functionality of the previously reported MCA majority gate [1] and a novel implementation of a ferromagnetic MCA majority gate is reported. From these results, {{the study of}} clocking Magnetic Cellular Automata (MCA) interconnect architectures was investigated (p. 54). The wire architectures were saturated under distinct directions of an external magnetic field. The experimental results suggested <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>coupled</b> wires were able to mitigate magnetic frustrations better than anti-ferromagnetic coupled wires. Simulations were also implemented supporting the experimental results. Ferromagnetic wires were found to operate more reliably and will likely be the primary interconnects for MCA. The first design and implementation of a coplanar cross wire system for MCA was constructed which consisted of orthogonal <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>coupled</b> wires (p. 68). Simulations were implemented of a simple crossing wire junction to analyze micro-magnetic dynamics, data propagation, and associated energy states. Furthermore, two systems were physically realized; the first system consisted of two coplanar crossing wires and the second was a more complex system consisting of over 120 nano-magnetic cells. By demonstrating the combination of all the possible logic states of the first system and the low ground state achieved by the second system, the data suggested coplanar cross wire systems would indeed be a viable architecture in MCA technology. Finally, ongoing research of an unconventional method for image processing using nano-magnetic field-based computation is presented (p. 79). In magnetic field-based computing (MFC), nano-disks were mapped to low level segments of an image, and the magnetostatic coupling of magnetic dipole moments was directly related to the saliency of a low level segment for grouping. A proof of concept model for two MFC systems was implemented. Details such as the importance of fabricating circular nano-magnetic cells to mitigate shape anisotropy, experimental coupling analysis via Magnetic Force Microscopy, and current results from a complex MFC system is outlined...|$|R
