25|$|With heavy {{lobbying}} by southern politicians, the Compromise of 1850 {{was passed}} by Congress after the Mexican–American War. It stipulated a more stringent Fugitive Slave Law; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states. Because the law required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped free blacks, especially children, and sold them into slavery. Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights. The law deprived suspected slaves {{of the right to}} defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status. In a de facto bribe, judges were paid a higher fee ($10) for <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> that <b>confirmed</b> <b>a</b> suspect as a slave than for one ruling that the suspect was free ($5). Many Northerners who might have ignored slave issues in the South were confronted by local challenges that bound them to support slavery. This was a primary grievance cited by the Union during the American Civil War, and the perception that Northern States ignored the fugitive slave law was a major justification for secession.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relative importance}} of transfers from workers to shareholders in the firm's decision to terminate their overfunded defined benefit pension plans. In contrast to earlier studies, I find evidence that firms terminate their pension plans to relieve themselves of implicit promises to workers of future compensation. In addition, financing and tax considerations influence the reversion decision. The results suggest that the 1986 excise tax on asset reversions reduced termination for reversion by 36 percent in 1986. In 1980 A & P terminated its overfunded pension plan. A & P said it intended to use the excess assets for corporate purposes. The reversion was challenged, but <b>a</b> court <b>decision</b> <b>confirmed</b> <b>a</b> firm's right to terminate its overfunded pension plans. Few plans were terminated for reversion before 1980. The number of terminations for reversion grew dramatically during the early eighties, peaking at 580 in 1985.

Other possible dates included Spring 2016, though AKP politicians claimed that elections could have been held as early as October 2015. Speculation on the date resulted in Sadi Güven, the President of the Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey (YSK), stating that the YSK was prepared for an early election and had organised an election within 63 days in the past.

Although the court in Pemex described its reasoning as consistent with prior U.

It moved towards embracing a “judgments” standard, which one of the authors had previously advocated. However, the opinion also left open serious questions and raised a few red flags, such as by suggesting that the standard of review for district court decisions confirming set-aside awards is “abuse of discretion. ” The authors explore the significance of these and other aspects of the Pemex decision...|$|R

40|$|Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) {{based on}} Event Related Potentials (ERPs) strive for {{offering}} communication pathways which {{are independent of}} muscle activity. While most visual ERP-based BCI paradigms require good control of the user's gaze direction, auditory BCI paradigms overcome this restriction. The present work proposes a novel approach using Auditory Evoked Potentials (AEP) for {{the example of a}} multiclass text spelling application. To control the ERP speller, BCI users focus their attention to two-dimensional auditory stimuli that vary in both, pitch (high/medium/low) and direction (left/middle/right) and that are presented via headphones. The resulting nine different control signals are exploited to drive a predictive text entry system. It enables the user to spell a letter by a single 9 -class decision plus two additional <b>decisions</b> to <b>confirm</b> <b>a</b> spelled word. This paradigm - called PASS 2 D - was investigated in an online study with twelve healthy participants.

40|$|Task-switching {{studies show}} no {{behavioral}} benefit of partially informative cues. However, ERP {{evidence of an}} early cue-locked positivity elicited by both fully and partially informative cues suggests that both cues trigger an anticipatory component of task set reconfiguration (Nicholson, Karayanidis, Davies, & Michie, 2006). We examined this apparent discrepancy using a cued-trials task-switching paradigm with three tasks. The ERP finding of an early cue-locked positivity was replicated for both switch-to cues, which validly predicted an upcoming switch trial and specified the new task set, and switch-away cues, which validly predicted an upcoming switch trial but not the new task set. This component was not elicited by a noninformative cue that did not specify whether the task would switch or repeat. Switch-away cues resulted in more accurate but not faster responding than did noninformative cues. Modeling of <b>decision</b> processes <b>confirmed</b> <b>a</b> speed–accuracy trade-off between these conditions and a preparation benefit for both switch-to and switch-away cues. These results indicate that both fully and partially informative cues elicit an early anticipatory component of task set reconfiguration that {{is reflected in the}} early cue-locked positivity.

L'Orchestre rouge (1967) was even more successful. In 1969 Perrault published a spy novel, Le dossier 51. In 1978, Gilles Perrault published Le Pull-over rouge, a novel in which he criticized the method of investigation done by the French police around the 1974 death of an 8-year-old girl. Christian Ranucci, a French citizen, was executed by guillotine for the murder on 28 July 1976. Perrault's case, calling Ranucci's guilt into question, held a great influence in the debate upon capital punishment in France. It has reportedly had a notable impact upon a part of public opinion, having sold over 1 million copies.
