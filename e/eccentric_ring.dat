40|$|Abridged) A {{simple and}} general {{description}} {{of the dynamics of}} a narrow <b>eccentric</b> <b>ring</b> is presented. We view an <b>eccentric</b> <b>ring</b> which precesses uniformly at a slow rate as exhibiting a global m= 1 mode originating from a standing wave superposed on an axisymmetric background. We adopt a continuum description using the language of fluid dynamics which gives equivalent results for the secular dynamics of thin rings as the the well known description using discrete elliptical streamlines formulated by Goldreich and Tremaine (1979). We use this to discuss the non linear mode interactions that appear through the excitation of higher m modes due to the coupling of the m= 1 mode with an external satellite potential, showing that they can lead to the excitation of the m= 1 mode through a feedback process. Two conditions for the maintainance of a steady m= 1 mode are obtained. One,being the condition for the normal mode pattern to precess uniformly requires a balance between the differential precession induced by the oblateness of the central planet,self-gravity and collisional effects and is the continuum form of that obtained from the N streamline model of Goldreich and Tremaine (1979). The other condition is for the steady maintenance of the non-zero radial action of the ring on account of the normal mode. This requires a balance between input due to eccentric resonances due to external satellites and additional collisional damping associated with the presence of the m= 1 mode We estimate that such a balance can occur in the ϵ-ring of Uranus,given its currently observed physical and orbital parameters.

40|$|The {{presence}} of young massive stars orbiting on <b>eccentric</b> <b>rings</b> {{within a few}} tenths of a parsec of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic centre is challenging for theories of star formation. The high tidal shear from the black hole should tear apart the molecular clouds that form stars elsewhere in the Galaxy, while transporting the stars to the Galactic centre also appears unlikely during their stellar lifetimes. We present numerical simulations of the infall of a giant molecular cloud that interacts with the black hole. The transfer of energy during closest approach allows part of the cloud to become bound to the black hole, forming an eccentric disc that quickly fragments to form stars. Compressional heating due to the black hole raises {{the temperature of the}} gas to 100 - 1000 K, ensuring that the fragmentation produces relatively high stellar masses. These stars retain the eccentricity of the disc and, for a sufficiently massive initial cloud, produce an extremely top-heavy distribution of stellar masses.

This results in a dark circular area known as the black hole 'shadow'. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a (sub) mm VLBI network capable of Schwarzschild-radius resolution on Sagittarius A* (or Sgr A*), the 4 million solar mass black hole at the Galactic Center. The goals of the Sgr A* observations include resolving and measuring the details of its morphology. However, EHT data are sparse in the visibility domain, complicating reliable detailed image reconstruction. Therefore, direct pixel imaging should be complemented by other approaches. Using simulated EHT data from a black hole emission model we consider an approach to Sgr A* image reconstruction based on a simple and computationally efficient analytical model that produces images similar to the synthetic ones. The model consists of an <b>eccentric</b> <b>ring</b> with a brightness gradient and a two-dimensional Gaussian.

40|$|The nearby A 4 -type star Fomalhaut hosts a debris belt in {{the form}} of an <b>eccentric</b> <b>ring,</b> which is thought to be caused by {{dynamical}} influence from a giant planet companion. In 2008, a detection of a point-source inside the inner edge of the ring was reported and was interpreted as a direct image of the planet, named Fomalhaut b. The detection was made at ~ 600 [...] 800 nm, but no corresponding signatures were found in the near-infrared range, where the bulk emission of such a planet should be expected. Here we present deep observations of Fomalhaut with Spitzer/IRAC at 4. 5 um, using a novel PSF subtraction technique based on ADI and LOCI, in order to substantially improve the Spitzer contrast at small separations. The results provide more than an order of magnitude improvement in the upper flux limit of Fomalhaut b and exclude the possibility that any flux from a giant planet surface contributes to the observed flux at visible wavelengths. This renders any direct connection between the observed light source and the dynamically inferred giant planet highly unlikely.

The model is a planar restricted five-body problem defined by the gravitational field of Saturn, including its second zonal harmonic $J_ 2 $, the shepherd moons Prometheus and Pandora, and Titan. We compute accurate long-time numerical integrations of (about 2. 5 million) non-interacting test-particles initially located in the region between the orbits of Prometheus and Pandora, and address whether they escape or remain trapped in this region. We obtain a wide region of initial conditions of the test particles that remain confined. We consider a dynamical stability indicator for the test particles' motion defined by computing {{the ratio of the}} standard deviation over the average value of relevant dynamical quantities, in particular, for the mean-motion and the semi-major axis. This indicator separates clearly a subset of trapped initial conditions that appear as very localized stripes in the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity space for the most stable orbits. Retaining only these test particles, we obtain a narrow <b>eccentric</b> <b>ring</b> which displays sharp edges and collective alignment. The semi-major axis of the accumulation stripes of the stable ring-particles can be associated with resonances, mostly involving Prometheus' outer Lindblad and co-rotation resonances, but not exclusively.

We created a software which calculates the corneal contour (CC) {{as a function of the}} radius from the corneal apex to each pixel of the contour. The software generates a central circumference with a radius of 1 mm and the remainder of the cornea is segmented in 5 rings concentric with corneal apex being its diameter not constant around the corneal circumference as a consequence of the irregular CC but keeping constant the diameter of each ring in each direction of the contour. PCT was determined as the mean thickness of the most <b>eccentric</b> <b>ring.</b> Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) regression was used to {{determine the}} pattern of the relationship between PCT and both DCT and GAT respectively. Thereafter, two multivariable linear regression models were constructed. In each of them, the dependant variable was intraocular pressure (IOP) as determined using GAT and DCT respectively.

Age and sex were also introduced control variables along with their first-degree interactions with PCT. Main outcome measures include amount of IOP variation explained through regression models (R 2) and regression coefficients (B). RESULTS: Subjects included 109 eyes of 109 healthy individuals. LOWESS regression suggested that a 2 nd-degree polynomial would be suitable to model the relationship between both DCT and GAT with PCT.

40|$|Context. Transition disks {{typically}} {{appear in}} resolved millimeter observations as giant dust rings surrounding their young host stars. More accurate observations with ALMA have shown {{several of these}} rings to be in fact asymmetric: they have lopsided shapes. It has been speculated that these rings act as dust traps, which would make them important laboratories for studying planet formation. It {{has been shown that}} an elongated giant vortex produced in a disk with a strong viscosity jump strikingly resembles the observed asymmetric rings. Aims. We aim to study a similar behavior for a disk in which a giant planet is embedded. However, a giant planet can induce two kinds of asymmetries: (1) a giant vortex, and (2) an eccentric disk. We studied under which conditions each of these can appear, and how one can observationally distinguish between them. This is important because only a vortex can trap particles both radially and azimuthally, while the <b>eccentric</b> <b>ring</b> can only trap particles in radial direction. Methods. We used the FARGO code to conduct the hydro-simulations. We set up a disk with an embedded giant planet and took a radial grid spanning from 0. 1 to 7 times the planet semi-major axis. We ran the simulations with various viscosity values and planet masses for 1000 planet orbits to allow a fully developed vortex or disk eccentricity. Afterwards, we compared the dust distribution in a vortex-holding disk with an eccentric disk using dust simulations. Results. We find that vorticity and eccentricity are distinguishable by looking at the azimuthal contrast of the dust density. While vortices, as particle traps, produce very pronounced azimuthal asymmetries, eccentric features are not able to accumulate millimeter dust particles in azimuthal direction, and therefore the asymmetries are expected to be modest...|$|E
40|$|Background: This is a {{case report}} of a 36 mm {{constrained}} cup (Freedom™, Biomet IN) that performed successfully for 7 -years in a salvage case involving a total-femur implanted in a leg already short by 3 - 4 inches. The goal was to enhance hip motion and stability using a 36 mm head {{instead of the usual}} 32 mm size. Templating indications were for a 50 mm cup (Freedom™; Arcom™ liner). The proximal femur inserted in 2008 incorporated the 36 mm constrained THA and was anchored distally to bone using the Compress™ fixator. By 2012 the fixator loosened and was replaced by hinged total-knee arthroplasty (TKA). The THA was retained at revision and patient’s clinical follow-up was satisfactory for 4 years. As indicated by Martel radiographic method, the Arcom™ liner showed minimal wear over this period. Radiographs in Feb- 2016 showed the cup’s constraint ring had rotated slightly but the patient had no symptoms. By Dec- 2016, the patient had experienced three falls and also had heard a popping sound in her hip. At Dec- 2016 office visit, radiographs indicated additional rotation of the constraint ring and CT scans showed an eccentric head position contacting the metal shell. At revision, 50 % of the Arcom rim was ablated and the remainder present as a loose fragment. Following insertion of new Freedom liner and 36 mm head, her follow-up appears satisfactory 10 -months later. Her leg shortening remains but she walks to office visits using a cane and doesn’t need the cane at home. Methods: Retrieved Arcom liner and detached rim fragment were reconstructed, photographed, and then bi-valved for comparison to similarly prepared exemplar liners, one identical to our revision and one with a thicker wall. Details of liner sections were taken from photographs and reconstructed by computer graphics (Canvas Draw- 3 ™). Wear performance over the first 7 years was assessed using the Martel x-ray method. Results: Inspection of retrieved liner showed a large oval depression in the ablated rim. The contra-rim featured the large Arcom fragment and the underlying liner wall was less than 1 mm thick. Comparison to exemplar liners showed that the large fragment had separated along the lower edge of the constraint groove. Exemplars demonstrated a substantial rim buttress spanning 13 mm, which had been ablated in our retrieval. Discussion and Conclusion: Although this was not a high-demand patient, the considerable hip-impingement forces in a flail limb likely levered the head repeatedly against the liner’s constrained rim. Neck impingement was clearly evident in the damaged liner. A subluxing femoral head would also thin the contra-wall, as would backside wear. We do not know if the <b>eccentric</b> <b>ring</b> image in Feb- 2016 radiographs depicted failure. The liner may have escaped from the shell’s locking-ring and with activity, ablated the Arcom contours and led to rim fracture.

However, these analyses have largely ignored the fact that some debris disks are found to contain small quantities of gas, a component that all such disks should contain at some level. Several debris disks have been measured with a dust-to-gas ratio around unity at which the effect of hydrodynamics on the structure of the disk cannot be ignored. Here we report linear and nonlinear modelling that shows that dust-gas interactions can produce some of the key patterns attributed to planets. We find a robust clumping instability that organizes the dust into narrow, <b>eccentric</b> <b>rings,</b> similar to the Fomalhaut debris disk. The conclusion that such disks might contain planets is not necessarily required to explain these systems. Comment: 18 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Nature. Supplementary Information at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The ring models {{described}} here {{were developed to}} account for the dynamical problems posed by the narrow rings of Uranus. Some of these rings are now known to be eccentric, inclined, nonuniform in width, optically thick, and narrow, with very sharp edges. The <b>eccentric</b> <b>rings</b> have common pericenters and large, positive eccentricity gradients. The theory of shepherding satellites successfully accounts for most of these features and can also account for some features of the narrow Saturnian rings, in particular, waves, kinks, and periodic variations in brightness. Outstanding problems include the putative relation between eccentricity and inclination displayed by eight of the nine Uranian rings, and the magnitudes of the tidal torques acting on the shepherding satellites. The horseshoe-orbit model, although viable, probably has more application to the narrow rings from which the Saturnian coorbital satellites formed. The angular momentum flow rate due to particle collisions is a minimum at the Lagrangian equilibrium points L(4) and L(5), and one can expect accretion to be rapid at these points...|$|R
40|$|Exoplanets {{are often}} {{associated}} with disks of dust and debris, analogs of the Kuiper Belt in our solar system. These "debris disks" show a variety of non-trivial structures attributed to planetary perturbations and utilized to constrain {{the properties of the}} planets. However, analyses of these systems have largely ignored the fact that, increasingly, debris disks are found to contain small quantities of gas, a component all debris disks should contain at some level. Several debris disks have been measured with a dust-to-gas ratio around unity where the effect of hydrodynamics on the structure of the disk cannot be ignored. Here we report that dust-gas interactions can produce some of the key patterns seen in debris disks that were previously attributed to planets. Through linear and nonlinear modeling of the hydrodynamical problem, we find that a robust clumping instability exists in this configuration, organizing the dust into narrow, <b>eccentric</b> <b>rings,</b> similar to the Fomalhaut debris disk. The hypothesis that these disks might contain planets, though thrilling, is not necessarily required to explain these systems...|$|R
