5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created in}} November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. All {{of the people in}} the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in Arlington, Vermont, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The Post published Freedom from Want with a corresponding essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Despite many who endured sociopolitical hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the socioeconomic hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.|$|E
25|$|Another well-loved work is Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach (Sankthansbål på Skagen strand), 1903.

During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of Indian elephants <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> ditch and uses his vines to save a baby elephant from the ditch. Although Baloo and Bagheera are both impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowgli's safety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan.

25|$|On March 5, 1770, a {{large crowd}} <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> group of British soldiers. The crowd grew threatening, {{throwing}} snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One soldier was clubbed and fell. There was no order to fire, but the soldiers fired into the crowd anyway. They hit 11 people; three civilians died {{at the scene of}} the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the Boston Massacre. The soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by John Adams), but the widespread descriptions soon began to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This, in turn, began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.|$|E

500|$|Chirping or stutter-barking: A cheetah chirps when excited (for instance, when <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> kill). This {{vocalisation}} {{can also}} be used at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which sounds more like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to [...] away. A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars cannot {{prove the}} authorship of Jeremiah with any certainty, {{although}} consensus has <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> thesis of multiple sources, {{mainly because of}} the contrast between the poetic discourses and the prose narrative. Some modern scholars think the Deuteronomist edited Jeremiah because of the similarity of phrasing between the books of Jeremiah and Deuteronomy. [...] For example, Egypt is referred to as an [...] "iron furnace" [...] in both Jeremiah 11:4 and Deuteronomy 4:20. [...] They also share a similar view of divine justice.|$|E
2500|$|Details of {{his life}} for {{the period in which}} he was in Rome are equally uncertain.

2500|$|A crowd {{gathered}} {{on the evening of}} 7 January, at Union Square in Manhattan, New York City. French ambassador to the United Nations François Delattre was present; the crowd lit candles, held signs, and sang the French national anthem. Several hundred people also showed up outside of the French consulate in San Francisco with [...] "Je suis Charlie" [...] signs to show their solidarity. In downtown Seattle, another vigil was held where people <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> French flag laid out with candles lit around it.

In Argentina, a large demonstration was held to denounce the attacks and show support for the victims outside the French embassy in the Buenos Aires.|$|E
2500|$|The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles {{franchise}} {{was arguably}} {{at the height}} of its popularity around the time that The Secret of the Ooze was released in theatres. A number of tie-ins were brought out alongside the release of the film. A new line of toys were introduced for the release of the film, including [...] "Movie Star" [...] toys of all four turtles, with the box art depicting stills from the film, as well as a cartoon rendition of the turtles <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> canister of ooze in the top right corner of the package. In contrast to the usual Turtles' figures, the film series figures were softer and more rubbery, to better reflect the look of the animatronic costumes used in the films. They also featured ball joints at the neck, shoulders, and hips, and each figure came with a small, plastic canister with a sticker of [...] "Ooze" [...] wrapped around them.

2500|$|Goldman Sachs's {{purchase}} of an 18% stake in state-owned Dong Energy—Denmark's largest electric utility—set off a [...] "political crisis" [...] in Denmark. The sale—approved in January 30, 2014—sparked protest {{in the form}} of the resignation of six cabinet ministers and the withdrawal of a party (Socialist People's Party) from Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt's leftist governing coalition. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, [...] "the role of Goldman in the deal struck a nerve with the Danish public, which is still suffering from the aftereffects of the global financial crisis." [...] Protesters in Copenhagen <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> banner [...] "with a drawing of a vampire squid—the description of Goldman used by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone in 2009". Opponents expressed concern that Goldman would have some say in Dong's management, and that Goldman planned to manage its investment through [...] "subsidiaries in Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands, and Delaware, which made Danes suspicious that the bank would shift earnings to tax havens." [...] Goldman purchased the 18% stake in 2014 for 8 billion kroner and sold just over a 6% stake in 2017 for 6.5 billion kroner.|$|E
2500|$|The buildup to [...] "Bettymania" [...] {{by various}} {{broadcasters}} {{also began to}} take shape overseas, especially in the United Kingdom. On December 6, 2006, Channel 4 began to advertise the show. The ad shows seemingly attractive models <b>gathered</b> <b>around</b> <b>a</b> pool, but as the camera angle changes a model comes out of the pool wearing Betty's glasses, then as the models smile, they are all wearing Betty's braces. Another ad parodies Marks and Spencer's successful fashion advertising campaign, as well as Dove and Gap campaigns. A voice over then says, [...] "Fashion has a new face. 'Ugly Betty' Coming Soon To 4." [...] After a week of these teasers, clips from the actual program were included in the trailers. In mid-January, Davina McCall, presenter of Celebrity Big Brother dressed up as Betty live on Channel 4 before the titles of the second eviction show of the evening. On February 16, 2007, Ashley Jensen (Christina) also dressed up as Betty during an airing of Channel 4's Friday Night Project, where she was the guest host. The children's channel CBeebies also parodied the title sequence, with one variation mixing faces of regular CBeebies characters until finally settling with Tiny from Little Robots.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1861, 54 {{percent of}} the state's voters voted against sending delegates to a secession convention, {{defeating}} the proposal for a State Convention {{by a vote of}} 69,675 to 57,798. If a State Convention had been held, {{it would have been very}} heavily pro-Union. 88,803 votes were cast for Unionist candidates and 22,749 votes were cast for Secession candidates. That day the American flag was displayed in [...] "every section of the city," [...] with zeal equal to that which existed during the late 1860 presidential campaign, wrote the Nashville Daily Gazette. [...] The proponents of the slavocracy were embarrassed, demoralized and politically disoriented but not willing to admit defeat: [...] "Whatever may be the result of the difficulties which at present agitate our country - whether we are to be united in our common destiny or whether two Republics shall take the place of that which has stood for nearly a century, the admired of all nations we will still bow with reverence to the sight of the stars and stripes, and recognize it as the standard around which the sons of liberty can rally [...] And if the remonstrances of the people of the South-pleading and begging for redress for years-does not in this critical moment, arouse her brethren of the North to a sense of justice and right, and honor demands a separation, we would still have the same claims upon the 'colors of Washington, great son of the South, and of Virginia, mother of the States.' Let us not abandon the stars and stripes under which Southern men have so often been led to victory."
