40|$|ABSTRACT: After {{a proper}} {{modification}} {{of a commercial}} Coulter LS 230 particle size analyzer {{that is based on}} Fraunhofer principle, we have developed its novel application in directly sizing particles dispersed <b>inside</b> <b>a</b> solid matrix. Using several particle standards, we have demonstrated its validity by comparing the particle size distribu-tions, respectively, obtained in water and directly inside different solid matrixes. In comparison with other conventional sizing methods, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), this novel application of Fraunhofer diffraction provides a fast, convenient, and direct way to characterize particles dispersed <b>inside</b> <b>a</b> transparent or translucent solid matrix. It can be envi-sioned that this application can be extended to directly size fillers <b>inside</b> <b>a</b> polymer materials, microdomains <b>inside</b> <b>a</b> polymer blends, and bubbles <b>inside</b> <b>a</b> foam. © 200...|$|R

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure <b>inside</b> <b>an</b> inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented the eggs {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based on the large size of the eggs and the largely overlapping distribution. However, the discovery of an oviraptorid embryo <b>inside</b> <b>an</b> elongatoolithid egg cast doubt on this hypothesis. With the discovery of multiple oviraptorosaur-elongatoolithid associations in the late 1990s, the eggs of elongatoolithids came to be accepted as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs. Oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed.

5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the electrons <b>inside</b> <b>an</b> electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound {{near the center of}} the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E

5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated <b>inside</b> <b>an</b> electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E
5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker.

The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated <b>inside</b> <b>an</b> enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both horn and drum at a constant speed.|$|E
