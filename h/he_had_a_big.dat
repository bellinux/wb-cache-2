500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW. Eastwood said of McCain: [...] "I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam. This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he was a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him come along and I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job.

500|$|In 1931, Lowerhouse {{finished}} in equal fourth place, its best {{position in the}} league since 1908. Reviewing the season, the Burnley News gave credit to St Hill for the revival. Describing him as a dependable batsman, it stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> impact with the ball. He scored 288 runs at 14.40, with a top score of 46, [...] to finish third in the club batting averages. He topped the bowling averages with 68 wickets, 46 of which were bowled, at 12.20. By the following season, St Hill's wife had joined him in Lowerhouse. An end of season summary in the Burnley Express suggested that his batting had improved, {{and that he had}} surprised people with his ability. He played several longer innings, with a highest score of 85, and he scored runs by [...] "delightfully played cricket". He headed the batting and bowling averages for the club with 477 runs at 20.73 and 77 wickets at 13.87. However, the report stated that his bowling had been inconsistent and that it was surprising that he ended with such a good average. Nevertheless, his figures stood comparison with other leading professionals in the Lancashire League. The club dropped to equal fifth in the league.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days, Wolfman Jack made {{sporadic}} public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies (an [...] "MC") for rock bands at local Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance {{he looked a}} little different because Smith had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat [...] "ethnic". Other times <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> afro wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. It was not until he appeared in the 1969 film, A Session with the Committee (a montage of skits by the seminal comedy troupe The Committee), that mainstream America got a good look at Wolfman Jack.|$|E

2500|$|The Transformer {{brothers}} {{also knew}} where he was, but he didn't look and just held his pole steady. The brothers came and landed {{on the side of}} the canoe.

[...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there in that little bay. You bring your canoe over and come up ashore." [...] He pulled up his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks and put them in a bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone in 1995, Jagger stated that Taylor never {{explained}} {{why he had}} left, and surmised that [...] " [...] {{wanted to have a}} solo career. I think he found it difficult to get on with Keith." [...] In the same interview Jagger said of Taylor's contribution to the band: [...] "I think <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> contribution. He made it very musical. He was a very fluent, melodic player, which we never had, and we don't have now. Neither Keith nor Ronnie Wood plays that kind of style. It was very good for me working with him ... Mick Taylor would play very fluid lines against my vocals. He was exciting, and he was very pretty, and it gave me something to follow, to bang off. Some people think that's the best version of the band that existed". Asked if he agreed with that assessment, Jagger said: [...] "I obviously can't say if I think Mick Taylor was the best, because it sort of trashes the period the band is in now." [...] Charlie Watts stated: [...] "I think we chose the right man for the job at that time just as Ronnie was the right man for the job later on. I still think Mick is great. I haven't heard or seen him play in a few years. But certainly what came out of playing with him are musically some of the best things we've ever done". Another statement in Guitar World in October 2002 made by Richards said [...] "Mick Taylor and I worked really well together ... He had some lovely energy. Sweetly sophisticated playing, way beyond his years. Lovely sense of melody. I never understood why he left the Stones, Nor does he, I think ... I had no desire to see him go." [...] Taylor later admitted in the 2012 documentary Crossfire Hurricane that he had become addicted to heroin and hoped to protect his family from the drug culture surrounding the band by leaving.|$|E
