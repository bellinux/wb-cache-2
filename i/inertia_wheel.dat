Unsprung weight is more properly regarded as a mass {{which has its own}} inherent inertia separate {{from the rest of the}} vehicle. When a wheel is pushed upwards by a bump in the road, the <b>inertia</b> of the <b>wheel</b> will cause it to be carried further upward above the height of the bump. If the force of the push is sufficiently large, the <b>inertia</b> of the <b>wheel</b> will cause the tire to completely lift off the road surface resulting in a loss of traction and control. Similarly when crossing into a sudden ground depression, the <b>inertia</b> of the <b>wheel</b> slows the rate at which it descends. If the <b>wheel</b> <b>inertia</b> is large enough, the wheel may be temporarily separated from the road surface before it has descended back into contact with the road surface.|$|R

40|$|A {{new system}} is being {{developed}} that performs satellite attitude control, attitude reference, and energy storage utilizing <b>inertia</b> <b>wheels.</b> The baseline approach consists of two counter rotating flywheels suspended in specially designed magnetic bearings, spin axis motor/generators, and a control system. The control system regulates the magnetic bearings and spin axis motor/generators and interacts with other satellite subsystems (photovoltaic array, star trackers, Sun sensors, magnetic torquers, etc.) to perform the three functions. Existing satellites utilize separate subsystems to perform attitude control, provide attitude reference, and store energy. These functions are currently performed using reaction or momentum wheels, gyros, batteries, and devices that provide an absolute reference (Sun sensors and star trackers). A Combined Attitude, Reference, and Energy Storage (CARES) system based on high energy density inertial energy storage wheels (flywheels) has potential advantages over existing technologies. Even when used only for energy storage, this system offers the potential for substantial improvements in life, energy efficiency, and weight over existing battery technologies. Utilizing this same device for both attitude control and attitude reference would result in significant additional savings in overall satellite weight and complexity...|$|R
