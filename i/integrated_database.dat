It briefly reviews the background to the growing interest in an <b>integrated</b> project <b>database</b> (IPDB) for construction projects, and examines the fundamental concept of an <b>integrated</b> project <b>database</b> by discussing the various definitions that have evolved, as well as the various approaches to its development. A detailed survey and analysis of recent UK projects that have sought to develop <b>integrated</b> project <b>databases</b> is also presented. The analysis is based on several criteria such as the application area, development environment, modelling approaches used, reusability, hardware and software requirements, and the use of standards. The paper concludes with an identification of gaps in current research and strategic advice on the future development of <b>integrated</b> project <b>databases...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} {{data integration}} solution {{can be viewed}} as an iterative process that consists of three phases, namely analysis, derivation and evolution. The entire process is similar to a software development process with the target application being the derivation rules for the <b>integrated</b> <b>databases.</b> In many cases, data integration requires several iterations of refining the local-to-global database mapping rules before a stable set of rules can be obtained. In particular, the mapping rules, as well as the data model and query model for the <b>integrated</b> <b>databases</b> have to cope with poor data quality in local databases, ongoing local database updates and instance heterogeneities. In this paper, we therefore propose a new object-oriented global data model, known as OORA, that can accommodate attribute and relationship instance heterogeneities in the <b>integrated</b> <b>databases.</b> The OORA model has been designed to allow database integrators and end users to query both the local and resolved instance values using the same query language throughout the derivation and evolution phases of database integration. Coupled with the OORA model, we also define a set of local-to-global database mapping rules that can detect new heterogeneities among databases and resolve instance heterogeneities if situations permit...|$|R

The approach consists of a joint bottom-up and top-down methodology; the bottom-up approach is taken to <b>integrate</b> existing <b>database</b> using standard schema integration techniques(B-Schema), the top-down approach is used to develop a database schema for the new applications(T-Schema). The T-Schema uses a joint functional-data analysis. The B-schema is evolved by comparing it with the generated T-schema. This facilitates an evolutionary {{approach to}} <b>integrate</b> existing <b>databases</b> to support new applications as and when needed.

40|$|With {{the burgeoning}} number of online files {{provided}} by {{an increasing number}} of vendors, information specialists will need more sophisticated capabilities to retrieve online information. <b>Integrated</b> <b>databases</b> provide a means for online searchers to retrieve information holistically. Three online developments by vendors will improve information retrieval: (1) simultaneous multi-file searchers; (2) crossover between separate files; (3) tagged retrievals that correlate to like records in other files. Simplicity in software design tends to engender rigid systems, such as menu-driven software, while flexibility for searching encourages complexity in software design. Vendors will need to balance these elements in <b>integrating</b> <b>databases.</b> Where should the information industry be going to make life easier for the information specialist and end user?
