50|$|Airglow {{is caused}} by various {{processes}} in the upper atmosphere, such as the recombination of atoms which were photoionized by the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day,</b> luminescence caused by cosmic rays striking the upper atmosphere, and chemiluminescence caused mainly by oxygen and nitrogen reacting with hydroxyl ions at heights {{of a few hundred}} kilometres. It is not noticeable during the daytime because of the scattered light from the sun.|$|R
40|$|Germination of teak {{is often}} poor. The study on fruits and seeds {{germination}} of Java teak, Muna teak, and Malabar Muna teak {{was conducted in}} a series of laboratory and greenhouse experiment. Teak fruits have saveral types of dormancy. So, fruits need pretreatment before they were planted. A recommended pretreatment of teak fruits is to soak the fruits during the night and dry them in the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day...</b>|$|R

50|$|They inhabit burrows and {{use either}} {{abandoned}} fox or porcupine burrows or enlarge those dug by gerbils or other rodents. The burrow is about 1.5 m deep and dug in slightly slanting ground with usually {{only a single}} entrance, though burrows {{with two or three}} entrances have also been observed. In winter, they stay in the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day,</b> but during the hot season, they are crepuscular and nocturnal.|$|R
50|$|Solar Panel Rig: Using the {{generator}} {{obtained from the}} traders in Episode 4, Mike, Joey and others set out to build a rig for the solar panels they obtained {{from the roof of}} a nearby building and along the railroad. John C. works to build a device that incorporates two photodiodes and a small motor into a solar tracking device, allowing the solar panels to follow the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day,</b> and return to starting positions at night.|$|R
5000|$|In Norse mythology, Hati Hróðvitnisson (first name meaning [...] "He Who Hates", or [...] "Enemy") is a warg; a wolf that, {{according}} to Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, chases Máni, the moon, across the night sky, {{just as the}} wolf Sköll chases Sól, the <b>sun,</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day,</b> until the time of Ragnarök, when they will swallow these heavenly bodies. Snorri also gives another name for a wolf who swallows the moon, Mánagarmr ("Moon-Hound", or [...] "Moon's Dog").|$|R
50|$|Aerial {{tumbling}} and talon grappling {{have been}} observed as behaviour during breeding season, which usually occurs in September-April, with egg laying in September-January. They build their nests on cliffs or crevices, and their broods {{have been observed}} to range between 1-3 nestlings. Both male and females have been observed tending to their young, and remaining present during the post-fledging period. Nests have been found at altitudes of 150-650m, in shaded areas {{to protect them from}} the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{main feature}} of this tower at its opening {{was that it was}} the most {{environmentally}} friendly building in France. It is equipped with photovoltaic modules that provide about 70% of the electricity consumed by the building, it uses environmentally friendly insulation materials such as cellulose, and uses no air conditioning, but exterior panels that cover the glass surfaces exposed to the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> (called the solar shield), without requiring the use of artificial lighting most of the time.|$|R
5000|$|Shamsiel (Aramaic: שִׁמשִׁיאֵל, Greek: Σεμιήλ), also spelled Samsâpêêl, Shamshel, Shashiel or Shamshiel, was the 16th Watcher of the 20 {{leaders of}} the 200 fallen angels that are {{mentioned}} in an ancient work called the Book of Enoch. The name means [...] "sun of God", which is fitting since {{it has been said}} that Shamsiel taught men the songs of the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>days</b> of Jared or Yered. Shamash (the Babylonian sun god) may share some mythological basis with Shamsiel.|$|R
50|$|It {{is harder}} to use the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> because {{of the changes in}} its {{position}} during the seasons, and it is necessary to use the swell of the ocean as an aid (not waves, which are local and variable). e.g. in the Santa Cruz group, three swells are considered to be present all round the year: the 'long swell' from the south east, the 'sea swell' from east-north-east and the 'hoahuadelahu' from the north-west. The helmsman detects the most reliable using balance.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 28-33 mm. Front {{and rear}} wings are dark brown to almost black. On the fore wing {{there are two}} large white spots. The rear wings show one white spot and a short streak, but they are smaller than the markings of the front wing. Front and rear wings are lined with white on the outer edge. These moths fly in the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> from April to August depending on the location, with two overlapping generations per year. They overwinter as a caterpillar.|$|R
50|$|Thermoclines {{can also}} be {{observed}} in lakes. In colder climates, {{this leads to a}} phenomenon called stratification. During the summer, warm water, which is less dense, will sit on top of colder, denser, deeper water with a thermocline separating them. The warm layer is called the epilimnion and the cold layer is called the hypolimnion. Because the warm water is exposed to the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day,</b> a stable system exists and very little mixing of warm water and cold water occurs, particularly in calm weather.|$|R
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day,</b> or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|R
30|$|Radhi Mahmood and Muhammad [18] {{designed}} and implemented a smart relay-based sun-tracking systems {{to keep the}} PV array perpendicular to the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> hours. The smart relay-based controller (SR 3 B 261 BD) was used to control {{the motion of the}} two-axis sun-tracking surface. Preliminary measurements indicated that the use of the two-axis sun tracker would increase daily energy 42  % more than the stationary solar panel and 1  % more than the single axis. The designed system operated smoothly with precise positioning about 7.5 ° per half hour.|$|R

50|$|A {{study was}} {{published}} in the science journal Oecologia by W. Bond (1983) on the purpose of retaining dead leaves by several species of tree aloe. Researchers before Bond have set forth studies to try to understand the function of such an adaptation. A few suggestions were that dead-leaf retention protected bare bark from the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> and the cold at night. On the contrary, another researcher believed that the thorny mass of leaves could deter unwanted wild life in search for water, nectar, or seeds. Bond, on the other hand, proposed that dead-leaf retention was selected to provide thick, fire resistant bark in a fire-prone habitat.|$|R
40|$|Passive Solar Architecture {{is a way}} of {{designing}} buildings that takes advantage of the benefits of the local environment (such as sunlight), while minimising the adverse impacts of the climate (such as cold night time temperatures) on the comfort level of the building. The aim of a passive solar building is to absorb (in winter) the maximum amount of radiation from the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day,</b> and to utilise this heat to warm the interior. The sides of the buildings exposed to the <b>sun</b> gain heat <b>during</b> the day, while the other sides, in the shade, lose heat. This helps to avoid overheating during [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} Rhône sub-region {{has a more}} Mediterranean climate with milder winters and hot summers. Drought can be {{a problem}} in the area, but limited irrigation is permitted. The differing terroirs, together with the rugged landscape which partly protects the valleys from the Mistral, produce microclimates which give rise to a wide diversity of wines. A feature of the cultivation of the region is the use of large pebbles around the bases of the vines to absorb the heat of the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> to keep the vines warm at night when, due to the cloudless skies, there is often a significant drop in temperature.|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} energy {{used for the}} living comfort, by the present society mainly comes from burning fossil fuels. These fuels are decreasing in a dramatic rate and it also contributes to pollution. Hybrid solar design for buildings helps to reduce the consumption of {{electrical energy}} and maximize the use of solar energy. A good thermal comfort is maintained during the whole cycle of the sun. This paper deals with maximum utilization of sun’s energy according to the various positions of <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> a <b>day.</b> It also includes the positioning of solar cells and better orientation, thus helping us to capture maximum solar energy. Based on the prevailing conditions of Thrissur a prototype is also being prepared...|$|R
25|$|This {{species is}} nocturnal and solitary. It is less active in colder and drier periods. B. asper is often found near rivers and streams, basking under the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> and lying still while well camouflaged in leaf litter or under forest cover waiting to ambush prey (including rats and mice) that comes within range during the night. When cornered or threatened, this species {{can be very}} {{defensive}} and may exhibit an S-coiled defense display. Juveniles are often semiarboreal and even adults are sometimes encountered in bushes and low trees. Juveniles are also known to exhibit caudal luring, a use of their differently colored tail tips to lure prey. Although {{both males and females}} display this behavior, only males have bright coloured tail tips.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{model of a}} new solar pumped laser system is tested to be run in Helwan in Egypt {{as an example of}} an industrial polluted area. The system is based on concentrating the solar radiation using a Fresnel lens on a laser head fixed on a mount tracking the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> and powered by a DC battery. The model is fed by real solar radiation data in the various seasons in order to know the laser power got from such a system in those conditions. The results showed that the output laser power obtained from this system can be up to 6. 2  W in spring, 6. 8  W in summer, 2. 2  W in autumn and 0. 4  W in winter...|$|R

For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> by the use of an internal clock. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris. These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the performative capacities of a pneumatic material system {{in regards to the}} specific environmental conditions. The use of Adaptation as a mechanism to modulate environmental performance was the main focus of the design process and research. The location of the <b>sun</b> <b>during</b> the <b>day</b> acts as a trigger to adapt the system, allowing the system to passively augment the environmental conditions. A new form-finding method that combines digital and material processes has been the main method by which the experiments were undertaken. This approach necessitates a dramatic shift in the architectural design, from producing static to environmentally responsive objects. It requires a shift in thinking from buildings as static and non-active systems to material system existing over time within specific environments capable of complex environmental performances. ...|$|R
