5|$|The {{end of the}} war brought {{national}} attention to Oak Ridge, and there was bad publicity about the conditions that the Black residents were living in. Roane-Anderson <b>dusted</b> <b>off</b> plans for a village for them. The new village, called Scarboro, was built where the Gamble Valley Trailer Camp had once stood. Construction commenced in 1948, and the first residents moved in two years later. It housed the entire Black community of Oak Ridge until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty's desire {{during the}} First World War for an {{aircraft}} carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but {{had no way to}} recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty {{an aircraft carrier}} design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was <b>dusted</b> <b>off</b> and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare, and the company began work on converting the ship.|$|E

500|$|From 1922 to 1926, Casey was {{the officer}} {{in charge of the}} Engineer Unit of the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, {{reverting}} to his substantive rank of first lieutenant on 27 November 1922. He again returned to Camp Humpreys in 1926 to attend the Company Officers Course. In 1927, Casey received his first civil works assignment, as assistant District Engineer at the Pittsburgh District. Casey took over the task of preparing a voluminous report on flood control. The Corps of Engineers was criticized by the Pittsburgh Flood Control Commission for over-engineering, in planning for a [...] "flood that had never happened and never would happen", and the report was shelved. However, in 1936 the flood did happen. The report was then <b>dusted</b> <b>off</b> and its recommendations were adopted. The Flood Control Act of 1936 assigned responsibility for flood control to the Corps of Engineers and other Federal agencies. Casey was also responsible for construction at Deadman Island Lock and Dam (now called the Dashields Lock and Dam) on the Ohio River.|$|E

After one of these drinking binges, he {{got into a fight}} over a misunderstanding with a man in St Stephen's Green; he was picked up and <b>dusted</b> <b>off</b> by a minor acquaintance of his father, Alfred H. Hunter, who took him into his home to tend to his injuries. Hunter was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife, and would serve as one of the models for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Ulysses. He took up with the medical student Oliver St. John Gogarty, who informed the character for Buck Mulligan in Ulysses. After six nights in the Martello Tower that Gogarty was renting in Sandycove, he left {{in the middle of the}} night following an altercation which involved another student he lived with, the unstable Dermot Chenevix Trench (Haines in Ulysses), who fired a pistol at some pans hanging directly over Joyce's bed. Joyce walked the [...] back to Dublin to stay with relatives for the night, and sent a friend to the tower the next day to pack his trunk. Shortly after, the couple left Ireland to live on the continent.|$|E

The team headed for England to play some tuneup matches, where they were beaten four times.|$|E

NOTS had initiated development of a rocket of the 2-inch caliber prior to the outbreak of the Korean War; the concept had been shelved with the war effort requiring higher-priority projects such as the Ram anti-tank rocket to be prioritized; now, however, the project was <b>dusted</b> <b>off</b> and development resumed under the name [...] "Gimlet" [...] – a name that, it was said, meant the rocket was to be a [...] "small anti-MiG" [...] weapon; [...] "Gim" [...] being [...] "MiG" [...] backwards, with an added diminutive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{popularity}} of backgammon surged in the mid-1960s, {{in part due}} to the charisma of Prince Alexis Obolensky who became known as [...] "The Father of Modern Backgammon". [...] "Obe", as he was called by friends, co-founded the International Backgammon Association, which published a set of official rules. He also established the World Backgammon Club of Manhattan, devised a backgammon tournament system in 1963, then organized the first major international backgammon tournament in March, 1964, which attracted royalty, celebrities and the press. The game became a huge fad and was played on college campuses, in discothèques and at country clubs; stockbrokers and bankers began playing at conservative men's clubs. People young and old all across the country <b>dusted</b> <b>off</b> their boards and checkers. Cigarette, liquor and car companies began to sponsor tournaments and Hugh Hefner held backgammon parties at the Playboy Mansion. Backgammon clubs were formed and tournaments were held, resulting in a World Championship promoted in Las Vegas in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|Alcott's pseudonymous {{career as}} A. M. Barnard, {{successful}} writer of sensational fiction, {{was brought to}} light in the early 1940s by a rare book dealer, Madeleine B. Stern, and a librarian, Leona Rostenberg. Their discovery became widely known in 1975, when Stern <b>dusted</b> <b>off</b> {{some of the more}} interesting stories for Behind a Mask: The Unknown Thrillers of Louisa May Alcott. Since then, several more such collections have been published, providing intriguing new material for literary scholars and biographers eager to reevaluate Alcott's career. The strongly feminist Love Chase seems likely to become a valued resource in this field of inquiry, with the added cachet that it was once judged too sensational for publication. In the words of reviewer Andria Spencer, “What proves so fascinating about Saxton's biography , A Long Fatal Love Chase, and … Behind a Mask is the reversal made in addressing Alcott's life and work — the solid, upright pedagogue melts away before the image of the ardent suffragette, sole support of family and home and rebel, despite herself.” ...|$|E

2500|$|As Michigan's {{equipment}} manager, Hatch {{played a}} role in the early history of the Little Brown Jug, one of the most famous trophies in college athletics. [...] In 1903, the Michigan Wolverines traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the unbeaten Wolverines played the unbeaten Minnesota Golden Gophers. [...] At the end of the game (a 6-6 tie), the crowd poured onto the field, and Michigan left its earthenware water jug on the field. [...] Michigan asked to have it returned, but Minnesota refused, saying Michigan would have to win the jug back. [...] Michigan reclaimed the jug several years later. [...] In 1919, Minnesota beat Michigan on the Wolverines' home field in Ann Arbor. [...] When Minnesota asked for the symbolic trophy at the end of the game, Michigan officials said they could not locate it. [...] Eventually, Hatch came up with it. [...] Hatch recalled, [...] "When Minnesota made such a fuss about getting it back, I started looking around and found it behind a clump of shrubbery near the gym. I shined it up and shipped it on to Doc Cooke." [...] Minnesota fans have long doubted Hatch's story, raising their suspicions that Hatch did not find the jug in a clump of shrubbery, but more likely [...] "in a trophy case inside the gymnasium, easily <b>dusted</b> <b>off</b> and proudly brought back to Minnesota." ...|$|E

The letters, with a cross after each one, [...] are said to stand either for the traditionally applied names of the Three Kings in Polish – Kacper, Melchior and Baltazar – [...] or for a Latin inscription meaning [...] "Christ bless this house." [...] They remain above the doors all year until they are inadvertently <b>dusted</b> <b>off</b> or replaced by new markings the next year. On January 6, as in much of Europe, a Polish style Three Kings cake is served with a coin or almond baked inside. The one who gets it is king or queen for the day, signified by wearing the paper crown that decorates the cake. According to Polish tradition this person will be lucky in the coming year. Recipes vary by region. Some serve a French-type puff pastry cake with almond paste filling, others favor a sponge cake with almond cream filling, and yet others enjoy a light fruitcake.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the middle}} of the 1930s the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration began to bring {{attention}} to the housing plight of lower-income groups in the United States. [...] Many of the New Deal administrators became convinced that decent housing was the right of every citizen, and believed it the duty of the government to find ways to provide such housing. [...] A decentralized lower-income housing program was developed, which relied heavily on local community involvement, organization and input. [...] Financial and administrative support for this initiative were provided by the federal government. In support of this effort, a well-developed public relations campaign was begun to promote and explain the need for public housing, and to establish popular support for the program. [...] Some administrators of the housing program were not satisfied with assisting only the lower-income groups. They asked why programs could not be expanded to assist the middle-income groups in finding decent, affordable housing. [...] Able to afford higher rents, yet often unable to accumulate the required down payments for ownership, members of the middle-income group found it very difficult, if not impossible, to make the jump from rental housing to home ownership. [...] Affordable housing plans were developed but were unable to garner the necessary support within government circles, and they were filed away to await a time when the environment would be right for implementation. [...] Surprisingly, the wait was not long. [...] Just prior to direct American involvement in World War II, the nation entered an emergency period of military buildup that required the development of housing for the middle-income defense workers then streaming into defense plants across the country. [...] The nation's entire public housing program needed to adjust quickly {{to the needs of the}} middle-income worker, and the proposals for housing programs—filed away just a few years earlier—were <b>dusted</b> <b>off.</b> During this relatively brief period of time (1940–1941) just prior to the outbreak of war and its accompanying material shortages and limitations, housing officials had a great deal of freedom to implement these experimental middle-income housing plans.|$|E
