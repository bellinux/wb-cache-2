5|$|The {{existence}} of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, in Brno (Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2ncombinations where n {{is the number}} of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured Wilhelm Johannsen's <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> dominant and recessive traits, the <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> {{aggressive}} mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E

5|$|A key <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> {{the bills}} of {{rights of the}} Commonwealth jurisdictions {{referred}} to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society.
