40|$|BACKGROUND: Beach volleyball is an Olympic {{overhead}} sport. It is {{not well}} known which clinical and imaging findings are normal and which are associated with symptoms. HYPOTHESIS: There are typical clinical and imaging findings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> shoulders of fully competitive professional beach volleyball players, as compared with their nonhitting shoulders. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: During the Beach Volleyball Grand Slam Tournament in Klagenfurt, Austria, 84 professional players (54 men, 30 women) underwent a questionnaire-based interview and a complete physical examination, including scoring and sonography of both shoulders. Twenty-nine players had shoulder MRIs. RESULTS: The {{mean age of the}} athletes was 28 years. Atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle was found in 30 % of <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> shoulders, and it was not typically recognized by the players. The absolute Constant score was significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> shoulder (87 versus 93 points, P <. 0001). Average external rotation strength was decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> shoulder (8. 2 versus 9. 5 kg, P <. 0001). There were more abnormalities on the sonography of <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> shoulder (1. 7 versus 0. 4, P <. 0001) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same shoulders on MRI than on sonography (P =. 0231). Compression of the suprascapular nerve was not observed. Pain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hitting</b> shoulder was present in 63 % of the players, without clear correlations to the investigated clinical and imaging parameters. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of infraspinatus muscle atrophy in professional beach volleyball players is 30 %. The typical, fully competitive player has subjectively unrecognized decreased strength of external rotation and frequent unspecific shoulder pain. Therefore, abnormal clinical and imaging findings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beach volleyball player should be interpreted with care...|$|R
