40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} powder {{apparent}} density {{and the content}} <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> on the maximum pore size and permeability of metal powder/wire mesh filter media were investigated. It was shown that the maximum pore size depends on the particle size when the content <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> is less than 9 %. The maximum pore size increases fast when the content <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> is higher than 9 %. The relative air permeability increases with increasing the content <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> in the porous materials. When the content <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> is constant, the maximum pore size and relative air permeability firstly decrease and then increase as the increase of the powder apparent density...|$|R

30|$|The binders {{dispersed}} in the coal/binder matrix {{are believed}} to act as fully adhesive, which benefits the mechanical strength of the briquettes. The amounts <b>of</b> dispersed <b>binders</b> increased as the concentration <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> increased. Large, unevenly distributed, agglomerated particles <b>of</b> <b>binders</b> that shrank during the drying process can generate fractures in the spaces between the binders and the coal particles, which is harmful to the mechanical strength (Wang et al. 2013). A larger size difference was found for the agglomerated binders as the binder concentration increased. When small amounts <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> were used, the cohesiveness <b>of</b> the dispersed <b>binders</b> was the dominating factor, with small volumes <b>of</b> agglomerated <b>binders</b> in the briquettes, and so the mechanical strength of the briquettes increased as the binder concentration increased. When the binder concentration was high enough, the volumes <b>of</b> the agglomerated <b>binders</b> increased significantly and strength-controlling flaws were produced, so mechanical strength of the briquettes decreased as the binder concentration increased, as shown in Fig.  6 a.|$|R

However, with increasing agitation time after addition <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> liquid the agglomerates size and density increases and morphology improves.

When the LiCoO 2 slurry is prepared with an organic-based process, the non-uniform distributions <b>of</b> the <b>binder,</b> poly(vinylidene fluoride), and a conductive agent, graphite, are markedly observed in the dried electrode sheet. Nevertheless, these non-uniform distributions of constituents are less significant for the electrode sheet prepared by a water-based process that uses a blend of styrene butadiene rubber and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as the binder. Beside the experimental results, the binder distributions in the dried electrodes can be accurately predicted via a theoretical calculation based on a migration-controlled drying kinetics. The calculated {{results show that the}} organic-based electrode sheet has much higher non-uniformity <b>of</b> <b>binder</b> distribution than the water-based one. Because of the higher non-uniform distributions <b>of</b> <b>binder,</b> the organic-based electrode sheet displays properties of weaker adhesion and higher electrical resistance.

The aim of the test programme was to investigate the viability of a series <b>of</b> <b>binders</b> designed to fulfil particular user needs while having significantly decreased carbon footprints.
