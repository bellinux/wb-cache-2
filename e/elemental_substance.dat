40|$|The {{procedures}} of tendon repair after suturing and grafting {{are discussed in}} this paper. Animal experiments were performed on the Achilles and long digital flexor tendons in rabbits, and after the operation histological examinations were conducted weekly until the sixth week. As for the grafting, free autogenous and homogenous tendon grafts were used. In addition, tendon fixation through a drill hole in the tibia was experimented. Results are as follows: 1. The peritenoneum and connective tissues surrounding the tendon play {{an essential role in}} repairing tendons that are sutured and grafted. 2. Histological investigations reveal that the fibrous union becomes fairly firm in the third postoperative week and almost complete in the sixth week. 3. The newly-formed tissue between the tendon stumps is not a truly regenerated tendinous tissue but a scar tissue. 4. Blood vessels that take part in the tendon repair originate from the surrounding connective tissues and in the sixth week they are almost completely in a definite arrangement. 5. Tendon grafts, both autogenous and homogenous, degenerate once and then are replaced with the surrounding connective tissues with round cell infiltration, connective tissue cell proliferation and blood vessel invasion. 6. At these replacements, <b>elemental</b> <b>substance</b> of the collagenous fibers remains and is involved in reconstruction of the fiber bundles. 7. Adhesions always occur about the sutured area and around the graft, but the gliding mechanism appears again after the fifth or sixth postoperative week. 8. Adhesions are marked especially near the silk sutures. 9. Thension to which the healing tendon is subjected tends to produce the separation at the suture line. But the nuclei and fibers of the newly-formed connective tissue and the blood vessels are arranged in a parallel form more rapidly with such functional stimuli than without. 10. The separation at the suture line occurs in the first to second week but does not continue to widen after the third week. 11. Two weeks of immobilization following operation, therefore, seems to be sufficient, and restricted use may be commenced thereafter. 12. When the tendon is grafted through a drill hole in a bone, the firm anchorage is obtained by its gradual ossification and incorporation in the bone. 13. Ossification of the tendon under these circumstances occurs by replacement of the tendon with the invading osteoblasts which form bone. 14. Contiguity of the collagenous fibers between the tendon and the bone is observed in the sixth week after grafting. 15. Ossification of the transplant is observed most markedly in the cortical area and least in the medullary portion...|$|E

40|$|The Aristotelian {{distinction}} between actual and potential {{presence of a}} substance in a mixture forms part of a conception of mixture which stands in contrast to atomist and Stoic theories as propounded by the ancients.

This is well-illustrated by Duhem, who maintained the Aristotelian idea that the original ingredients are only potentially, and not actually, present in a mixture, but sided with the Stoics and against Aristotle on the possibility of cooccupancy. I have argued that the Stoic theory can’t dispense with some such notion as the Aristotelian conception of potentiality in allowing the elements to be actually present in a mixture.

40|$|Effective pair {{interactions}} with a soft-repulsive component are a well-known feature of polymer solutions and colloidal suspensions, {{but they also}} provide a key to interpret the high-pressure behaviour of simple elements. We have computed the zero-temperature phase diagram of four different model potentials with various degrees of core softness. Among the reviewed crystal structures, {{there are also a}} number of non-Bravais lattices, chosen among those observed in real systems. Some of these crystals are indeed found to be stable for the selected potentials.

Conversely, a bounded repulsion may lead to intermittent appearance of compact structures with compression and no eventual settling down in a specific phase.

40|$|Metallic {{properties}} {{are by no}} means confined to <b>elemental</b> <b>substances</b> alone. A variety of materials, both inorganic and organic, show metallic properties. Some of these exotic substances exhibit electrical conductivities comparable to those of elemental metals like copper. A large number of systems traverse the transition from the metallic state to the nonmetallic state when there is a change in temperature, pressure or composition. Metal oxides provide a wide range of materials exhibiting metallic behaviour or going through the metal to non-metal (M-NM) transition. Alkali metal-ammonia solutions, with which chemists are all too familiar, probably constitute one of the earliest and most widely studied examples of the M-NM transition. However, a proper recognition of the metallization of ammonia {{in the context of the}} variety of solid systems exhibiting M-NM transitions has only been possible recently. Another interesting class of substances is that of expanded metals such as Hg and Cs which become non-metallic when the density is reduced below a critical value. Several organic solids, metal-chain compounds and polymers are not only metallic, but also become superconducting at low temperatures. With such a galaxy of chemical substances exhibiting metallic behaviour, the fundamental, recurring question of vital interest is "what makes a metal?". In this contribution, we shall examine operational criteria as well as criteria derived from models to answer this question.

This was {{the first}} report of assessment of the ethanolic stem extract (ESE), of C. lutea as anti-diarrhoeal agent in rats. The anti-diarrhoeal effects, acute toxicity and ionic profile are investigated and reported. Materials and Methods: The acute toxicity was established using Lock’s method. The anti-diarrhoeal effects were demonstrated using castor oil-induced diarrheal and fluid accumulation {{and its effect on}} normal intestinal transit. The mechanism elucidated using yohimbine, isosorbide dinitrate, and diphenoxylate. The elemental and ionic profile of ESE was established using inductively coupled argon-plasma emission spectrometer and potentiometric titration respectively. The finger print of ESE was revealed by Jasco (Tokyo, Japan), HPLC and active compounds by phytochemical screening using standard procedure. Results: The LD 50 obtained is 866. 025 mg/kg (i. p). The doses of 43. 3, 86. 6, and 173. 2 mg/kg of ESE showed inhibition of castor oil–induced diarrheal (p< 0. 05 - 0. 001). The most abundant cations in the extract are potassium and phosphorus (1. 00 ± 0. 01 and 0. 80 ± 0. 030 mg/g respectively); while the most abundant anions are phosphate and sulphate (33. 50 ± 7. 09 and 7. 19 ± 3. 29 mg/g respectively).

60|$|I {{attempted}} also to {{show that}} there is a steady tendency in the forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant and exterminate the preceding, less divergent and less improved forms. I request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as formerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that the inevitable result is, that the modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. In the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including several species; and the whole of the genera along this upper line form together one class, for all are descended from one ancient parent, and, consequently, have inherited something in common. But the three genera on the left hand have, on this same principle, much in common, and form a subfamily, distinct from that containing the next two genera on the right hand, which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent. These five genera have also much in common, though less than when grouped in subfamilies; and they form a family distinct from that containing the three genera still further to the right hand, which diverged at an earlier period. And all these genera, descended from (A), form an order distinct from the genera descended from (I). So that we here have many species descended from a single progenitor grouped into genera; and the genera into subfamilies, families and orders, all under one great class. The grand fact of the natural subordination of organic beings in groups under groups, which, from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my judgment thus explained. No doubt organic beings, like all other objects, can be classed in many ways, either artificially by single characters, or more naturally by a number of characters. We know, for instance, that minerals and the <b>elemental</b> <b>substances</b> can be thus arranged. In this case there is of course no relation to genealogical succession, and no cause can at present be assigned for their falling into groups. But with organic beings the case is different, and the view above given accords with their natural arrangement in group under group; and no other explanation has ever been attempted.|$|R
