The transconductor can {{work from the}} weak <b>inversion</b> <b>region</b> to the strong <b>inversion</b> <b>region</b> to maximize the transconductance tuning range. The trasconductance can be tuned by changing its bias current. A fifth-order Elliptic low-pass filter implemented with the transconductors is proposed to be implemented in SPICE using CMOS. The filter can operate with the cutoff frequency of 250 Hz to 1 MHz. The wide tuning range filter would be suitable for multi-mode applications, especially under the consideration of saving chip areas. The third-order inter-modulation of- 40 dB was measured over the tuning range with two tone input signals. The power consumption is 0. 8 mW at 1 MHz cutoff frequency and 1. 8 -V supply. Cost and power consumption are two most important factors for these products. For the power consumption, digital circuits can benefit from the supply voltage reduction, but analog circuits can not necessarily decrease the power consumption with the decrease of supply voltage. To meet different specifications for low power consumption, new basic analog building blocks should be re-designed.
