40|$|Among {{the various}} {{possible}} <b>embodiements</b> of Advanced Therapies {{and in particular}} of Tissue Engineering the use of temporary scaffolds to regenerate tissue defects {{is one of the}} key issues. The scaffolds should be specifically designed to create environments that promote tissue development and not merely to support the maintenance of communities of cells. To achieve that goal, highly functional scaffolds may combine specific morphologies and surface chemistry with the local release of bioactive agents. Many biomaterials have been proposed to produce scaffolds aiming the regeneration of a wealth of human tissues. We have a particular interest in developing systems based in nanofibrous biodegradable polymers 1, 2. Those demanding applications require a combination of mechanical properties, processability, cell-friendly surfaces and tunable biodegradability that need to be tailored for the specific application envisioned. Those biomaterials are usually processed by different routes into devices with wide range of morphologies such as biodegradable fibers and meshes, films or particles and adaptable to different biomedical applications. In our approach, we combine the temporary scaffolds populated with therapeutically relevant communities of cells to generate a hybrid implant. For that we have explored different sources of adult and also embryonic stem cells. We are exploring the use of adult MSCs 3, namely obtained from the bone marrow for the development autologous-based therapies. We also develop strategies based in extra-embryonic tissues, such as amniotic fluid (AF) and the perivascular region of the umbilical cord 4 (Whartonâ s Jelly, WJ). Those tissues offer many advantages over both embryonic and other adult stem cell sourcess. These tissues are frequently discarded at parturition and its extracorporeal nature facilitates tissue donation by the patients. The comparatively large volume of tissue and ease of physical manipulation facilitates the isolation of larger numbers of stem cells. The fetal stem cells appear to have more pronounced immunomodulatory properties than adult MSCs. This allogeneic escape mechanism may be of therapeutic value, because the transplantation of readily available allogeneic human MSCs would be preferable as opposed to the required expansion stage (involving both time and logistic effort) of autologous cells. Topics to be covered: This talk will review our latest developments of nanostructured-based biomaterials and scaffolds in combination with stem cells for bone and cartilage tissue engineering.

50|$|A {{theory of}} the folklorist Dietz-Rüdiger Moser says that the {{conflict}} between the amusement/enjoyment of Fastnacht and the deprivation of Lent can also be interpreted in a theological way. Whereas, according to the augustinian two kingdoms doctrine, Fastnacht was equated with the kingdom of the devil “civitas diaboli”, Lent was seen as part of the kingdom of God or “civitas Dei”. This idea might have led to the invention of early Fastnacht figures such as devils and demons. The jester, who was considered as another central figure of Fastnacht at that time, was seen as the <b>embodiement</b> of evanescence, separation from god and death. Whereas studies conducted before and during the 1980s assumed that Fastnacht did not originate from Christian beliefs, scholars today agree that the existence of the church was a necessary condition for the emergence of Fastnacht. Fastnacht was an opportunity for the people to criticise authorities and also the church. This often led to prohibitions of Fastnacht.|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} was first popularized (and possibly created) by Milanese writer Carlo Maria Maggi, who also {{gave him the}} surname [...] "Pecenna", a Milanese word which means [...] "hairdresser" [...] but also conveys an implicit critique to the vanity and shallowness of aristocracy and clergy. The {{character was}} further developed by Milanese poet Carlo Porta, who used it in several works, including his debut El lavapiatt del Meneghin ch'è mort ("The dead Meneghino's dish-washer", 1792). Porta also developed the anti-clerical traits of the character in works such as Meneghin biroeu di ex monegh ("Meneghino Servant of the Former Nuns", 1820). Meneghino thus eventually became the <b>embodiement</b> of the Milanese's critical attitude towards the powerful, the rich, and the oppressors of the people. As a consequence, {{in the years that}} led to the Italian unification (i.e., during the [...] "Risorgimento"), he became a symbol of the Milanese revolutionary movement against the Austrian oppression.|$|E

The protestant theologians of the so-called 'Religionsgeschichtliche Schule' were inspired by the dominant intellectual trends of the German Empire. Their research on the pneumatology of the New Testament has been largely influenced by individual experiences of latent cultural forces of mobilization, labeled in terms as, i. e., spirit, appearance of spirit, <b>embodiement</b> of spirit, spirituality, mental, or consciousness. The study examines the protestant belief of the theologians by using methods of cultural sciences, sciences of religions, and historical epistemology. The theoretical bias is directed towards the cognitive potential of the period around 1900, which governed and shaped scientific as well as intellectual trends. In {{the context of a}} new research interest in protestant spirituality, the study affords a number of important new contributions...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the various visions of the streets {{reflected}} in a few short stories by Chat Kopchitti, Atsiri Thammachot, Wanit Charungkit-anan and Sila Khomchai (who all won the SEA Write Award). After a brief review of the history and situation of the short story in Thailand and a presentation of the corpus and writers, five themes will be developed in relation with five key elements structuring these short stories : the scenery - streets as a place of contrasts -; the characters - streets as a meeting place -; the action - streets as a place of movement -; the themes - streets as an <b>embodiement</b> of social inequalities - and, last, the atmosphere - streets as a nostalgia set. These themes, which constitute major topics in the corpus considered, offer an opportunity to analyse how the city and the streets in the city are perceived by different authors, giving an idea of how Thai intellectuals judge the city and modern urban society.

40|$|Several {{researches}} that we {{have conducted}} in our laboratory (CRESSON) have aimed at understanding the ambient milieu (among which sonic and optic environment) through one's experience. These works encourage us to consider an "ecological approach to architecture" which {{takes into account the}} human, sensitive and social, experience in situ. It gives importance to the potentials of perception and action that an environment can afford to users. But it also questions the aesthetic criterias and the <b>embodiement</b> of ́ references a that guide architectural thinking. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show and discuss results of researches that lead us to question how "ambience" could be a reasoning vector when conceiving architectural and urban projects and how ambient references are build up and integrated in an architectural culture. The approach we use is indeed inspired and awakened by several researches in different domains such as that of perception or of sociological and architectural research. We briefly explain these references and their respective importance for an ecological approach. Then, we present two sorts of work according to their respective aims and a few examples of interesting results belonging to the fields of sonic environments and optic structures which could make reference. It will particularly concern spaces that create transition between different conxtets. They are important in current life and as units of structuration in architectural composition.

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Biologia (Biologia Evolutiva e do Desenvolvimento), 2009, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de CiênciasResumo alargado em português disponível no documentoAs social species, {{mechanisms}} of social cohesion must exist {{to secure the}} harmony within the group and defence of {{the survival of the}} kind. Empathy could have emerged to answer just that: an internal mechanism allowing the <b>embodiement</b> of emotions that ensures the efficient contagion of emotional states for the synchrony of individuals within the group. Even though understanding the actions and emotions of others is a pragmatic need of social animals, the study of empathy remained crippled through many years due to the erroneous idea of human exclusivity. The new tools brought by psychological, behavioural and neural sciences not only make it possible, but urge the redefinition of many abilities we thought until now to be exclusive to man. The present study reviews what we know so far regarding the study of empathy, and presents behavioural work towards the systematic approach to the phenomenon. With the purpose of inferring on the existence of emotional empathy in chimpanzees, presenting a method of systematic data collection and investigating further into the empathic process, the present study was carried out for the course of four months in South Africa, at Jane Goodall's Institute sanctuary, Chimp Eden. Behavioural sampling was carried out to register empathy triggers and group scans were conducted in order to obtain measures of Relationship Quality and Proximity and ascertain their possible relation to the empathic response. The present study presents results that support the existence of empathy in chimpanzees and proposes the next steps in the systematic study of the phenomenon, either in laboratory or wild conditions...|$|E
