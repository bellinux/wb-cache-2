25|$|Time-independent {{perturbation}} theory {{is one of}} two categories of {{perturbation theory}}, the other being time-dependent perturbation (see next section). In time-independent perturbation theory the perturbation Hamiltonian is static (i.e., possesses no time dependence). Time-independent perturbation theory was presented by Erwin Schrödinger in a 1926 paper, shortly after he produced his theories in wave mechanics. In this paper Schrödinger referred to earlier work of Lord Rayleigh, who investigated harmonic vibrations of a string perturbed by small inhomogeneities. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> perturbation theory {{is often referred to as}} Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory.|$|E
25|$|When {{air flows}} around the wheel wells it gets {{disturbed}} by the rims of the vehicles, and forms an area of turbulence around the wheel. In order for the air to flow smoother around the wheel well smooth wheel covers are often applied. Smooth wheel covers are hub caps with no holes in them for air to pass through. This design reduces drag, however, it may cause the brakes to heat up quicker because the covers prevent airflow around the brake system. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> modification is more commonly seen with high efficiency vehicles, rather than sports cars or racing vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only are}} {{songbird}} and human language parallel regarding neural and molecular factors, {{they also are}} similar in how their communication is initially produced. Observations about these similarities {{can be traced back}} to Charles Darwin and his studies. Avian and mammalian brains are similar in form and connectivity and there may even be a gene that is relevant to speech found in both organisms. The learning of a song is produced through a mix of interaction, experience, and predisposition. Young songbirds will imitate their species' call when presented with songs from their own and another species. They are physically capable of producing either song, but do not. Humans learn language through similar means, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> early vocalization in songbirds is considered babbling.|$|E

25|$|Brando {{would later}} say in his 2015 documentary, Listen to me Marlon, {{that he felt}} the part in On the Waterfront that won him an Oscar was to him personally, not good, and that {{he knew he had}} done better acting. In the behind the scenes of On the Waterfront film experts and critics would say he would change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it as natural as possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell {{said that}} {{thanks to this}} album, Megadeth {{developed}} a strong cult following. He viewed the record as a resistance against the glam metal acts from the day, because bands like Megadeth were more appealing to the [...] "dead-end kids". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters praised the album for making strong impression both musically and visually. Although Begrand acknowledged {{that this was not}} Megadeth's most technically proficient album, he explained that the unique combination of [...] "the extreme and the accessible" [...] <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> album remained a fan-favorite. Spin magazine's Mike Powell cited the record as an example of [...] "glossy hardcore" [...] with Satanic lyricism. Jeff Treppel from Decibel noted that the album exhibits a distinctive sound, which set Megadeth apart from their contemporaries: [...] "Peace Sells was a leaner, nastier predator. Megadeth preferred to kill with speed and precision instead of size and power." [...] According to him, the album influenced countless heavy metal bands that followed, from Arch Enemy to DragonForce.|$|E
500|$|Following an {{incident}} in which Natasha sprays graffiti around Ramsay Street, Michael disowns his daughter and ignores her attempts {{to get back in}} his good books. Natasha finds the situation weird and she is hurt by her father's actions. Novakovic said Natasha is disappointed in herself for hurting Michael so much. Natasha responds by taking advantage of her new independence to try to get Michael's attention. She also tries to get back on her father's good side, by doing some housekeeping, but Michael brushes it all aside. Of how Natasha feels about this, Novakovic said [...] "She knows how much her father loves her which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> is even more jarring, as she realises it must be killing her father to act this way." [...] Natasha and Michael eventually make amends, but it is not an easy journey and they have a lot to work through. Novakovic told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that the storyline would change Natasha and she would become more sensitive and less self-absorbed.|$|E

She stated: [...] "Once on the skin, the scent transformed in a matter of just a few minutes from something floral-y and vaguely acceptable to an offensive mix of car fumes and that vanilla body spray Victoria's Secret used to sell to 12-year-olds", then adding that the perfume's logo and gold swirls [...] "sway too similar to that of KY Jelly's", before concluding that [...] "calling to mind sex is kind of Beyoncé's thing, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> fragrance could just be a smashing success." [...] Holly Siegel of The New York Times complimented the fragrance's scent of [...] "floral-fruity-woody blend and notes of neroli, almond and tonka bean." [...] On October 25, 2010, the perfume won a gold status at the Design of the Times Awards by The Strive Group. At the 2011 CEW Beauty Awards, Heat won in the category for Best Fragrance of the Year: Mass.

2500|$|Also {{known as}} the Axial system, or Equatorial system, it divides the {{celestial}} equator in twelve 30° sectors (starting at the local meridian) and projects them on to the ecliptic along the great circles containing the North and South celestial poles. The intersections of the ecliptic with those great circles provide the house cusps. The 10th house cusp thus equals the Midheaven, but the East Point (also known as Equatorial Ascendant) is now the first house's cusp. Each house is exactly 2 sidereal hours long. This system was proposed by the Australian astrologer David Cope {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century and has become the most popular system with the Uranian school of astrology. [...] The Ascendant (intersection between the ecliptic and the horizon) preserves its importance in chart interpretation through sign and aspects, but not as a house determinant, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>this</b> house system can be used in any latitude.|$|E
