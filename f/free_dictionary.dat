5000|$|Any {{characteristic}} in {{the physical}} world can adopt one out of a set of values. Quantification of a characteristic may have several meanings; however, according to the <b>Free</b> <b>Dictionary</b> it is used for [...] "the act or process of assigning numbers to phenomena according to a rule". Accordingly, quantification of a characteristic means that the set of values of the characteristic is mapped on a suitable set of numbers. In other words, a characteristic is represented by a variable. The rules take care that all the relations like order, distance or a natural zero among the values of the characteristic are preserved within the obtained set of real numbers. An appropriate quantification necessitates therefore that the relations and hence the nature of the characteristic are sufficiently well understood. In physics metric characteristics are of interest and quantification of a metric characteristic is obtained by selecting, for example, the values which are mapped on the real numbers 0 and 1, where the letter is called unit with a particular name like meter, mass or second.|$|E
