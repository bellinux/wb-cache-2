2500|$|Writing in 1927, Arghezi publicized his regret at {{not having}} {{cultivated}} the friendship: [...] "I {{never saw him}} again and I am weighed down by the irreparable grief of never seeking him out. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> optimism could have rekindled in his cerebral chaos those candid and pure things that were beginning to die." [...] Several Urmuz exegetes have traditionally seen the suicide intrinsically linked to Urmuz's artistic attitude. For scholar Carmen Blaga, it was the [...] "dissolution of [...] faith" [...] in Romania's intellectual class, along with economic decline and [...] "an existential void", that prompted the writer to opt himself out. This resonates with claims by the first-generation followers of Urmuz: Geo Bogza suggests that his mentor killed himself once the deconstructive process, performed by his [...] "sharp intellect", reached a natural conclusion; Sașa Pană claims that Urmuz was tired of merely amusing the [...] "cretins" [...] and [...] "profiteers" [...] who held sway over Bucharest's literary scene, and, determined to turn his literary persona into [...] "stardust", took the risk of destroying his physical self. Additionally, academic George Călinescu argued that there was a philosophical rationale [...] "very in tune with his century": [...] "he wanted to die in some original way, 'without any cause'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Different {{opinions}} and questions started to surface over the magazine editors' negligence and choice of dress. There were also suspicions that {{the incident was}} a set-up to ruin Zhao's career. [...] On 28 December 2001, during her performance at a concert, Zhao was attacked on stage by Fu Shenghua, a construction worker who later said his grandparents were killed during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Reflecting upon his actions, Fu told a Chinese magazine: [...] "I know what I did wasn't right. But <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> cause was just... As a famous Chinese person, {{she should have been}} aware of such an important event in Chinese history." [...] Later, a Chinese newspaper, Beijing Youth Daily published a special report after a two-month investigation and alleged that Fu had lied to the media, claiming that no one in his family had died during the war and that he was not a construction worker but instead had been unemployed for several years. The journalist noted that it was difficult to have conversations with Fu due to his alleged extremist views. More and more people started to believe that the incident was a set-up and the public views started shifting more empathetically towards Zhao. After this report was published, the hype surrounding the incident died down and the Chinese media seldom mentioned it again.|$|E
