50|$|This species prefers marshy and swampy localities between {{sea level}} and 1,100 m ASL, and also occurs in more wooded habitat if {{suitable}} wetlands are nearby. A key feature of prime habitat is an abundant growth of caraguata (spiny <b>eryngos,</b> Eryngium spp.), such as E. pandanifolium which it utilizes particularly in upland localities.

25|$|Gundelia {{is a low}} to high (20–100cm) thistle-like {{perennial}} {{herbaceous plant}} with latex, spiny compound inflorescences, reminiscent of teasles and <b>eryngos,</b> that contain cream, yellow, greenish, pink, purple or redish-purple disk florets. It is assigned to the daisy family. Flowers can be found from February to May. The stems of this plant dry-out when the seeds are ripe and break free from the underground root, and are then blown away like a tumbleweed, thus spreading the seeds effectively over large areas with little standing vegetation. This plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle-East. Opinions differ {{about the number of}} species in Gundelia. Sometimes the genus is regarded monotypic, Gundelia tournefortii being a species with a large variability, but other authors distinguish up to nine species, differing in floret color and pubescence. Young stems are cooked and eaten in the Middle-East and are said to taste like a combination of artichoke and asparagus. The plant also contains compounds that have been demonstrated to be effective against a range of ailments. A large quantity of pollen assigned to Gundelia has been found on the Shroud of Turin, which may suggest that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia, but this finding has been contested.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study tracks local {{vegetation}} {{change in}} West Cornwall (South West England) within regional context, using historic herbarium (pre- 1900) and recent vegetation records (post- 1900). The focus centres on species lost {{from the region}} over the past century. For this study we used a collection of herbarium records published in 1909 (Davey’s “Flora of Cornwall”) and contemporary records from the “New Atlas of British and Irish Flora” downloaded from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN), online database. Both data sets were spatially analysed using ArcGIS in order to detect local scale species loss. Our results showed that species loss was highest in the south (11 plant species), compared to the loss from middle areas (6 plant species) and in the northern area (8 plant species) of West Cornwall. Results on species change at the local scale were different to {{the changes that are}} happening at the national scale. Loss from West Cornwall was detected for two plant species, Mountain Melick (Melica nutans) and Field <b>Eryngo</b> (Eryngium campestare). These key results amplify the importance of local scale research and conservation in order to protect ecosystems functioning, genetic diversity, ecosystem services and regional identity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEryngium creticum Lam. (E. cyaneum Sibth. & Sm., E. syriacum Lam.), Saniculoideae, Apiaceae is {{of great}} {{importance}} in the traditional Greco – Arab medicine. This study {{was carried out in}} order to contribute to the ethnopharmacological knowledge of this medicinal species. This review describes the botanical characterization and distribution, as well as critically assesses the phytochemical properties and biological activities of E. creticum, a species that has been used in traditional medicine for many decades. Possible trends and perspectives for future research of this plant are discussed, as well. E. creticum has been found to contain several chemical constituents, mostly sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, aldehydes, coumarins, sitosterols and sugars. <b>Eryngo</b> with its bioactive compounds possesses a wild range of biological activities. It was reported that in traditional medicine E. creticum was applied mainly as the remedy for snake and scorpion bites. Some published studies have shown a broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities, including anti-snake and anti-scorpion venom, as well as antibacterial, antifungal and antileishmanial effects. Other have indicated antihyperglycemic, hypoglycemic and antioxidant activities of this species. The in vitro studies and in vivo models have provided a simple bioscientific explanation for its various ethnopharmacological uses...|$|E
