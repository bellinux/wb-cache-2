Another member of the government panel, Seiji Shiroya was paid 3.1 million yen by Japan Atomic <b>Industrial</b> <b>Forum</b> Inc. over three years to 2009, while he was professor at the University of Kyoto. According to Madarame, a former professor of the University of Tokyo, these donations had no influence on their decision-making, when they were promoting nuclear safety by double-checking the regulatory measures implemented by the nuclear industry and science ministries. According to the two scientists, the donations were intended to promote nuclear research, and the money was spent on research and {{to cover the costs}} of business trips. Madarame added that all records of the panel-meetings were made published, and the public should judge whether these donations were appropriate.|$|E

50|$|The Institute {{was founded}} in 1994 from the merger of several nuclear energy {{industry}} organizations, the oldest of which was created in 1953. Specifically, in 1994, NEI was formed from the merger of the Nuclear Utility Management and Resources Council (NUMARC), which addressed generic regulatory and technical issues; the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness (USCEA), which conducted a national communications program; the American Nuclear Energy Council (ANEC), which conducted government affairs; and the nuclear division of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), which handled issues involving used nuclear fuel management, nuclear fuel supply, and the economics of nuclear energy. In 1987, NUMARC and USCEA were created through {{a division of the}} Atomic <b>Industrial</b> <b>Forum</b> (AIF). USCEA {{was founded in}} 1979 as the U.S. Committee for Energy Awareness. AIF was created in 1953 to focus on the beneficial uses of nuclear energy. This was two years before the international “Atoms for Peace” conference held in Geneva in 1955, marking the dawn of the nuclear age.|$|E

While the paper relates and highlights the technical, professional and personnel difficulties which complicated production of the video by far the greatest challenge was change. A decentralisation of industrial relations {{in recent years and}} the likelihood of its acceleration brought into question the relevance of advocacy skills as part of the curriculum in industrial relations education. After months of re-assessment the video was completed because it was concluded that the skills of advocacy will remain relevant. It is argued, while the tribunal context of advocacy may decline (but not entirely disappear) the generic skills which comprise advocacy will also continue to have application in other <b>industrial</b> relations <b>forums</b> or contexts...|$|R
