5|$|Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut {{or broken}} DNA strands. Ligases are {{particularly}} important in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete copy of the <b>DNA</b> <b>template.</b> They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the <b>DNA</b> <b>template</b> to the polymerase.|$|E
5|$|RNAs are a type {{of large}} {{biological}} molecules, whose individual building blocks are called nucleotides. The name poly(A) tail (for polyadenylic acid tail) reflects the way RNA nucleotides are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (transcribed) from a <b>DNA</b> <b>template.</b> By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5' to 3' direction. The 5' end {{is the part of}} the RNA molecule that is transcribed first, and the 3' end is transcribed last. The 3' end is also where the poly(A) tail is found on polyadenylated RNAs.|$|E

5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a <b>DNA</b> <b>template</b> from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E

40|$|Three {{forms of}} DNA {{polymerase}} alpha [DNA nucleotidyltransferase (DNA-directed), EC 2. 7. 7. 7] were partially purified from the combined nuclear extract and postmicrosomal supernatant solution of synchronized HeLa cells. These enzymes, designated DNA polymerases alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3, {{on the basis}} of their order of elution from DEAE-Bio-Gel, differ in their abilities to utilize single-strand <b>DNA</b> <b>templates.</b> <b>DNA</b> polymerase alpha 2 has equal catalytic activities with activated and single-strand DNAs as template-primers. DNA polymerase alpha 1 has only partial catalytic activity with single-strand <b>DNA</b> <b>templates,</b> and <b>DNA</b> polymerase alpha 3 is essentially inactive with this template. Successive steps of hydrophobic affinity chromatography and phosphocellulose chromatography of DNA polymerase alpha 2 resolved the polymerase alpha activity and two protein factors (C 1 and C 2) that are required for its catalytic activity with a DNA template-primer that contains extended single-strand regions. In the absence of the factors, DNA polymerase alpha activity is measurable with activated but not single-strand <b>DNA</b> <b>templates.</b> In the presence of the C 1 and C 2 factors DNA polymerase alpha activity with single-strand <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> is restored to about 75 % of the catalytic activity of DNA polymerase alpha 2 with this template...|$|R

40|$|Automated DNA {{sequencing}} is {{an extremely}} valuable technique which requires very high quality <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> {{to be carried out}} successfully. While it has been possible to readily produce large numbers of such templates from M 13 or other single-stranded vectors for several years, the sequencing of double-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> using the ABI 373 DNA Sequencer has had a considerably lower success rate. We describe how the combination of a new fluorescent, dideoxy sequencing method, called cycle-sequencing, coupled with modifications to template isolation procedures based on Qiagen columns, makes fluorescent sequencing of double-stranded templates a reliable procedure. From a single five milliliter culture enough DNA can be isolated (up to 20 micrograms) to do 4 - 8 sequencing reactions, each of which yields 400 - 500 bases of high quality sequence data. These procedures make the routine use of double-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> a viable strategy in automated DNA sequencing projects...|$|R

25|$|Secondary {{structures}} in the DNA can result in folding or knotting of <b>DNA</b> <b>template</b> or primers, leading to decreased product yield {{or failure of the}} reaction. Hairpins, which consist of internal folds caused by base-pairing between nucleotides in inverted repeats within single-stranded DNA, are common secondary structures and may result in failed PCRs.|$|E
25|$|DNA polymerases require {{additional}} factors to support DNA replication. DNA polymerases have a semiclosed 'hand' structure, {{which allows the}} polymerase to load onto the DNA and begin translocating. This structure permits DNA polymerase to hold the single-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>template,</b> incorporate dNTPs at the active site, and release the newly formed double-stranded DNA.

40|$|For the {{site-specific}} labeling and {{modification of}} RNA by genetic alphabet expansion, {{we developed a}} PCR and transcription system using two hydrophobic unnatural base pairs: 7 -(2 -thienyl) -imidazo[4, 5 -b]pyridine (Ds) and 2 -nitro- 4 -propynylpyrrole (Px) as a third pair for PCR amplification and Ds and pyrrole- 2 -carbaldehyde (Pa) for the incorporation of functional components as modified Pa bases into RNA by T 7 transcription. To prepare Ds-containing <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> with long chains, the Ds-Px pair was utilized in a fusion PCR method, by which we demonstrated the synthesis of 282 -bp <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> containing Ds at specific positions. Using these Ds-containing <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> and a biotin-linked Pa substrate (Biotin-PaTP) as a modified Pa base, 260 -mer RNA transcripts containing Biotin-Pa at a specific position were generated by T 7 RNA polymerase.

Each reaction tube contained 2  μL of <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> and was tested using real-time PCR and conventional PCR. Standard DNA and the negative control samples were amplified three times each. The concentrations of standard <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> for conventional PCR and real-time PCR were the same. PCR products were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis.|$|R
25|$|PCNA fully encircles the <b>DNA</b> <b>template</b> strand {{and must}} be loaded onto DNA at the {{replication}} fork. At the leading strand, loading of the PCNA is an infrequent process, because DNA replication on the leading strand is continuous until replication is terminated. However, at the lagging strand, DNA polymerase δ needs to be continually loaded {{at the start of}} each Okazaki fragment. This constant initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis requires repeated PCNA loading for efficient DNA replication.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{proofreading}} {{mechanisms of}} DNA polymerase {{those of the}} RNA variety have only recently been investigated. Proofreading begins with separation of the mis-incorporated nucleotide from the <b>DNA</b> <b>template.</b> This pauses transcription. The polymerase then backtracks by one position and cleaves the dinucleotide that contains the mismatched nucleotide. In the RNA polymerase this occurs at the same active site used for polymerization and is therefore markedly different from the DNA polymerase where proofreading occurs at a distinct nuclease active site.|$|E
25|$|Asymmetric PCR: {{preferentially}} amplifies one DNA strand in a double-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>template.</b> It {{is used in}} sequencing and hybridization probing where amplification of {{only one}} of the two complementary strands is required. PCR is carried out as usual, but with a great excess of the primer for the strand targeted for amplification. Because of the slow (arithmetic) amplification later in the reaction after the limiting primer has been used up, extra cycles of PCR are required. A recent modification on this process, known as Linear-After-The-Exponential-PCR (LATE-PCR), uses a limiting primer with a higher melting temperature (Tm) than the excess primer to maintain reaction efficiency as the limiting primer concentration decreases mid-reaction.|$|E

40|$|The effect Of C- 60 on DNA {{replication}} {{in vitro}} was studied by a quantitative real-time {{polymerase chain reaction}} (QPCR) system using a designed 110 bp single-stranded <b>DNA</b> as the <b>template.</b> The {{results indicated that the}} efficiency of QPCR can be dramatically enhanced by C- 60 {{at the beginning of the}} exponential phase, and that QPCR production can be significantly inhibited by C- 60 at later cycles or at the plateau, which is the period represented by an interesting inverted U-shaped time response curve. TWO different sized double-stranded DNA fragments (110 bp and 60 bp) were used to investigate the possible interaction between C- 60 and DNA. The melting curve results showed that C- 60 significantly decreased the melting temperatures (Tm) of the DNA fragments. By changing the concentrations of the initial <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> Or C- 60 in the QPCR system, we found that the decreased Tm value of <b>DNA</b> <b>templates</b> by C- 60 is the primary reason for the increased QPCR efficiency. Our findings are consistent with the conclusions of other studies that C- 60 can disrupt DNA replication in vitro by binding to DNA and changing the conformation of <b>DNA</b> <b>templates.</b> (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
25|$|To {{strengthen}} {{the interaction between}} the polymerase and the template DNA, DNA sliding clamps associate with the polymerase to promote the processivity of the replicative polymerase. In eukaryotes, the sliding clamp is a homotrimer ring structure known as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The PCNA ring has polarity with surfaces that interact with DNA polymerases and tethers them securely to the <b>DNA</b> <b>template.</b> PCNA-dependent stabilization of DNA polymerases has a significant effect on DNA replication because PCNAs are able to enhance the polymerase processivity up to 1,000-fold. PCNA is an essential cofactor and has the distinction of being {{one of the most common}} interaction platforms in the replisome to accommodate multiple processes at the replication fork, and so PCNA is also viewed as a regulatory cofactor for DNA polymerases.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} for measuring mRNA abundance is RT-qPCR. In this technique, reverse transcription {{is followed by}} quantitative PCR. Reverse transcription first generates a <b>DNA</b> <b>template</b> from the mRNA; this single-stranded template is called cDNA. The cDNA template is then amplified in the quantitative step, during which the fluorescence emitted by labeled hybridization probes or intercalating dyes changes as the DNA amplification process progresses. With a carefully constructed standard curve, qPCR can produce an absolute measurement {{of the number of}} copies of original mRNA, typically in units of copies per nanolitre of homogenized tissue or copies per cell. qPCR is very sensitive (detection of a single mRNA molecule is theoretically possible), but can be expensive {{depending on the type of}} reporter used; fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes are more expensive than non-specific intercalating fluorescent dyes.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of PCR methods rely on thermal cycling, which involves exposing the reactants to cycles of repeated heating and cooling, permitting different temperature-dependent reactions—specifically, DNA melting and enzyme-driven DNA replication—to quickly proceed many times in sequence. Primers (short DNA fragments) containing sequences complementary to the target region, along with a DNA polymerase, after which the method is named, enable selective and repeated amplification. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the original <b>DNA</b> <b>template</b> is exponentially amplified. The simplicity of the basic principle underlying PCR means it can be extensively modified to perform {{a wide array of}} genetic manipulations. PCR is not generally considered to be a recombinant DNA method, as it does not involve cutting and pasting DNA, only amplification of existing sequences.|$|E
