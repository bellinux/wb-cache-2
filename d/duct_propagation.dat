3000|$|In this connection, it is {{interesting}} to consider that the detection footprints of the various techniques may have a counterintuitive trend—that higher-altitude surveys may sample a smaller area. Specifically, the extremely low frequency (ELF) (~[*] 100  Hz) whistler-mode electromagnetic detections from orbit sample only an area connected to the spacecraft by appropriate ionospheric and magnetic field conditions and so may sense a range of only a couple of hundred kilometers from the subspacecraft point. However, very low frequency (VLF) (10 – 80  kHz) measurements by descent probes at low altitude may detect discharges at ranges of thousands of kilometers, due to <b>ducted</b> <b>propagation</b> by super-refraction in the lower atmosphere (Croft 1983) and/or by “skybounce”—reflection from the ionosphere (e.g., Simões et al. 2008)—see also discussion in Ksanfomality et al.

40|$|The transmission, mode conversion, and {{reflection}} of HM-waves associated with short-period geomagnetic pulsations through {{and by the}} ionosphere are comparatively examined for three different model cases, bearing in mind the localized injection of the shear Alfven wave at high latitude and the consequent horizontal spread of disturbances to low-latitude regions through the <b>ducted</b> <b>propagation</b> in the upper ionosphere. In the first model case composed of two semiinfinite layers (the magnetosphere and the neutral atmosphere) with a separating interface (the ionospheric E-layer with anisotropic conductivities), we have studied conductivity dependences of the transmission of magnetic signals of the shear Alfven and the fast magnetosonic waves respectively, propagating down along vertical field lines and having a periodic horizontal structure. For the Alfven wave incidence with the static electric field the transmitted magnetic signal intensity has a peak against the Hall conductivity variation, while it rather decreases as the Pedersen conductivity increases. We have also shown that the ionosphere behaves as a shielding metalic conductor for the incidence of the fast magnetosonic wave with the inductive electric field. In the second model case consisting of five layers, i. e. a magnetospheric region, an upper ionosphere as a trapping region, an interface (E-region), an atmospheric region, and a semi-infinite solid earth, we have dealt with ionospheric effects on a localized incidence of the shear Alfven wave. A comparison of magnetic signal intensities at the levels just {{above and below the}} E-layer leads us to conclude that the behaviour of magnetic signals in a near-source region is similar to that obtained in the first model case without a trapping region, and that the dominating direct source of ground magnetic fields is the induced eddy Hall current in the ionosphere. Finally, the ionospheric shielding effect in a distant region from the injection source has been estimated by employing the third model of the <b>ducted</b> <b>propagation</b> of the fast magnetosonic wave in the upper ionosphere. We conclude that the ionospheric screening is rather significant in the source region when the Pedersen to Hall conductivity ratio is much larger than unity while it is not so significant in the intermediate and distant regions...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{understanding}} {{of the effects of}} acoustic treatment on the propagation of sound through commercial aircraft engine nacelles is a requirement for more efficient liner design. To this end, one of NASA s goals is to further the development of <b>duct</b> <b>propagation</b> and impedance reduction codes. A number of these codes have been developed over the last three decades. These codes are typically divided into two categories: (1) codes that use the measured complex acoustic pressure field to reduce the acoustic impedance of treatment that is positioned along the wall of the duct, and (2) codes that use the acoustic impedance of the treatment as input and compute the sound field throughout the duct. Clearly, the value of these codes is dependent upon the quality of the data used for their validation. Over the past two decades, data acquired in the NASA Langley Research Center Grazing Incidence Tube have been used by a number of researchers for comparison with their propagation codes. Many of these comparisons have been based upon Grazing Incidence Tube tests that were conducted to study specific liner technology components, and were incomplete for general propagation code validation. Thus, the objective of the current investigation is to provide a quality data set that {{can be used as a}} benchmark for evaluation of <b>duct</b> <b>propagation</b> and impedance reduction codes. In order to achieve this objective, two parallel efforts have been undertaken.

The second key effort is the acquisition of a comprehensive set of data selected to allow propagation code evaluations over a range of test conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} we have {{estimated}} radio wave propagation losses at SHF band by applying available propagation models into several Air Force benchmark scenarios. The study shows that dominantly additional losses over the free space loss are atmospheric absorption, clouds, fog, and precipitation, as well as scintillation /multipath at low elevation angles. The free space loss equation has been modzjied to include all atmospheric attenuation and fading effects that cannot be neglected over the range of frequency of interest. Terrain profiles along all directions of interest within the coastal areas and inland areas for four benchmark cases have been analyzed in detail. We find that while the atmospheric gaseous absorption {{plays a significant role}} under a clear weather, heavy rainfalls can cause several tens of dB loss for a 100 -km path through the rain.

40|$|Propagation effects {{degrade the}} {{performance}} of active sonar systems operating in either deep or shallow water. The ocean medium distorts the transmitted signals by time dispersion and as a result, the performance (signal-to-noise ratio) of correlation receivers is reduced if the receiver {{does not account for}} energy spreading. Results from this study demonstrate that {{the performance of}} a conventional matched filter can be improved if the reference (replica) channel compensates for the distortion. A model-based matched filter is generated by correlating the received signal with a reference channel that consists of the transmitted signal convolved with the impulse response of the medium. The channel impulse responses are predicted with a broadband propagation model using in situ sound speed measured data and archival bottom loss data. The relative performance of conventional and model-based matched filter processing is compared for large time-bandwidth product linear frequency modulated signals propagating in a dispersive waveguide. From <b>ducted</b> <b>propagation</b> measurements conducted in an area west of Sardinia, the model-based matched filter localizes the depths of both the source and receiving array and the range between them.

40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} on the discovery of fine structure in whistler data received {{on the ground at}} Halley, Antarctica. This structure was not apparent in conventional spectral analysis but was revealed by the technique of digital matched filtering. We have now examined a larger data set, and a commonly observed phenomenon is that single whistler traces become split into two, over various frequency ranges. Examples are presented in the form of time-transformed spectrograms in which reference model whistlers are represented as vertical lines. The splitting is typically 5 – 15 ms (about 0. 5 % of the total whistler travel time) and extends over frequency ranges of a few hundred hertz which may occur anywhere between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies of the whistler. The splitting may be either symmetrical or unsymmetrical with respect to the unsplit trace. The effect is unlikely to arise in the spectrum of the lightning source or from propagation under or through the ionosphere. It may, however, be a signature of field-aligned fine spatial structure in plasmaspheric density, and hence refractive index, in the whistler duct. For simple longitudinal propagation, electron density fluctuations of the order of 1 % and spatial scale sizes of the order of 50 km in the equatorial plane are implied.

Acoustic transmissions were carried out from an anchored vessel using 620 Hz transducer and received by an array of hydrophones moored at ~ 5 km away from the anchorage. Thermal structure in this region was characterised by a tri-layer structure, ie, a strong thermocline (> 0. 4 oC/m) sandwiched between an upper ( 25 m) homogeneous layer. High-resolution (sampled at 10 s interval) temperature data from moored sensors revealed intense internal wave activity. The maximum value of Brunt-Vaisala frequency, which is the maximum frequency limit of internal waves in the thermocline, suggests that the upper frequency limit of the internal wave, which can be generated during this period, is 23 cph (2. 6 min). High and low frequency waves caused variations of ~ 3 oC and ~ 5 oC respectively in the temperature field. But the low frequency internal waves were found to contain maximum energy compared to the high frequency waves.

Engebretson et al. (2015) recently reported intense EMIC waves extending over 12 -h MLTs using combined ground and satellite measurements. The PWING magnetometers can provide the opportunity to monitor the spatial extent of such waves on a routine basis.
