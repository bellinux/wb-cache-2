A lack of digital leadership in the age of <b>digital</b> <b>transformation</b> has also stifled innovation and IoT adoption to a degree that many companies, in the face of uncertainty, [...] "were waiting for the market dynamics to play out", or further action in regards to IoT [...] "was pending competitor moves, customer pull, or regulatory requirements."

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>transformations</b> are not {{contained}} within the digital domain but are increasingly spilling over into the physical world. In this chapter, we analyse some of the transformations undergoing in cities today towards becoming smart cities. We offer a critique of smart cities and a way forward, divided into three parts: First, we explore the concept of Smart Citizens {{in terms of both}} localities, the move towards a hyperlocal network and also the citizen’s role in the creation and use of data. We use the ‘Smart London’ plan drawn up by the Mayor of London, as a way to illustrate our discussion. Second, we turn to the civic innovations enabled by <b>digital</b> <b>transformations</b> and their potential impact on citizens and citizenship. Specifically, we are interested in the notion of social capital as an alternative form of in-kind currency and its function as an indicator of value, in order to ask, can <b>digital</b> <b>transformations</b> give rise to ‘civic capital,’ and how can such a concept help, for instance, a local government invite more representative residents and community champions to participate in community engagement for better urban planning. Third, we introduce a hybrid, location-based game under development by design agency Preliminal Games in London, UK. This illustrative case critiques and highlights the current challenges to establishing a new economic model that bridges the digital / physical divide. The game provides a vehicle for us to explore how established principles and strategies in game design such as immersive storytelling and goal setting, can be employed to encourage players to think of the interconnections of their hybrid digital / physical environments in new ways...|$|R

30|$|It {{follows that}} {{companies}} in their particular <b>digital</b> <b>transformations</b> should reflect on themselves as software organizations.

Moreover, they should also be frequently revisited, because digitalization is continuously shaping competitive environments, while the development of organizational capabilities may take time.|$|R

30|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>transformations</b> are a {{cause of}} rapid and even {{disruptive}} change in a majority of companies and future competitive environments. Fundamentally novel models for organizations and businesses (like Uber-type) are emerging, and traditional companies as well must consider their structure and their roles in achieving new business goals. Both the software producer organization and the customer viewpoints should be understood via comprehensive sense making. Companies now begin to focus on software – either following strategy, or ad hoc, when forced by competitive pressure imposed on them by digitalization.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} and {{elaborate}} our initial ideas presented in [4]. We compile {{a set of}} competence development and resource impact mapping grids to address those research propositions. The key idea is to define what (goals), why (purpose), and how (roles) future successful software organizations perform. Our research approach is design science. The purpose of this design-scientific work is to construct actionable artefacts (the grids) for future software organizations facing <b>digital</b> <b>transformations.</b> We validate them by informed arguments and our real-life empirical experiences. Different industrial companies can then compare and relate their situational conditions and transformation circumstances towards software-intensity accordingly.|$|R

Software organizations should realize the impact that this expansion in the roles of software has in their specific <b>digital</b> <b>transformations</b> {{in order to be able}} determine and assess the future customer value constellations – which may be radically different from the traditional ones [16, 17].|$|R
