5|$|Further {{calculations}} of this ilk combine {{to show that}} the number of <b>essentially</b> different Sudoku grids is 5,472,730,538, for example as demonstrated by Jarvis / Russell and verified by Pettersen. Similar methods have been applied to the 2x3 case, where Jarvis / Russell showed that there are 49 <b>essentially</b> different grids (see also the article by Bailey, Cameron and Connelly), to the 2x4 case, where Russell showed that there are 1,673,187 <b>essentially</b> different grids (verified by Pettersen), and to the 2x5 case where Pettersen showed that there are 4,743,933,602,050,718 <b>essentially</b> different grids (not verified).|$|E

5|$|By early 1947, the {{military}} decided to transfer future radar training operations to Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi. The {{departure of the}} air force in 1947 would leave Boca Raton Army Airfield <b>essentially</b> abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Dakshinachara {{lineages}} generally prefer internal worship (meditative techniques, etc.) and <b>essentially</b> {{disapprove of}} the panchamakara under any circumstances.|$|E
5|$|From 1941 until 1976, {{when it was}} discontinued, the Model DU {{spectrophotometer}} {{was built}} upon what was <b>essentially</b> the same design. It was a single beam instrument.|$|E

5|$|In May 2016, The Washington Post <b>essentially</b> {{replicated}} the Annenberg poll, {{getting the}} same results. While attempting {{to address some of}} the flaws in the earlier poll it received many of the same criticisms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ancient}} Olympic Games, {{as well as}} the other Panhellenic Games, there were both four-horse (tethrippon, Greek: τέθριππον) and two-horse (synoris, Greek: συνωρὶς) chariot races, which were <b>essentially</b> the same aside from the number of horses.|$|E
5|$|In these {{examples}} the automorphisms {{are easy to}} identify, but in general automorphism is not always obvious. The table at right shows {{the number of the}} <b>essentially</b> different Sudoku solution grids for all existing automorphisms.|$|E
5|$|Law {{professor}} Lawrence Lessig cited {{this passage}} {{to argue that}} in creating a system of copyrights in which control of music {{is in the hands}} of record labels, Sousa was <b>essentially</b> correct.|$|E
5|$|Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it {{gradually}} renders people incapable of tending {{for their own}} needs, caregiving is <b>essentially</b> the treatment and must be carefully managed {{over the course of}} the disease.|$|E
5|$|Speed: This {{level of}} {{training}} addresses the athlete's ability to sprint and is neuromuscular, <b>essentially</b> training the muscles to move quickly.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently the British edition was {{released}} in the US <b>essentially</b> unchanged, with a cover date delayed by one month, starting with issue 99 (October 1960).|$|E
5|$|Suggestions for etymologies of {{the name}} are <b>essentially</b> divided between a Celtic and a Germanic origin.|$|E
5|$|The Bobtail is <b>essentially</b> {{the front}} of a {{tractor-trailer}} combo. The Bobtail has all the equipment typically seen on the truck of a tractor/trailer set up.|$|E
5|$|The DNA codon {{table is}} <b>essentially</b> {{identical}} to that for RNA, but with U replaced by T.|$|E
5|$|The Flatbed is <b>essentially</b> {{a trailer}} without the {{enclosed}} portion on the back. The back or bed is flat and open. These are {{often referred to}} as Stake Beds.|$|E
5|$|The Hotshot vehicle or {{truck is}} <b>essentially</b> a pick-up {{with a larger}} load {{capacity}} than a personal truck. Hotshots are typically single axle 1-ton to 3-ton trucks, which can be either a dual or single tire.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{system of}} copyhold, which prevailed {{throughout}} the East End, into the 19th century. <b>Essentially,</b> {{there was little}} point in developing land that was held on short leases.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{distinct}} solutions {{can also be}} identified with Burnside's Lemma. For a solution, the set of equivalent solutions which can be reached using these operations (excluding relabeling), form an orbit of the symmetric group. The number of <b>essentially</b> different solutions is then the number of orbits, which can be computed using Burnside's lemma. The Burnside fixed points are solutions that differ only by relabeling. Using this technique, Jarvis/Russell computed the number of <b>essentially</b> different (symmetrically distinct) solutions as 5,472,730,538.|$|E
5|$|The {{surnames}} Stewart and Stuart denote <b>essentially</b> {{the same}} occupation {{but have a}} completely different word derivation. They originate from the pre-7th-century English words stigweard—a compound of stig meaning household—and weard, a guardian.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} so {{completely}} damaged {{that it had}} to be <b>essentially</b> rebuilt. Damage claims exceeded $300,000 ($7million in 2006 dollars), however, damages may have been as high as $600,000 ($14million in 2006 dollars).|$|E
5|$|Which {{of the two}} ovaries—left or right—ovulates appears <b>essentially</b> random; {{no known}} left and right {{co-ordination}} exists. Occasionally, both ovaries will release an egg; if both eggs are fertilized, the result is fraternal twins.|$|E

5|$|Africa Check, a {{non-profit}} organisation that checks facts in claims made about Africa, and the Centre for the Study of Democracy have criticised polls by market research companies as unscientific. Africa Check warned that some polls are intentionally misleading {{and some are}} <b>essentially</b> conjecture.|$|E
5|$|After Liliʻuokalani {{was imprisoned}} in the ʻIolani Palace, she was denied {{literature}} and newspapers, <b>essentially</b> cutting her {{off from her}} people. However, she was not forbidden from having a paper and pencil, so she could continue to compose music {{while she was in}} confinement.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only used}} for spares after being retired from test flying and trials work in 1981, Concorde G-BBDG was {{dismantled}} and transported by road from Filton then restored from <b>essentially</b> a shell at the Brooklands Museum in Surrey, where it remains open to {{visitors to the}} museum.|$|E
5|$|Around 1200, {{the rules}} of shatranj started to be {{modified}} in southern Europe, and around 1475, several major changes made the game <b>essentially</b> {{as it is known}} today. These modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in Italy and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{regarded}} {{his series}} of sermons on the Seven Seals in 1963 as {{a highlight of}} his ministry. In reality, Branham's teaching on this subject revealed very little new doctrine and was <b>essentially</b> a laborious restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages.|$|E
5|$|Dislocation {{diffusion}} {{occurs when}} adjacent sub-units of a cluster {{move in a}} row-by-row fashion through displacement of a dislocation. As shown in figure 11(a) the process begins with nucleation of the dislocation followed by what is <b>essentially</b> sequential displacement on a concerted basis.|$|E
5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, Airbus considered propfan technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it was <b>essentially</b> a fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering {{speed of a}} turbofan at turboprops economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{leadership}} campaign, Stelmach, along with Oberg, Hancock, and Norris, organized two $5,000 per plate dinners in January 2007 to pay campaign debts.

5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained <b>essentially</b> {{the same as the}} Alpine's.
