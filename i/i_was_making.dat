5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It {{just felt}} like everything got a little soft the second time. On Batman Forever, I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> a movie. The second time, I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> a kid's toy commercial." [...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable {{than the one he}} wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for the}} film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Nile Rodgers {{was chosen}} by Madonna as the {{producer}} of the album, {{with the approval of}} the Warner Brothers executives. Madonna chose Rodgers mostly because of his work {{as a member of the}} seventies band Chic, and his most recent production work with David Bowie on his 1983 album Let's Dance. She commented, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> the record, I was just so thrilled and happy to be working with Nile Rodgers. I idolized Nile because of the whole Chic thing. I couldn't believe that the record company gave me the money so that I could work with him." ...|$|E

500|$|Certain musicians {{influenced}} Ranaldo's songwriting including Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen and Cat Power, {{which he}} referred to as [...] "a kind of older generation of songwriting." [...] He also mentioned Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde (1966) as a particular influence. Ranaldo stated that [...] "these songs were allowed to breathe because they weren't sent through the fan machine. When Sonic Youth writes music, we write everything in a very communal way. It doesn't matter who brought something in initially, it all gets transformed by the band. In this case, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> decisions, and I wanted {{them to have a}} certain kind of simplicity. They ended up more personal for that reason." ...|$|E
500|$|Alois {{had made}} a {{successful}} career in the customs bureau, and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event {{that gave rise to}} an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed. Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900. Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw [...] "what little progress <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream".|$|E
500|$|The puzzles, {{according}} to Broady, were of uneven quality. He called some [...] "hopelessly difficult" [...] and others extremely derivative. By contrast, he viewed the Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton dialogue puzzle as [...] "brilliant", but said, [...] "Ideas as original as Horse's call for puzzles to match, not rehashes of things we've seen {{far too many}} times already." [...] Ramsey thought the puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, arguing [...] "on almost every occasion I felt that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> progress, and I never felt bogged down and hopelessly lost." [...] He felt the puzzles were mostly well-integrated, and found those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment. Ivey remarked, [...] "For puzzle lovers, Drowned God is a treasure trove. ...

500|$|Usher and Diplo {{worked on}} the song's {{production}} for two months, recording in studios in Los Angeles, New York, and Atlanta. Diplo originally pursued a house music sound based on a chord progression he wrote, but changed his direction after working in the recording studio alone on {{what he called a}} [...] "wildfire" [...] beat. He later said of his direction for the song, [...] "the idea of pushing cut-off on a synth used so much in progressive house music but pulling back. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> something like a minimal techno record with Atlanta strip clubs in mind." [...] According to Diplo, Usher proposed the idea of [...] "tak the strip club to the stadium" [...] with the song's production. Classical music composer Nico Muhly contributed with the song's string arrangement.|$|E

Sims would later explain, [...] "most people wait [...] until after they've grown up—and then it's too late." [...] That same year, clogger Ira Bernstein received an NEA Folk Arts Apprenticeship grant [...] "o study traditional lack tap dance with master dancer Howard 'Sandman' Sims." [...] Sims loved to teach; his son recounted how Sandman would [...] "stop every kid he saw and show them a step and get them to copy a step.

500|$|According to Kano, {{the editor}} in chief of Rockin'On Japan, he stated that the lyrical content {{discusses}} themes of mystery and daily life actions; he furthered believed that the song's lyrics is an open interpretation, due to its lack of major characteristics and identified philosophy and religion as examples. In an interview that promoted her fifth Japanese studio album Ultra Blue (2005) and her single [...] "Passion", which is the follow to [...] "Hikari", Utada felt the writing process was difficult. She believed that the plot to Kingdom Hearts was soulless, and was unable to become inspired by it to write the song. She further explained; [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> the song 'Hikari', the whole outlook for the game and its entry onto the world was so crucial that I got a lot more info on the characters (so that 'Hikari' would mirror the image that they wanted)." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{beginning}} {{work on her}} then-untitled third studio album, Stefani sought {{inspiration from}} her personal life in order to write lyrics for new material. She noted:... I was also in a really desperate place doing This Is What The Truth Feels Like, and I wasn’t back {{to a place of}} naiveté and purity. It was, 'All I have left right now is my music. And if I do that, maybe I’ll survive.' So, the way Tragic Kingdom was pure, this new record was pure. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> this record because it’s all I could do to save my own life. She described this as a magical process. Immediately following the completion of [...] "Make Me Like You", Stefani wrote [...] "Misery" [...] with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson; however, unlike the recording sessions for her previous albums, the songwriting process was significantly shorter, which she opined was because everything should be simple. [...] "Misery" [...] was recorded by Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson of Mattman & Robin at Wolf Cousins Studios and Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California. Additional recording was handled by Juan Carlos Torrado and Noah Passovoy, while Serban Ghenea mixed the audio at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.|$|E
500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Publishers such as Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Majesco Entertainment {{continued}} to release exclusive titles for the console, but the Wii's strongest titles remained within its first-party line-up. Analysts speculated {{that this would}} change in time as the Wii's growing popularity persuaded third-party publishers to focus on it; however, some third party developers expressed frustration at low software sales. Goichi Suda, developer of No More Heroes for the Wii, noted that [...] "only Nintendo titles are doing well. This isn't {{just because of the}} current situation in Japan, as this is happening outside Japan. I am very surprised about the reality about Wii, because before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> this game, I wasn't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non-gamers. I expected more games for hardcore gamers. The reality is different to what I expected." [...] Conversely, the PAL publisher of No More Heroes Rising Star Games were greatly impressed with the game's sales. Goichi Suda later retracted his comment, saying his [...] "point was that No More Heroes, unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product that will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware, i.e. gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products that have been successful on this platform thus far." ...|$|E

500|$|Oakley, Inc. {{provided}} the red-lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a customized {{version of the}} company's own X-Metal Juliet. Wolverine's claws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were built so he could easily put them on and take them off for safety reasons. Production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer Gordon Smith refused to do it. Production also insisted on real metal blades, which Smith also refused to do, making injection-moulded plaster blades instead. Hundreds of pairs were built for Jackman and his stunt doubles. Rebecca's wore 110 individual silicone prosthetic, Only the edges were glued, the rest were self-sticking. The prosthetics were built flat and wrapped her body. They were internally colored with food coloring and needed additional makeup or paint. The original agreed to and tested design was, to color her skin with cosmetic grade food coloring as well, which looked remarkable, says Gordon Smith, {{but at the last}} minute Bryan Singer insisted on painting her skin to look opaque, as in the comic book, which added 6 hours to the makeup, making the ordeal very difficult for her. [...] There were also no facilities provided to exhaust paint fumes, during one of Canada's colder winters. Romijn reflected, [...] "I had almost no contact {{with the rest of the}} cast; it was like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> a different movie from everyone else. It was hell." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>making</b> came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E
