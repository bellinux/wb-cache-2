25|$|Construction {{of a new}} {{and even}} more {{formidable}} defence line began 25km south of Ngaruawahia, soon after the fall of Rangiriri. The line included fortifications at Pikopiko and Rangiatea and was centered on Paterangi, its largest pā, and was designed to block the main approaches to the agriculturally rich Rangiaowhia district, east of Te Awamutu, a major economic base and supply centre of the Kingite tribes. By the end of January 1864 the line had become the largest system of Māori fortifications of the land wars, consisting of at least four large pā spaced about 8km apart, each of which included complex sets of entrenchments and parapets.

25|$|The society held {{monthly meeting}} to discuss new books, share folklore, deliver presentations, debate on ways to stop Germanization. The {{meetings}} took place not only in Tilsit, but also in Memel (Klaipėda), Coadjuthen (Katyčiai), Kaukehmen (Jasnoje), Ragnit (Neman), Lasdehnen (Krasnoznamensk), Schmalleningken (Smalininkai). The number of attendees grew <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> to 300. However, the quality of presentations and discussions was limited by lack of education among Birutė's members, most of whom only had primary education. In {{one of the early}} meetings, Vilius Bruožis, future chairman of the society, spoke for three hours trying to prove that the Lithuanian language was spoken in the Garden of Eden. The society considered and took tentative steps to establish Lithuanian-language schools, publish books (including a history of Lithuania that would incorporate the history of Lithuania Minor), its own newspaper, or calendars, but those plans were not realized. The society considered but rejected the idea of taking over the publication of bankrupt Aušra. Instead, it financially supported (15 marks per month) the short-lived newspaper Garsas published by Jankus. In 1888, the society officially dropped book publication from its goals and reduced the number of meetings to once a quarter. In total, between 1885 and 1888, the society held about 30 meetings.|$|E

500|$|The Representation of the People Act 1832 (known informally as the 1832 Reform Act, Great Reform Act or First Reform Act to {{distinguish}} it from subsequent Reform Acts) was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom (indexed as 2 & 3 Will.

According to its preamble, the Act was designed to [...] "take effectual Measures for correcting divers Abuses that have long prevailed in the Choice of Members {{to serve in the}} Commons House of Parliament". Before the reform, most members nominally represented boroughs. The number of electors in a borough varied widely, <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or so up to 12,000. Frequently the selection of MPs was effectively controlled by one powerful patron: for example Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk controlled eleven boroughs. Criteria for qualification for the franchise varied greatly among boroughs, from the requirement to own land, to merely living in a house with a hearth sufficient to boil a pot.|$|E

[...] Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Stop-motion animation may be the hardest and most tedious job in Hollywood, but the makers of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride deserve a couple of years in Tahiti celebrating their effort."

[...] Lisa Rose of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Corpse Bride offers unclassifiable enchantment." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "As animated films go, this is easily the best of a weak year." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "If his The Nightmare Before Christmas <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> years back was a treat for the eyes and mind, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride goes double or nothing by being a delight for the ears and also the heart."

2500|$|In 1982, Southwark Council leased the Wood to London Wildlife Trust {{to manage}} as a nature reserve. In 1984 Southwark Council’s Mid/South Southwark Local Plan {{included}} proposals for blocks {{of up to}} 146 flats on the top part of the Wood. London Wildlife Trust's Southwark Wildlife Group ran a [...] "Save the Woods" [...] campaign backed by West Lewisham MP John Maples and other local MPs. Dulwich MP Gerald Bowden asked the Secretary of State for the Environment to intervene. A full-page Evening Standard article set the scene for a New Year public inquiry into the Plan. The January inquiry heard evidence <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> ecologists on the Wood's wildlife diversity, other witnesses describing the Wood’s educational and amenity value, visited the site and listened to views from several hundred {{members of the public}} at an evening meeting at Kingswood House. Southwark MP Simon Hughes spoke in favour of saving the wood in the House of Commons. Further, Dulwich College Estates applied for planning permission to build 36 flats on the site of Beechgrove House. In July, the Local Plan inspector reported that most of the Wood should be protected from development. The written report was published in the same week that Southwark Council’s planning committee rejected the Beechgrove application. In advance of a public inquiry into the Beechgrove plans held in November 1986, Gerald Bowden MP said: [...] "I’ve never had quite such a wide range of ordinary people writing to me on one subject. There is very broad opposition to the flats." [...] The inspector's decision against the plan was hailed as [...] "Wood reprieve a policy precedent." [...] "The need to preserve areas of existing natural woodland within the urban areas is of as much importance in preserving our heritage and improving the quality of the environment as that of preserving the countryside," [...] the inspector said.|$|E
2500|$|From Josiah Gregg's journal, Commerce of the Prairies: [...] "Of all {{the prairie}} animals, {{by far the}} most curious, and by no means the least celebrated, is the little prairie dog. ...The flesh, though often eaten by travelers, is not esteemed savory. It was {{denominated}} the 'barking squirrel', the 'prairie ground-squirrel', etc., by early explorers, with much more apparent propriety than the present established name. Its yelp, which resembles that of the little toy-dog, seems its only canine attribute. It rather appears to occupy a middle ground betwixt the rabbit and squirrel—like the former in feeding and burrowing — like the latter in frisking, flirting, sitting erect, and somewhat so in its barking. The prairie dog has been reckoned by some naturalists a species of the marmot (arctomys ludoviciana); yet it seems to possess scarce any other quality in common with this animal except that of burrowing. ...I have the concurrent testimony of several persons, who have been upon the Prairies in winter, that, like rabbits and squirrels, they issue from their holes every soft day; and therefore lay up no doubt a hoard of 'hay' (as there is rarely anything else {{to be found in the}} vicinity of their towns) for winter's use. A collection of their burrows has been termed by travelers a 'dog town,' which comprises <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> or so, to some thousands in the same vicinity; often covering an area of several square miles. They generally locate upon firm dry plains, coated with fine short grass, upon which they feed; for they are no doubt exclusively herbivorous. But even when tall coarse grass surrounds, they seem commonly to destroy this within their 'streets,' which are nearly always found 'paved' with a fine species suited to their palates. They must need but little water, if any at all, as their 'towns' are often, indeed generally, found in the midst of the most arid plains—unless we suppose they dig down to subterranean fountains. At least they evidently burrow remarkably deep. Attempts either to dig or drown them out of their holes have generally proved unsuccessful. Approaching a 'village,' the little dogs may be observed frisking about the 'streets'—passing from dwelling to dwelling apparently on visits—sometimes a few clustered together as though in council—here feeding upon the tender herbage—there cleansing their 'houses,' or brushing the little hillock about the door—yet all quiet. Upon seeing a stranger, however, each streaks it to its home, but is apt to stop at the entrance, and spread the general alarm by a succession of shrill yelps, usually sitting erect. Yet at the report of a gun or the too near approach of the visitor, they dart down and are seen no more till the cause of alarm seems to have disappeared.|$|E
