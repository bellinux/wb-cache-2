40|$|This paper {{examines}} the long-term and short-term causal relationships between steel consumption and economic activity in Korea between 1975 and 2008 using vector error correction and vector autoregression models. This study disaggregates steel products and steel-consuming industries because {{the consumption of}} a specific steel product is {{closely linked to the}} output of the corresponding industry. This approach can provide a clear and reliable causal relationship between variable pairs. The results show that total steel consumption and GDP have a long-term equilibrium relationship, running from GDP to total steel consumption. However, a long-term bi-directional causal relationship exists between flat products consumption and the manufacturing GDP. Flat products consumption also demonstrates the long-term relationships between steel-consuming industries, such as automobile, shipbuilding, and <b>fabricated</b> <b>metal</b> <b>product,</b> but causal directions are mixed, depending on variable pairs. These results imply that the reciprocal growth between these industries has contributed to the robust competitiveness of Korean manufacturing.

30|$|Period 3 is {{regarded}} as a period of politically significant transitional moments, and the government of Indonesia began to remove subsidies for oil commodities. During period 3, the growth of TFP with CO 2 emissions over time dropped sharply compared with the previous period. Several sectors, particularly for the high energy-intensive sectors, might be negatively affected by the increase in prices of oil commodities. The TFP with CO 2 emissions over time of the high energy-intensive sectors: food and beverages; textiles and its related industry; chemicals and chemical product; rubber and plastics product; others non-metallic mineral product; and <b>fabricated</b> <b>metal</b> <b>product</b> and equipment sectors present considerable decline in this period. Only basic metals sector that shows insignificant decrease. The effort in reducing CO 2 emissions seems to have further pressures due to the increase in prices of oil commodities. A similarly worsened performance was also experienced by the TFP environment over time as the growth dramatically declined to reach a negative level. In contrast, TFP without CO 2 emissions over time indicated positive growth. Almost all of the sectors show a notable increase of this TFP, except for textiles and wearing apparel sectors.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a framework to estimate BC emissions from heavy-duty diesel trucks and trains engaged in transporting freight in the Midwestern and Northeastern United States (MNUS) from 1977 to 2007. We first expand on a previous development of a regional econometric input–output model (REIM) {{that has been used}} to estimate commodity flows between 13 states in the MNUS (plus the rest of the US) and 13 industrial sectors. These commodity flow data are then distributed over the MNUS using a stylized link-and-node network, which creates great circle transportation links between nodes in each state at the county with the largest population. Freight flows are converted to BC transportation emissions and the resulting BC emissions are compared to the MACCity BC emissions inventory. We find that from 1977 to 2007 potential emission growth from the continued increase in freight tonnage in the MWUS is counteracted by decreases in the BC emission factor of heavy-duty diesel trucks, which results in an overall decrease of BC emissions by 2007. One sector (<b>fabricated</b> <b>metal</b> <b>product</b> manufacturing) has dominated the BC transportation emissions throughout 1977 to 2007 with transportation emissions remaining relatively unchanged from 1977 to 1997 and then decreasing out to 2007. The BC transportation emissions are concentrated in and around the urban centers, which serve as transportation and production nodes for industrial manufacturing. Our BC emissions are distributed along stylized transportation corridors that are not well represented in emissions inventories that largely distribute emissions via a population proxy. The framework established in this study can be used to estimate future BC transportation emissions under a set of stylized economic, technological, and regulatory scenarios...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the labour cost {{competitiveness}} of <b>fabricated</b> <b>metal</b> industry in China and Finland in particular, using the corresponding German, the US and Estonian industries {{as a point of}} comparison in the early 2000 s. This study deepens the analysis of the earlier study of the cost competitiveness of the manufacturing industries in the same group of countries. Separate studies focusing on the labour cost competitiveness are carried out in a parallel manner on the paper and pulp and metal industries. The results of these three sector studies deepen the knowledge about the change of competitiveness and its level. Large unit labour cost differences in a common currency were obviously a key factor behind exceptionally rapidly changing international production and trade structures in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s. The Chinese <b>fabricated</b> <b>metal</b> industry grew by about 22 per cent per year in 2000 - 2007 as the average annual growth of the value added of world manufacturing volume was only 3 per cent in 2000 - 2006. Nominal wages as such do not imply good international competitiveness. Chinese wages are, however, low even if their low labour productivity is taken into account and costs per unit of production are compared in a common currency. The relative levels of the Chinese unit labour costs vis- 0 -vis Germany, using the unit value ratios (UVR) to make the production volumes comparable, were estimated to be about 2 per cent in the <b>fabricated</b> <b>metal</b> industry. The ratio has even declined in early 2000 s and has stayed relatively stable after that till 2007. Improving labour productivity in China had compensated for the effects of rapidly rising wages and an appreciating Renminbi. The outlook of the <b>fabricated</b> <b>metal</b> industry is clouded by the difficult global financial crisis, which strongly restricts export possibilities and dampens also the domestic markets of industry.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{has experienced}} remarkable {{growth in the}} past decade with applications in both rapid prototyping and rapid manufacturing for functional end-usable parts. As {{one of the most promising}} AM processes, selective laser melting (SLM) can be used to <b>fabricate</b> <b>metal</b> <b>products</b> line by line and layer upon layer within a powder bed system. Such process allows the building of parts with customized shapes, which brings higher design flexibility than traditional casting and wrought manufacturing. In this work, AlSi 10 Mg powder is chosen as the raw material for producing parts by SLM, since aluminum alloys are widely used in automotive and aerospace industries thanks to an excellent combination of low density and competitive mechanical properties. However, there remain multiple drawbacks which limit further applications of aluminum parts produced by SLM: lack of prediction of solidification microstructure, few studies on fatigue properties, and cost and time caused by the limited production rate. All these issues were studied in this work and summarized as follows: Rapid movement of the melt pool (at a speed around 1 m/s) in SLM of metal powder directly implies rapid solidification. In this research, the length scale of the as-built microstructure of parts built with the alloy AlSi 10 Mg was measured and compared with the well-known relationship between cell size and cooling rate. Cooling rates during solidification were estimated using the Rosenthal equation. It was found that the solidification structure is the expected cellular combination of silicon with α-aluminum. The dependence of the measured cell spacing on the calculated cooling rate follows the well-established relationship for aluminum alloys. The implication is that cell spacing can be manipulated by changing the heat input. Microscopy of polished sections through particles of the metal powder used to build the parts showed that the particles have a dendritic-eutectic structure; the dendrite arm spacings in metal powder particles of different diameters were measured and also agree with literature correlations, showing the expected increase in secondary dendrite arm spacing with increasing particle diameter. It is well-known that the fatigue behavior of cast aluminum alloy parts is largely determined by the internal defects, particularly pores and inclusions, such as oxides. This study shows that such imperfections are also present in AlSi 10 Mg parts produced by SLM, and serve as sites for failure initiation. The effect of hatch spacing and building orientation on tensile and fatigue properties was tested. Similar defects were found both on polished cross-sections and on fracture surfaces. The results imply that the oxide-driven pores dominate the fatigue resistance of the samples in this work. The larger oxide particles which are associated with the crack initiation likely form by oxidation of metal vapor during part manufacture. Residual porosity in parts produced by SLM mainly results from lack-of-fusion, entrapped gas, pores left in powder, evaporation of elements, and collapse of key-holes. Lack-of-fusion porosity is caused by the the insufficient overlap of melt pools in powder bed fusion and is particularly detrimental to fatigue performance due to the stress concentration at the sharp edges of the pores. The third part of this work deals with predicting lack-of-fusion porosity quantitatively by a geometrically-based model and designing processing parameters for build rate improvement without introducing porosity. The inputs into the simulation are hatch spacing, layer thickness, melt-pool cross-sectional area, and hatch rotation angle. Comparison with several data sets from the literature shows that the simulations correctly predict process conditions at which lack-of-fusion porosity becomes apparent, as well as the rate at which porosity increases with changes in process conditions such as beam speed, layer thickness, and hatch spacing. Relative to the default processing parameters provided by the manufacturer, the build rate can be improved by adjusting hatch spacing and layer thickness, and increasing the platform temperature. The simulations also show that the volume fraction of lack-of-fusion porosity is independent of hatch rotation angle. A unique combination of zero rotation and half hatch spacing as the beam offset between adjacent layers is proposed for build rate optimization...|$|R
