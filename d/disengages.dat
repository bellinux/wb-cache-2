25|$|The JetStick, {{designed}} by Control Engineering, Inc., {{was first used}} in 1998. The computer-integrated design allows the skipper to control and dock the boat {{through the use of}} a joystick. To use the JetStick the driver pushes a button to engage docking mode, this in turn <b>disengages</b> the wheel while a computer determines the amount of bow thruster and jet needed to move the boat sideways.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the vehicle}} has {{completed}} {{the shift to}} second gear, the first gear is immediately de-selected, and third gear (being on the same shaft as 1st and 5th) is pre-selected, and is pending. Once the time comes to shift into 3rd, the second clutch <b>disengages</b> and the first clutch re-engages. This method of operation continues {{in the same manner}} for the remaining forward gears.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{solutions}} that would mechanically simultaneously release both falls were proposed. The British Royal Navy adopted and standardized on the Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> Gear in 1881, and this system {{was still in}} use in the late 20th century.The Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> Gear consists of three mechanisms. There are two <b>disengaging</b> hooks, one {{at each end of}} the seaboat, holding the boat to the falls. The two <b>disengaging</b> hooks are connected by a relatively tight and thin wire rope to the <b>disengaging</b> release clip located approximately at the center of the seaboat. The thin connecting wire rope is called the [...] "Fore and After". The <b>disengaging</b> hooks are normally held safe from unintentionally dropping the seaboat by a pin in each <b>disengaging</b> hook.|$|R
50|$|Much like Klayton's {{experiences}} with R.E.X., his short deal with Flying Tart provided {{a number of}} frustrations. Although Klayton intended to release <b>Disengage</b> in 1997 and precede its release with an EP of <b>Disengage</b> remixes titled Refractorchasm, Flying Tart canceled the EP's release and delayed <b>Disengage</b> until 1998, requiring Klayton to tack the EP onto <b>Disengage</b> {{in order to ensure}} the release of the music. The label also reduced the length of the album's art booklet, which Klayton self-designed. Within two weeks of signing his contract with Flying Tart, the label was bought out and dissolved, ensuring the album saw extremely limited distribution.|$|R

25|$|The Katana is {{commonly}} {{fitted with a}} Continental O-240 piston engine, which is both a lightweight and relatively fuel-efficient powerplant. The Rotax 912 is also equipped upon many aircraft. Variants powered by the Rotax engine have been approved for use with standard automotive gasoline, automotive-grade oil Mobil is also recommended {{for use as a}} lubricant. In the event of a loss of coolant leak, the Rotax engine is capable of 'dry running' for up to 2 hours without any resulting damage if run at or below 56 per cent power. The aircraft's constant-speed propeller is hydraulically actuated and fitted with composite blades. A unique clutch arrangement automatically <b>disengages</b> the propeller from the engine {{in the event of an}} obstacle being struck.|$|E
25|$|All 567 engines utilize forced induction, {{with either}} a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design that uses a gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during low engine speed, when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine and the clutch <b>disengages,</b> turning the turbo-compressor system into a true turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement.|$|E
25|$|The end {{replication}} {{problem is}} handled in eukaryotic cells by telomere regions and telomerase. Telomeres extend the 3' {{end of the}} parental chromosome beyond the 5' end of the daughter strand. This single-stranded DNA structure can act as an origin of replication that recruits telomerase. Telomerase is a specialized DNA polymerase that consists of multiple protein subunits and an RNA component. The RNA component of telomerase anneals to the single stranded 3' end of the template DNA and contains 1.5 copies of the telomeric sequence. Telomerase contains a protein subunit that is a reverse transcriptase called telomerase reverse transcriptase or TERT. TERT synthesizes DNA {{until the end of}} the template telomerase RNA and then <b>disengages.</b> This process can be repeated as many times as needed with the extension of the 3' end of the parental DNA molecule. This 3' addition provides a template for extension of the 5' end of the daughter strand by lagging strand DNA synthesis. Regulation of telomerase activity is handled by telomere-binding proteins.|$|E

50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. To <b>disengage</b> the safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the <b>disengaged</b> position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the engaged position. Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing to <b>disengage</b> the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly is all it takes to <b>disengage</b> the safety.|$|R
500|$|Amidala's ship {{is damaged}} {{as they pass}} the Federation {{blockade}} and becomes unable to use its hyperdrive, landing for repairs on the desert planet Tatooine. Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, astromech droid R2-D2, and Amidala (in disguise {{as one of her}} handmaidens) visit the settlement of Mos Espa to purchase new parts at a junk shop. They meet the shop's owner, Watto, and his nine-year-old slave, Anakin Skywalker, who is a gifted pilot and engineer, and has created a protocol droid called C-3PO. Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force within Anakin, and is convinced that he is the [...] "chosen one" [...] of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force. Qui-Gon wagers Anakin's freedom with Watto in a Podrace, which Anakin wins. Anakin joins the group to be trained as a Jedi, leaving his mother Shmi behind. En route to their starship, Qui-Gon encounters Darth Maul, Darth Sidious's apprentice, who was sent to capture Amidala. A duel ensues, but Qui-Gon quickly <b>disengages</b> and escapes on board the starship.|$|E

Spider-Man attempts to pull the Scoop down, but is attacked by all the supervillains. Spider-Man thwarts them, but not before Doctor Octopus <b>disengages</b> the anti-gravity device, sending the Scoop on a simulated freefall until it is rescued by Spider-Man's webbing right above the ground and another Stan Lee cameo. Spider-Man manages to capture all of the supervillains by tying them with webs. As the vehicle pulls into the unload station, Spider-Man thanks the guests for their help and sends {{them back to the}} Daily Bugle, where he has rigged the anti-gravity cannon to lift Jameson up to the ceiling in his office.

40|$|Visuospatial neglect after stroke {{is often}} {{characterized}} by a <b>disengage</b> deficit on a cued orienting task, in which individuals are disproportionately slower to respond to targets presented on the contralesional side of space following an ispilesional cue {{as compared to the}} reverse. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the generality of the finding of a <b>disengage</b> deficit on another measure of cued attention, the temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, that does not depend upon speeded manual responses. Individuals with right hemisphere stroke with and without spatial neglect and older healthy controls were tested with both a speeded RT cueing task and an unspeeded TOJ-with-cuing task. All stroke patients evidenced a <b>disengage</b> deficit on the speeded RT cueing task, although the size and direction of the bias was not associated with the severity of neglect. In contrast, few neglect patients showed a <b>disengage</b> deficit on the TOJ task. This discrepancy suggests that the <b>disengage</b> deficit may be related to task demands, rather than solely due to impaired attentional mechanisms per se. Further, the results of our study show that the <b>disengage</b> deficit is neither necessary nor sufficient for neglect to manifest...|$|R

50|$|Single-revolution {{clutches}} {{were developed}} in the 19th century to power machinery such as shears or presses where a single pull of the operating lever or (later) press of a button would trip the mechanism, engaging the clutch between the power source and the machine's crankshaft for exactly one revolution before <b>disengaging</b> the clutch.

Following the procedures described by Lee and Jia (2014), they determined the average proportion correct for engaged versus <b>disengaged</b> response behavior across items (and additionally by item) for each construct, {{as well as the}} correlations between score group and proportion correct for engaged and <b>disengaged</b> response behavior by item. One example of their findings is that the proportion correct for engaged responses in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving were 0.56, 0.63 and 0.43, respectively, in comparison to 0 for <b>disengaged</b> responses by definition according to the P +> 0 % method. Compared to other methods specifying constant thresholds of 5000 or 3000  ms, or item-specific thresholds obtained by inspecting visually the (bimodal) response time distribution, the P +> 0 % method resulted in the greatest difference in proportion correct for engaged versus <b>disengaged</b> responses, suggesting that the method separates <b>disengaged</b> and engaged responses very well. Taken together, these validity checks indicate that the P +> 0 % indicator can validly be interpreted as a measure of test-taking disengagement.|$|R
