5|$|The 2009 {{version was}} {{released}} for sale September 9, 2008. Symantec set several goals for version 2009 while in development: complete installations under {{minute and a}} <b>footprint</b> of 100 MB. Average installation times range from eight to ten minutes, and the previous 2008 version had a 400 MB <b>footprint.</b> Other goals included reducing load time after the computer starts, from 20–30 seconds to 10 seconds, and file scanning times with a technology allowing Norton to skip certain trusted files. The technology works {{on the basis that}} if a piece of software runs on a significant proportion of computers, then it is safe.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys and}} Candace {{return to a}} muddy area where the T. rex has left a massive <b>footprint,</b> which they {{recognize}} will eventually be {{on display in the}} museum in the present. Phineas leaves a message in the <b>footprint</b> for Isabella and the Fireside Girls to save them. The girls—in the present—immediately spot the <b>footprint</b> and the message and follow their handbook to create a new time machine. They use the machine to travel back in time and rescue the three. Upon arrival in the present, though, they realize a T. rex returned with them, so Candace flees and tries to expose it to her parents. A stray ray from Doofenshmirtz's machine freezes the creature, so her parents merely believe it is an exhibit.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} <b>footprint</b> of Croatia's {{population and}} industry varies significantly between the country's regions since 50% {{of the population}} resides in 26.8% of the nation's territory, with a particularly high impact made {{by the city of}} Zagreb and Zagreb County areas—their combined area comprises 6.6% of Croatia's territory while encompassing 25% of the population. The ecological <b>footprint</b> is most notably from the increased development of settlements and the sea coast leading to habitat fragmentation. Between 1998 and 2008, the greatest changes of land use pertained to artificially developed areas, but the scale of development is negligible compared to EU member states.|$|E

40|$|<b>Footprinting</b> is {{a simple}} method for {{assessing}} the sequence selectivity of DNA-binding ligands. The method {{is based on the}} ability of the ligand to protect DNA from cleavage at its binding site. This review describes the use of DNase I and hydroxyl radicals, the most commonly used <b>footprinting</b> probes, in <b>footprinting</b> experiments. The success of a <b>footprinting</b> experiment depends on using an appropriate DNA substrate and we describe how these can best be chosen or designed. Although <b>footprinting</b> was originally developed for assessing a ligand’s sequence selectivity, it can also be employed to estimate the binding strength (quantitative <b>footprinting)</b> and to assess the association and dissociation rate constants for slow binding reactions...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{extraction}} of building <b>footprints</b> {{is important for}} the calculation of sustainable urban form indexes. In this study automatic extraction methods have been investigated for the building reconstruction. It is found that buildings with closed polygon <b>footprints</b> are difficult to obtain the desired accuracy. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach is proposed for the {{extraction of}} closed polygon <b>footprints</b> from lidar data. Two types of closed polygons have been investigated, where one type is a simple closed polygon and the other is a complex combination of multiple polygons. From the reference data that is surveyed with a total station, the building <b>footprints</b> have been extracted. The extracted <b>footprints</b> from lidar data have been compared with the surveyed <b>footprints</b> using a confusion matrix and Kappa Index. It is concluded that our approach is reliable because the closed polygon <b>footprints</b> can be extracted with a high Kappa Index. This indicates that the proposed procedure is suitable to be utilized for cadastral mapping of remote built up areas...|$|R
