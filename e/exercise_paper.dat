40|$|Background: The {{knowledge}} of underlying mechanisms {{for the maintenance}} and spread of musculoskeletal pain is limited. Pain is a complex subjective experience influenced {{by a variety of}} factors. The focus of the present thesis is on possible mechanisms associated with chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain, and factors of importance for the variation in reports of pain intensity and sensory symptoms in subjects with localized and generalized musculoskeletal pain. Aims: The specific aims were to investigate: 1) whether sympathoadrenal and cortisol responses were attenuated and associated with pain intensity and muscle fatigue during exercise in subjects with fibromyalgia (FM) compared with healthy controls; 2) {{the reliability and validity of}} two different pain assessment strategies of recalled pain intensity in subjects with localized (LP) and generalized (GP) musculoskeletal pain; 3) whether pain intensity, number of painful body areas and emotional distress were associated with neuropathic symptoms in subjects with musculoskeletal pain Materials and methods: Sympathoadrenal and cortisol responses, pain intensity and muscular responses were compared between subjects with fibromyalgia and their matched healthy controls during dynamic bicycling and static repetitive contractions (papers I and II). Pain intensity, neuropathic symptoms (LANSS), and number of painful body areas were reported over the first week in four subsequent months and compared in subjects with LP and GP (papers III and IV). Pain intensity was assessed as recalls of pain intensity during the last 24 hours (daily recalls) (papers I-III) and the last seven days (weekly recalls) (papers I-IV). Real-time pain intensity was assessed moment by moment during exercise (papers I and II) and during one week in every day life (paper III). Results: Compared with the healthy controls the FM patients exhibited lower peak oxygen uptake and lower MVC (papers I and II), similar physiological responses during dynamic <b>exercise</b> (<b>paper</b> I), but lower plasma adrenaline responses and higher relative EMG during static repetitive <b>exercise</b> (<b>paper</b> II). The catecholamine responses were not associated with real-time pain intensity and muscle fatigue during exercise (papers I and II). Real-time pain intensity increased during exercise, but no increase was reported in recalled pain comparing the week before and after exercise. Across four months the average of daily ratings of recalled pain intensity conducted over a week were lower and corresponded better with the average of multiple real-time ratings than single ratings of weekly recalls. The GP group obtained lower reliability of pain intensity than the LP group and overestimated weekly recalled pain compared to real-time pain. The overestimation increased with increasing pain intensity (paper III). The LANSS scores were stable over time and positively associated with number of painful body areas, pain intensity, and emotional distress. In multiple regression analysis emotional distress and the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remained the final predictors of neuropathic symptoms (paper IV). Conclusion: This study showed attenuated adrenaline responses in FM during static repetitive exercise, but no clear relationship between altered physiological responses and exercise related pain. Pain intensity varied considerably according to context and the assessment method applied. Generalized pain and emotional distress were the main factors influencing the reports of pain and sensory symptoms. In future studies, the causal relationship between emotional distress and development of generalized pain and associated symptoms need further exploration...|$|E
40|$|Avhandling (doktorgrad) - Norges idrettshøgskole, 2015 Many athletes {{struggle}} with disordered eating or eating disorders (ED) {{as they attempt}} to conform to demands or competition regulations that might be ill-suited to their physique. In this situation, participation in sports may lead to an array of health concerns that may adversely affect the athlete’s short and long-term health at a variety of performance levels and sports. The peak onset of ED is adolescence, when most athletic participation and competition takes place and athletes begin to focus on a particularly sport. For athletes, the biological changes occurring during adolescence might affect not only attitudes toward weight and shape, but also performance. To prevent the medical and psychological consequences related to ED, early intervention and identification is important. Paper I: Martinsen M, Sundgot-Borgen J.

40|$|Avhandling (doktorgrad) – Norges idrettshøgskole, 2011. The present thesis {{consists}} of four studies with the main objective to examine {{the significance of the}} skeletal muscular metabolic capacity during whole body exercise. Exercise capacity was studied in chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) patients and a control group in study I, and in endurance‐trained subjects and normal physical active subjects in study II. In both studies, muscular metabolic capacity was quantified during exercise with a small muscle mass (1. 7 ‐ 2. 8 kg) to avoid the issue of muscular oxygen uptake being limited by oxygen supply. Thereafter, we tested how much the muscular metabolic capacity could be exploited during whole body exercise (bicycling). Exploitation less than 100 % indicated a muscular metabolic reserve probably due to oxygen supply limitations. The muscular metabolic capacity ranged from 264 to 570 ml. kg‐ 1. min‐ 1 for the four groups. However, there was less variation in the relative exploitation of the muscular metabolic capacity during whole body exercise for the healthy groups (31 %‐ 37 %), while this percentage was smaller (17 %) for the COPD patients. Based on these results, we concluded that the exploitation of the muscular metabolic capacity was relatively equal for the healthy groups despite large differences in age and maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max). The COPD patients were least capable of exploiting the muscular metabolic capacity during bicycling and consequently, they had a relatively higher muscular metabolic reserve during whole body exercise compared with healthy subjects.

40|$|Adaptations to {{strength}} training are usually divided in two broad categories: morphological (peripheral) and neural (central) adaptations. The {{purpose of this}} thesis {{was to investigate the}} chronic neural adaptations in response to various {{strength training}} interventions (Paper I-III), and the acute neural adjustments that occur after heavy resistance <b>exercise</b> (<b>Paper</b> IV and V). Improved understanding of the mechanisms should allow better prescription of exercise to athletic, clinical, and the general population. The principal measurement techniques employed to assess neural changes were surface electromyogram (EMG) activity and evoked spinal reflexes, namely H-reflex and V-wave responses. Paper I investigated whether maximal functional multiple-joint leg press training could induce neural adaptations to the plantar flexor muscles in a single-joint contraction task. In accordance with the hypothesis, significant “carry-over” effects of neural drive and muscle strength were observed. Paper II assessed the effects of unilateral, maximal strength training on neural adaptations of the untrained contralateral limb. It is extensively documented that “cross-education” of muscle strength occurs, but the mechanisms require further inspection. In agreement with the hypothesis, the findings reinforced the concept that enhanced neural drive to the contralateral agonist muscles is the underlying mechanism for cross-education of strength. Paper III investigated the effects of lower limb strength training on neural drive to the muscle in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. MS-patients are not able to fully activate motor units (recruitment and/or firing frequency) in the lower limbs, and therefore suffer from reduced leg strength compared to healthy individuals. Conversely, strength training induces opposite neural effects, but has never been assessed in this population. Neural drive and muscle strength was enhanced in response to strength training with no negative interactions, in accordance with the hypothesis. Central neural fatigue occurs after resistive exercise. In paper IV it was investigated whether caffeine supplementation could enhance the recovery of efferent neural drive after maximal fatiguing contractions. Contrary to our hypothesis, caffeine did not influence neural recovery and thus did not affect muscle strength. However, this study established a significant relationship between the two measures of efferent neural drive, namely EMG activity and Vwave responses. In contrast to muscle fatigue - the most obvious effect of contractile history, paper V investigated post-activation potentiation (PAP) which is a transient enhancement of power/strength performance after heavy muscle work. This study established the time-courses of the muscular and neural mechanisms proposed being responsible for PAP. Opposite to our hypothesis, strength/power performance was not enhanced at the arbitrarily chosen timepoint. Collectively, increased EMG activity and V-wave responses after strength training demonstrated adaptive changes in the central nervous system leading to increased muscle strength. H-reflex responses remained unchanged in response to the heavy strength training, indicating that adaptations of this pathway were not underlying the present strength gains. Transient changes in the central nervous activation of muscle was observed after acute resistance exercise, although no effects of caffeine were observed, nor were there any evidence of PAP despite the occurrence of the proposed underlying mechanisms.

40|$|Metabolic {{efficiency}} affects weight control, {{generation of}} heat, exercise performance and health. The tiny radical nitric oxide (NO) targets several cellular components that can influence metabolic efficiency. NO is produced endogenously from L-arginine and molecular oxygen by specific NO-synthases. In addition, extensive research {{during the past}} two decades shows that the inorganic anions nitrate and nitrite, which are oxidation products from endogenous NO generation, can be reduced back to NO and other nitrogen oxides. Apart from reflecting endogenous NOS-activity, circulating nitrate and nitrite are dependent on dietary intake, where green leafy vegetables in particular contain high amounts of nitrate. Circulating nitrate is actively taken up by the salivary glands and excreted in saliva. Oral commensal bacteria then reduce salivary nitrate into nitrite, which after swallowing and effective uptake in the gut, reaches the systemic circulation. In blood and tissues several enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways are able to reduce nitrite to NO. These pathways are potentiated under acidic and hypoxic conditions. The nitratenitrite- NO pathway is considered a back-up system during conditions when NO-synthases are failing. Prior to the inception of this thesis, our group had shown that dietary nitrate was able to decrease oxygen cost during exercise and we wanted to further explore its metabolic effects With this background, we investigated the underlying mechanisms behind the oxygen sparing effect of dietary nitrate during <b>exercise</b> (<b>Paper</b> I). Moreover, we explored the effects of dietary nitrate on muscular function in mice (Paper II), oxygen consumption in a human model of global hypoxia (Paper III) and on resting metabolic rate in humans (Paper IV). In the last two papers we wanted to investigate if metabolic efficiency can affect exercise tolerance in hypoxia (Paper V) and how cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit IV isoform composition affects resting metabolic rate (Paper VI). Respirometric analysis of isolated mitochondria from healthy humans revealed that dietary nitrate improves mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratio) and this effect correlated strongly with the reduction in oxygen consumption during cycling ergometry. In addition we found respirometric support for less uncoupling which was supported by reduced expression of adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT), a major determinant of proton conductance (Paper I). In muscle from mice fed for 7 days with nitrate, electric stimulation led to increased contractile force and speed of force development in fast twitch muscle compared to controls. This was accompanied by higher Ca 2 + levels and increased expression of the Ca 2 +- handling proteins dihydropyridine receptor and calsequestrin- 1 (Paper II). In the human model of global hypoxia a reduction in arterial oxygen saturation was achieved during prolonged breath-holding by experienced free divers after nitrate or placebo. In contrast to our hypothesis, nitrate during resting apnea increased pulmonary oxygen uptake, reduced arterial oxygen saturation and shortened maximal breathholding time. This was probably related to a NO-mediated attenuation of the oxygen conserving diving response as showed by less bradycardia and indications of an attenuation of the increase in blood pressure after nitrate (Paper III). In healthy humans we could demonstrate that dietary nitrate reduces resting metabolic rate by 4 % and that acute administration of nitrite in vitro reduces respiration by 40 % in primary myotubes from the same individuals (Paper IV). We found that healthy subjects with a high metabolic efficiency in normoxia had higher tolerance to exercise in hypoxia. Interestingly, these subjects acutely reduced their metabolic efficiency during hypoxia in order to maintain power output. On the other hand, isolated mitochondria, which work in the lower efficiency range, acutely increased their efficiency during a steady state hypoxic challenge in order to maintain ATP production (Paper V). There is a largely unexplained variation in resting metabolic rate between seemingly similar individuals. We found that the inter-individual variation in resting metabolic rate seems to depend on the composition of COX subunit IV isoforms. We could show that COX IV- 2 isoform is present in human skeletal muscle and that a high COX IV- 2 /COX IV- 1 ratio showed a strong negative correlation to resting metabolic rate. Moreover, concurrent overexpression of COX IV- 2 and knock down of COX IV- 1 in primary human myotubes significantly reduced basal cell respiration and ROS generation without affecting the COX activity (Paper VI). In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates profound effects of dietary nitrate on mitochondrial efficiency, muscle function and metabolism. In addition, metabolic efficiency plays a role in exercise tolerance during hypoxia and adapts to obtain optimal power. Finally, mitochondrial COX subunit IV isoform composition seems to affect resting metabolic rate. The physiological, therapeutic and nutritional aspects of these findings create a platform for further studies on dietary nitrate, mitochondrial function and metabolism...|$|E
