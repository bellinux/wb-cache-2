5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his {{photographs in the}} images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E
5|$|From the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 CE) {{until the}} modern period (1840–1919), {{scholars}} and rulers developed a male-dominated patriarchal society in China. Confucianism {{was at the}} root of the development of the patriarchal society in China, and emphasized the distinctions between the sexes and the roles they have within the family. These ideologies continued through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and girls were taught from a very young age to be submissive to their fathers, then to their husbands, and later to their sons. During the Song Dynasty (960-1297), Confucian scholars <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.|$|E

5|$|Johns was {{a popular}} member of the cast of The Footy Show, and played several {{characters}} for the show. He <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> Reg Reagan character as a beer-swilling rugby league fan, and the character became hugely popular. He also appeared as Trent, a gay flight attendant. In 2004, Johns recorded a novelty song and wrote a book, This Is My Life in character as Reg Reagan, and produced a DVD featuring both characters. He also commentated on Nine's telecasts of rugby league games. In 2008, he wrote a second book, From the Sheds, under his own name. He also became assistant coach of the Melbourne Storm NRL team.|$|E
5|$|MercyMe {{wanted to}} get out of their comfort zone with the overall sound of the album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala. Millard has said that he initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't think much about the overall length of the songs. MercyMe <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> sound of the album by looking to the work of The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} {{the sixteenth}} century through the eighteenth century, a period known as Reformed orthodoxy, Reformed baptismal {{theology}} <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> covenantal meaning of baptism. Theologians more carefully defined the sacramental union of baptism, or the relationship between the outward washing with that which it signifies. In the high orthodox period (middle to late seventeenth century), theologians such as Hermann Witsius expanded the covenantal meaning of baptism using analogies such as Noah's Ark and the crossing of the Red Sea, which carried the theological themes of the resurrection and eternal life. This period also saw the emergence of Reformed Baptists. Reformed Baptist theologians had much in common with the Reformed, but saw baptism {{as a sign of the}} baptized's fellowship with Christ rather than a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, and as a result did not baptize their children.|$|E

5|$|In a Chess Notes feature article, Edward Winter {{showed that}} the origins of this opening are not yet entirely elucidated. The first known game with the Budapest Gambit is Adler–Maróczy (played in Budapest in 1896). This game already {{featured}} some key aspects of the gambit, such as active play for the black pieces, and White making the typical mistake of moving the queen too early. As the player of the white pieces was not a strong player, the new opening went unnoticed apart from the local experts who had witnessed the game. The Hungarians István Abonyi, Zsigmond Barász and Gyula Breyer <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> opening. Abonyi played it in 1916 against the Dutch surgeon Johannes Esser in a small tournament in Budapest. The Austrian player Josef Emil Krejcik played it against Helmer in Vienna in 1917. Carl Schlechter published an optimistic analysis of the gambit in the Deutsche Schachzeitung.|$|E
5|$|The castle was besieged in 1216 {{during the}} civil war between King John and rebellious barons, who were {{supported}} by France. It was successfully captured after Prince Louis, the future Louis VIII, attacked it with siege engines for twenty days, forcing the garrison to surrender. After being retaken by royal forces the subsequent year, it was given to Richard, Earl of Cornwall, beginning a long association with the Earldom of Cornwall and the later duchy. Richard redeveloped the castle as a palatial residence, and made it the centre of the earldom's administration. Edward III <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> castle in the 14th century and gave it to his son, Edward, the Black Prince, who expanded the hunting grounds. The castle was also used to hold royal prisoners, including John II of France and rival claimants to the English throne.|$|E
5|$|The team {{used the}} BT49 over four seasons. In the 1980 season Piquet scored three wins {{and the team}} took third in the Constructors' Championship with Piquet second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the {{introduction}} of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> BT49C for the 1981 season, incorporating a hydropneumatic suspension system to avoid ride height limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray, took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit amid accusations of cheating. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the Williams team.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} linear algebra first {{emerged from the}} study of determinants, which were used to solve systems of linear equations. Determinants were used by Leibniz in 1693, and subsequently, Gabriel Cramer devised Cramer's Rule for solving linear systems in 1750. Later, Gauss <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> theory of solving linear systems by using Gaussian elimination, which was {{initially}} listed as an advancement in geodesy.|$|E
25|$|Like other interpretations before it, Kircher's 'translations' were {{hampered}} by the fundamental assumption that hieroglyphs recorded ideas and not {{the sounds of the}} language.

Kitsons <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> idea, the first loco being constructed in 1894.|$|E
25|$|James Gunn is {{partially}} {{responsible for the}} screenplay although he received a solo writing credit. After he left the project to concentrate on , Michael Tolkin and Scott Frank were brought in for rewriting. In a commentary track on the Ultimate Edition DVD for the original George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, Richard P. Rubinstein, producer of the original and the remake, explained that Tolkin <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> characters, while Frank provided some of the bigger and upbeat action sequences.|$|E
25|$|Levko Revutsky <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> {{methods of}} Lysenko and Leontovych. He enriched Ukrainian music with his {{individual}} stylistic discoveries. The composer's style of Revutsky was formed {{on the basis}} of deep and comprehensive understanding of Ukrainian folk melody and traditions of modern professional music. Life-asserting attitude, lyricism, restraint, breadth and riches of emotions, are inherent in the works of this artist. His measured, expressive melody unites with the saturated, difficult harmony. Revutsky exposed reality and in lyrical-dramatic, and in lyrical-epic keys.|$|E

25|$|Burton Kurth's 1937 {{appointment}} as Supervisor of Music in the Vancouver {{public school system}} {{contributed significantly to the}} creation of fine school choir, orchestra and band programs in many schools.

With the advent of the BC Liberal government in 2001, and its limited funding of public schools, school districts gradually eliminated many schools' music programs, redirecting scant funds to provide urgently needed ESL training.|$|E
25|$|Between Hughes and Schweizer, and {{including}} foreign-licensed production civil and military training aircraft, nearly 3,000 {{copies of the}} Model 269/300 have been built and flown over the last 50 years. That {{would have been the}} end of the story, but Schweizer continued to develop the model 300 by adding a turbine and redesigning the body to create the model 330m, and then <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> dynamic components to take greater advantage of the power of the turbine engine; this led to the development of the Model 333.|$|E
25|$|In 1881 the Dunedin cable tramway system {{opened in}} Dunedin, New Zealand {{and became the}} first such system outside San Francisco. For Dunedin, George Smith Duncan <b>further</b> <b>developed</b> <b>the</b> Hallidie model, {{introducing}} the pull curve and the slot brake; the former was a way to pull cars through a curve, since Dunedin's curves were too sharp to allow coasting, while the latter forced a wedge down into the cable slot to stop the car. Both of these innovations were generally adopted by other cities, including San Francisco.|$|E
