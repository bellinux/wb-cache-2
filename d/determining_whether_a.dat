5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} for <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, {{using only}} a logarithmic amount of writable memory, {{is easy to}} describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from v to its negation {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it is also possible in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|Designing {{reversible}} {{rules for}} block cellular automata, and <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> given rule is reversible, is easy: for a block cellular automaton to be reversible {{it is necessary}} and sufficient that the transformation applied to the individual blocks at {{each step of the}} automaton is itself reversible. When a block cellular automaton is reversible, the time-reversed version of its dynamics can also be described as a block cellular automaton with the same block structure, using a time-reversed sequence of partitions of cells into blocks, and with the transition function for each block being the inverse function of the original rule.|$|E
5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive in the exercise of discretion were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA graph {{is called}} v-pancyclic if it {{contains}} a cycle of length l containing a given vertex v for 3 ⩽l⩽n, and a graph G is called vertex pancyclic if G is v-pancyclic for all v.

25|$|A {{reduction}} can {{be demonstrated}} to this problem from the well-known undecidable problem of <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> Turing machine accepts a particular input (the halting problem). The reduction uses {{the concept of a}} computation history, a string describing an entire computation of a Turing machine. A CFG can be constructed that generates all strings that are not accepting computation histories for a particular Turing machine on a particular input, and thus it will accept all strings only if the machine doesn't accept that input.|$|E

In this way, elevated levels of LDH (where the level of LDH1 is higher than that of LDH2, i.e. the LDH Flip, as normally, in serum, LDH2 is higher than LDH1) can be useful for <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> patient has had a myocardial infarction if they come to doctors several days after an episode of chest pain.|$|E
