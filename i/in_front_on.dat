5|$|At the 2011 World Championships in Khanty-Mansiysk, Neuner {{won three}} gold and two silver medals. She claimed silver, {{alongside}} Andrea Henkel, Arnd Peiffer and Michael Greis, {{in the opening}} mixed relay. On 5 March 2011, Neuner won the sprint race courtesy of a clean shooting performance. She {{finished second in the}} pursuit and fifth in the individual subsequently. On 12 March 2011, Neuner won her second title in the mass start despite of four shooing errors. The following day she also claimed gold in the women's relay, together with Andrea Henkel, Miriam Gössner and Tina Bachmann. Running the last leg for Germany, Neuner started in fourth, 67.5seconds off the lead, but she pulled back the entire time and moved <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>on</b> the last lap. Her five medals made her the most successful female athlete in the history of Biathlon World Championships.|$|E
5|$|On the British side, General Clinton {{learned of}} the almost undefended Jamaica Pass from local Loyalists. He drew up a plan {{and gave it to}} William Erskine to propose to Howe. Clinton's plan had the main army making a night march and going through the Jamaica Pass to turn the American flank, while other troops would keep the Americans busy <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> <b>On</b> August 26, Clinton {{received}} word from Howe that the plan would be used, and that Clinton was to command the advance guard of the main army of 10,000 men on the march through the Jamaica Pass. While they made the night march, General James Grant's British troops along with some Hessians, a total of 4,000 men, were to attack the Americans in front to distract them from the main army coming on their flank. Howe told Clinton to be ready to move out that night, August 26.|$|E

25|$|Van Dorn {{ordered a}} retreat first towards Pocahontas, where he {{proposed}} for the Confederate army to attack Corinth again from the south; both Price and Maury talked him out of it. The retreat continued westward, with Lovell's division serving as a rearguard against Rosecrans and Price's divisions <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> <b>On</b> the morning of October 6, Van Dorn learned that another Union force commanded by Stephen Hulbut was approaching from the west; he assigned Maury's division to hold the Davis Bridge over the Hatchie River until the army could reach another crossing six miles to the south. Maury formed a line {{on the west side}} of the creek but the line was overrun with the loss of 300 prisoners. Hulbut then crossed several regiments to the east bank, which suffered 570 casualties, mostly due to sharpshooters and artillery fire. Once a temporary bridge was built across the Hatchie, the Confederate army retreated to Holly Springs.|$|E
25|$|Jourdan, Carnot and Representative Ernest Dominique François Joseph Duquesnoy {{accompanied}} Balland's {{division in}} the center. The army commander planned {{to wait for the}} attacks of his two wings to make significant progress before launching the attack of Balland's division. In mid-morning, the division filed out of the woods in front of Dourlers and opened fire with its artillery. Seeing the initial success of the two wings, Carnot wanted the attack to be started at once. Jourdan wanted more ground to be gained on the flanks but the politician would not be denied. Finally, Jourdan put himself at the head of Balland's division and ordered the assault. As the French soldiers came over the crest of the ridge <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>on</b> the sunken road, they came under murderous fire from the crack Austrian grenadiers. Despite heroic attempts to get light artillery forward, cannons were dismounted and gunners and horses were shot down. In the thick of the bullets, Jourdan bravely urged his troops on but an Austrian force appeared from the direction of Saint-Aubin, threatening the French left flank. At nightfall the representatives authorized a retreat after Balland's division had lost between 1,200 and 1,500 casualties.|$|E

Shannon is probably best remembered for not winning the Epsom Handicap that season, when {{he appeared to be}} unbeatable. As a short-priced favourite for the 1946 Epsom Handicap, Shannon missed the start and did not move from his starting position until {{the rest of the field}} had travelled about a hundred metres. Despite the setback his jockey, Darby Munro took off after the field and failed only by half a head to catch the winner Blue Legend, and just past the post he was <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> <b>On</b> his return to scale Munro was given a hostile reception for his ride in the race, it was later disclosed that the starter had failed to see that Shannon was not facing up.|$|E
500|$|If {{a bishop}} is a diocesan bishop, it is {{customary}} {{for him to}} combine his arms with {{the arms of the}} diocese following normal heraldic rules. This combining is termed marshalling, and is normally accomplished by impalement, placing the arms of the diocese to the viewer's left (dexter in heraldry) and the personal arms to the viewer's right. The arms of Thomas Arundel are found impaled with those of the See of Canterbury in a document from 1411. In Germany and Switzerland, quartering is the norm rather than impalement. Guy Selvester, an American ecclesiastical heraldist, says if arms are not designed with care, marshalling can lead to [...] "busy", crowded shields. Crowding can be reduced by placing a smaller shield overlapping the larger shield, known as an inescutcheon or an escutcheon surtout. In the arms of Heinrich Mussinghoff, Bishop of Aachen, the personal arms are placed in front of the diocesan arms, but the opposite arrangement is found <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>on</b> the arms of Paul Gregory Bootkoski, Bishop of Metuchen. Cardinals sometimes combine their personal arms with the arms of the Pope who named them a cardinal. As Prefect of the Pontifical Household, Jacques Martin impaled his personal arms with those of three successive pontiffs. A married Church of England bishop combines his arms with those of his wife and the diocese on two separate shields placed accollé, or side-by-side.|$|E

[...] At {{the end of the}} film Churchill reads a sympathetic post-election note from his old friend Jack Seely: [...] "I feel our world slipping away." [...] Churchill thinks back: [...] "I met him in South Africa, riding across the veldt. He was Col. Seely then. I saw him at the head of a column of British cavalry, riding twenty yards <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> <b>on</b> a black horse. I thought of him as the very symbol of British Imperial power." [...] The Testimony Films 2012 documentary War Horse: The Real Story contained extensive discussion of the First World War service of Seely and his widely revered horse, Warrior. Warrior was adopted as his formation's mascot and had a reputation for bravery under fire. Warrior survived the war, dying in 1941 at the age of 33. In September 2014, the horse was posthumously awarded an honorary PDSA Dickin Medal for bravery.|$|E

2500|$|Before the 2008 flyby to re-orient for {{the comet}} 103P/Hartley encounter, the {{spacecraft}} used High Resolution Instrument, {{the larger of}} its two telescopes, to perform photometric observations of previously discovered transiting extrasolar planets from January to August 2008. The goal of photometric observations is to measure the quantity of light, not necessarily resolve an image. An aberration in the primary mirror of the HRI [...] allowed the HRI to spread the light from observations over more pixels without saturating the CCD, effectively obtaining better data. A total of 198,434 images were exposed. EPOCh's goals were to study the physical properties of giant planets and search for rings, moons and planets as small as three Earth masses. It also looked at Earth {{as though it were}} an extrasolar planet to provide data that could characterize Earth-type planets for future missions, and it imaged the Earth over 24 hours to capture the Moon passing <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>on</b> 2008-05-29.|$|E

2500|$|Ma's cross-political {{following}} has {{led some}} to note him as a rare example of relative civility in the notoriously rough and tumble world of Taiwanese politics. Ma has generally avoided being accused of using the vitriolic and sometimes offensive rhetoric common in Taiwanese political debate. His academic background and bearing have helped cultivate the image of Ma as an honest, dispassionate technocrat. Despite this reputation, and his wooden speaking style and shy demeanor, Ma is also considered a charismatic figure and is popular among women and youth. On the other hand, Ma's critics claim that Ma, overeager to appear unbiased and/or neutral, is overly indecisive and lacks bold vision. Ma is often accused of avoiding being out <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>on</b> {{some of the more}} vigorous or controversial criticisms of President Chen or opposing parties, or involving himself in intra-party disputes. Among these critics, Ma has been referred to as a [...] "non-stick pan" [...] or [...] "Teflon-man." [...] Recently, there has also been some criticism of his stumping for election candidates suspected of and later indicted for corruption charges. Many in the Pan-Green Coalition expressed opinions that Ma misled voters by lending his clean charismatic image to unscrupulous candidates in his own party.|$|E

In only the 3rd minute, the Deacons' top scorer passed from the end line to their #2 scorer, Bakero, who blasted {{the ball into the}} net from 9 yards <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> <b>On</b> the Cougars' lone corner kick of the game, both Ebbesen and his shot on goal were knocked down by the Wake keeper, but Ledbetter got to the rebound and netted [...] it to tie the score. SIUE looked about {{to take the lead in}} the 51st minute on a Jambga breakaway, but the Deacons' keeper, Cases Mundet, stayed with the pass to Ebbesen and blocked his point-blank shot. After repeated stops and saves by the Cougar defense, in the 72nd minute, it was again Bakero who redirected a shot that Dal Santo was ready to stop and scored the game winner. Although SIUE looked to be dominated in the statistics, out-shot 24–6 and bested on corner kicks 9–1, Wake Forest knew they had been in a fight; [...] "“I give SIUE credit." [...] said Wake's coach Muuss. [...] "They were blocking shots, battling."

The shallow ditches and captured trenches facing the wrong way had no drainage and few dugouts, all waterlogged and incapable of resisting shell-splinters. There were no communication trenches and the four largest craters had to be by-passed, supply parties being tied together to pull out those who got stranded in flooded shell-holes.
