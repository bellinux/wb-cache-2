5|$|The {{presence}} of two populations of {{particles in the}} main ring explains why its appearance depends on the viewing geometry. The dust scatters light preferably in the <b>forward</b> <b>direction</b> and forms a relatively thick homogenous ring bounded by the orbit of Adrastea. In contrast, large particles, which scatter in the back direction, are confined {{in a number of}} ringlets between the Metidian and Adrastean orbits.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955). The animal first fixes the posterior {{end of the}} foot by thrusting {{the point of the}} sickle-shaped operculum into the substrate, then it extends the foot in a <b>forward</b> <b>direction,</b> lifting and throwing the shell forward in a so-called leaping motion. This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting, making L.gigas a good climber even of vertical concrete surfaces. This leaping locomotion may help prevent predators from following the snail's chemical traces, which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate.|$|E
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a <b>forward</b> <b>direction</b> over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E

25|$|The only {{remedy for}} {{this loss of}} control is to desaturate the CMGs by {{removing}} the excess angular momentum from the spacecraft. The simplest way of doing this is to use Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters. In our example of saturation along the forward axis, the RCS will be fired to produce an anticlockwise torque about that axis. The CMG control program will then command the rotor spin axes to begin fanning out away from the <b>forward</b> <b>direction,</b> producing gyroscopic torques whose resultant is clockwise about the <b>forward</b> <b>direction,</b> opposing the RCS {{as long as it}} is still firing and holding the spacecraft steady. This is continued until a suitable amount of forward angular momentum has been drained out of the CMG rotors; it is transformed into the moment of momentum of the moving matter in the RCS thruster exhausts and carried away from the spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|A light-emitting-diode (LED) is a {{semiconductor}} diode that emits light when an electric current is {{applied in the}} <b>forward</b> <b>direction</b> of the device, as in the simple LED circuit.

25|$|In principle, all {{reactions}} are reversible however in practice reactions often effectively occur {{in only one}} direction.

25|$|Reactions may {{proceed in}} the forward or reverse {{direction}} until they go to completion or reach equilibrium. Reactions that proceed in the <b>forward</b> <b>direction</b> to approach equilibrium are often described as spontaneous, requiring no input of free energy to go forward. Non-spontaneous reactions require input of free energy to go forward (examples include charging a battery by applying an external electrical power source, or photosynthesis driven by absorption of electromagnetic radiation {{in the form of}} sunlight).|$|E
25|$|Besides {{reversed}} {{values for}} index of refraction, Veselago predicted {{the occurrence of}} reversed Cherenkov radiation (also known simply as CR) in a left-handed medium. In 1934 Pavel Cherenkov discovered a coherent radiation that occurs when certain types of media are bombarded by fast moving electron beams. In 1937 a theory built around CR stated that when charged particles, such as electrons, travel through a medium at speeds faster {{than the speed of}} light in the medium only then will CR radiate. As the CR occurs, electromagnetic radiation is emitted in a cone shape, fanning out in the <b>forward</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Military bands or {{corps of}} drums were {{historically}} the first marching bands. Instrumentation in these bands varies but generally consists of brass, woodwinds, and percussion. Due {{to their original}} purpose, military marching bands typically march in a <b>forward</b> <b>direction</b> with consistent straight lines. Music is performed at a constant tempo (120–140 BPM) to facilitate the steady marching of the entire military group the band is playing with. The marching step size, or interval, is consistent, and usually at a 6 to 5 (six steps per five yards) or 8 to 5 (eight steps to five yards). This style includes field music units such as drum and bugle corps or bugle bands, pipe bands, and fife and drum corps.|$|E

Differential cross sections were measured for scattering process of H (n) + He -> H (n') + He at the collision energy of 0. 526 eV. Experimental result indicates that the scattered H (n') product is mainly forward distributed, with signals observed in {{the wide range of}} angles at the sideway and <b>forward</b> scattering <b>directions.</b> At the sideway and <b>forward</b> <b>directions,</b> a lot of oscillatory structures in the angular distributions are present.

25|$|Xing Yi Quan {{features}} aggressive shocking {{attacks and}} direct footwork. Most {{of the training}} and footwork are practiced on straight lines. The linear nature of the art hints at both the military origins {{and the influence of}} spear technique alluded to in its mythology. The goal of the Xing Yi exponent is to reach the opponent quickly and drive power through them in a single burst. The analogy with spear fighting is useful here. This is achieved by coordinating one's body as a single unit, and the intense focusing of one's Intent (Yi 意) and coordinated power (Jin 劲) utilizing tight circles (usually in a <b>forward</b> <b>direction).</b> Issuing explosive power in Xing Yi is referred to as 'Fa Jin' (发劲), the same term used in many other traditional Chinese Martial Arts.|$|E
25|$|In Leonardo's {{notebooks}} {{there is}} an array of war machines which includes a vehicle to be propelled by two men powering crank shafts. Although the drawing itself looks quite finished, the mechanics were apparently not fully developed because, if built as drawn, the vehicle would never progress in a <b>forward</b> <b>direction.</b> In a BBC documentary, a military team built the machine and changed the gears {{in order to make}} the machine work. It has been suggested that Leonardo deliberately left this error in the design, in order to prevent it from being put to practice by unauthorized people. Another machine, propelled by horses with a pillion rider, carries in front of it four scythes mounted on a revolving gear, turned by a shaft driven by the wheels of a cart behind the horses.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{shoulder}} dislocations are downwards (inferior) and of these, 95% {{are in a}} <b>forward</b> <b>direction.</b> Clinically this {{is referred}} to as an anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint. Not only does the arm appear out of position when the shoulder dislocates, but the dislocation also produces pain. Muscle spasms may increase the intensity of pain. Swelling and bruising normally develop, and in some cases there may be numbness and muscle weakness. Problems seen with a dislocated shoulder are tearing of the ligaments or tendons reinforcing the joint capsule and, less commonly, nerve damage. Doctors usually diagnose a dislocation by a physical examination, but x rays are taken to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out a related fracture and other complications. X rays are also taken after relocation to ensure it is in the correct place.|$|E

500|$|A {{characteristic}} of the brain is gyrification (wrinkling of the cortex). In the womb, the cortex starts off as smooth but starts to form fissures that begin to mark out the different lobes of the brain. Scientists {{do not have a}} clear answer as to why the cortex later wrinkles and folds, but the wrinkling and folding is associated with intelligence and neurological disorders. The fissures form {{as a result of the}} growing hemispheres that increase in size due to a sudden growth in cells of the grey matter. The underlying white matter does not grow at the same rate and the hemispheres are crowded into the small cranial vault. The first cleft to appear in the fourth month is the lateral cerebral fossa. The expanding caudal end of the hemisphere has to curve over in a <b>forward</b> <b>direction</b> to fit into the restricted space. This covers the fossa and turns it into a much deeper ridge known as the lateral sulcus and this marks out the temporal lobe. By the sixth month other sulci have formed that demarcate the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. A gene present in the human genome (ArhGAP11B) may play a major role in gyrification and encephalisation.|$|E
