5|$|Stops {{that are}} <b>fortis</b> (or 'strong') are {{differentiated}} {{from those that}} are lenis (or 'weak') {{on the basis of}} length of closure, as opposed to the voice onset time (VOT), the period after the release of the stop before the commencement of vocal fold activity (or voice) which normally differentiates <b>fortis</b> and lenis stops in English and most other languages.|$|E
5|$|Where {{reflexes}} of the Old Irish <b>fortis</b> sonorants {{appear in}} syllable-final position (in some cases, only in word-final position), they trigger a lengthening or diphthongization {{of the preceding}} vowel in most dialects of Irish. The details vary from dialect to dialect.|$|E
5|$|G. juniperina subsp. <b>fortis</b> Makinson – is a {{vigorous}} red-flowered shrub growing to 1–3m (3–10ft) tall that is found on rocky hills and slopes near watercourses—specifically along Ginninderra Creek, the lower {{reaches of the}} Molonglo and Cotter Rivers, and the Murrumbidgee River from Pine Island downstream to where it is joined by the Molonglo River—mostly within the Australian Capital Territory.|$|E
5|$|Lenis {{stops in}} Wagiman sound like English voiced stops and are {{therefore}} written using the Roman alphabet letters b, d and g. <b>Fortis</b> stops, however, sound more like voiceless stops in English, but are slightly longer than lenis stops.

5|$|The {{production}} process was {{and still is}} chemically straightforward, effectively dissolving lead in aqua <b>fortis</b> (nitric acid), and subsequently harvesting the precipitate. However, the production remained small-scale for many centuries, and the commercial production of lead(II) nitrate as raw material for the manufacture of other lead compounds was not reported until 1835. In 1974, the U.S. consumption of lead compounds, excluding pigments and gasoline additives, was 642tons.|$|E

The mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold, the king of metals.|$|E

25|$|The {{different}} systems {{used to write}} Ojibwe are typically distinguished by their representation of key features of the Ojibwe inventory of sounds.

25|$|In {{the initial}} {{explication}} of character displacement, {{many of the}} examples set forth as potential evidence for character displacement were observations between multiple pairs of birds. These included rock nuthatches in Asia, Australian honeyeaters of the genus Myzantha, Australian parrots, shearwaters in the Cape Verde Islands, flycatchers of the Bismarck Archipelago and notably, Darwin's finches in the Galapagos. David Lack found that when the two species Geospiza <b>fortis</b> and G. fuliginosa occurred on large islands together, they could be distinguished unequivocally by beak size. When either one occurred by itself on a smaller island, however, the beak size was intermediate in size relative to when the two co-occurred. Similarly, Peter and Rosemary Grant found that a Geospiza <b>fortis</b> island population diverged in beak size (due to high mortality) from competitor G. magnirostris in a year with low food supply, apparently due to increased competition for larger seeds that both species fed on.|$|E
