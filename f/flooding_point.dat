40|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} a channel-based approach for dry pressure drop and the Buchanan equation for wet pressure drop in packed beds has been numerically evaluated within the flooding region. The <b>flooding</b> <b>point</b> is an important design parameter since it establishes the maximum hydrodynamic capacity at which a packed column can operate. Upon analyzing the aforementioned approach, {{it was found that}} the usual practice of fixing a reasonable wet pressure drop at the <b>flooding</b> <b>point</b> (e. g., 1025 Pa/m) may not yield the correct flooding velocity of the gas, particularly at higher liquid loads. In fact, numerical evaluations of the aforementioned model showed a rather retrograde non-monotonic behavior of pressure drop with respect to the f factor of the gas near flooding at different liquid loads. A calculation procedure was therefore devised in this work to correctly compute the <b>flooding</b> <b>point</b> for a given liquid load when using the aforementioned modeling approach.

The test section is made of Pyrex glass tube to allow visual observation. The inner diameter of the test tube is 7 mm and the height is 1 m. The inclination of test tubes varied from vertical to crank type with various horizontal lengths. Waterair flow and lubricant oil-air flow were examined {{through a series of}} experiment at various liquid flow rates.

Flow reversal point represents the air flow rate when the liquid film begins to flow downwards in the tube below the liquid inlet location. Whole supplied liquid flows upward when the gas flow rate is larger than this value. So the flow reversal point can be interpreted as oil return criterion and the flow reversal points were measured using various shape of test section {{in a wide range of}} liquid flow rate. The gas velocities for the flow reversal point appeared to be similar over a certain range of liquid flow rate. <b>Flooding</b> <b>point</b> was defined as the air flow rate when liquid starts to flow above the liquid inlet part.

A direct comparison with the efficiency of operation of a Rotating Disc Contactor was made by carrying out the identical experiments in each case. The general differential equations for the extract and raf-finate phases in a differential contactor model have been derived by several methods. The relationship between the sign of each term in the differential equation and the direction of phase flow has been considered.

Ten independent conditioning factors, like LULC, elevation, slope, TWI, surface runoff, landform, lithology, distance from the main river, soil texture and soil drainage were derived from the geospatial data sets and used as input into the FR model towards flood prone area mapping. As the result suggests, these ten variables are likely to be major factors to map flood-affected zone. The FR model was used to establish the relationship between past and future flood occurrences. 143 <b>flooded</b> <b>points</b> were generated through “create fishnet” analysis of the PNGRIS national database, field investigation and satellite data before and after flood events. Random sampling technique was used to select 70 % input flood data and to calculate frequency ratio for each parameters and their subclasses (Rahmati et al. 2016 b). The use of stratified random sampling would be difficult to generate frequency ratio for all classes under each parameter. So random sampling has been mooted by the authors as the prudent choice in this type of studies. FR values for different categories of all conditioning factors were calculated based on the 100 <b>flood</b> training <b>points</b> (70 %). The validation report indicated a higher prediction accuracy of 97.7 % which had been enough to validate the FR model that was used for this study. It is obvious that a higher number of input data sets generate higher accuracy. FR model requires a large number of <b>flood</b> <b>points</b> as training like 70 % (or 100 points) to generate Frequency Ratio, whereas a less number of input data do not fall under all classes of every parameter.

To validate the superiority, we sought to compare the method used in this study (FR model) with another multi-criteria decision support approach (MCDA) (Samanta et al. 2016 a) which was conducted in the same river basin. As per our assessment, FR model produced better results compared to MCDA. This FR model can be used in any other geographical area to develop a flood risk map which can help planners and decision makers to perform proper flood management in future.|$|R

Firstly, to measure the Sauter diameter of ethanol in excess oil done in laboratory by self-modified syringe tube by releasing droplet form the bottom of measuring cylinder. For the second experiment, several ratios of oil to ethanol prepared mixed vigorously for 20 minutes at 450 C. The time for settlement and height of two layers formed recorded. Finally for the third experiment, several ratios of oil to ethanol prepared and mixed vigorously for 20 minutes at 450 C and the mixture tested for the viscosity, shear rate and rpm in viscometer.

In the meantime, the result of liquids mixing shows that the solubility of ethanol increased proportionally with the volume of ethanol at 450 C.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A multi-stage, crosscurrent column, {{packed with}} Pall rings, was {{employed}} for oxygen absorption from an oxygen-rich air phase by contacting with water. Mass transfer {{data were collected}} for the column using 6 and 12 baffles and employing a partial gas phase recycle. Data were also collected from a countercurrent column having the same volume of packing as the crosscurrent column. The mass transfer efficiency for the column was determined {{using a variety of}} liquid to gas flowrate ratios and covering a range of liquid flowrates. Efficiencies were highest for flowrates above the transition point to crosscurrent flow. Efficiencies increased with decreasing liquid to gas ratios. Efficiences were higher with the larger number of baffles. Higher oxygen concentrations in the gas phase were created while using a gas phase recycle. The increased oxygen concentrations resulted in increased mass transfer efficiencies and increased oxygen utilization. The location of the transition point was correlated as a function of liquid flowrate and liquid to gas ratio. An earlier study, performed on the same column but using a different gas-liquid system and different ranges of flowrates, presented similar data. Comparison of the data from this study and the previous one shows that more information must be collected to determine which factors significantly influence the location of the transition point. The mass transfer efficiency for the countercurrent column was greater than for the crosscurrent column when similar flowrates were tested. However the flow-through capacity of the crosscurrent column was much greater than the flow-through capacity possible with the coutercurrent column. At flowrates above the <b>flooding</b> <b>point</b> for the countercurrent column the crosscurrent column achieved efficiencies which were comparable to the maximum efficiencies for the countercurrent column.
