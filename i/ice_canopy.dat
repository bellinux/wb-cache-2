40|$|Groundwater {{storage is}} an {{important}} parameter in water resource management, land-surface processes and hydrological cycle. However, the traditional instruments {{are very difficult to}} monitor global groundwater storage variations due to high cost and strong labor intensity. In this paper, the global total terrestrial water storage (TWS) is derived from approximately 10 years of monthly geopotential coefficients from GRACE observations (2002 August- 2012 April), and the groundwater storage is then obtained by subtracting the surface water, soil moisture, snow, <b>ice</b> and <b>canopy</b> water from the hydrological models GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) and WGHM (WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model). The seasonal, secular and acceleration variations of global groundwater storage are investigated from about 10 years of monthly groundwater time series. Annual and semiannual amplitudes of GRACE-WGHM and GRACE-GLDAS are almost similar, while WGHM groundwater results are much smaller. The larger annual amplitude of groundwater variations can be up to 80 mm, e. g., in Amazon and Zambezi Basins, and the smaller annual amplitude of groundwater variations is less than 10 mm, e. g., in Northern Africa with larger deserts. The annual and semi-annual phases agree remarkably well for three independent results. In the most parts of the world, the groundwater reaches the maximum in September-October each year and the minimum in March-April. The mean trend and acceleration of global groundwater storage variations are 1. 86 mm/y and - 0. 28 mm/y(2) from GRACE-GLDAS, and 1. 20 mm/y and - 0. 18 mm/y(2) from GRACE-WGHM, respectively, while the WGHM model underestimates the trend and acceleration. Meanwhile the GRACE-GLDAS is generally closer to in-situ observations in Illinois and satellite altimetry. Therefore, the GRACE-GLDAS provides the relatively reliable data set of global groundwater storage, which enables to detect large-scale variations of global groundwater storage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Between January 4 and 10, 1998, {{a severe}} ice storm {{impacted}} {{large areas of}} northern New York, New England, and eastern Canada. This storm struck the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire on January 7 - 8, 1998, and caused extensive forest crown damage (> 30 %) in a narrow elevation band (600 - 740 m) across the south-facing experimental watersheds. Stream water has been collected and chemically analyzed since 1963 in six experimental watersheds at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest; thus, {{we were able to}} examine the effect of this severe natural disturbance on watershed nutrient export and changes in instream nitrate (NO 3 -) processing. The ice storm caused large increases in watershed export of NO 3 - for 2 years after the disturbance, but our examination of in-stream processing suggests that NO 3 - losses would have been much more dramatic had there not been an increase in in-stream, nitrogen-processing efficiency after the <b>ice</b> storm. The <b>canopy</b> damage that resulted from the ice storm led to increased light availability and large inputs of woody debris to the stream. We suspect that increases in algal production and storage and processing of terrestrial litter account for the increase in inorganic nitrogen processing in these streams. Our results indicate that, without in-stream processing, export of NO 3 - from the damaged watersheds would have been 80 - 140 % higher than was observed. These results point to an intriguing negative feedback mechanism whereby the same disturbance that causes watershed NO 3 - loss may simultaneously lead to increased in-stream retention and transformation...|$|R
50|$|Sea ice can be {{classified}} according {{to whether or not}} it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline (or between shoals or to grounded icebergs). If attached, it is called landfast ice, or more often, fast ice (from fastened). Alternatively, and unlike fast ice, drift ice occurs further offshore in very wide areas, and encompasses ice that is free to move with currents and winds. The physical boundary between fast ice and drift ice is the fast ice boundary. The drift ice zone may be further divided into a shear zone, a marginal ice zone and a central pack. Drift ice consists of floes, individual pieces of sea ice 20 m or more across. There are names for various floe sizes: small - 20 m to 100 m; medium - 100 m to 500 m; big - 500 m to 2000 m; vast - 2 km to 10 km; and giant - more than 10 km. The term pack ice is used either as a synonym to drift ice, or to designate drift ice zone in which the floes are densely packed. The overall sea ice cover is termed the <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> from the perspective of submarine navigation.|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{propagation}} in the Arctic and Antarctic {{is largely}} characterised {{by the presence}} of a highly variable <b>ice</b> <b>canopy.</b> To model sound in these environments requires both a way of effectively representing the ice layer and modelling its effect on signal transmission. The Ocean Acoustics Library has a powerful open source Acoustics Toolbox that contains Fortran code for running Ray, Normal Mode, and Wavenumber Integration models. There are two parts to modelling a sea ice environment: modelling the ice as an elastic acoustic medium, and modelling the roughness of the ridging characteristics of the ice. This work considers the scenario of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) producing a survey under ridged sea ice. This specifies a range of interest of 10 km and a frequency band of interest of 3 kHz- 13 kHz. An overview of methods for modelling ice as an acoustic medium and as a ridged surface is provided, and the applicability of different propagation and ice models for this scenario is discussed. The scenario is then implemented as a specific test case for two example <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> profiles. The <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> profiles used are sea ice draft measurements recorded in the Arctic using an upward looking SONAR on a nuclear submarine. Beam and ray methods are the only computationally fast propagation codes for this frequency range and are included in the BELLHOP module of the Acoustics Toolbox. With these methods the options for including the elastic properties of the ice are limited and only include reduction in the coherent field on reflection. Two methods for including the ridging of the <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> are implemented, one statistically based and one using direct input of measured <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> data. The statistically based method uses Twersky boss scattering, and the direct method inputs the draft data as an altimetry file. Gaussian beam tracing using BELLHOP is run to generate ray trace and coherent transmission loss estimates of this environment. The advantages and limitations of these implementations are discussed with suggestions for future improvements to the Acoustics Toolbox to better model the ice scenarios outlined. The improvements identified from this review and test case are: the capability to include specific ice condition data where available, better consideration of the elastic properties of the ice in BELLHOP; and new statistical methods for modelling unknown variable surface boundaries that provide statistical distribution information as well as mean field values...|$|E

40|$|The Arctic Ocean has {{experienced}} wide-spread decreases in sea ice concentrations that may impact various marine ecosystems. This study analyzes yearlong ocean acoustic recordings from north of Barrow, Alaska, to provide baseline measurements prior to possible increases in anthropogenic activities. In September 2006, two autonomous High-frequency Acoustic Recording Packages (HARPs) were deployed to the seafloor (250 m), where sound was continuously recorded by hydrophones for nine months. Ice conditions during the recordings included open water, pack <b>ice</b> formation, shore-fast <b>canopies,</b> and thermal breakup, providing {{a wide range}} of Arctic Ocean acoustic measurements. Spectral-averaging was used to determine received sound-pressure levels. Across the low-frequency band, fall was the noisiest season, reaching 87 dB re [mu]Pa between 20 - 60 Hz, while 10 % of October was exposed to noise above 130 dB re [mu]Pa at 10 Hz and 112 dB re [mu]Pa between 20 - 30 Hz; seismic airguns were present from September to November. Acoustic data was compared with sea ice concentration and wind speed; during summer and fall, sound-pressure spectrum levels correlate directly with high wind speeds, typically indicative of low-pressure atmospheric events. Throughout winter and spring, strong winds and thermal fracturing in sea ice opens leads, resulting in correlations with spectral energy-peaks. Bioacoustic recordings of cetaceans and pinnipeds were analyzed using long-term spectral-averages to determine presence or absence on an hourly basis. Combined with ancillary measurements, long-term acoustic monitoring is an effective tool for observing changing levels of ambient sound related to sea ice dynamics, environmental noise- generating mechanisms, and anthropogenic noise, while simultaneously detecting marine mammal...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of underwater acoustic signals in polar regions {{is dominated by}} an upward refracting sound speed environment {{and the presence of}} a dynamic highly variable <b>ice</b> <b>canopy.</b> This paper provides an overview of the acoustic properties of sea ice and assesses the influence of <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> and water column properties on acoustic transmission loss for propagation within 20 km of a sound source at 20 m depth. The influence of the <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> is assessed first as a perfectly flat surface, and then as a statistically rough surface. A Monte Carlo method is used for the inclusion of ice deformation and roughness. This involves the creation of sets of synthetic ice profiles based on a given sea ice thickness distribution, followed by statistical methods for combining the output of individually evaluated ice realisations. The experimental situation being considered in the framing of this problem is that of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operating within 50 m of the surface. This scenario is associated with a frequency band of interest of 9 - 12 kHz and a horizontal range of interest up to 20 km. The situation has been evaluated for a set of typical ice statistics using Ray and Beam acoustic propagation techniques. The sound speed profile (based on real data) results in a strong defocussing of direct path signals at ranges from 9 - 20 km and depths shallower than 50 m. This reduction in the signal strength of the direct path creates areas where the influence of surface reflected paths becomes significant. The inclusion of a perfectly flat ice layer reduces the transmission loss between 9 - 20 km by 15 - 50 dB. When the ice layer is included as a rough surface layer the results show a boost to signal strength of up to 8 dB in the small areas of maximum defocussing. Sea ice is a strongly time and space varying sea surface and exists in area...|$|E

40|$|The second Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite mission {{currently}} {{planned by}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration will measure global <b>ice</b> topography and <b>canopy</b> height using the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System {ATLAS). The ATLAS comprises two lasers; {{but only one}} will be used at a time. Each laser will generate between 125 watts and 250 watts of heat, and each laser has its own optimal operating temperature that must be maintained within plus or minus 1 degree Centigrade accuracy by the Laser Thermal Control System (LTCS) consisting of a constant conductance heat pipe (CCHP), a loop heat pipe (LHP) and a radiator. The heat generated by the laser is acquired by the CCHP and transferred to the LHP, which delivers the heat to the radiator for ultimate rejection. The radiator can be exposed to temperatures between minus 71 degrees Centigrade and minus 93 degrees Centigrade. The two lasers can have different operating temperatures varying between plus 15 degrees Centigrade and plus 30 degrees Centigrade, and their operating temperatures are not known while the LTCS is being designed and built. Major challenges of the LTCS include: 1) A single thermal control system must maintain the ATLAS at 15 degrees Centigrade with 250 watts heat load and minus 71 degrees Centigrade radiator sink temperature, and maintain the ATLAS at plus 30 degrees Centigrade with 125 watts heat load and minus 93 degrees Centigrade radiator sink temperature. Furthermore, the LTCS must be qualification tested to maintain the ATLAS between plus 10 degrees Centigrade and plus 35 degrees Centigrade. 2) The LTCS must be shut down {{to ensure that the}} ATLAS can be maintained above its lowest desirable temperature of minus 2 degrees Centigrade during the survival mode. No software control algorithm for LTCS can be activated during survival and only thermostats can be used. 3) The radiator must be kept above minus 65 degrees Centigrade to prevent ammonia from freezing using no more than 135 watts of heater power. 4) The LHP reservoir control heater power is limited to 15 watts with a 70 percent duty cycle. 5) The voltage of the power supply can vary between 26 volts direct current and 34 volts direct current during the spacecraft lifetime. A design analysis shows that a single LTCS can satisfy these requirements. However, shutdown of the LHP is particularly challenging and the shutdown heater must be wired in series with two reservoir thermostats and two CCHP thermostats at different set points. An LTCS demonstration unit has been tested to verify these performance characteristics experimentally prior to proceeding to the final LTCS design and fabrication. Test results showed that the LHP shutdown scheme would be able to shut down the LHP as designed and the reservoir control heater can maintain the ATLAS mass simulator within the plus or minus 1 degrees Centigrade accuracy under various combinations of the heat load, sink temperature, and power supply voltage...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of low frequency seismo-acoustic {{waves in the}} Arctic Ocean <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> is examined through the analysis of hydrophone and geophone data sets collected in 1987 at an ice camp designated PRUDEX in the Beaufort Sea. Study of the geophone time series generated by under-ice explosive detonations reveals not only the expected longitudinal and flexural waves in the ice plate, but also an unexpected horizontally-polarized transverse (SH) wave arriving at a higher amplitude than the other wave types. The travel paths of all three observed wave types {{are found to be}} refracted in the horizontal plane along a line coincident with a known ridge separating the <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> locally into two distinct half-plates, the first of thin first year ice and the second of thicker multi-year ice. The origin of the SH wave appears to be near the detonation and not associated with the interaction of longitudinal, flexural or waterborne waves with the ridge line. The need to determine the exact location of each detonation from the received time series highlights the dramatic superiority of geophones over hydrophones in this application, as does the ability to detect the anomalous SH waves and the refracted ray paths, neither of which are visible in the hydrophone data. Inversion of the geophone data sets for the low frequency elastic parameters of the ice is conducted initially by treating the ice as a single homogeneous isotropic plate to demonstrate the power of SAFARI numerical modeling in this application. A modified stationary phase approach is then used to extend SAFARI modeling to invert the data sets for the elastic parameters of the tow ice half-plates simultaneously. The compressional/shear bulk wave speeds estimated in the half-plates, 3500 / 1750 m/s in the multi-year ice and 3000 / 1590 m/s in the new ice, are comparable to previously obtained values; however, the compressional/shear attenuation values in the tow half-plates, 1. 0 / 2. 99 dB/[Lamda] and 1. 0 / 2. 67 dB/[Lamda], respectively, are somewhat greater than previously measured values and four times greater than estimates extrapolated from high frequency data[URL] Navy (U.

40|$|This work identifes and investigates {{acoustic}} conditions relevant to ship based operation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) under Antarctic sea ice. The principal {{objective of the}} project was to predict the detectability of acoustic status and emergency beacons used by AUVs in an Antarctic sea-ice deployment environment. The key acoustic issues identified were deployment noise, the inuence of water column and sea <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> properties on acoustic propagation, and the source and receiver locations. This work contributes to this endeavour in three ways: the first is the measurement of a noise profile of the Australian Antarctic Division's research and resupply vessel the Aurora Australis while parked in Antarctic sea ice; the second is an investigation of the influence of water column properties and sea ice roughness on signal propagation using acoustic modelling and simulation; and the third is the inclusion of field measured Antarctic water and ice data in acoustic models to assess variability and create detectability estimates. Experiments were carried out in the Antarctic Ocean in November 2010 and September- November 2012. The noise profile of the Aurora Australis showed the reduction in deployment noise through shutting down of the main engine which resulted in a 10 dB reduction at 10 kHz when measured below 200 m depth. The influence of a generalised sea <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> was assessed with multiple statistically generated simulated ice draft profiles in acoustic modelling tool BELLHOP. Initial simulation using a sound speed profile from Antarctic field trials highlighted the impact of the surface reflected path in regions where defocusing of the direct path was created by the sound speed profile. Further exploration of the Antarctic water and ice environment examined the variability of these media and found that the shape of the sound speed profile was the most significant influence for consistency of direct path propagation. Inhomogeneities in direct path propagation resulting from the characteristics of the sound speed profile led to a greater influence of the surface reflected path than {{in the case of a}} linear upward refracting sound speed profile. When modelling acoustic reflections from the underside of the <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> the inclusion of statistical surface roughness, obtained from AUV mounted multibeam and drill line measurements, was found to have a signifcant influence on transmission loss and range estimates. Inclusion of the field results in detectability calculations provided a method for combining noise and signal variability into a useful form for estimating safe working ranges. Graphs are presented showing detectability fields for a 10 kHz signal with a probability of detection of 0 : 5 and probability of false alarm of 10. A range of field measured noise and environmental variables were used to show the variability in detection field. Safe operating ranges were found to vary from 5 km to over 20 km for different ship noise and ice surface conditions. The main contributions of this work are the combination and analysis of Antarctic field measured environmental and AUV deployment conditions with an acoustic propagation modelling tool. A method is provided for estimating safe operating ranges using ice roughness statistics and highlights the importance of realistic sound speed profiles.

Two methods for modeling {{particles in the}} <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> are contrasted. The first is a 'traditional' approach employing Marshall-Palmer ice spheres.

Results from the alternative approach are superior to those from the traditional method in the anvil and mature convective core. In the decaying convective region, the traditional approach yields better agreement with observed magnitudes. Neither method, however, matches the geometry of the observed TB depression associated with the decaying convective core.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. An extensive field program {{during the spring}} and summer in the coastal Beaufort Sea test site has been completed using a wide variety of sensing techniques. Reduction of field data and ERTS- 1 image analysis have shown the coastal environment to be complexly influenced by unique processes, most of which involve or are related to sea ice. Active sedimentologic processes along the Arctic coast are set in motion by the melting, flooding, and eventual overflow of rivers onto the sea ice. It is now apparent that only minor amounts of sediment are transported offshore at this stage; however, scouring of the bottom is significant beneath the strudels (drain holes) which develop in the fast <b>ice</b> <b>canopy</b> in the region of overflow. Areal salinity and turbidity patterns together with ERTS- 1 imagery confirm a consistent influx of colder, clearer, saltier water towards the coast just east of the Colville River. Strong (up to 3 knots) bidirectional but intermittent currents often manifest themselves in imagery and aerial photographs as wakes behind grounded ice. Ice movement vectors generated from repetitive images indicate that ice drift is closely associated with wind direction, especially in shallow bays, and displacements of 4 - 22 kilometers were noted in 24 hours...|$|E
40|$|Flexural {{oscillations}} {{of floating}} sea ice sheets induced by ocean waves travelling at {{the boundary between}} the ice and the water below can propagate great distances. But, by virtue of scattering, changes of ice thickness and other properties encountered during the journey affect their passage, notwithstanding attenuation arising from several other naturally occurring agencies. We describe here a two-dimensional model that can simulate wave scattering by long (approx. 50 [*]km) stretches of inelastic sea ice, the goal being to replicate heterogeneity accurately while also assimilating supplementary processes that lead to energy loss in sea ice at scales that are amenable to experimental validation. In work concerned with scattering from solitary or juxtaposed stylized features in the sea <b>ice</b> <b>canopy,</b> reflection and transmission coefficients are commonly used to quantify scattering, but on this occasion, we use the attenuation coefficient as we consider that it provides a more helpful description when dealing with long sequences of adjoining scatterers. Results show that scattering and viscosity both induce exponential decay and we observe three distinct regimes: (i) low period, where scattering dominates, (ii) high period, where viscosity dominates, and (iii) a transition regime. Each regime’s period range depends on the sea ice properties including viscosity, which must be included for the correct identification of decay rate. Gareth L. Vaughan, Luke G. Bennetts and Vernon A. Squir...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Northward flowing rivers of Alaska inundate extensive areas of sea ice during spring breakup. This {{process has been}} studied under the ERTS- 1 program. Drainage of large volumes of fresh water through the ice at holes and cracks (strudel) causes scour depressions, over 4 m deep, and up to 20 m across in the sea floor below. Strudel scours occur within 30 km of river mouths, generally in areas where ERTS- 1 imagery shows less potential for drifting ice to scour the bottom than elsewhere. The shapes and distribution patterns of strudel scours correspond with those of strudel seen in the <b>ice</b> <b>canopy.</b> Densities of scours are highest in the inner areas of overlfow. But strudel scours also occur outside of overflow areas mapped during the last several years. These must be very old. One strudel scour investigated by diving {{is surrounded by a}} rim, has vertical walls exposing a tundra horizon, and terminates at a gravel layer 4 m below the lagoon floor. Another terminates at a semi-consolidated layer of silty clay. The gravel and silty clay are pre-Holocene deposits. Mixing of Holocene marine with older sediments by vertical strudel flow causes great variability in sediment types over small areas. These observations complicate interpretation of shallow water deposits of cold climates...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{discovery}} of the “Boulder Patch”, an area of cobbles and boulders with attached kelp and invertebrate life, is reported from Stefansson Sound, near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Geophysical surveys using side-scan sonar and low-frequency recording fathometers reveal that cobbles and boulders occur in patches of various sizes and densities. Despite a seasonal influx of sediments, the Boulder Patch is a nondepositional environment. Physical disruption of cobbles and boulders by deep draft ice is minimal due to offshore islands and shoals which restrict the passage of large ice floes into Stefansson Sound. The apparent absence of similar concentrations of rocks with attached biota along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast is explained by the scarcity of rocks in areas protected from ice abrasion and with no net sediment deposition. In Stefansson Sound, the rocks provide a substratum for a diverse assortment of invertebrates and several species of algae. Recolonization by the biota was minimal on twelve boulders denuded and then left undisturbed for a three-year period. Sedimentation and grazing activity {{appear to be the}} major factors inhibiting recolonization. Linear growth in the kelp, Laminaria solidungula, is greatest in winter and early spring when nutrients are available for new tissue growth. The plant draws on stored food reserves to complete over 90 % of its annual linear growth during the nine months of darkness under a turbid <b>ice</b> <b>canopy.</b> These reserves are accumulated by photosynthetic activity during the preceding summer. The total carbon contribution made by kelp in Stefansson Sound under these conditions is about 146 x lo 6 gyr ” or 7 g. m- 2. yr”. A small percentage of this carbon is consumed directly by herbivores, but its importance to other organisms is not known and is under investigation...|$|E
40|$|The highest {{resolution}} Holocene sediment core {{from the}} Antarctic Peninsula to date was {{collected during the}} first SHALDRIL cruise (NBP 0502). Drilling yielded a 108. 2 -m-long core (87 % recovery; site NBP 0502 – 1 B) from Maxwell Bay, South Shetland Islands. This high-resolution sediment record comes from a region that is currently experiencing dramatic climate change and associated glacial retreat. Such records can help to constrain the nature of past climate change and causal mechanisms, {{and to provide a}} context for evaluating current climate change and its impacts. The base of the drill site sampled till and/or proximal glacimarine sediments resting directly on bedrock. Glacimarine suspension deposits composed of dark greenish gray silty mud with variable diatom abundance and scattered very fine sand laminations make up the majority of the sedimentary section. Detailed sedimentological and geochemical analyses, including magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon (TOC) content, carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition, pebble content, and biogenic silica content, allow subdivision of the glacimarine section into nine units, and seismic facies analyses resulted in the identification of six distinct seismic units. We used 29 radiocarbon ages to construct an age model and calculate sedimentation rates that vary by two orders of magnitude, from 0. 7 mm/a to ? 30 mm/a. Radiocarbon ages from glacimarine sediments just above the till date back to between 14. 1 and 14. 8 ka. Thus, ice was grounded in the fjord during the Last Glacial Maximum and eroded older sediments from the fjord. Following initial retreat of grounded ice from Maxwell Bay, the fjord was covered by a permanent floating <b>ice</b> <b>canopy,</b> probably an ice tongue. The highest sedimentation rate corresponds to an interval that contains abundant sand laminations and gravelly mud intervals and likely represents a melt-out phase or period of rapid glacial retreat from 10. 1 ka to 8. 2 ka. There is no evidence for an early Holocene climatic reversal, as recorded farther south at the Palmer Deep drill site. Minimum sea-ice cover and warm water conditions occurred between 8. 2 and 5. 9 ka. From 5. 9 to 2. 6 ka, there was a gradual cooling and more extensive sea-ice cover in the bay. After 2. 6 ka, the climate varied slightly, causing only subtle variation in glacier grounding lines. There is no compelling evidence for a Little Ice Age readvance in Maxwell Bay. The current warming and associated glacial response in the northern Antarctic Peninsula appears to be unprecedented in its synchroneity and widespread impact. <br/...|$|E
