5|$|After the war, Patton {{became the}} {{military}} governor of Bavaria, {{but he was}} relieved of this post because of his statements trivializing denazification. He commanded the United States Fifteenth Army for slightly more than two months. Patton died in Germany on December 21, 1945, {{as a result of}} <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> an automobile accident twelve days earlier.|$|E
5|$|Every year, Florida averages 10 {{deaths and}} 30 <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> {{lightning}} strikes, {{with several of}} these usually occurring in or around Tampa. University of Florida lightning expert Martin A. Uman has calculated that the average resident is within a half-mile of 10 to 15 lightning strikes every year. TECO Energy, the local electric utility, spends over USD $1,000,000 annually to repair transformers and other equipment damaged by lightning strikes.|$|E

5|$|On land, young sea otters {{may face}} attack from bears and coyotes. In California, bites from sharks, {{particularly}} great white sharks, have been estimated to cause 10% of sea otter deaths and {{are one of}} the reasons the population has not expanded further north. The great white shark is believed to be their primary predator, and dead sea otters have been found with <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> shark bites, although there is no evidence that sharks actually eat them.|$|E
5|$|On the Potomac River, where tides ran {{well above}} normal, ships broke free from their {{moorings}} and drifted downstream. In one instance, a large steamship called the George Leary struck and damaged six other ships. Numerous vessels capsized in the river, including the steamer Mary Washington and the schooner John W. Linnell. At the Washington Navy Yard, multiple buildings sustained damage. Overall losses in Washington, D.C. were approximately $400,000, {{and at least}} two dozen individuals in the city suffered <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> falling debris.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} caused by a hunter's illegal fire that got out of control, and it was named for its {{proximity}} to the Rim of the World vista point, a scenic overlook on Highway 120 leading up to Yosemite. A total of eleven residences, three commercial structures, and 98 outbuildings were destroyed in the fire. A total of ten <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> the wildfire were also reported, but no firefighters were killed during the suppression efforts which cost more than $127 million (2013 USD).|$|E

5|$|The most {{destructive}} {{of the weather}} events, an EF4 tornado, traveled {{for nearly an hour}} through four counties in Oklahoma during the evening of February10. It destroyed 114residences in Lone Grove alone. All casualties (8 deaths and 46 <b>injuries)</b> <b>from</b> the outbreak were due to the tornado in the Lone Grove area in Carter County. It was the deadliest tornado to hit Oklahoma since May3, 1999 and the strongest tornado during the month of February in Oklahoma since 1950.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} heavy surf {{along the}} western coastline, {{as well as a}} storm tide of 4.78feet (1.46m) at Clearwater Beach. The wave action caused minor beach erosion, with 50–60feet (15–18m) of sand washed away at Bradenton Beach. The increased ocean action caused minor flooding along several roads in the Tampa Bay area, which trapped some automobile travelers. At Indian Shores, a woman died after sustaining <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> the rough surf.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E

5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock {{climbing}} that is performed on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls, without the use of ropes or harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E
5|$|High winds from Jimena {{knocked down}} trees and damaged power lines, leaving 1,300 {{residents}} without electricity. Heavy rainfall {{from the storm}} also caused minor flooding {{on the eastern side}} of the Big Island. Offshore, high surf and strong currents brought by the storm resulted in 350 swimmers being rescued by the United States Coast Guard, residents, and state and local police and fire departments. Overall there were no fatalities or <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> Hurricane Jimena. The name Jimena was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2004 and was used in the 2009 season.|$|E

5|$|However, a {{burst of}} intense neutron and gamma {{radiation}} came directly from the fireball. Its lethal radius was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Sultan Iskandar {{was accused}} of causing {{the death of a}} golf caddy in Cameron Highlands by assault, {{following}} an incident in which the golf caddy laughed when the Sultan missed a hole. Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, pointed out that the Sultan (then the Agong) could not be prosecuted due to the immunity that was accorded to the rulers, yet he condemned Sultan Iskandar's actions at the same time. In the end the matter was let off without much public attention. The brother of the caddy – who also suffered <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> the incident, being distressed from what he saw, subsequently ran amok in Kuala Lumpur and had to be quarantined in a mental hospital.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by <b>injuries</b> <b>from</b> his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E
