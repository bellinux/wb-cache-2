500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the same thing is happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E

5000|$|I Heard a Voice - Live from Long Beach Arena is {{the first}} live DVD release from the rock band AFI. It was {{released}} on December 12, 2006. The concert was filmed at the Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California on Friday, September 15, 2006. Part of the Decemberunderground Tour, the crowd was the largest AFI had ever headlined with over 13,000 people in attendance. The concert was shot in HD with more than 23 cameras. The title of this DVD is lifted from a line of poetry in the decemberunderground CD booklet. Underneath the song 37mm, it says: [...] "The power went out. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio. The power went out. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio.

He believed in the American dream with all his heart, he was the honest man of his generation. Now <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> television and see Americans without jobs, without food and without a chance to help themselves.

O'Brien and the other players had originally intended to be at the marathon's finish line during the time at which bombs exploded, killing and injuring several spectators and runners. Scratches for that night's game against the Boston Bruins, the players changed their plans at the last minute and elected to return to their hotel for a nap instead. [...] "Sure enough I wake up from a nap and have a bunch of text messages. <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TV ... it was just a twist of fate. It's definitely something that's hard to think about it. Thank goodness we didn't go", said O'Brien.|$|E
5000|$|In {{interviews}} {{made for}} the British documentary film Beyond Citizen Kane (1993), the Minister of Justice Armando Falcão (1974-1979) confirmed that [...] "Roberto Marinho never gave me any problems. When I was the minister in charge of censorship {{and he was the}} director of the TV Globo network, Radio Globo, Radio Mundial and Radio Eldorado, he never gave me any trouble." [...] The military president Médici (1969-1974) even claimed in an interview, about Jornal Nacional prime time news, [...] "I feel good every evening when <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TV to watch Jornal Nacional. While the news report of strikes, protests, attacks and conflicts {{in various parts of the}} world, Brazil marches in peace, towards development. It is as if I took a tranquilizer after a day's work".

[...] "Para-Noir" [...] contains a distinctive guitar solo from John 5, who performed it in one take using an unfamiliar, out-of-tune guitar whilst blindfolded. [...] "Ka-Boom Ka-Boom" [...] was the final song composed for the record, and was written in response to criticism made by the head of the A&R division of Interscope Records, who said that the album [...] "had no kaboom". In a 2008 interview with a now-defunct fansite, Manson claimed to have performed the majority of the keyboards and synthesizer on the album, and not the band's longtime keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy. According to Manson, Gacy displayed little interest in contributing creatively, and eventually detached himself from the rest of the group to such a degree that he refused to attend studio sessions when informed that recording was to begin in June 2002. As a result, Manson received musical composition credits for eleven of the fifteen tracks on the record, in addition to his usual lyrical credits.|$|E

5000|$|... "Do {{you write}} with a {{fountain}} pen?" [...] is an inevitable question one gets at readings and such public appearances. The {{assumption is that}} if only one picked the right tool, one could do that! ... But to get {{that out of the}} way, I write on a computer (an ancient Mac Performa I'm about to replace) and correct drafts with a fountain pen (Pelikan, Mont Blanc, Cross, Waterman, Parker, Sheaffer - I have a pleasing array of them). I wake sometime between seven and nine, depending on how late I was up reading the night before. I pour my coffee and bring it to the computer in the small study that was originally a dressing room. <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> CD player (at the moment, the Shostakovich preludes and fugues are playing), check the email, reply to whatever's urgent, play a few games of solitaire, and then get to what I'm working on. There is almost always a longish project to which I can repair for entertainment and occupation. But I will put that aside, whatever it is, if a poem presents itself to me. ... I write until noon and then have a light lunch. The mail usually comes in around midday, and I'll look through that. I may read a little (in connection with some project or other, or in search of one, or just for entertainment) or look at newspapers or magazines (the usual ones, but The Georgia Review, Pequod, and Shenandoah are on the nightstand at the moment). If the work has been going well, I may put in another hour in the afternoon. Or I will run errands and shop. Or cook, which is pleasant to do after a session with words because it's physical and tactile, and the payoff is immediate. I generally exercise for half an hour (on a stationary bicycle, usually watching Inside Politics on CNN, which is the best — or least bad — thing on then). My wife gets home around 6:30 PM, and inasmuch as the main purpose of writing is to get through the day until drinks-time, I can pop a cork and declare the day a success.|$|E

40|$|Human {{behavior}} {{is a function}} of an iterative interaction between the stimulus environment and past experience. It is {{not simply a matter of}} the current stimulus environment activating the appropriate experience or rule from memory (e. g., if it is dark and I hear a strange noise outside, then <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside lights and investigate). Rather, it is a dynamic process that takes into account not only things one would generally do in a given situation, but things that have recently become known (e. g., there have recently been coyotes seen in the area and one is known to be rabid), as well as other immediate environmental characteristics (e. g., it is snowing outside, I know my dog is outside, I know the police are already outside, etc.). All of these factors combine to inform me of the most appropriate behavior for the situation. If it were the case that humans had a rule for every possible contingency, the amount of storage that would be required to enable us to fluidly deal with most situations we encounter would rapidly become biologically untenable. We can all deal with contingencies like the one above with fairly little effort, but if it isn't based on rules, what is it based on? The assertion of the Cognitive Systems program at Sandia for the past 5 years is that at the heart of this ability to effectively navigate the world is an ability to discriminate between different contexts (i. e., Dynamic Context Discrimination, or DCD). While this assertion in and of itself might not seem earthshaking, it is compelling that this ability and its components show up in a wide variety of paradigms across different subdisciplines in psychology. We begin by outlining, at a high functional level, the basic ideas of DCD. We then provide evidence from several different literatures and paradigms that support our assertion that DCD is a core aspect of cognitive functioning. Finally, we discuss DCD and the computational model that we have developed as an instantiation of DCD in more detail. Before commencing with our overview of DCD, we should note that DCD is not necessarily a theory in the classic sense. Rather, it is a description of cognitive functioning that seeks to unify highly similar findings across a wide variety of literatures. Further, we believe that such convergence warrants a central place in efforts to computationally emulate human cognition. That is, DCD is a general principle of cognition. It is also important to note that while we are drawing parallels across many literatures, these are functional parallels and are not necessarily structural ones. That is, we are not saying that the same neural pathways are involved in these phenomena. We are only saying that the different neural pathways that are responsible for the appearance of these various phenomena follow the same functional rules - the mechanisms are the same even if the physical parts are distinct. Furthermore, DCD is not a causal mechanism - it is an emergent property of the way the brain is constructed. DCD is the result of neurophysiology (cf. John, 2002, 2003). Finally, it is important to note that we are not proposing a generic learning mechanism such that one biological algorithm can account for all situation interpretation. Rather, we are pointing out that there are strikingly similar empirical results across a wide variety of disciplines that can be understood, in part, by similar cognitive processes. It is entirely possible, even assumed in some cases (i. e., primary language acquisition) that these more generic cognitive processes are complemented and constrained by various limits which may or may not be biological in nature (cf. Bates & Elman, 1996; Elman, in press) ...|$|E
