25|$|If a small, <b>discrete</b> <b>stock</b> {{had existed}} in the Bay of Biscay, then {{localized}} hunting by the Basques {{may have led to}} its over-exploitation and subsequent (near) disappearance there. A third possibility, perhaps the most plausible, would be that there are (or were) two populations, one in the western North Atlantic and the other in the eastern North Atlantic. Such a view would conform well with the mainly coastal distribution of right whales in the western North Atlantic today. Still, this possibility would result in the harvest of right whales not only in the Bay of Biscay, but in Iceland, Northern Norway, and the rest of Europe, which may have been enough to severely deplete this supposed stock.|$|E

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{management of}} a stock representing a metapopulation has been simulated in a case study loosely based upon herring {{to the west of}} the British isles, where stocks are currently assessed and managed by management area, although there is evidence of mixing between stocks (in terms of connectivity, migrations, and exploitation). The simulations evaluate scientific advice (based on virtual population analysis, VPA) and the sustainability of fishing under two population-structure scenarios, corresponding either to <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks,</b> which only mix on the feeding grounds, or where diffusion between stocks takes place. The ability of stock assessment to monitor stock status and exploitation levels was evaluated for defining stocks based on fishing areas and for stocks that combined fishing areas.

40|$|This thesis explores an {{alternative}} method of assessing {{the status of}} commercially exploited fish stocks. Aggregate numerical least-squares regression methods are most often used to estimate fin fish population numbers by age of fish within the stock. These methods, commonly called virtual population analysis (VPA) or cohort analysis, provide single point static estimates of stock size. In this thesis, the state-of-age aggregated stock components are tracked {{over the course of}} each season. Data about fish stock spatial-temporal migration dynamics and partial observations from catches by the commercial fishery are used to update stock status estimates {{over the course of the}} season. Stock status is described in a probability distribution over <b>discrete</b> <b>stock</b> classes. A Bayesian updating procedure is used to take account of the partially observable catch information. The model requires a probabilistic description of the underlying stock dynamics in the form of a Markovian probability transition matrix, and a reliability measure that explicitly accounts for errors in observation. The spatial-temporal assessment approach is applied to the Scotia-Fundy herring stock in NAFO divisions 4 WX. The dynamics of the herring are described and the model is developed for a given season...|$|E

40|$|Otolith {{chemistry}} {{is widely used}} to understand patterns of fish movement and habitat use, with significant progress made in understanding the influence of environmental factors on otolith elemental uptake. However, few studies consider the interactive effect that environmental and genetic influences have on otolith chemistry. This study assessed the influence of salinity, temperature, and genetics on the incorporation of three key elements (strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and magnesium (Mg)) into the otoliths of two <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks</b> of mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) fingerlings reared in captivity. Elemental analysis via laser ablation inductively coupled – plasma mass spectrometry found that stock (genetics) had a significant interactive effect on otolith Sr:Ca (salinity × temperature × stock) and Ba:Ca (salinity × stock), but did not affect Mg:Ca incorporation. Mg:Ca showed a positive relationship with temperature for both stocks. The incorporation of some elements into the otoliths of fish {{is the result of}} complex interactions between extrinsic and intrinsic factors. These findings highlight the necessity to also consider stock along with environmental variables when using trace elemental signatures to reconstruct the environmental histories of fish. Thomas C.

40|$|High {{levels of}} gene flow are {{expected}} to produce genetic homogeneity among open-ocean populations of walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) because of few restrictions on migration. Although most genetic studies confirm this prediction, many surveys of morphology have detected differences among populations. Here, sequences of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I in nine samples (n 433) from Japan to Puget Sound were used to evaluate genetic population structure. Two haplotypes varied clinally across the North Pacific. These clines are likely {{the result of the}} isolation of populations in ice-age refugia, secondary post-glacial contact, and restricted long-distance dispersal. Overall, FST 0. 030 (p, 0. 001), but the greatest partition was attribu-table to differences between Asian and North American populations (FCT 0. 058, p 0. 036). Isolation by distance was detected across the North Pacific, but differentiation among populations within regions was minimal (FSC 0. 007, p, 0. 092).

40|$|An {{application}} of a mixture of Poisson distributions is proposed to model the discrete changes in stock price based on the minimum price movement known as `tick-size 2 ̆ 7. The parameters are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with a constant mixing probability as well as mixing probabilities which depend on order size. The model is evaluated using simulations and real data. Both the simulated and real data show reasonable estimates. Several adjustments are made to the model implementation to improve the efficiency with user written codes for the Newton Raphson algorithm and also implementing {{one of the most}} recent versions of the EM algorithm (PEM). Both the improvements show an exponentially increasing efficiency to the implementation. Further a Clustered Signed model is proposed to use summarized data {{to reduce the amount of}} data to be used in the model implementation using the discrete order sizes and the signs of the <b>discrete</b> <b>stock</b> price changes. The clustered model provided a significant time efficiency. A parametric bootstrap procedure is also considered to assess the significance of the order size on the mixing probabilities.

North Atlantic whaling for this species ended in 1987 and it is unclear if the populations are recovering. The stock structure in the North Atlantic is still under debate, but several lines of evidence suggest that fin whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence may form a <b>discrete</b> <b>stock</b> with limited exchange {{with the rest of}} the North Atlantic. We applied mark-recapture models to 21 yr of photo-identification data from the Jacques-Cartier Passage to estimate the abundance and, for the first time, a survival rate based on live re-sightings for this stock of fin whales. Using the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, we estimated a unisex non-calf apparent survival rate of 0. 955 (95 % CI: 0. 936 to 0. 969) for the period 1990 to 2010, declining in the last 4 yr of the study. The reduced survivorship was likely caused by a lower site fidelity combined with a higher mortality. The POPAN model yielded a super-population estimate of 328 individuals (95 % CI: 306 to 350) for the period 2004 to 2010, and confirmed the negative trend in apparent survival and annual abundance, indicating that the population has not increased since the last large-scale surveys from 1974 and 1997...|$|E

Despite the large geographic separations, values of Neis unbiased genetic distance, D (0. 004 - 0. 048) and standardised genetic variation among populations, Fst (0. 011 - 0. 055) were small. The levels of gene flow (Nm = 8) {{found in this study}} prevent the effect of differentiation among populations by genetic drift. This findings indicate that its long-lived planktotrophic larvae provides this species with considerable dispersal ability throughout its range which is favoured by the ocean currents along the chilean coast. In terms of management of the M. chilensis fishery, the results provide no evidence for <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks,</b> {{with the possible exception of}} the Punta Arenas population.

40|$|Herring {{along the}} west coast of the British Isles are managed and {{assessed}} as a series of <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks.</b> The relationship between the spawning components, mixed (feeding) aggregations, and juveniles in nursery areas for these stocks was modelled by discriminant analysis and integrated stock mixture analysis based on otolith elemental composition data. The relative elemental concentrations produced otolith signals corresponding to three main groupings of nursery-ground fish representing the Irish Sea, Scottish sea lochs, and the Minch. There were significant differences among spawning groups in the otolith concentrations of Li, Na, Mg, Mn, Sr, and Ba. Inclusion of length-at-age information improved the classification rates, ranging overall from 35 to 100 %. Spawning groups consist of individuals from a number of different nursery areas and originate from several different management areas. Each of the mixed aggregations contained at least three spawning components. Results suggest that most west coast herring belong to interconnected populations subject to mixing and that populations are not discrete, so the current practice of assessments based on individual spawning components will probably not provide sufficiently robust information for management advice.

40|$|Patterns of circuli groupings within {{scales are}} used to {{determine}} the stock structure of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). The methodology typically employed involves using trained scale readers to interpret and manually measure circuli spacing patterns. These measurements are used as input into Linear Discriminant function Analysis (LDA) to determine stock structure. This pilot study introduces a new technique, probabilistic neural networks, to evaluate scale patterns for stock composition. We compare the method directly to LDA by using the same measurement data as input. We then explore Fourier analysis of luminance profiles of the scale images as an objective means to classify scale patterns. The samples used in the pilot study are from two Canadian stocks and one Alaskan stock encountered in South-east Alaskan fisheries. Correctly identifying these stocks has been a challenging problem for fisheries management. The probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) used for this study were implemented using proprietary software (Ward Systems Neuroshell®).

Adults (larger than about 80 cm FL) spawn in tropical and sub-tropical waters between about 10 °S and 25 °S during the austral summer (Ramon and Bailey 1996), with juveniles recruiting to surface fisheries in New Zealand coastal waters {{and in the}} vicinity of the sub-tropical convergence zone (STCZ − about 40 °S) in the central Pacific about two years later, at a size of 45 − 50 cm fork length (FL). From this region, albacore appear to gradually disperse to the north (Figure 1), but may make seasonal migrations between tropical and sub-tropical waters. Albacore are relatively slow growing, and have a maximum fork length (FL) of about 120 cm. They grow at a rate of approximately 10 cm per year from ages 2 to 4, with growth rate declining in a classic von Bertalanffy fashion thereafter (Labelle et al. 1993).

40|$|The bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas, is an {{important}} euryhaline predator that is exploited throughout its range for meat and fins. This species is taxonomically paired with the pigeye shark, C. amboinensis. Validity of this group has not been directly tested using molecular markers. Genetic variation and phylogeny was examined with concatenated datasets of mitochondrial genes (cytb, cox 1 and 12 stRNA 16 s) for nineteen species, from three families within the order Carcharhiniformes. Whilst there were indications of species pairings within the genus, {{there was no evidence}} to suggest that the bull and pigeye sharks should be considered a species group. Phylogenetic analysis failed to resolve Carcharhinus, but confirmed Negaprion as a sister taxon and placed Prionace glauca within Carcharhinus. It remains unclear if the family Sphyrnidae, arose from a Rhizoprionodon or Scoliodon ancestor and future revision of this complex group of sharks is required. Like other large carcharhinid species, C. leucas exhibits a low reproductive rate and long generation times. It is susceptible to localised depletions and such declines have been documented. The global stock structure was assessed by analysing the mitochondrial control region in 245 individuals sampled from eight populations in three ocean basins. The bull shark exhibits relatively high haplotype diversity (0. 896 ± 0. 010) when compared to other globally-distributed sharks and the nucleotide diversity was similar to others from the genus (0. 00465 ± 0. 00014). There was significant stock structure found among populations (ΦST= 0. 736, p< 0. 00001) and among ocean basins (ΦCT= 0. 527, p= 0. 00653). Geneflow between the US Atlantic coastline and Gulf of Mexico was sufficient to consider the area to be a single panmictic population.

40|$|Background: High {{throughput}} {{next-generation sequencing}} technology has enabled {{the collection of}} genome-wide sequence data and revolutionized single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in {{a broad range of}} species. When analyzed within a population genomics framework, SNP-based genotypic data may be used to investigate questions of evolutionary, ecological, and conservation significance in natural populations of non-model organisms. Kokanee salmon are recently diverged freshwater populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that exhibit reproductive ecotypes (stream-spawning and shore-spawning) in lakes throughout western North America and northeast Asia. Current conservation and management strategies may treat these ecotypes as <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks,</b> however their recent divergence and low levels of gene flow make in-season genetic stock identification a challenge. The development of genome-wide SNP markers is an essential step towards fine-scale stock identification, and may enable a direct investigation of the genetic basis of ecotype divergence. Results: We used pooled cDNA samples from both ecotypes of kokanee to generate 750 million base pairs of transcriptome sequence data. These raw data were assembled into 11, 074 high coverage contigs from which we identified 32, 699 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms.

This species is a culturally important food fish in the Mariana Archipelago and subject to high fishing pressure. Our primary hypothesis was to test whether the individuals resident in the southern Mariana Island chain were genetically distinct and hence should be managed as <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks.</b> In addition to spatial sampling of adults, newly-settled individuals were sampled on Guam over four recruitment events {{to assess the}} temporal stability of the observed spatial patterns, and evidence of self-recruitment. We found significant genetic structure in S. spinus across the western Pacific, with Bayesian analyses revealing three genetically distinct clusters: the southernMariana Islands, east Micronesia, and the west Pacific; with the southern Mariana Islands beingmore strongly differentiated fromthe rest of the region. Analyses of temporal samples from Guam indicated the southern Mariana cluster was stable over time, with no genetic differentiation between adults versus recruits, or between samples collected across four separate recruitment events spanning 11 months. Subsequent assignment tests indicated seven recruits had self-recruited from within the Southern Mariana Islands population. Our results confirm the relative isolation of the southern Mariana Islands population and highlight how local processes can act to isolate populations that, {{by virtue of their}} broad-scale distribution, have been subject to traditionally high gene flows.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five essays exploring {{the validity of}} some extensively used financial models {{with a focus on}} the Swedish equity and derivative markets. The essays are of both an empirical and a theoretical nature. In the first paper, The Search for Chaos and Nonlinearities in Swedish Stock Index Returns, an investigation of the presence of nonlinearities in general and chaos in particular on the Swedish stock market is performed. Some properties of stock returns are hard to grasp with linear models. Nonlinearities must be introduced and can be of both a stochastic and a deterministic nature. In the former case, the movements are generated by external shocks, although these shocks may exhibit complicated interdependences. In the latter case, the movements are self-generating due to the nonlinear dynamics of the system, but still behave in a way seemingly indistinguishable from pure randomness. This is called chaotic motion, or chaos. Since the stock market crash of 1987 in particular, much effort has been made, trying to uncover the existence of different types of nonlinearities in financial and economic time series. Using the BDS test, we examine whether the rejection of the null hypothesis of IID stock returns arises from nonlinear or linear dependences in the conditional mean process, chaos, nonstationarities, or autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH). The results indicate that ARCH-effects are responsible for the rejections of IID. The second paper, The Compass Rose Pattern of the Stock Market: How Does it Affect Parameter Estimates, Forecasts, and Statistical Tests?, deals with the discrete nature of stock returns, imposed by the fact that stock prices move in discrete steps, or ticks. Recently, a geometrical pattern in a scatter plot of stock returns versus lagged stock returns, has been found. We believe that the effects of discreteness need a closer examination and, in this paper, we do Monte Carlo simulations on artificial stock prices with different degrees of rounding. We find AR-GARCH parameter estimates to be affected by the discreteness imposed by rounding. On basis of the compass rose and the discreteness we investigate different possibilities of improving predictions of stock returns, theoretically and empirically. The distributions of some correlation integral statistics, that is, the BDS test and Savit and Green's dependability index, are also influenced by the compass rose pattern. However, throughout the paper, we must impose heavy rounding of the stock prices to find significant effects on our estimates, forecasts, and statistical tests. Discreteness in stock returns is also the issue in the third paper, GARCH Estimation and <b>Discrete</b> <b>Stock</b> Prices. The results from the previous paper indicate the break-down of statistical models and tests based on state-continuity as the tick size to price ratio increases. Still, modeling such low-price stocks might be desirable in many situations. The continuous-state GARCH model is often used in modeling financial asset returns, but is misspecified if applied to returns calculated from discrete price series. I propose a modification of the above model for handling such cases, by modeling the dependent variable as an unobserved stochastic variable. The focus is on the GARCH framework, but the same ideas could also be used for other stochastic processes. Using Swedish stock price data and a stochastic optimization algorithm, that is, simulated annealing, I compare the parameter estimates and asymptotic standard errors from the approximative and the extended model. I find small deviations between the two models for longer time series, but larger differences for shorter series, mainly in the conditional variance parameters. None of the models provide continuous residuals. By constructing generalized residuals, I show how valid residual diagnostic and specification tests can be performed. The fourth paper, A Neural Network Versus Black-Scholes: A Comparison of Pricing and Hedging Performances, studies option pricing. The Black-Scholes formula is a well-known model for pricing and hedging derivative securities. It relies, however, on several highly questionable assumptions. This paper examines whether a neural network (MLP) can be used to find a call option pricing formula better corresponding to market prices and the properties of the underlying asset than the Black-Scholes formula. The neural network model is applied to out-of-sample pricing and delta-hedging of daily Swedish stock index call options from the period 1997 - 1999. The relevance of a hedge-analysis stressed in this paper. The Black-Scholes model with historical and implicit volatility estimates is used as benchmarks. Comparisons reveal that the neural network models outperform the benchmarks both in pricing and hedging performances. The moving block bootstrap procedure is used to test the statistical significance of the results. Although the neural networks are superior, the results are often insignificant at the 5 % level. In the fifth paper, Comparison of Mean-Variance and Exact Utility Maximization in Stock Portfolio Selection, portfolio optimization is considered. The mean-variance approximation to expected utility maximization has been subject to much controversy ever since introduced by Markowitz. Given different correlated assets, how shall an investor create a portfolio maximizing his expected utility? The validity of the mean-variance approximation has been verified, but only in the limited case of choosing among 10 - 20 securities. This paper examines how well the approximation works in a larger allocation problem. The effects of limited short selling of the risky assets, as well as including synthetic options, that is, assets with high levels of skewness and kurtosis, in the security set is also explored. The results show that the mean-variance approximative portfolios have less skewness than the exact solution portfolios, but welfare losses, measured as the reduction in the certainty equivalent, are still small...|$|E
40|$|Lutjanus carponotatus {{ranges from}} the Indian Ocean to {{northern}} Australia and Papua New Guinea {{and is an}} important species for both commercial and recreational fisheries. Due to its life history characteristics and fishing pressures, L. carponotatus is vulnerable to overfishing and suitable management is essential. This phylogenetic and population genetic study assessed the population genetic structure of L. carponotatus at seven locations in three bioregions in Western Australia (WA) using the mitochondrial DNA control region. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated no genetic differentiation among locations within (øCT = 0. 051) and among bioregions (øSC = − 0. 026). Phylogenetic analyses indicated no geographic partitioning within WA, though two distinct lineages were found. Within these two lineages {{there was no significant}} spatial partitioning, suggesting a panmictic population that can, under current conditions, be managed as a single stock. WA and Great Barrier Reef (GBR) population genetic data were then combined to determine the broad-scale connectivity between the east and west coast of Australia. L. carponotatus from the GBR did differ significantly (FST = 0. 64, p = < 0. 001) from the WA population, indicating the two populations do not exchange any migrants and should be managed as <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks.</b> As an indicator of population resilience, genetic variability was compared among WA and GBR populations of L. carponotatus and we show that the WA population has almost three times the genetic variability of the GBR population, suggesting that it will be better able to adapt to environmental change expected during the 21 st century...|$|R

Data from the 22 most {{reliable}} parasites gave no evidence of <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks</b> of skipjack tuna in the Pacific, either when analyzed singly or when using combinations of parasites in multivariate analyses. New Zealand fish carried many tropical parasites, particularly didymozoids, in numbers similar to fish caught in the tropics, indicating {{that the bulk of}} these fish had recently migrated from the tropics. The number of Ten­ !(J! 2 ̆ 7 U(J" 2 ̆ 7;(J coryphaena. e, a larval tapeworm, was positively correlated to fish size in the tropics. In New Zealand, however, fish over 55 em carried about the same number of T. corypha. enae as fish 45 to 55 em, SUI!;l.;csting they had left the tropics when they were 45 to 55 cm and had not returned. Analysis of the numbers of parasites from particular schools suggested that school members stayed together for several weeks but not for life. The use of parasites to delineate stocks for manage­ ment purposes is a well-established technique. For a comprehensive review of the many examples see MacKenzie (1983). The skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, {{is one of the most}} valuable fishery resources of the central and western Pacific. At least 50 species of parasites have been reported from it. The distribution of only one, the hemiuroid digenean Hirudinella ventricosa, has previously been investigated. In the Atlantic, Watertor (1973) found it in 7...|$|R

40|$|Lethrinus miniatus and Lutjanus sebae are {{important}} commercial and recreational species of reef fish. Within Australian waters the former species is less widespread than the latter {{and has a}} discontinuous distribution, whilst the latter is continuously distributed in tropical Australian waters. The demographic attributes of these species (e. g. long life span, low rates of natural mortality) make them vulnerable to over-exploitation. Consequently, conservative harvest strategies including no-take zones for these species have been adopted by fisheries management agencies to control exploitation. Information on the genetic stock structure of these species is important for developing specific management strategies. However, {{little is known about}} genetic stock structures within and between east and west Australian populations of these species. The current study used the mitochondrial genome hypervariable region 1 (HVR 1) of the control region to examine variation between two sites from both the east and west Australian coasts for each species. HVR 1 for L. sebae did not differ genetically either within or between coasts (Fst 0. 15) at the sites studied, suggesting a panmictic population structure. Similarly, L. miniatus did not differ significantly between sites sampled within coast. However, the west coast HVR 1 for L. miniatus east and west coast populations, were discrete (Fst of at least 0. 92, p < 0. 0001). The degree of genetic sub-division between east and west coast populations indicates that they should be managed as <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks.</b> Further, when considering both species, the lower genetic (both haplotype and nucleotide) diversity in three of the four sites on the west coast of Australia, indicates that this region is genetically impoverished and neutrality tests suggest that selection is responsible. Consequently, west Australian populations will be less resilient to perturbations (e. g. fishing, climate change) than east Australian populations, which have higher genetic diversity...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Project CROOS, Collaborative Research on Oregon Ocean Salmon, is {{a unique}} {{partnership}} of scientists and commercial fishermen that combines catch location data with stock assignments obtained from genetic micro-satellite analysis to investigate the distribution of Oregon Chinook across multiple spatial scales. Using catch data collected by collaborating Oregon troll fishermen, we investigated the distribution of individual populations of Chinook salmon along the nearshore regions of the Oregon Coast. The study focused on two distinct spatial scales: 1) the coast-wide, latitudinal distribution of the 13 most abundant stocks {{that contributed to the}} Oregon catch in 2007, and 2) stock-based patterns of Chinook aggregation on spatial scales as low as tens to hundreds of meters. The description of spatial distribution was performed over time periods as short as two days and in season-long summaries. Based on 2007 catch data, we report three separate patterns in the coastal distribution of Oregon-caught Chinook. Stocks from the Sacramento River, Mid-Oregon Coast and Upper Columbia basin were distributed coast-wide in the Oregon catch. Chinook salmon that originated from northern California and southern Oregon were found to be more abundant south of 44 ° North – the approximate latitude of the coastal town of Florence, Oregon. Stocks from the north Oregon coast and the lower Columbia basin were primarily taken north of 44 ° North. We describe in-season and annual changes in the relative contribution of <b>discrete</b> <b>stocks</b> and in the age-structure of these stocks. Using distance-based metrics compared to random permutations, we found evidence from the ocean catch that Chinook salmon were sometimes closely proximate to river cohorts at sea. However, these discreet stocks were generally intermingled with other stocks in mixed-stock aggregations...|$|R
