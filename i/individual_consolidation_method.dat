40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{examine the}} {{improvement}} {{effect of the}} vacuum <b>consolidation</b> <b>method</b> in peat ground, which is composed of highly organic soil, test construction of an embankment was conducted for an expressway construction project on peat ground. Although the peat ground of the site is extremely soft, the vacuum <b>consolidation</b> <b>method</b> enabled {{the construction of a}} 10 -meter high embankment {{in a short period of}} time. After examining the test construction results, it was evident that the ratio of increments of the undrained shear strength to increments of the effective stress (△Cu / △σv’) in the peat layer to which the vacuum <b>consolidation</b> <b>method</b> was applied had a higher value than that of the peat layer to which no countermeasure was applied. In addition, the actual values of the settlement correspond to the calculated values obtained using Barron’s formula, which doesn’t take well resistance into account. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the key factors of the dynamic-static drainage <b>consolidation</b> <b>method</b> {{as it applies}} to a petroleum storage site that features very soft mud of strength as low as 8. 5 kPa. A field experiment was conducted to study the key factors on the success of this method such as effects of the number of tampings and the number of passes. The excess pore water pressures, settlements, field vane strengths were measured. Analysis of the results of measurements at the site leads to the conclusions that this method gives excellent results for strengthening the very soft mud. In addition, for a given total compaction energy, better result is obtained by increasing the number of passes with corresponding {{decrease in the number of}} tamping in each pass and limiting the compaction energy at a point for each pass to less than 1000 kN. m. Introudution The dynamic-static drainage <b>consolidation</b> <b>method</b> is a newly developed soil improvement technique based on combining the traditional dynamic compaction with the static consolidation method[1 - 2]. While the dynamic compaction method is suitable for application to granular soils, it is inapplicable to soft clay.

40|$|Abstract Background One {{method to}} {{understand}} and evaluate an experiment that produces a large set of genes, such as a gene expression microarray analysis, is to identify overrepresentation or enrichment for biological pathways. Because pathways are able to functionally describe the set of genes, much effort {{has been made to}} collect curated biological pathways into publicly accessible databases. When combining disparate databases, highly related or redundant pathways exist, making their consolidation into pathway concepts essential. This will facilitate unbiased, comprehensive yet streamlined analysis of experiments that result in large gene sets. Methods After gene set enrichment finds representative pathways for large gene sets, pathways are consolidated into representative pathway concepts. Three complementary, but different <b>methods</b> of pathway <b>consolidation</b> are explored. Enrichment Consolidation combines the set of the pathways enriched for the signature gene list through iterative combining of enriched pathways with other pathways with similar signature gene sets; Weighted Consolidation utilizes a Protein-Protein Interaction network based gene-weighting approach that finds clusters of both enriched and non-enriched pathways limited to the experiments' resultant gene list; and finally the de novo <b>Consolidation</b> <b>method</b> uses several measurements of pathway similarity, that finds static pathway clusters independent of any given experiment. Results We demonstrate that the three <b>consolidation</b> <b>methods</b> provide unified yet different functional insights of a resultant gene set derived from a genome-wide profiling experiment. Results from the methods are presented, demonstrating their applications in biological studies and comparing with a pathway web-based framework that also combines several pathway databases. Additionally a web-based consolidation framework that encompasses all three methods discussed in this paper, Pathway Distiller ([URL]), is established to allow researchers access to the methods and example microarray data described in this manuscript, and the ability to analyze their own gene list by using our unique <b>consolidation</b> <b>methods.</b> Conclusions By combining several pathway systems, implementing different, but complementary pathway <b>consolidation</b> <b>methods,</b> and providing a user-friendly web-accessible tool, we have enabled users the ability to extract functional explanations of their genome wide experiments. </p...|$|R

Load consolidation {{is a widely}} used practice in transportation. Load consolidation is grouping of several small shipments into one container while satisfying logistics system constraints. In this paper, two simple load consolidation approaches, which are known as 'quantity-based consolidation' and 'time and quantity-based consolidation' are evaluated. These approaches are 'non-recurrent', in which the logistics system has a 'target time' or 'target weight' before the accumulation of the orders. Some performance measures for these methods are investigated through a case study. The study is performed in a 3 P-logistics company operating from Gaziantep. Due {{to the complexity of}} the logistics processes, effects of the load <b>consolidation</b> <b>methods</b> are evaluated via process modelling and simulation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} a design method for improving the ground around piles using the vacuum <b>consolidation</b> <b>method,</b> one of various ground improvement methods, and using the increased ground strength to reflect onto the horizontal resistance of piles. This is a rational design method that can reduce construction costs for site conditions with soft ground, where horizontal resistance determines pile specifications. In this design method, the range of influence of the horizontal resistance, or the range of ground improvement requiring the vacuum <b>consolidation</b> <b>method,</b> is set from 1 /β (the characteristic length of piles: β= 4 √(KD) /(4 EyI)) to the range of passive earth pressure,θ= 45 °+φ/ 2. The horizontal subgrade reaction of piles is determined by converting the shear strength C of ground, increased by consolidation, to the modulus of deformation E. The validity of the design method was empirically verified by applying it to an actual site and conducting horizontal loading tests on actual piles.

However, the behavior of this combination on the ground deformation is not fully clarified on FLVCM, fill design and site management is depending on the experienced technique. In this study, numerical simulation has been carried out by finite element method (FEM) for the quantitative evaluation of the deformation suppression effect of FLVCM on the soft grounds of ariake clay, Japan. The utility of FLVCM was confirmed from comparison with the observed and the analytical ground deformation. In addition, the numerical simulation have been carried out under the various conditions of vacuum preand post-loading pressures and fill speeds, and it is suggested that the reasonable construction management index can be easily obtained by the site measurement of deformation...|$|R
