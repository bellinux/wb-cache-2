50|$|<b>Econometric</b> <b>models</b> are {{statistical}} models used in econometrics. An <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> specifies the statistical relationship that {{is believed to}} hold between the various economic quantities pertaining to a particular economic phenomenon under study. An <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> {{can be derived from}} a deterministic economic model by allowing for uncertainty, or from an economic model which itself is stochastic. However, it is also possible to use <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> that are not tied to any specific economic theory.|$|R

A hybrid assisted method, which combines programs written by user, and specialized software used for symbolic calculus has been proposed. The contents and mathematical expression of an <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> is presented, {{the nature of}} the endogen, exogenous and residual variables and considerations on the elaboration and using of the econometrics model, the phases of an <b>econometric</b> <b>model,</b> an example of an <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> and further approaches have been presented as well...|$|R

40|$|Sales {{forecasting}} at the UPC {{level is}} important for the retailers in inventory planning. In practice, many retailers produce the forecasts using simple models with subjective adjustment for promotional events. The <b>econometric</b> <b>models,</b> which could be an effective way of incorporating promotional information, are not widely applied. This research examines the performance of the <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> in forecasting the product sales at the UPC level, asking whether this lack of application arises from poor performance compared to simple benchmarks. Standard models assume constant structure which may subsequently expose the models to structural breaks and then forecast failure. To tackle the problem, we modify the <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> with three approaches: impulse saturation, intercept correction and estimation window combining. Categories are considered as a basis for generalising the empirical results. 29 categories were segmented using conceptual mapping technique and experiments were conducted for those which are distinguishable and representative. The results show that the <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> outperform the benchmark (simple) models for most of the categories and their forecasting performance can be further improved by the modification approaches, especially for the non-promoted forecast period. The explanation may lie {{in the fact that the}} <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> take concerns of the competitive promotional information. However, for one distinct category- the “Front-end-candies”, the benchmark models proved superior. For the promoted period, the unmodified <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> generally yield the best performance. One implication of our research is to use the unmodified <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> and the modified <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> to forecast the promoted period and the non-promoted period separately...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} outline a method, termed 'theoretical reconstruction,' {{which allows the}} system {{properties}} of any econometric macromodel {{to be related to}} a simpler theoretical model. First, elements of the <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> which involve significant additional theoretical complexity compared to the theory model are removed. This process continues until the properties of the 'deconstructed' <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> match those of the reference theory. Second, the <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> is gradually reconstructed, noting at each point how each element of additional complexity influences the model properties. The technique is illustrated using fiscal policy changes and the U. K. <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> COMPACT. Coauthors are Julia Darby, Jonathan Ireland, and Ottavio Ricchi.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> to short-term forecasting, {{that is to}} say, forecasting up to one year ahead, has naturally enough been extensively discussed. Some of the discussion has centred on the usefulness of <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> in general for this purpose as against other forecasting methods. It is clearly realised that short-term forecasting by means of non-econometric methods is not only possible but may give better results than are obtained {{by the use of}} <b>econometric</b> <b>models.</b> It is therefore quite legitimate to argue against the use of models in the realm of short-term forecasting. If, on the other hand, one believes that <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> can make a useful contribution in this field, then the question arises what kind of models are most appropriate for this purpose...|$|R

50|$|More {{recently}} Nell {{has worked}} with his colleague Karim Errouaki on the methodological foundations of structural econometrics. The position exposed by Martin Hollis and E.J Nell (1975)'s Rational Economic Man was further extended and developed in their recent book Rational Econometric Man, Edward Elgar, 2013). They argued that is not too farfetched to see Hollis and Nell (1975) Rational Economic Man {{as a foundation for}} reconstructing the scientific foundations of structural econometrics; one might say Rational Econometric Man. They argued that there are good reasons for considering Hollis and Nell's (1975) framework as a foundation for reconstructing structural econometrics, a foundation that complements and extends the original ideas of Trygve Haavelmo. Haavelmo's (1944) work is probably the most important landmark in the history of <b>econometric</b> <b>modelling.</b> It is a remarkable monograph which, unfortunately for econometrics, became a classic much too early, part of the reason it is misunderstood.

In so doing, they also outline a number of elements that will be needed to develop a 'good' macro-econometric model of an advanced economy.|$|E
