Next to these popular, ideologically affirmative incarnations of vampire mythology, and more {{in the margins of}} contemporary vampire culture, there exists also another type of vampire, which has its origins in the lesser-known female vampire who first came to existence in the nineteenth century: Carmilla Karnstein.
