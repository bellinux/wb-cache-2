25|$|The organs mainly {{involved}} in heme synthesis are the liver (in which {{the rate of}} synthesis is highly variable, depending on the systemic heme pool) and the bone marrow (in which rate of synthesis of Heme is relatively constant and depends on the production of globin chain), although every cell requires heme to function properly.

Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of hemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism. Defects in various enzymes in synthesis of heme can lead to group of disorder called porphyrias, these include acute intermittent porphyria, congenital erythropoetic porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, <b>hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria,</b> variegate porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria.|$|E
25|$|The acute porphyrias are acute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP), {{variegate porphyria}} (VP), amino levulinic acid dehydratase deficiency (ALAD) and <b>hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria</b> (HCP). These diseases primarily affect the nervous system, resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks. The major symptom of an acute attack is abdominal pain, often accompanied by vomiting, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), and tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate). The most severe episodes may involve neurological complications: typically motor neuropathy (severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that innervate muscle), which leads to muscle weakness and potentially to quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs) and central nervous system symptoms such as seizures and coma. Occasionally, there may be short-lived psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and, very rarely, overt psychosis. All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes. Porphyria is not a cause of chronic psychiatric illness, though an association with anxiety and depression has been suggested.|$|E

30|$|Porphyrias are {{metabolic}} disorders {{caused by}} altered activity of enzymes within the heme biosynthetic pathway [7]. Porphyrias {{can be classified}} as “acute” (present characteristically with neurovisceral manifestations) or “cutaneous” (present characteristically with skin lesions) [7]. Acute porphyrias include delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria, <b>hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria,</b> and VP. Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria results in neurovisceral symptoms only. The prevalence of skin lesions increases {{in the order of}} acute intermittent porphyria, <b>hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria,</b> and VP. VP is generated by the PPOX mutation, which can cause various symptoms. The most common symptom of VP is skin lesions and is observed frequently compared with other types of acute porphyria. Skin lesions are seen in 10 – 50 % of VP patients. Our patient did not have skin lesions.|$|E

40|$|Three {{siblings}} {{with intense}} jaundice and hemolytic anemia at birth {{were found to}} excrete {{a high level of}} coproporphyrin in their urine and feces; the pattern of fecal porphyrin excretion was atypical for <b>hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria</b> because the major porphyrin was harderoporphyrin (greater than 60 %; normal value is less than 20 %). The lymphocyte coproporphyrinogen III oxidase activity of each patient was 10 % of control values, which suggests a homozygous state. Both parents showed only mild abnormalities in porphyrin excretion and lymphocyte coproporphyrinogen III oxidase activity decreased to 50 % of normal values, as is expected in heterozygous cases of <b>hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria.</b> Kinetic parameters of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase from these patients were clearly modified, with a Michaelis constant 15 - 20 -fold higher than normal values when using coproporphyrinogen or harderoporphyrinogen as substrates. Maximal velocity was half the normal value, and we also observed a marked sensitivity to thermal denaturation. The possibility that a mutation affecting the enzyme on the active center which is specifically involved in the second decarboxylation (from harderoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrinogen) was eliminated by experiments on rat liver that showed that coproporphyrinogen and harderoporphyrinogen were metabolized at the same active center. The pattern of porphyrin excretion and the coproporphyrinogen oxidase from the three patients exhibited abnormalities that were different from the abnormalities found in another recently described homozygous case of <b>hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria.</b> We suggest naming this variant of coproporphyrinogen oxidase defect "harderoporphyria. ...|$|E

40|$|The acute porphyrias include acute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP), <b>hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria</b> and {{variegate porphyria}} (VP).

Despite a detailed biochemical understanding of these diseases, the pathophysiology of the neurological manifestations is poorly understood.

40|$|The acute or {{inducible}} hepatic porphyrias comprise four inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis.

40|$|<b>Hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder {{resulting from the}} half-normal activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO), a mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing the antepenultimate step in heme biosynthesis. The mechanism by which CPO catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation, in an extraordinary metal- and cofactor-independent manner, is poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of human CPO at 1. 58 -Å resolution. The structure reveals a previously uncharacterized tertiary topology comprising an unusually flat seven-stranded β-sheet sandwiched by α-helices. In the biologically active dimer (KD = 5 × 10 - 7 M), one monomer rotates relative to the second by ≈ 40 ° to create an intersubunit interface {{in close proximity to}} two independent enzymatic sites. The unexpected finding of citrate at the active site allows us to assign Ser- 244, His- 258, Asn- 260, Arg- 262, Asp- 282, and Arg- 332 as residues mediating substrate recognition and decarboxylation. We favor a mechanism in which oxygen serves as the immediate electron acceptor, and a substrate radical or a carbanion with substantial radical character participates in catalysis. Although several mutations in the CPO gene have been described, the molecular basis for how these alterations diminish enzyme activity is unknown. We show that deletion of residues (392 - 418) encoded by exon six disrupts dimerization. Conversely, harderoporphyria-causing K 404 E mutation precludes a type I β-turn from retaining the substrate for the second decarboxylation cycle. Together, these findings resolve several questions regarding CPO catalysis and provide insights into <b>hereditary</b> <b>coproporphyria...</b>|$|E
