5|$|Following {{announcements}} {{that the}} band had begun composition of new material and booked studio time in early 2010 with Kevin Shirley producing, The Final Frontier was announced on 4 March.

5|$|In early 1969, Quaife {{told the}} band he was leaving. The other members {{did not take}} his {{statement}} seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling {{the rest of the}} Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>as</b> a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>as</b> evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E

5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways.

Shells have had various uses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>as</b> body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>As</b> {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E
