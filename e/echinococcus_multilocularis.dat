Methodology/Principal Findings: Using Western blot analysis, qPCR and immunohistochemistry, we measured the levels of MAPKs activation, Cyclins, PCNA, Gadd 45 b, Gadd 45 c, p 53 and p 21 expression in the murine AE model, from day 2 to 360 post-infection.

This research tested the hypothesis that overgrazing might promote <b>Echinococcus</b> <b>multilocularis</b> transmission through increasing populations of small mammal, intermediate hosts in Tibetan pastoral communities. METHODS: Grazing practices, small mammal indices and dog <b>Echinococcus</b> <b>multilocularis</b> infection data were collected to analyze the relation between overgrazing and <b>Echinococcus</b> <b>multilocularis</b> transmission using nonparametric tests and multiple stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: In the investigated area, raising livestock was a key industry. The communal pastures existed and the available forage was deficient for grazing. Open (common) pastures were overgrazed and had higher burrow density of small mammals compared with neighboring fenced (private) pastures; this high overgrazing pressure on the open pastures measured by neighboring fenced area led to higher burrow density of small mammals in open pastures. The median burrow density of small mammals in open pastures was independently associated with nearby canine <b>Echinococcus</b> <b>multilocularis</b> infection (P = 0. 003, OR = 1. 048).
