40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort is to perform design analyses for a non-nuclear hot-hydrogen materials tester, {{as a first step}} towards developing efficient and accurate multiphysics, thermo-fluid computational methodology to predict environments for hypothetical solid-core, nuclear thermal engine thrust chamber design and analysis. The computational methodology is based on a multidimensional, finite-volume, turbulent, chemically reacting, thermally radiating, unstructured-grid, and pressure-based formulation. The multiphysics invoked in this study include hydrogen dissociation kinetics and thermodynamics, turbulent flow, convective, and thermal radiative heat transfers. The goals of the design analyses are to maintain maximum hot-hydrogen jet <b>impingement</b> <b>energy</b> and to minimize chamber wall heating. The results of analyses on three test fixture configurations and the rationale for final selection are presented. The interrogation of physics revealed that reactions of hydrogen dissociation and recombination are highly correlated with local temperature and are necessary for accurate prediction of the hot-hydrogen jet temperature...|$|E
40|$|A hot air {{anti-icing}} system {{of a gas}} turbine engine inlet is analyzed numerically. A three-dimensional potential flow code, which accounts for compressibility effects, is {{used to determine the}} flowfield in and around the inlet. A particle trajectory code is developed using a local linearization technique. The trajectory code is used to calculate local water <b>impingement</b> rates. <b>Energy</b> balances are performed on both the surface runback water and the metallic skin to determine their temperature distributions. A variety of test cases are considered in order to validate the various numerical components of the process as well as to demonstrate the procedure...|$|R
40|$|In the XYZ color space, the {{subset of}} the tri-stimuli {{corresponding}} to spike-type (monochromatic) <b>impingement</b> of <b>energy</b> is the chromaticity cone, CC. Using a family of concentric spheres, we describe a nonlinear transformation over the CC and construct a bijection from the CC onto the flat plane. In the process, we open up the CC and {{view it as a}} chart on the plane. Because the map is a bijection, the color perception information is preserved (invariant) through the transformation. We discuss stereographic projection of the chromaticity chart and some examples. Comment: 20 pages, 31 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{specially}} {{textured surface}} of pyrolytic graphite exhibits extremely low yields of secondary electrons and reduced numbers of reflected primary electrons after <b>impingement</b> of high <b>energy</b> primary electrons. An ion flux having an energy between 500 eV and 1000 eV and a current density between 1. 0 mA/sq cm and 6. 0 mA/sq cm produces surface roughening or texturing {{which is in}} the form of needles or spines. Such textured surfaces are especially useful as anode collector plates in high efficiency electron tube devices...|$|R
40|$|A {{plurality}} of heat pipes in a shell receive concentrated solar energy and transfer {{the energy to}} a heat activated system. To provide for even distribution of the <b>energy</b> despite uneven <b>impingement</b> of solar <b>energy</b> on the heat pipes, absence of solar energy at times, or failure {{of one or more}} of the heat pipes, energy storage means are disposed on the heat pipes which extend through a heat pipe thermal coupling means into the heat activated device. To enhance energy transfer to the heat activated device, the heat pipe coupling cavity means may be provided with extensions into the device. For use with a Stirling engine having passages for working gas, heat transfer members may be positioned to contact the gas and the heat pipes. The shell may be divided into sections by transverse walls. To prevent cavity working fluid from collecting in the extensions, a porous body is positioned in the cavity...|$|R
40|$|In {{industrial}} applications involving spray-cooling, combustion, and so on, prediction {{of the maximum}} spreading diameter of a droplet impinging on a solid surface permits a quantitative estimation of heat removal and energy consumption. However, {{although there are many}} experimental studies regarding droplet impingement behaviour, theoretical models have an applicability limit for predicting the maximum spreading diameter. In the present study, we have developed an analytical model for droplet <b>impingement</b> based on <b>energy</b> conservation that considers adhesion energy in both horizontal and vertical directions at the contact line. The theory is validated by our experiment and existing experimental data possessing a wide range of Weber numbers. We demonstrate that our model can predict Î²m (i. e., the maximum spreading diameter normalised in terms of initial droplet diameter) for various Newtonian liquids ranging from micro- to millimetre-sized droplets on different solid surfaces and can determine the transition between capillary and viscous regimes. Furthermore, theoretical relations for scaling laws observed by many researchers are derived...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} are presented for sub-scale ion optics systems comprised of 7 and 19 aperture pairs with geometrical {{features that are}} similar to the HiPEP ion optics system. Effects of hole diameter and grid-to-grid spacing are presented as functions of applied voltage and beamlet current. Recommendations are made for the beamlet current range where the ion optics system can be safely operated without experiencing direct <b>impingement</b> of high <b>energy</b> ions on the accelerator grid surface. Measurements are also presented of the accelerator grid voltage where beam plasma electrons backstream through the ion optics system. Results of numerical simulations obtained with the ffx code are compared to both the impingement limit and backstreaming measurements. An emphasis is placed on identifying differences between measurements and simulation predictions to highlight areas where more research is needed. Relatively large effects are observed in simulations when the discharge chamber plasma properties and ion optics geometry are varied. Parameters investigated using simulations include the applied voltages, grid spacing, hole-to-hole spacing, doubles-to-singles ratio, plasma potential, and electron temperature; and estimates are provided for the sensitivity of impingement limits on these parameters...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanisms}} {{that control the}} operation of this combustor, an experimental setup is developed with access for detailed optical measurements. Propane is employed as fuel because the absence of liquid drops and combustion generated particulates in the combustion region significantly simplifies the optical diagnostics. The experimental techniques utilized include acoustic pressure measurements, space and time resolved radiation measurements, steady temperature measurements, exhaust flow chemical analysis, high speed video and intensified images of the reacting flow field by a computer based CCD camera imaging system. Flow visualization by the imaging system and the results from radiation intensity distribution measurements suggest that the periodic combustion processes caused by periodic vortex shedding and <b>impingement</b> provide the <b>energy</b> required to sustain the pressure oscillations. High radiation intensity occurs during {{a relatively short period}} of time and is in phase with the pressure oscillations, indicating that Rayleigh`s criterion is satisfied. Periodic variations of the air and fuel flow rates and, consequently, the air/fuel ratio of the reacting mixture inside the combustor appear to be another mechanism that contributes to the occurrence of periodic combustion and heat release processes. The presence of this mechanism has been uncovered by acoustic pressure measurements that revealed the presence of traveling pressure waves inside the air and fuel feed lines. These traveling waves produce periodic fuel and air feed rates which, in turn, result in periodic combustion and heat release processes within the combustor...|$|R
40|$|Electron Beam Induced Deposition (EBID) is an {{emerging}} additive nanomanufacturing tool which enables growth of complex 3 -D parts {{from a variety}} of materials with nanoscale resolution. Fundamentals of EBID and its application to making a robust, low-contact-resistance electromechanical junction between a Multiwall Carbon Nanotube (MWNT) and a metal electrode are investigated in this thesis research. MWNTs are promising candidates for next generation electrical and electronic devices, and one of the main challenges in MWNT utilization is a high intrinsic contact resistance of the MWNT-metal electrode junction interface. EBID of an amorphous carbon interface has previously been demonstrated to simultaneously lower the electrical contact resistance and to improve mechanical characteristics of the MWNT-electrode junction. In this work, factors contributing to the EBID formation of the carbon joint between a MWNT and an electrode are systematically explored via complimentary experimental and theoretical investigations. A comprehensive dynamic model of EBID using residual hydrocarbons as a precursor molecule is developed by coupling the precursor mass transport, electron transport and scattering, and surface deposition reaction. The model is validated by comparison with experiments and is used to identify different EBID growth regimes and the growth rates and shapes of EBID deposits for each regime. In addition, the impact of MWNT properties, the electron beam <b>impingement</b> location and <b>energy</b> on the EBID-made carbon joint between the MWNT and the metal electrode is critically evaluated. Lastly, the dominant factors contributing to the overall electrical resistance of the MWNT-based electrical interconnect and relative importance of the mechanical contact area of the EBID-made carbon joint to MWNT vs. that to the metal electrode are determined using carefully designed experiments.

40|$|In {{order to}} counter adverse effects {{resulting}} from the <b>impingement</b> of high <b>energy</b> plasmas on solid material surfaces, especially as this relates to fusion reactor high heat flux components, the idea of protecting the material surface with a thin film of liquid metal has been advanced. In principle, this film would protect the underlying substrate from physical sputtering and reduce thermal stresses in the structure. However, serious concerns related to establishing such a liquid metal flow and its performance in a fusion environment need to be addressed. In particular, {{the interaction of the}} conducting metal film with the complicated magnetic fields typical of a diverted reactor plasma may lead to retardation of the film resulting in channel flooding, velocity profiles not conducive to effective heat transfer, and possibly even detachment of the film from the substrate. In addition, the momentum carried by the plasma particles may deform the film shape to a significant extent, possibly disrupting the flow or leaving sections on the substrate inadequately protected. Proposed here are several mathematical and experimental models intended to address these specific questions. Mathematical models will be derived from the basic set of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations for the cases of fully developed and developing film flow. The fully developed flow model allows simplification of the governing equations to two dimensions, facilitating their solution. The data obtained from this formulation will yield the velocity, induced magnetic field, and height of the film as a function of space and flow parameters. From this data the effect of the plasma momentum on the shape of the surface will be seen, as will the velocity structure across the channel, a structure that is only assumed in previous modeling attempts. The developing film model, based on simplifying assumptions for the height and velocity profiles determined from the previous model for the fully developed case, will account for spatial and temporal varying magnetic fields. In this way {{it will be possible to}} model more fusion relevant field distributions and establish their effect on the evolution of the film and its possible flooding or detachment as it flows along the substrate...|$|R
