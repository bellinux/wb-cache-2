60|$|Why the {{descendants}} of plants which were originally dioecious, and which therefore profited by always intercrossing with another individual, should have been converted into hermaphrodites, may perhaps {{be explained by the}} risk which they ran, especially {{as long as they were}} anemophilous, of not being always fertilised, and consequently of not leaving offspring. This latter evil, the greatest of all to any organism, would have been much lessened by their becoming hermaphrodites, though with the contingent disadvantage of frequent self-fertilisation. By what graduated steps an hermaphrodite condition was acquired we do not know. But we can see that if a lowly organised form, in which the two sexes were represented by somewhat different individuals, were to increase by budding either before or after conjugation, the two incipient sexes would be capable of appearing by buds on the same stock, as occasionally occurs with various characters at the present day. The organism would then be in a monoecious condition, and this is probably the first step towards hermaphroditism; for if very simple male and female flowers on the same stock, each consisting of a single stamen or pistil, were brought close together and surrounded by a common envelope, in nearly the same manner as with the florets of the Compositae, we should have an <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flower.</b>|$|E
60|$|Before we {{consider}} {{in detail the}} several cases given in Table 7/C, some preliminary remarks must be made. There is the clearest evidence, as we shall presently see, that {{the advantage of a}} cross depends wholly on the plants differing somewhat in constitution; and that the disadvantages of self-fertilisation depend on the two parents, which are combined in the same <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flower,</b> having a closely similar constitution. A certain amount of differentiation in the sexual elements seems indispensable for the full fertility of the parents, and for the full vigour of the offspring. All the individuals of the same species, even those produced in a state of nature, differ somewhat, though often very slightly, from one another in external characters and probably in constitution. This obviously holds good between the varieties of the same species, as far as external characters are concerned; and much evidence could be advanced with respect to their generally differing somewhat in constitution. There can hardly be a doubt that the differences of all kinds between the individuals and varieties of the same species depend largely, and as I believe exclusively, on their progenitors having been subjected to different conditions; though the conditions to which the individuals of the same species are exposed in a state of nature often falsely appear to us the same. For instance, the individuals growing together are necessarily exposed to the same climate, and they seem to us at first sight to be subjected to identically the same conditions; but this can hardly be the case, except under the unusual contingency of each individual being surrounded by other kinds of plants in exactly the same proportional numbers. For the surrounding plants absorb different amounts of various substances from the soil, and thus greatly affect the nourishment and even the life of the individuals of any particular species. These will also be shaded and otherwise affected {{by the nature of the}} surrounding plants. Moreover, seeds often lie dormant in the ground, and those which germinate during any one year will often have been matured during very different seasons. Seeds are widely dispersed by various means, and some will occasionally be brought from distant stations, where their parents have grown under somewhat different conditions, and the plants produced from such seeds will intercross with the old residents, thus mingling their constitutional peculiarities in all sorts of proportions.|$|E
40|$|The {{date palm}} (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is {{dioecious}} with male flowers deficient in functional gynoecium and female flowers deficient in functional androecium borne on separate palms. The presence {{of male and}} female flowers on the same plant, a phenomenon known as monoecy, is unusual in male date palms. This study reports {{for the first time on}} <b>hermaphrodite</b> (bisexual) <b>flowers</b> borne by two female date palms, 'Alligue', that were found growing in an open field in Degache, southern Tunisia. The observations on these two female palms were compared with hermaphrodite male date palms growing in the same location. Hermaphrodite female date palm inflorescence branches bear female flowers predominantly near their base, in contrast to the <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> that are found primarily toward their upper part. The position of the <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> in <b>hermaphrodite</b> male date palms is reversed: inflorescence branches bear male flowers toward the upper part while the <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> are found at the base. Histological examination of female <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> revealed that they had three carpels and 1 - 6 stamens. <b>Hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> on male plants were usually also composed of three carpels of variable size, and six stamens. <b>Hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> on both female and male palm trees turn generally into parthenocarpic fruits.

40|$|Question: Which {{ecological}} factors favor {{the transition from}} plants with <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> to monoecious plants with separate male and female flowers on the same individual? Mathematical methods: ESS computation in sex allocation models Key assumptions: Within a flower, costs of attraction, pollen production, style/ovary and fruit with seeds are assumed fixed. Often costs of fruit with seeds outweigh other costs. Female flowers produce more seeds than <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers,</b> due to less pollen-stigma interference. Conclusions: When sex allocation is female-biased at the flower level, plants respond by producing either male flowers or flowers without fruit. Hermaphroditism evolves to andromonoecy (male and <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> on the same plant) and then to monoecy. In species with large fruits, sex allocation is female-biased at the flower level {{and the production of}} male flowers is favored. This facilitates the production of female flowers. The alternative route via gynomonoecy (female and <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> on the same plant) is improbable since it requires unrealistically high levels of seed production in female flowers. Monoecious species are likely to have: (i) small, inexpensive flowers, (ii) large, costly fruits and seeds, and (iii) high fertilization rates. ...|$|R
40|$|Gymnocladus assamicus is a {{critically}} endangered tree species endemic to Northeast India, and shows sexual dimorphism with male and <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers</b> on separate trees. We studied phenology, reproductive biology and mating {{system of the}} species. The flowers are small, tubular, odorless and last for about 96 hours. Pollen grains in both morphs were viable and capable of fertilization leading to fruit and seed set. Scanning electron micrographs revealed morphologically similar pollen in both male and <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flowers.</b> The fruit set in open pollinated flowers was 43. 61 percent, while controlled autogamous and geitonogamous pollinations yielded 76. 81 and 65. 58 percent fruit set respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Different {{theories}} for {{the origin}} of the angiosperm <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flower</b> make different predictions concerning the overlap between the genes expressed in the male and female cones of gymnosperms and the genes expressed in the <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flower</b> of angiosperms. The Mostly Male (MM) theory predicts that, of genes expressed primarily in male versus female gymnosperm cones, an excess of male orthologs will be expressed in flowers, excluding ovules, while Out Of Male (OOM) and Out Of Female (OOF) theories predict no such excess. Results In this paper, we tested these predictions by comparing the transcriptomes of three gymnosperms (Ginkgo biloba, Welwitschia mirabilis and Zamia fisheri) and two angiosperms (Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa), using EST data. We found that the proportion of orthologous genes expressed in the reproductive organs of the gymnosperms and in the angiosperms flower is significantly higher than the proportion of orthologous genes expressed in the reproductive organs of the gymnosperms and in the angiosperms vegetative tissues, which shows that the approach is correct. However, we detected {{no significant differences between the}} proportion of gymnosperm orthologous genes expressed in the male cone and in the angiosperms flower and the proportion of gymnosperm orthologous genes expressed in the female cone and in the angiosperms flower. Conclusions These results do not support the MM theory prediction of an excess of male gymnosperm genes expressed in the <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flower</b> of the angiosperms and seem to support the OOM/OOF theories. However, other explanations can be given for the 1 : 1 ratio that we found. More abundant and more specific (namely carpel and ovule) expression data should be produced in order to further test these theories. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Self-incompatibility (SI) {{is defined}} as the {{inability}} to produce zygotes after self-pollination in a fertile hermaphrodite plant, which has stamens and pistils in the same flower. This structural organization of the <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flower</b> increases the risk of self-pollination, leading to low genetic diversity. To avoid this problem plants have established several pollination systems, among which the most elegant system is surely SI. The SI trait can be observed in Brassica crops, including cabbage, broccoli, turnip and radish. To produce hybrid seed of these crops efficiently, the SI trait has been employed in an agricultural context. From another point of view, the recognition reaction of SI during pollen-stigma interaction is an excellent model system for cell-cell communication and signal transduction in higher plants. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanisms of SI in Brassicaceae, which have been dissected by genetic, physiological, and biological approaches, and we discuss the future prospects in relation to associated scientific fields and new technologies...|$|E

40|$|Morphological, {{molecular}} and cytological {{analyses were}} performed to assess the hybridity of 120 putative interspecific hybrids of Carica papaya L. x C. cauliflora Jacq. In the putative interspecific hybrids the number of main leaf veins was intermediate between the two parents while the <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flower</b> sex form and the low vigour were distinctive features of these hybrids. Petiole length, stem diameter, leaf length, leaf width and flower colour were similar to C. papaya, whereas leaf shape, type, serration, venation, petiole hairiness and flower shape were similar to C. cauliflora. Markers generated by the polymerase chain reaction using 72 10 -mer primers (random amplified polymorphic DNA) revealed {{a high level of}} polymorphism (64 %) between C. papaya and C. cauliflora. Seventeen of these primers yielded reliable and easily scorable polymorphic banding patterns that were further screened to reveal hybrids. A range of 1 - 5 RAPD primers consistently confirmed that all 120 plants were genetic hybrids, with all of them containing at least one band from the male parent. Cytological analysis revealed that 7 - 48 % of the cells in many of the interspecific hybrids were aneuploid suggesting that chromosome elimination was occurring. The frequency of aneuploid cells was negatively associated (r = 0. 88) with the number of bands from the male parent integrated into the hybrid. Pollen fertility of the hybrids was from 0. 5 to 14. 0 % while C. papaya and C. cauliflora had 88. 0 - 99. 0 % and 90. 0 - 97. 0 % fertile pollen, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Perennial grasses have diverse {{uses and}} are {{relevant}} from the agronomic and economic point of view, with main uses as forage, turf and bioenergy. In the grass family polyploidy is prevalent and both autopolyploids and allopolyploids are present. Also, within grasses {{there are a}} range of breeding systems, but <b>hermaphrodite</b> <b>flower</b> is the most frequent floral condition. Cross-pollination in species with hermaphrodite flowers is imposed by a gametophytic genetic self-incompatibility (SI). SI is controlled by two multiallelic and independent loci, S and Z. The incompatibility phenotype of the pollen grain is determined by its haploid genome. A pollen grain is incompatible when the same S and Z alleles carried by pollen {{are present in the}} pistil. This SI mechanism keeps its functionality at higher ploidy levels. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the breakdown of SI are crucial for implementing novel breeding practices. The aim of this work is to increase the knowledge of SF in outcrossing grasses for the purpose of inbred line development and making hybrid breeding possible. Mutations at S, Z and at a third locus are known to cause self-fertility (SF). In perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), a locus conferring SF is located in linkage group 5. Using segregation and linkage analysis, the SF locus region was reduced to 1. 6 cM. This locus explained 94 % of the observed variability. By aligning the flanking marker sequences to the Brachypodium distachium reference genome, it was found that it corresponds to an 807 Kbp region in B. distachium. This locus was studied at the tetraploid level and it was found that SF remained functional, the SF locus genotype was the main determinant of pollen compatibility explaining 54 % of the variation, and there is incomplete dominance between alleles at this locus in the diploid pollen grain. The prospects of migrating the SF locus from perennial ryegrass to other related self-incompatible were discussed. Based on the available information on hybridization between Lolium and Festuca species, different types of crosses were propose according to the particular species involved. The results and observations presented here contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the trait at both diploid and tetraploid levels and are promising as SF may readily be incorporated into breeding programs...|$|E
