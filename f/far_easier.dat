5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process.

5|$|After Midway and the {{exhausting}} attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in materiel (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained pilots and maintenance crewmen) rapidly became insufficient {{to cope with}} mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial and training capabilities made losses <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> to replace. The Battle of Midway, along with the Guadalcanal Campaign, is widely considered {{a turning point in}} the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E

5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells <b>far</b> <b>easier</b> and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E

The aircraft could continuously light a two-mile circle from an altitude of 12,000ft.

The numerous improvements allowed for a sound quality that was significantly better than Edison's machine.|$|E
