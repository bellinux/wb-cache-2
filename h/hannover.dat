5|$|<b>Hannover</b> and {{her sisters}} saw {{extensive}} service with the fleet. The ship took part in all major training maneuvers until World War I broke out in July 1914. <b>Hannover</b> {{and her sisters}} were immediately pressed into guard duties {{in the mouth of}} the Elbe River {{while the rest of the}} fleet mobilized. The ship took part in a number of fleet advances, which culminated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916. During the battle, <b>Hannover</b> served as the flagship for the IV Division of the II Battle Squadron. After Jutland, <b>Hannover</b> and her three surviving sisters were removed from active duty with the fleet to serve as guard ships. In 1917, <b>Hannover</b> was briefly used as a target ship before being returned to guard duties in the Baltic Sea. The ship was decommissioned in December 1918, shortly after the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Upon her commissioning, <b>Hannover</b> {{joined the}} II Battle Squadron. From May to June 1908, <b>Hannover</b> {{took part in}} {{maneuvers}} in the North Sea. From the following month until August, the fleet conducted a training cruise into the Atlantic. During the cruise, <b>Hannover</b> stopped in Punta Delgado in the Azores from 23 July to 1 August. The annual autumn exercises began in September; after these were completed <b>Hannover</b> {{was transferred to the}} I Squadron, where she served as the flagship for two years. In November, fleet and unit exercises were conducted in the Baltic Sea.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 1918, Germany {{entered into}} the Armistice with the Western Allies. According {{to the terms of}} the Armistice, the most modern {{components}} of Germany's surface fleet were interned in the British naval base at Scapa Flow, {{while the rest of the}} fleet was demilitarized. On the day the armistice took effect, <b>Hannover</b> was sent briefly to Swinemünde, before returning to Kiel on 14–15 November along with Schlesien. <b>Hannover</b> was decommissioned a month later on 17 December in accordance with the terms of the Armistice.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} struck from the naval {{register}} in 1936, {{after which the}} navy intended to rebuild <b>Hannover</b> {{for use as a}} target ship. The conversion, however, never occurred. Ultimately, the ship was broken up between May 1944 and October 1946 in Bremerhaven. Her bell now resides in the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 21 June 1919, {{permitted}} Germany to retain a surface fleet of eight obsolete battleships. This amounted to three of the Deutschland-class battleships, <b>Hannover,</b> Schleswig-Holstein and Schlesien, {{as well as the}} five s.|$|E
5|$|The {{training}} regimen {{in which}} <b>Hannover</b> participated followed {{a similar pattern}} {{over the next five}} years. This included another cruise into the Atlantic, from 7 July to 1 August 1909. February 1910 saw the I Squadron conduct individual training in the Baltic. The unit was subsequently transferred from Kiel to the base in Wilhelmshaven on 1 April. Fleet maneuvers were conducted shortly thereafter, followed by a summer cruise to Norway, and additional fleet training in the fall. On 3 October 1911, the ship was transferred back to the II Squadron. Due to the Agadir Crisis in July, the summer cruise only went into the Baltic. On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began, but the threat of war in Europe caused the excursion to be cut short; within two weeks <b>Hannover</b> {{and the rest of the}} II Squadron had returned to Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1916, {{the four}} {{remaining}} ships were withdrawn from service with the fleet. They were placed into reserve on 15 August 1917. Deutschland and Schleswig-Holstein became barracks ships in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, respectively. <b>Hannover</b> {{was used as a}} guard ship in the Danish belt, and Schlesien became a training ship in Kiel. Guns removed from these ships starting in 1917 were used by the Imperial Army in World War I as railway guns.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{was criticized}} {{severely}} {{by the international}} press for lax security measures in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle a pistol on board, and for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in <b>Hannover.</b> Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had recently come under fire after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that the explosives had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, the Frankfurt airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent security procedures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hannover</b> {{was brought}} back to active service in the Reichsmarine, the post-war Germany navy. She served with the fleet for ten years, from 1921 to 1931, before she was again decommissioned. The navy planned to convert the ship into a {{radio-controlled}} target ship for aircraft, but this was never carried out. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap between 1944 and 1946 in Bremerhaven. Her bell is preserved at the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hannover</b> {{was struck}} from the navy list in 1936 and {{destined for the}} scrapyard. There were ideas to rebuild her as a target ship {{especially}} for aircraft, although this never occurred. Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including a stop in Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E

In February, 11 aircraft brought his tally to 57—four fell on the 16th. After achieving his 57th he probably downed a 58th—a <b>Hannover</b> CL.III—but it went down over enemy lines under control as McCudden's guns seized having already fired 300 rounds at his first victim.|$|E
5|$|Scientology {{first became}} active in Germany in 1970. By 2007, there were ten major centres ("Scientology Churches"), {{as well as}} {{fourteen}} minor centres ("Scientology Missions") in Germany. The German Scientology Churches {{are located in the}} big cities– Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, <b>Hannover</b> and Stuttgart. Of the Scientology Missions, nine are in Baden-Württemberg, and three in Bavaria. Following German re-unification, Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic; most adherents are found in Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia.|$|E
5|$|Demeke {{demanded that}} the {{aircraft}} be flown to New York City and demanded political asylum in the United States. After being told that the plane {{would need to be}} refueled, Demeke agreed to allow a refueling stop in <b>Hannover,</b> Germany. The aircraft landed at Hannover-Langenhagen Airport around noon local time, where it was surrounded by law enforcement officials. Demeke remained in the cockpit with the pistol to the pilot's head, and threatened to begin killing a flight attendant every five minutes. German authorities allowed the plane to depart after Demeke threatened to kill his hostages but promised to surrender peacefully upon reaching the United States.|$|E
5|$|However, {{instead of}} {{being used as a}} coastal defense ship, Deutschland was broken up in 1920–1922. <b>Hannover</b> was to be {{converted}} into a target vessel, although this was never done. She was eventually broken up in 1944–1946. Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein were the only two vessels of the class to see continued front-line service in the Reichsmarine and later the Kriegsmarine. Both ships saw limited duty during World War II, which was inaugurated by the firing of Schleswig-Holsteins main guns at the Polish fortress at Westerplatte. Near {{the end of the war}} the two ships were both sunk.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011–12 season, Tasci scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} season in a 3–0 win over <b>Hannover</b> 96 on 10 September. and scored his second in a 1–1 draw against Borussia Dortmund on 29 October 2011. Halfway through the 2011–12 season, on 12 January 2012, he was {{appointed}} the new captain of VfB Stuttgart by Bruno Labbadia. Seven days before being appointed, Tasci and Cristian Molinaro were involved in an incident at training. Tasci third goal came on 10 April 2012 in a 3–1 win over FC Augsburg. Despite injuries, he appeared 28 times that season.|$|E
5|$|Lena Meyer-Landrut {{was born}} in Hanover, Germany. She is the granddaughter of Andreas Meyer-Landrut, the Estonian-born West German {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union in Moscow from 1980 to 1983 and 1987 to 1989 and Hanna Karatsony von Hodos who {{was born in}} Bratislava, Slovakia of Hungarian nobility. She grew up as an only child, and started taking dancing lessons at the age of five; initially doing ballet and later practising various modern styles, including hip-hop and jazz dance. Meyer-Landrut grew fond of singing and appeared as an extra in a number of German television series; however she never received any formal acting or vocal training. In June 2010 she graduated from IGS Roderbruch <b>Hannover,</b> a comprehensive school, receiving her Abitur diploma.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As a result of their having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn. <b>Hannover</b> and the other five ships of the squadron therefore were located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1944, Schlesiens and Schleswig-Holsteins {{anti-aircraft}} armament {{was considerably}} strengthened {{to allow them}} to be used as an air defense ships in the port of Gotenhafen. Schleswig-Holstein was attacked by RAF bombers in December 1944, and although she was sunk in shallow water, her weapons could still be used. After a fire permanently disabled the ship, her crew was sent ashore to assist in the defense of Marienburg. Starting in 1944, <b>Hannover</b> was broken up for scrap; work lasted until 1945. Schlesien provided fire support for German troops in the vicinity of Gotenhafen between 15 and 21 March 1945. In April, Schlesien was moved to Swinemünde to restock her ammunition supply as well as evacuate 1,000 wounded soldiers from the front. On 3 May she struck a mine outside Swinemünde; the following day she was scuttled by her crew in shallow water. Both ships were broken up in situ after the war.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{factories}} {{assembled the}} various {{models of the}} Sd.Kfz. 10. Demag built approximately 1,075 from 1938 to November 1942. Adler-Werke completed 3,414 between 1938 and December 1943. Büssing-NAG built 750 between 1938 and December 1942. MWC assembled 4750 between 1939 and November 1944. Mühlenbau und Industrie A.G. (MIAG) completed 324 between 1939 and 1941. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen <b>Hannover</b> (MNH) built about 600 between 1939 and November 1942. Österreichische Saurerwerke completed about 3,075 from 1940 to December 1943. Both Demag and MWC were producing the D 7p chassis for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light APC in 1945 when a shortage of armored bodies meant that 276 had to be completed with wooden upper bodies. Eighty of these {{are known to have}} been delivered by 1 March 1945. These numbers may include 310 chassis built for Sd.Kfz. 252 armored ammunition carriers and Sd.Kfz. 253 oberservation vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{coordination}} was {{not helped}} by the poor relations between the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine Commanders-in-Chief, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring and Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder. The system required both services to work together, but it produced co-operation difficulties. A {{solution to the problem}} was twofold. Fighter units defending the North Sea coast were subordinated to Luftgaukommando XI (Air District Command 9) in <b>Hannover.</b> These fighter units would function as an autonomous fighter command, or Jagdfliegerführer (Fighter Flyer Leaders). The command of Fighter Command unit was given to Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher, a former commander of II./Jagdgeschwader 77. Schumacher had served in the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial German Navy) during the First World War and as an officer cadet had seen combat at the Battle of Jutland. It was hoped with his naval background and easy personality it would ease any difficulties with naval service cooperation. Nevertheless, Schumacher and his counterpart in the Navy were of the same rank, so each lacked authority over the other, an arrangement that lacked the needed unity of command.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Braunschweigs {{bridge was}} rebuilt and enlarged. The year {{followed}} the same pattern as the previous one, with visits to foreign ports in July; Braunschweig stopped in Helsinki, Finland and Gothenburg, Sweden during her trip. Joint maneuvers were held again in August and September, after which Püllen left the ship. On 15 October, VAdm Hans Zenker, then the Oberbefehlshaber der Seestreitkräfte (O.d.SCommander of Naval Forces), reorganized the fleet structure, disbanding the North Sea and Baltic commands and replacing them with organizations based on ship type. Braunschweig was now assigned to the Linienschiffsdivision (Battleship Division), where she served as Zenker's flagship. The division also included the battleship <b>Hannover.</b> In February and March 1924, the ship served as an icebreaker in the Baltic. The usual cruise abroad in July 1924 ventured further than in previous years, with a trip into the Atlantic. Braunschweig stopped in A Coruña from 6 to 13 July. Fleet maneuvers followed {{at the end of}} August, and at their conclusion, the fleet anchored off Sassnitz for a naval review for Admiral Paul Behncke, the retiring Chef der Admiralität (Chief of the Admiralty). Zenker was promoted to replace Behncke, who was in turn replaced by now-VAdm Mommsen, who again made Braunschweig his flagship. Further exercises were held from 29 September to 5 October.|$|E
5|$|The {{numerous}} honours and endowments that General Nansouty received {{following the}} Battle of Friedland {{seem to suggest}} the Emperor's appreciation {{and the fact that}} Napoleon did not regard the early incident during this battle as Nansouty's fault. On 11 July 1807, General of Division Nansouty was named Grand Aigle de la Légion d'Honneur, the fifth and top rank of this order, reserved for the greatest general officers. This also brought an annual revenue of 20,000 Francs. His first endowment of 12,846 Francs was offered on 30 June 1807, and was paid by the Duchy of Warsaw. On 23 September, he received another 5,882 Francs on the Empire's Grand Livre. A count of the Empire from 10 March 1808, Nansouty was offered two additional endowments, one of 25,000 Francs, paid by the Kingdom of Westphalia, and the second of 10,000 Francs, paid by the Zeven domain in <b>Hannover.</b> He also received an endowment of 100,000 Francs for the acquisition of a Parisian Hôtel particulier; Nansouty bought the Hôtel du Président Duret in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a neighbourhood inhabited by the new elite of Imperial France. Indeed, first-rate military figures such as the Viceroy of Italy Eugène, Marshals Davout and Lannes and Generals Rapp and Legrand also acquired residences in Faubourg Saint-Germain.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Zhao Xijin named two Megalosaurus species {{found in}} Tibet. He had earlier {{mentioned}} these species in an unpublished dissertation of 1983, implying they initially were invalid nomina ex dissertatione. However, his 1985 publication {{did not contain}} descriptions so the names are still nomina nuda. The first species was Megalosaurus dapukaensis, named for the Dapuka Group. It was, in the second edition of The Dinosauria, by mistake spelled as Megalosaurus cachuensis. The second species was Megalosaurus tibetensis. In 1987/1988, Monique Vianey-Liaud renamed Massospondylus rawesi (Lydekker, 1890), based on specimen NHMUK R4190, a tooth from the Maastrichtian of India, into Megalosaurus rawesi. This is a nomen dubium, a possible member of the Abelisauridae. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul renamed Torvosaurus tanneri Galton & Jensen 1979 into Megalosaurus tanneri. The change has found no acceptance. In 1973, Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky had renamed Poekilopleuron schmidti Kiprijanow 1883 into a Megalosaurus sp. However, as it is formally impossible to change a named species into an unnamed one, George Olshevsky in 1991 used the new combination Megalosaurus schmidti. It is a chimaera. In 1993, Ernst Probst and Raymund Windolf by mistake renamed Plateosaurus ornatus Huene 1905 into Megalosaurus ornatus by mentioning the latter name in a species list. This {{can be seen as}} a nomen vanum. The same publication listed the ichnospecies Megalosauropus teutonicus Kaever & Lapparent 1974 as a Megalosaurus teutonicus. In 1997, Windolf renamed Saurocephalus monasterii Münster 1846, based on a tooth found near <b>Hannover,</b> into Megalosaurus monasterii. It is a nomen dubium, an indeterminate member of the Theropoda. In 1998, Peter Malcolm Galton renamed Zanclodon cambrensis Newton 1899, based on a left lower jaw, specimen BGS 6532 found at Bridgend, into ?Megalosaurus cambrensis because it was not a basal sauropodomorph. It is a senior synonym of Gressylosaurus cambrensis Olshevsky 1991. The specific name refers to Cambria, the Latin name of Wales. It probably represents a member of the Coelophysoidea, or some other predatory archosaur.|$|E
