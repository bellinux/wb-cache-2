40|$|The {{experimental}} analysis {{described in}} this paper has been performed within {{the activities of the}} FREEDAM project (FREE from DAMage steel connections), which is an RFCS project (Research Fund for Coal and Steel), granted by the European Community, devoted {{to the development of a}} new design strategy based on the employment of friction dampers in beam-to-column joints. In past, the application of dampers has been widely investigated within the development of supplemental energy dissipation strategies, with the aim to improve the energy dissipation capacity of the primary structure and to reduce the structural damage by concentrating the energy dissipation supply in fuses located in zones of the structure where high relative displacements are expected. Conversely, the strategy studied in the FREEDAM project is based on the application of damping devices, specifically friction dampers, under a new perspective. In fact, they are conceived as elements included in connections with the aim to completely substitute the traditional dissipative zones of MRFs, i. e. the beam ends. To this scope, beam-to-column joints are equipped with friction dampers constituted by steel plates and <b>friction</b> <b>pads</b> pre-loaded with high-strength bolts, that can be located either at the level of both flanges, or at the bottom flange level only, or on additional haunches which can be used to increase the lever arm of the damper. In particular, the connection studied in the FREEDAM project is realized as a modification of the classical detail of a Double Split Tee Joint (DST) where, in substitution of the bottom Tee element, a symmetrical friction damper is introduced which is realized pre-loading <b>friction</b> <b>pads</b> located between the webs of a couple of angles used to fasten the beam to the column and the beam flange or the lowev plate of an eventual beam hunch, which is slotted in order to allow the sliding of the damper. With this connecting system, under bending actions, the joint is forced to rotate around a rotation center located at the base of the upper T-stub web and the energy dissipation supply is provided by the alternate slippage of the lower beam flange on <b>friction</b> <b>pads.</b> In this way, provided that the steel components of the connection are properly over-strengthened, the joint resistance and the rotation capacity can be easily governed by calibrating the preload applied to the frictional interfaces and realizing slotted holes whose length provides an adequate stroke for the dissipative device. The main feature of this connection is that, even under the occurrence of destructive seismic events, the only damage is due to the consumption of the <b>friction</b> <b>pads,</b> while all the steel elements are completely preserved obtaining, in this way, a connection able to withstand destructive seismic events without any damage to the steel parts, namely a FREE from DAMage connection. Clearly, in order to accurately control the design of such a connection typology, the knowledge of the value of the friction coefficient of the material employed to realize the <b>friction</b> <b>pads</b> is of paramount importance. Therefore, among all the possible materials, it is necessary to select those able to develop high values of the friction coefficient and a stable behavior under cyclic loading conditions. In this paper, the main results of preliminary analyses devoted to select the best materials to be employed as <b>friction</b> <b>pads</b> in the FREEDAM connections are presented. To date, twelve tests on eight different materials combined with stainless steel plates have been realized. The tests performed, mainly devoted to evaluate the behavior of the friction interfaces in terms of static and kinetic friction coefficient and in terms of degradation, are inspired to the sliding test proposed by EN 1090 - 2 adopting the loading protocol suggested by the EN 12159 for the qualification of seismic devices. The initial value of the friction coefficient and its evolution during the tests, have been determined for the different materials by monitoring the values of the forces of the bolts used to apply the pre-load to the friction interface and the value of the sliding force. The obtained results are presented both in terms of force-displacement curves and in terms of friction coefficient, providing a comparison between the performances of the analyzed interfaces in terms of energy dissipation supply...|$|R

A complex modal analysis is performed for different static configurations in which only the contact pressure evolves.

It is shown that the introduction of both kinds of geometrical imperfections have an influence on dynamic behavior and mode lock-in (through modification of the eigenfrequencies of the system).

40|$|In {{contemporary}} vehicles, {{friction clutches}} {{are exposed to}} increased engine performances, i. e. increased torque, particularly for vehicles equipped with diesel engines. Demands for low mass and low moments of inertia of the moving parts are more pronounced. Towards the aim of meeting those demands, {{there is a tendency}} for manufacturing of clutch covers by drawing from a thin tin sheet metal, thus decreasing their axial stiffness, and increasing the path of the release bearing. Such a situation in conditions of increasing vehicle speed endangers the fast and precise work and functionality of the friction clutch. Concomitantly, the effort and the work that the driver needs to make and do during its clutch release increase. These factors need to be within certain limits. This paper provides an analysis of a possible response to this kind of challenges.

40|$|Brake squeal" groups a large set of high {{frequency}} sound emissions from brake systems, generated during the braking phase and {{characterized by a}} harmonic spectrum. The generation of squeal is due to an unstable behaviour of the system during the braking phase. Many researchers associate the squeal phenomena to the coalescence of two eigenfrequencies of the system: when two modes, characterized by large deformation at the contact surface, couple at the same frequency, one of them becomes unstable leading to increasing vibration. The present experimental analysis is focused on correlating the propensity to instability of a system mode with its modal damping. Because {{of the complexity of}} real brake systems, a simplified experimental set-up is proposed. The set-up is a valid tool that permits to control easily and modify its dynamics. A clear distinction is obtained between the dynamics of the <b>friction</b> <b>pad</b> and the caliper. Different conditions of unstable coupling between a mode of the brake disc and a mode of the caliper or the pad are analyzed. Two opposite roles of the modal damping are detected.

Moreover, the add of damping, aimed to prevent a specified squeal condition, can cause the rise of different squeal events...|$|E

Because of numerous advantages in comparison to a traditional air block brake, disc brakes, {{are more and more}} often utilized in passenger carriages and other railway vehicles. Stable and constant – in the whole speed range – coefficient of friction µ, with the value: µ = 0. 35 is a basic advantage of disc brake systems [7].

40|$|International audience“Brake squeal” groups a large set of {{high-frequency}} {{sound emissions}} from brake systems. They are generated during the braking phase and {{are characterized by}} a harmonic spectrum. The onset of squeal is due to an unstable behaviour occurring in linear conditions during the braking phase, and a general approach used by several authors to determine the system instabilities is the complex eigenvalues analysis. When the brake begins to squeal, {{the response of the}} system reaches a new limit cycle where the linear models cannot be used anymore. This paper presents the integration of two different numerical procedures to identify the mechanism bringing to squeal instability and to analyse its dynamics. The first approach is a finite element modal analysis of the brake system and is used to identify its eigenvalues and to relate them to the squeal occurrence. The second one is a specific finite element programme, Plast 3, appropriate for nonlinear dynamic analyses in the time domain and is particularly addressed to study contact problems with friction between deformable bodies. This programme computes the contact stresses and permits to determine the dynamics of the system along the contact surface, both in the linear and nonlinear fields. The two models are compared and the onset of squeal is predicted both in the frequency domain by the linear model and in the time domain by the nonlinear one. The instability predictions, obtained by the two models, are discussed. To simplify the dynamics of its components, the study is carried out on a simple model, made of a disc, a small <b>friction</b> <b>pad</b> and a beam supporting the pad.
