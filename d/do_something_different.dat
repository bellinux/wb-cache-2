5|$|Despite the {{positive}} response the game {{would go on}} to receive, Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games' last Spyro title. In an interview, CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games because they could not do anything new with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different.</b> Future Spyro games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, and Tantalus Media.|$|E
25|$|According to Ne-Yo, {{the idea}} for the album emerged from three influences: his desire to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> instead of a {{standard}} compilation; his interest in science fiction, comic books and Japanese animation; and inspiration from the works of Michael Jackson, particularly Thriller, Moonwalker, and Bad. Originally a short movie was to accompany the album, but such proved not to be viable given time and monetary constraints, so Ne-Yo chose to develop a series of six extended music videos instead. Nevertheless, the film concept continues to influence the work, as he has stated the songs on the album are inspired by the script of the film that he wrote. The album features a number of songs which follow the story of Jerome and Pretti Sinclair.|$|E
25|$|Takahashi {{created the}} {{majority}} of the main scenario himself. Takahashi worked on the script alongside Yuichiro Takeda, a writer who had previously worked on Xenoblade Chronicles; and Kazuho Hyodo, who had written episodes for multiple Gundam series. The story of Xenoblade Chronicle X was substantially larger than Xenoblade Chronicles, with Takahashi and Takeda feeling that they could not handle the entire scenario themselves. On advice from Takeda, he brought in Hyodo. Due to Hyodo's extensive involvement in science fiction stories, Takahashi felt confident leaving much of the work to him. The choice of a science fiction setting was influenced by Takahashi's wish to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> from the fantasy setting of Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenoblade Chronicles X was the first time Hyodo had worked on a video game. One of the main goals for Takahashi was having humans and the robot Skells coexisting and functioning in the world. Due to the scale and experimental nature of the game, the Monolith Soft team made an effort {{to move away from the}} philosophical storylines their company had become known for with previous titles. Speaking about his goals for the game, Takahashi felt that he had finally created what he had wanted to since first founding Monolith Soft in 1999.|$|E

I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for me, because I was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E

Quill noted that the pilot includes [...] "every cliche in the western movie arsenal", but that [...] "everything, from characters to plot turns, is skewed away from the norm", and that the pilot episode rose above the level of western spoof to become an [...] "outrageously confident tribute to... {{the best of the}} genre".|$|E
