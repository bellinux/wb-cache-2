40|$|This paper {{presents}} a growth diagnostic exercise for Peru. It notes that although Peru has recently enjoyed {{high rates of}} economic growth, this growth is actually a recovery from a significant and sustained growth collapse {{that began in the}} 1970 s. Income per capita has barely recovered to its historical peak, despite significant improvements in education, infrastructure, the financial system, political stability, institutional quality, and macroeconomic sustainability. The growth collapse was caused by a decline in export earnings due to the fall in international prices and an inadequate investment regime in export activities that led to a fall in market share. This situation led to collateral damage {{in the form of a}} balance of payments, fiscal, and financial crisis, accompanied by hyperinflation and violence, but these aspects were corrected in the 1990 s. However, the transformation of the export sector has been surprisingly small: the same activities that declined – mining and energy – are the ones that are leading the current recovery in exports to levels that in real per capita terms are similar to those achieved 30 years ago. The authors argue that the lack of structural transformation is associated with Peru’s position in a poorly connected part of the product space and this accentuates coordination failures in the movement to new activities. In addition, Peru’s current <b>export</b> <b>package</b> is very capital intensive and generates few jobs, especially in urban areas where the bulk of the labor force is now located. This limits the welfare benefits of the current growth path. The key policy message is that the public sector must act to encourage the development of new export activities that better utilize the human resources of the country. This involves action on the macro front to achieve a more competitive real exchange rate, improvements in the capacity to solve coordination failures in the provision of specific public sector inputs, and programs to stimulate investment in new tradable activities. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze Colombia's {{experiences}} with and opportunities for export led growth. We first review Colombia's growth and export performance over the past 30 years and find that the country is indeed facing an export challenge. We then go on to develop new metrics and apply them to Colombia's export challenge. First, we consider the opportunities for upgrading quality within existing exports, and find that Colombia has very little opportunity for growth in this dimension. Second, we consider the level of sophistication of the current export basket, and find that it is low and commensurate with the lack of export dynamism. Although not a significant drag on growth, the current export basket will not be sufficient to fuel future output growth. Finally, we develop the concept distances between products, open forest, and the option value of exports to examine the possibility that Colombia's current structure of production is itself a barrier to future structural transformation. While improvements in the <b>export</b> <b>package</b> have been slow in the past, this evidence suggests that Colombia does now enjoy more options for future structural transformation. As there are attractive options for structural transformation nearby, a parsimonious approach to industrial strategy, rather than a risky strategic bet to move to a new part of the product space, seems appropriate. In order to inform such a strategy, we use the metrics developed in the diagnostic to evaluate new export activities in terms of their proximity to current activities, their sophistication, and their strategic value. We identify the sectors representing the best tradeoffs between these aims for Colombia as a whole, as well as its regions. We also devote separate attention to the topic of Agricultural exports, and to exports of services. Finally, we use these metrics to analyze the list of 'high-potential' sectors in the United States, developed by another firm, as well as the sectors prioritized in Colombia's Agenda Interna. These external lists of high-potential sectors are found to be sensible, but could be further rationalized using these metrics. This identification of nearby, high-potential, and strategically valuable sectors is not meant to be a definitive list for targeted subsidies and 'picking winners'. Rather, it provides a robust data-driven approach to inform the next steps in achieving export-led growth in Colombia: which private sector actors should be consulted first? What sector-specific reforms should be stressed? How should public spending on infrastructure and training, which are also sector-specific, be prioritized? What foreign firms should be targeted by FDI promotion agencies? These decisions can be informed by our analysis and the accompanying data. ...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this project}} is to inspect {{detrimental}} fungi, particularly ophiostomatoid fungi, on wood which is from importation or from indigenous plants. Morphological characteristics and DNA sequences of these fungi can be established to {{provide the basis for}} their accurate and quick detection. Both methods of morphology identification and DNA sequence comparison will be applied. Specific approaches of isolation will be adopted to obtain specific groups of fungi. Specific primers are used to amplify specific DNA fragments for comparisons with DNA sequences deposited in GenBank. Based on the morphological and molecular data acquired, it can be expected that these potential pathogens can be warded off from our country. As to the imported / <b>exported</b> wood <b>packaging</b> materials, a standard sampling procedure of a fast screening process and a monitoring system will be set up for these materials. In this project, three tasks will be included, (i) literature survey of important pests and pathogens for wood (ii) establishing a standard procedures for inspecting and identifying of pests and plant pathogens and (iii) continuous monitoring important pests and pathogens information of imported / <b>exported</b> wood <b>packaging</b> materials, are proposed to accomplish our goal.
