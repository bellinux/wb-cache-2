40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the prevalence of Salmonella species in milk and locally processed milk products traded for human consumption and assess the risk factors associated with Salmonella milk contamination in the study area. The study utilized microbiological culture and isolation as well as questionnaire analysis. A total of 600 samples were studied, 200 each for fresh milk (madara), <b>full</b> <b>creamed</b> milk (kindirmo) and skimmed milk (nono). The study revealed an overall prevalence of 8. 7 % (52 / 600).

This revealed a high level of statistical significance (P< 0. 05). Prevalence rates in relation to milk type were 6. 4 % (38 / 600), 1. 5 % (9 / 600) and 0. 8 % (5 / 600) for fresh milk, <b>full</b> <b>creamed</b> milk and skimmed milk respectively.

6000|$|The farm is older. It {{was first}} a grange of Whitekirk Abbey, tilled and {{inhabited}} by rosy friars. Thence, after the Reformation, it {{passed into the}} hands of a true-blue Protestant family. During the Covenanting troubles, when a night conventicle was held upon the Pentlands, the farm doors stood hospitably open till the morning; the dresser was laden with cheese and bannocks, milk and brandy; and the worshipers kept lipping down from the hill between two exercises, as couples visit the supper-room between two dances of a modern ball. In the Forty-Five, some foraging Highlanders from Prince Charlie's army fell upon Swanston in the dawn. The great-grandfather of the late farmer was then a little child; him they awakened by plucking the blankets from his bed, and he remembered, when he was an old man, their truculent looks and uncouth speech. The churn stood <b>full</b> of <b>cream</b> in the dairy, and with this they made their brose in high delight. [...] "It was braw brose," [...] said one of them.

On dark days, when the mist runs low upon the hill, the house has a gloomy air as if suitable for private tragedy. But in hot July, you can fancy nothing more perfect than the garden, laid out in alleys and arbours and bright, old-fashioned flower-plots, and ending in a miniature ravine, all trellis-work and moss and tinkling waterfall, and housed from the sun under fathoms of broad foliage.|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaSensory {{analysis}} is being increasingly {{used by the}} food industry, a science that uses man and his senses to measure sensorial characteristics (and acceptability criteria) of food products. The main objective of this work was to use of sensory analysis to characterize traditional meat products (sausages) and cheeses. There are several definitions of traditional products. According to Commission Regulation (EC) Nº 509 / 2006 of 20 March 2007 a product is designated as traditional when it has "proven usage on the Community market for a time period showing transmission between generations; this time period {{should be the one}} generally ascribed to one human generation, at least 25 years". Cheese is a fresh or aged product, with different styles and textures. It is obtained from milk (<b>full</b> or skimmed), <b>cream,</b> buttermilk, or a mixture of these products, including whey. Sausages are cured meat products, made from meat, entrails, spices and additives. They can undergo a period of maturation and cure, including smoking. For the cheese analysis, a descriptive test was performed, with a certain number of attributes. A frequency table was built, from which different cheese definitions were evaluated, identical to the existing ones. Two statistical methods were used: hierarchical classification and principal component analysis. With the hierarchical classification, the cheeses were grouped in four groups, nine, seven, five and three. The cheeses "Picante da Beira-Baixa DOP" and "Terrincho Velho DOP" are located in isolated groups. The cheese "Amarelo da Beira Baixa DOP" was found not isolated only in group of three. With nine and seven groups the cheeses "Amanteigado de Seia", "Castelo Branco", "Serra da Estrela" and "Azeitão" formed a subgroup showing that the evaluators probably used the same descriptors based on the same properties, the look of the crust, form, height, taste and aroma. With only five groups, a very heterogeneous sub-group was formed, that could be divided in three. "Azeitão DOP", "Castelo Branco DOP", "Amanteigado de Seia", "Serra da Estrela DOP" and "Serpa DOP" would form a group while "Nisa DOP", "Mestiço de Tolosa IGP", "Mistura" and "Castelo Branco DOP" would form another, as the characteristics of these subgroups are similar. "Flamengo" would be in a separate group as its characteristics are very different from the other analyzed cheeses. This separate group probably originated in the discrepancy of the results, as no common descriptor would be clearly different from the others. Principal component analysis was used to study groupings of similar sample types, and it was shown that the first three main components justify 54 % of the variance. The is a low value, with the first six principal components we could explain 83 % of the variance, but in this work we used the first three principal components. The first two correlated with the crust properties, consistency and texture and the third with taste and aroma. It was shown that "Picante da Beira Baixa DOP" was distinct from the other cheeses. It should be noted that "Serpa DOP" was far-off the other soft cheeses. For the sausages a hedonic scale was used, with a t test and the samples showed no significant differences (when ItstatI> Tcrit to p< 0. 05). The analysis of "Salpicão de Vinhais IGP" and "Lombo Fumado Ponte de Lima" was done with only twenty evaluators, and this might have influenced the results, as the samples were non representative. The product that was less likely to be bought was shown to be "Salpicão de Vinhais IGP", which could mean that it has lower acceptance by the consumers, among the studied sausages. On the other hand, "Lombo Fumado Ponte de Lima" was the one most likely to be bought. Only sliced "Presunto de Chaves" (ham) had all attributes in the positive side of the scale...|$|R
