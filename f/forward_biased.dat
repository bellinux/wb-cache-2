25|$|When the anode is at a {{positive}} potential VAK {{with respect to}} the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate, junctions J1 and J3 are <b>forward</b> <b>biased,</b> while junction J2 is reverse biased. As J2 is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if VAK is increased beyond the breakdown voltage VBO of the thyristor, avalanche breakdown of J2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting (On state).|$|E
25|$|The {{voltage drop}} VF across the <b>forward</b> <b>biased</b> diode {{in the circuit}} of a passive {{rectifier}} is undesired. In this active version, the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the output voltage across the load with the input voltage and increases its own output voltage with the value of VF. As a result, the voltage drop VF is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (super) diode with VF = 0 V.|$|E

A convincing explanation for these puzzles should also explain two other 'facts': (a) the time dependency of the <b>forward</b> <b>bias</b> and failure of UIP and (b) that UIP holds better under a gold standard than under flexible rates.

25|$|In typical operation, the base–emitter {{junction}} is <b>forward</b> <b>biased,</b> {{which means}} that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base–collector junction is reverse biased. In an NPN transistor, when positive bias is applied to the base–emitter junction, the equilibrium is disturbed between the thermally generated carriers and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter depletion region. This allows thermally excited electrons to inject from the emitter into the base region. These electrons diffuse through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter towards the region of low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called minority carriers because the base is doped p-type, which makes holes the majority carrier in the base.|$|E
2500|$|Forward-active (or simply active): The base–emitter {{junction}} is <b>forward</b> <b>biased</b> and the base–collector junction is reverse biased. Most {{bipolar transistors}} {{are designed to}} afford the greatest common-emitter current gain, βF, in forward-active mode. If this is the case, the collector–emitter current is approximately [...] proportional to the base current, but many times larger, for small base current variations.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{types of}} BJT {{function}} by letting a small current input {{to the base}} control an amplified output from the collector. The {{result is that the}} transistor makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input. The BJT also makes a good amplifier, since it can multiply a weak input signal to about 100 times its original strength. Networks of transistors are used to make powerful amplifiers with many different applications. In the discussion below, focus is on the NPN bipolar transistor. In the NPN transistor in what is called active mode, the base–emitter voltage [...] and collector–base voltage [...] are positive, forward biasing the emitter–base junction and reverse-biasing the collector–base junction. In the active mode of operation, electrons are injected from the <b>forward</b> <b>biased</b> n-type emitter region into the p-type base where they diffuse as minority carriers to the reverse-biased n-type collector and are swept away by the electric field in the reverse-biased collector–base junction.
