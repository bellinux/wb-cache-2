50|$|By 1960, Vox had forsaken {{the more}} {{conservative}} TV-front look for the now legendary cabinet design that has remained largely unchanged since 1960. The new cabinets featured a different covering known as fawn Rexine, which {{was a sort of}} beige leathercloth with a subtle printed grain. The front baffle was now divided by a thin gold-toned strip with the upper valence covered in fawn Rexine, and the lower grille covered in brown <b>diamond</b> <b>cloth.</b> Ventilation was provided by three small brass vents {{on the top of the}} cabinet, and the TV-front's single suitcase type handle was replaced with three leather straps.|$|E

30|$|Figure  5 b (i) {{shows this}} red, yellow and black <b>diamond</b> {{patterned}} <b>cloth</b> and Fig.  5 b (ii) shows the pattern in more detail. The {{red and yellow}} is produced by differing concentrations of iron oxide. There is a trace of turmeric present in both coloured areas. This cloth is attributed to Hawaii whose geology has red earth (ochre). There was no indication that tannins {{had been used to}} create mixtures here as HPLC only detected turmeric in very low levels.|$|R
2500|$|For the {{etymology}} see [...] "diaper". The Oxford dictionary {{gives the}} Greek dia for [...] "cross" [...] as in [...] "diamond" [...] or [...] "diagonal," [...] and aspros, Greek for [...] "white". A white <b>diamond</b> or white <b>cloth</b> {{is used on}} the diagonal, hence the diagonal lattice or reticulation in patterning.|$|R
50|$|Coin means good fortune, horn {{of water}} buffalo means great fortune, <b>diamond</b> of {{wrapping}} <b>cloth</b> is pattern made for wishing good things. And illustrated book means smooth office life. Wormwood {{is a kind}} of medicinal herbs and used to light a fire, so means long life. Mirror means symbol of king or power class. 'teck kyeong' instrument(a kind of idiophone)(특경,特磬) is one of ancient instrument and made jade. Its sound was regarded rare.|$|R
50|$|The regimental badge had a <b>cloth</b> <b>diamond</b> shape backing {{split in}} half {{coloured}} black {{on the left}} side and rifle green on the right side with the first three battalions having vertical red stripes for the number of the battalion, one, two and three respectively. The 4th (Manicaland) Battalion (4 RR) wore a blue and white hackle, the colours of Umtali. In 1960 the diamond-shaped flash was changed to an all-red diamond, similar to the KRRC.|$|R
5000|$|This first {{generation}} of AC30s were housed in [...] "TV-front" [...] cabinets, much like the early to mid-50s tweed Fender amps, and had a single 12-inch Goodmans 60-watt speaker, {{as opposed to the}} later, conventional twin 12-inch speaker configuration. These early amps sported a thin white covering ("Rexine") with a small printed diamond pattern and larger <b>diamond</b> pattern grill <b>cloth.</b> However, the EL34-powered AC30 was short lived, and a new AC30 version appeared in late 1959. This second generation AC30/4 had two channels with two inputs, hence the [...] "4" [...] in the model name, and a single tone control, and was powered by a quartet of EL84 (6BQ5) power tubes, making it truly a doubling of the AC15 power amp circuit. The AC30/4 also carried over the AC15's preamplifier circuit, which included the EF86 pentode in its [...] "Normal" [...] channel. Vox initially offered a 1×12" [...] version but subsequently introduced the 2×12" [...] AC30 Twin, which solved the volume problem at larger venues. The first AC30 Twins used two Goodmans Audiom 60 15-Watt Speakers, followed by Celestion G12 alnico speakers.|$|R
6000|$|Just as {{the party}} issued from {{the gate of the}} park into the street of the hamlet, a heavy gun was fired from the fleet. It was soon succeeded by others, and whiffs and cornets were seen flying from the mast-heads that rose above the {{openings}} in the cliffs, the signals of recall for all boats. This set every one in motion, and, never within the memory of man, had Wychecombe presented such a scene of confusion and activity. Half-intoxicated seamen were driven down to the boats, by youngsters with the <b>cloth</b> <b>diamond</b> in their collars, like swine, who were reluctant to go, and yet afraid to stay. Quarters of beeves were trundled along in carts or barrows, and were soon seen swinging at different main-stays; while the gathering of eggs, butter, poultry, mutton, lamb, and veal, menaced the surrounding country with a scarcity. Through this throng of the living and the dead, our party held its way, jostled by the eager countrymen, and respectfully avoided by all who belonged to the fleet, until it reached the point where the roads to the cliffs and the landing separated, when the vice-admiral turned to the only midshipman present, and courteously lifting his hat, as if reluctant to impose such a duty on a [...] "young gentleman" [...] on liberty, he said-- ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{will discuss the}} intersections of art and history {{with a focus on}} family and {{community}} and will examine immigration, resettlement, loyalty, and mental health concepts in a traditional Chinese American perception. During my 30 year career as an artist, I have used oral history as a foundation to explore the impact of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Law on my family and community, including later immigrants; I have transformed these little-known chronicles into art that speaks to the universality of adjustment to space and place. The iconic materials that I have used to convey these narratives are <b>cloth</b> <b>Diamond</b> Double A rice sacks, canvases no longer being manufactured to package rice. In particular, I will be showing images from my installations entitled the Baby Jack Rice Story, which narrates the memory of my husband‘s (Edward K. Wong) tri-cultural African American, Chinese American, and white-childhood during segregation in Augusta, Georgia, made in usa: Angel/sland Shhh, an exploration of identity secrets of paper people, Chinese immigrants who entered this country under false identities and who were subsequently detained and interrogated, Kindred Spirit, an inquiry of the 1999 wrongful incarceration of nuclear scientist, Wen Ho Lee, who was accused of mishandling sensitive nuclear secrets, and My Sister: Li Hong, a personal probe into the resilient story of my 87 year old developmentally-challenged sister. These extraordinary stories of ordinary people, created on Diamond Double A rice sacks, are sagas that deserve a place in the American landscape of art. They have transformed me, the creator, and the stakeholders, those who have told their stories publicly (some for the first time). As a result, we are healing from these challenging and shameful American experiences that we once hid from ourselves and others...|$|R
