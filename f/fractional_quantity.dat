40|$|We {{find the}} {{coexistence}} of {{two kinds of}} non-abelian anyons, Majorana fermion at the geometric ends and Jackiw-Rebbi-type bound state (JRBS) at a domain-wall, in a topological superconducting phase in one-dimensional (1 D) systems. Each localized JRBS carries a new <b>fractional</b> <b>quantity,</b> half of the parity of fermion number. This induces a topological protected crossing at the zero energy for its eigen-energy. For a chain embedded with a JRBS, one is possible to switch between the occupied and empty states of Majorana zero energy state (MZES) by varying the strength of external magnetic field across that crossing point. This enable a way to encode a quantum qubit into one MZES without breaking parity conservation. We propose that such JRBS and Majorana fermion can appear in two 1 D models, one can be accomplished in an artificial lattice with staggered hopping, staggered spin-orbital interaction and staggered superconducting pairing for cold fermion atoms, the other is describing a 1 D semiconductor chain sandwiched between s-wave superconductor and antiferromagnet.

40|$|Nanocrystalline {{samples of}} PbF 2 doped with 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 4 and 1  mol% Mn 2 +, used as {{paramagnetic}} probe, were prepared by inert gas condensation technique. All {{the samples were}} vacuum annealed at different temperatures to get different grain sizes. The X-ray diffraction studies showed the dominant content of β-PbF 2 phase with a <b>fractional</b> <b>quantity</b> of α-PbF 2. Thermal stability and sublattice melting were studied by TGA and DSC respectively. EPR measurements were made on all these samples at  77 and 300  K. The EPR spectra of all samples were found to contain well resolved sextet arising from the Mn 2 + ions that occupied the cubic sites of Pb 2 + ion of PbF 2 lattice. The lower concentration of the Mn 2 + ions (0. 05 and 0. 1  mol%) clearly monitored the Pb 2 + environment in the PbF 2 lattice. The 0. 4  mol% showed the presence of only the cubic sites with a minor concentration of the orthorhombic sites. The spectra corresponding to  1 mol% Mn 2 + clearly showed two different components. The isotropic nature of the 1  mol% as-prepared sample implied {{that there was no}} cluster formation and hence this EPR spectrum was taken as the single ion spectrum. The annealed samples contain two spectral components; one is from the isolated single ions and the other one from the Mn 2 + clusters. The spectral component of Mn 2 + clusters was obtained by subtracting the spectrum for the as-prepared sample for the spectra of annealed samples. The extracted cluster phase spectra and the pure spectrum from the as-prepared sample were then combined to simulate the entire set of experimental spectra. The simulated spectra were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The g values obtained were in the range very close to the free electron g factor as the electrons are in the S state (L= 0).

40|$|Students with {{mathematical}} {{learning disabilities}} (MLDs) experience persistent challenges learning {{even the most}} elementary mathematics. While prior research on MLDs has classified students {{on the basis of}} test scores and documented performance differences between groups, this dissertation focuses on the qualitative differences in individual students with MLDs as each student attempted to learn. This study extends the understanding of MLDs by (1) focusing on the mathematical domain of fractions, (2) selecting for study students whose difficulties with mathematics are clearly due to an MLD and not other factors, (3) conducting detailed diagnostic analyses of video-taped tutoring sessions, and (4) contrasting the difficulties that the students with MLDs experience to data collected with five typically achieving fifth grade control students. The two case study students, "Lisa" (19 -year-old community college student) and "Emily" (18 -year-old high school student) each participated in a pretest, four weekly tutoring sessions, and a posttest focused on fraction concepts. Achievement test scores, interviews, and videotaped tutoring session data were used to establish that Lisa and Emily met classic MLD qualifications, and more stringent response-to-intervention criteria. Both students demonstrated unexplained persistent low math achievement and neither student benefited from a tutoring protocol that had been effective for typically achieving fifth grade students. The tutoring sessions were analyzed using microgenetic methods. Analysis indicated that each student relied upon a unique collection of atypical understandings, which reoccurred across the sessions, were resistant to standard instructional approaches, and proved to be highly consequential for the student's ability to understand more complex fraction concepts. A cross case analysis revealed surprising similarities in the atypical understandings displayed by both case study students. These atypical understandings stemmed from and contributed to the student's inability to conceptualize and manipulate representations of <b>fractional</b> <b>quantity.</b> These atypical understandings were not similarly problematic for the fifth grade control students, but did appear in one additional student with an MLD. This suggests that there are qualitative differences in the difficulties experienced by students with MLDs and that {{it may be possible to}} design screening measures to identify these indicators of atypicality. In addition, remediation approaches should take into account and specifically target these atypicalities...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{lesson is}} presented to help teachers understand why one can invert and multiply to divide fractions. I chose the topic not because I argue {{for the value of}} teaching fractions, but because it is a topic that most teachers understand only instrumentally and because understanding the relationships among <b>fractional</b> <b>quantities</b> requires multiplicative reasoning, the cornerstone to proportional reasoning. Fractions are introduced via pattern blocks, and ways to connect the physical models to symbolic representations in combining and separating <b>fractional</b> <b>quantities</b> are explored, with special attention to common confusions between multiplication and subtraction situations.

These studies follow up on testing conducted in August 2010 and reported at ICES 2011. The tests were conducted at the NASA White Sands Test Facility in a custom glove box designed for burning <b>fractional</b> gram <b>quantities</b> of materials under varying heating profiles.

Evaluating new technologies for measuring carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride and other species of interest was a key objective of the test. Some of these sensors were located inside the glovebox near the fire source to avoid losses through the sampling lines; the rest were located just outside the glovebox.

Two publications have appeared in the literature based on work at this facility [1, 2], and other work has been presented at several conferences and is being prepared for publication. Significant findings are summarized below. Enhanced site resolution in 11 B MAS NMR. While differentiation between three- and four-coordinate borons in borates can generally be achieved at moderately high fields (e. g.,> 11. 7 T), the distinction between different three-coordinate borons requires very high fields. In the present case, 11 B MAS NMR of a lithium borate invert glass at 21. 1 T yielded unprecedented resolution of the various trigonal borons present and provided an opportunity to test speciation models in the high-alkali region. Surprisingly, these experiments also found significant differences between the network structure of lithium borates and those of the other alkali borate glasses, where lower-field NMR studies found none. Furthermore, the cation disorder and paramagnetic impurities often present in natural minerals can cause peak broadening which compromises site resolution and quantification in borosilicates. Using the ultrahigh-field NMR facility, well-resolved 11 B MAS NMR spectra could be obtained for tourmalines, allowing straightforward analysis of the total and <b>fractional</b> boron contents, <b>quantities</b> not easily accessible by conventional techniques such as x-ray diffraction and electron-microprobe analysis.
