25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the key was}} {{narrower}} than it {{is today}} and had the shape of a keyhole, measuring six feet (1.8m) wide, hence [...] "the key", with the free-throw circle as the head, and the shaded lane as the body. It has been also called [...] "cup" [...] or [...] "bottle" [...] in other languages, because of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> from other perspectives. Due to the narrowness of the key, imposing centers, such as George Mikan, dominated the paint, scoring at will. To counter this, the key was widened into 12feet (3.7m) from [...] {{at the onset of the}} 1951–52 NBA season.|$|E

2500|$|The {{numbers in}} the list depend on the choice of {{coordinate}} system. [...] For instance, if the vector represents position with respect to an observer (position vector), then the coordinate system may be obtained from a system of rigid rods, or reference axes, along which the components v1, v2, and v3 are measured. [...] For a vector to represent a geometric object, it must be possible to describe <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> in any other coordinate system. [...] That is to say, {{the components of the}} vectors will transform in a certain way in passing from one coordinate system to another.|$|E
2500|$|Cliff Curtis as Searle, the ship's {{doctor and}} {{psychological}} officer. He {{is obsessed with}} the Sun and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> when staring at it without any type of protection. The role of Searle was originally written to be a [...] "slightly stiff" [...] British character. Curtis {{was drawn to the}} role based on the script and also expressed interest in working with the director. Boyle was familiar with Curtis from Training Day (2001) and Whale Rider (2002), and Curtis's audition appealed to Boyle strongly enough to cast the actor as Searle. Curtis initially foresaw an esoteric approach for his character, but he later pursued a military and scientific approach based on the seriousness of the mission. The actor also compared Searle to the character of Pinbacker, noting their similarities and differences: [...] " [...] would sacrifice those beliefs and views, his life, for the greater good, whereas Pinbacker, who's come to a place he believes is right, would sacrifice the world for his beliefs. They're {{two sides of the same}} coin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucas Sullivan at GamesRadar {{wrote that}} Cuphead [...] "stands tall {{among the best}} 2D {{shooters}} of all time", and agreed the gameplay challenges demanded patient pattern recognition to be accomplished, from which he said players would be rewarded [...] "tenfold". Sullivan called the animation adorable, noting the wealth of detail present in the watercolor backdrops, and said it worked well with the gameplay. Like Carsillo, Sullivan claimed never to be frustrated with the difficulty. Giant Bomb's Ben Pack remarked that playing the game yielded {{one of his most}} enjoyable experiences with video games, citing the combination of [...] "brutal" [...] platforming and an [...] "exceptionally well realized" [...] art style. Writing for IGN, Joe Skrebels declared every scene a [...] "masterwork" [...] and commended the sound work, calling it an [...] "ideal match" [...] to the aesthetics. Platforming battles were seen as the most imaginative part of the game, and having no health bars for enemies its [...] "smartest" [...] and [...] "most devilish" [...] addition. Like Brown and Sullivan, Skrebels found the battles to be rewarding as well as [...] "one of Cupheads greatest strengths". Chris Schilling of PC Gamer expressed approval of the controls, saying that their [...] "reliable jump and dash" [...] led to more [...] "nimble and responsive" [...] handling. Disagreeing with Makedonski, Schilling explained that certain random elements meant [...] "you can't simply learn patterns by rote and rely entirely on muscle memory". Chris Plante at Polygon commented that, at its best, the game serves to educate the player in strategy through trial and error. He enjoyed the parrying system more so than the various attacks, as it proved to be a [...] "crucial" [...] and [...] "relatively forgiving" [...] mechanic. Colm Ahern of VideoGamer.com wrote in his verdict, [...] "Cuphead will best most games in <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> and sounds, and defeating that boss that you once deemed unbeatable is glorious".|$|E
