Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 53). Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. {{is one of the}} world‟s most successful fast moving consumer goods manufacturing companies with local manufacturing facilities, reporting to regional business groups for innovation and business results. Unilever Bangladesh Limited has five departments to carry out all the organizational functions. I was appointed in Brand Activation Departments Headed by the Brand Activation Manager as an intern. This internship report is on “Hair Care Survey on Parlors & Salons in Dhaka”. The report comprises the survey of 60 ladies parlors and 34 men‟s salons in the Dhaka metropolitan city. The survey includes both qualitative and quantitative issues. The findings differed slightly between the two groups of gender. Women are more concerned about voluminous hair and prevention of split ends than men but both the gender are concerned about nourishment of hair, hair fall problems, <b>dandruffs</b> etc. Both men and women are becoming increasingly aware {{of the quality of the}} hair care products used in parlors and salons. According to the survey, majority of the parlors are using cheap Chinese, Thai or Indian herbal shampoos and conditioners. Caring conditioner is a prominent brand used in parlors owing to its cost effectiveness. Among the local brands, Sunsilk is the most commonly used brand in Grade B and Grade C parlors and Pantene is used in Grade A parlors especially for premium customers as Pantene is considered as high end product by customers. In men‟s salons, Pantene and Head & Shoulder dominate while conditioners are rarely used. Men‟s salon mostly prefers 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. One of the major necessities is to build and maintain a good relationship with parlors and salons and initiatives like beauty seminars, beauty talk shows on television or radios or other promotional campaign can be arranged that will lead to a win-win situation for both the company and the parlors and salons. An important concern of parlors and salons is the unavailability of 5 liters gallon shampoos in the market, limited sales on credit and direct delivery opportunities which should be considered if profit is to be boosted from this sector. This report includes valuable insights gained from the survey and suggestions to overcome some of the problems faced by parlors and salons regarding hair care products and how a good relationship can be built with parlors and salons to ensure attractive yield from this sector.

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2012. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 59). Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. (UBL) is the Bangladeshi arm of Anglo-Dutch consumer goods manufacturer Unilever which is {{regarded as one of}} the world‟s most successful fast moving consumer goods manufacturing companies with access to global resources as well as local manufacturing facilities, economies of scale and above all synergy of resources and operations across the world. Unilever Bangladesh Limited, the leading company in the Bangladeshi consumer market has five departments to carry out all its organizational functions. Having owned some dominant brands in Home and Personal care product portfolio, the company now wants to evaluate its potential in the beauty salon business in Bangladesh with its fast growing hair care brands like Sunsilk, Clear and Dove. I was appointed in Brand Development Departments specially hair care department headed by the Senior Brand Manager as an intern to “Assess the feasibility of Unilever‟s market potential in Beauty salon business” on which my internship report is based. This research report is however designed to explore and assess the impact of consumer‟s hair care experiences provided through services in the beauty salon in Dhaka metropolitan city and Chittagong. The study was conducted through use of a survey questionnaire followed by personal interviews of 24 ladies parlors, 4 men‟s salon and 43 individual customers respectively in the corresponding cities. It was carried out as the basis for understanding a comprehensive abstract of consumer stance towards the hair care product that are being used in the beauty salon to provide the hair care services. A substantial amount of data which includes both qualitative and quantitative issues resulted by the survey were then analyzed to learn more about the impact of these experiences, parlor‟s inside activities, hair care services and brand preference of both parlors and customers. Although both women and men were engaged in conducting the survey, however women appeared to be more concerned about voluminous hair and prevention of split ends than men. Based on several important factors, this systematic study yielded rich quantitative data (presented through figures, graphs,) and qualitative data (comments and opinions) which led to ascertain the market potential for UBL in the beauty salon industry in Bangladesh. The statistics and comments obtained, provided substantial evidence that now a days almost everyone both male and female who are concerned about hair, consider hair treatment in beauty salons. Specific attributes of hair care problems like nourishment of hair, hair loss, <b>dandruffs</b> were cited as extremely important to the success of a quality hair care product with the suggestion that there may be a potential market for an herbal hair care product. The author gained dramatic insights about the significance of brand and quality and how it influences the consumers‟ attitude in choosing a hair care product like shampoo. Though customers personally prefer Dove, Pantene is however regarded as the most preferred brand followed by Sunsilk by the majority of the beauty salons. This report provided valuable insights gained from the survey and suggestions to overcome some of the problems faced by parlors and salons regarding hair care products and thus analyzed the gaps and opportunities in the beauty salon market in Bangladesh to implement an effective plan to strengthen the use of UBL‟s hair care product in the beauty salons. The approach will not only utilize the favorable market condition that Unilever already holds but will also secure a strong market position for long term and thus will set the ball rolling towards the corporate and strategic goals of UBL for the forthcoming years.

25|$|Older {{literature}} {{cites the}} fungus Malassezia furfur (previously known as Pityrosporum ovale) {{as the cause}} of <b>dandruff.</b> While this species does occur naturally on the skin surface of both healthy people and those with <b>dandruff,</b> in 2007 it was discovered that the responsible agent is a scalp specific fungus, Malassezia globosa, that metabolizes triglycerides present in sebum by the expression of lipase, resulting in a lipid byproduct oleic acid. During <b>dandruff,</b> the levels of Malassezia increase by 1.5 to 2 times its normal level. Oleic acid penetrates the top layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, and evokes an inflammatory response in susceptible people which disturbs homeostasis and results in erratic cleavage of stratum corneum cells.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dandruff</b> {{scale is}} {{a cluster of}} corneocytes, which have {{retained}} a large degree of cohesion {{with one another and}} detach as such {{from the surface of the}} stratum corneum. A corneocyte is a protein complex that is made of tiny threads of keratin in an organised matrix. The size and abundance of scales are heterogeneous from one site to another and over time. Parakeratotic cells often make up part of <b>dandruff.</b> Their numbers are related to the severity of the clinical manifestations, which may also be influenced by seborrhea.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2016 study, {{bacteria}} (mainly Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus) {{are more}} important to <b>dandruff</b> formation than fungi. Bacterial presence was in turn influenced by water and sebum amount.|$|E

25|$|Tea tree oil is toxic {{when taken}} by mouth, but {{is widely used}} in low {{concentrations}} in cosmetics and skin washes.

It is my understanding that, in law, First Amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative. In this context, the PMRC's demands are the equivalent of treating <b>dandruff</b> by decapitation....
