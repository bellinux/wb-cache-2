50|$|The vexed {{question}} {{of liberty and}} necessity appears to be carefully avoided in Hutcheson's professedly ethical works.

This is substantially <b>the</b> same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> doctrine propounded by Hobbes and Locke (to the latter of whom Hutcheson refers in a note), namely that our will is determined by motives in conjunction with our general character and habit of mind, and that the only true liberty is the liberty of acting as we will, not the liberty of willing as we will. Though, however, his leaning is clear, he carefully avoids dogmatising, and deprecates the angry controversies to which the speculation on this subject had given rise.|$|R
