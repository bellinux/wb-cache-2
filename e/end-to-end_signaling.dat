In this context, the E 2 E QoS (Quality of Service) always remains as a challenge. In fact, the E 2 E supposes that apart the network resource, the service {{should be taken into}} account as an important resource, in the form of service component, i. e., we should also provision and monitor the service resource and verify the conformation to the QoS contract. In this paper, we propose a “dynamic user oriented end-to-end QoS signaling” for the service delivery in order to provision and dynamically negotiate the different services in the NGN environment. This <b>end-to-end</b> <b>signaling</b> extends to process the service delivery to maintain QoS continuity.

Consequently, the path management is simplified because {{there is no need to}} store specific routing tables at the RS level and there is a reduced need for signaling to update the path information. On the other hand, the explicit path management approach uses an <b>end-to-end</b> <b>signaling</b> mechanism in order to distribute the routing table along the path. In more details, each path is identified by a path ID to which the CIDs are bound. The MR-BS needs to send the required information to the RSs belonging to the concerned path whenever it is created, updated or removed. Optionally, the MR-BS may specify the QoS requirements associated with each CID in order to enable the RSs to take the scheduling decision independently in case of distributed scheduling mode. The explicit path management approach needs small routing tables at the RSs and enables a reduction of the overhead required to update these tables, [10].|$|E

40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) are infrastructureless networks {{formed by}} wireless mobile devices with limited battery life. In MANETs for civilian applications, the network nodes may {{not belong to}} a single authority {{and they may not}} have a common goal. These MANETs are particularly vulnerable to selfish behavior, as some nodes may prefer saving resources to forward data. There are a few generic reputation-based systems for MANETs which could be used to enforce cooperation among nodes. However, we envision that the system performance can be highly improved by using cross-layer techniques that take into account the specific characteristics of each particular service. In this article, we propose a distributed and easy-to-implement routing mechanism based on reputation for the provision of MPEG- 2 video-streaming services over MANETs. The main novelty that we introduce regarding the existent literature is that our proposal is service aware, that is to say, we consider the video-streaming service characteristics to develop a cross-layer design with the routing protocol. In addition, we do not introduce extra signaling overhead to monitor reputation because we use the standard video-streaming <b>end-to-end</b> <b>signaling.</b> Finally, simulation results show that our proposal clearly outperforms both standard Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and OCEAN (a generic reputation-based mechanism).

40|$|Reservation-based Quality of Service (QoS) in a mixed {{wireless}} and wireline environment {{requires an}} <b>end-to-end</b> <b>signaling</b> protocol that {{is capable of}} adapting to the idiosyncrasies of the different networks. The QoS NSIS Signaling Protocol (QoSNSLP) has been created by the Next Steps In Signaling working group at the IETF to fulfill this need for an adaptive reservation protocol. It allows reservation requests to be interpreted by equipment implementing different QoS models along the path between a data sender and a data receiver. This paper describes the QoS-NSLP, and an example of a particular QoS model that is based on Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD). RMD provides a scalable dynamic resource management method for Diffserv networks. RMD has two basic functions to control the traffic load in a Diffserv domain: it provides admission control for flows entering the network and it has an algorithm that terminates the required amount of flows in case of congestion caused by failures (e. g. link or router) bandwidth and require per-flow reservations. On the other hand, the wireline networks tend to form the backbones and have relatively abundant bandwidth and carry a large number of flows, where aggregation is necessary since per-flow reservations suffer from scalability constraints...|$|E
30|$|With {{the growth}} in {{potential}} use of MANETs, {{a lot of research}} is being focused on providing QoS [7 – 15]. For the current Internet, there are two different models to obtain a QoS guarantee, namely, Integrated Services (IntServ) [9] and Differentiated Services (DiffServ) [16]. Using resource reservation protocol, RSVP [17, 18] IntServ carries QoS parameters from senders to receivers to make resource reservations along a path and hence provides a rich end-to-end QoS solution, by the way of <b>end-to-end</b> <b>signaling,</b> state-maintenance for each RSVP-flow as well as reservation and admission control at each network element. As an alternate, DiffServ works on a service level agreement between providers and users. All packets from a user carry service levels and are treated accordingly. Multiple flows in DiffServ model are mapped to a single service level and state information about every flow need not be maintained along the paths. The IntServ-based model on per-flow resource reservation is not particularly suitable for MANETs because of its frequently changing topology and limited resources. This results more signaling overhead and unaffordable storage and computing power for mobile nodes. However, DiffServ-based approach is a lightweight model using a relative-priority scheme to soften the requirements of hard QoS models like IntServ. Since service differentiation is based on per-hop behaviors no flow states need to be maintained and making DiffServ as a potential QoS model in MANETs.|$|E
