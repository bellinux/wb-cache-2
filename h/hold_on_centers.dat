On their first play from scrimmage, Lewis Tillman lost a fumble that was recovered by Vikings lineman Henry Thomas on the Chicago 6-yard line. The Vikings then scored on Fuad Reveiz' 29-yard field goal {{to give them a}} 3-0 lead, but only after a <b>holding</b> penalty <b>on</b> <b>center</b> Jeff Christy eliminated Terry Allen's touchdown run. After the kickoff, the Bears lost another turnover, this time an interception by Vikings defensive back Anthony Parker, who returned it 10 yards to the Chicago 39-yard line.

The Long Island Rail Road has served the town since 1885 (and possibly as early as 1867), but the town did not take on a suburban character until the housing development between the 1950s and 1970s.

50|$|Montgomery County Public Schools {{officials}} {{plan to move}} Tilden Middle School out of {{its current}} facility and into a newly renovated school by 2019. It would be moved back to a modernized Tilden <b>Holding</b> <b>Center</b> <b>on</b> Tilden Lane (where it was originally located before 1991). The Tilden Holding Center {{was used as a}} holding facility for middle schools undergoing renovation. A feasibility study is scheduled which will determine the scope and cost of the Tilden modernization. The county no longer has a holding facility that can accommodate a high school. The current site of Tilden would fit that bill once the Tilden students return to their original building.|$|R
40|$|Suicide {{in young}} {{children}} seem to occur more frequently now than ever before. Children as young as five years old have been admitted to the intense patient Behavioral Health facilities. It is important that these enclosed facilities are comfortable for these children while they are under analysis and treatment. The difficulty in term of design for these facilities that they are particularly secluded and closed-off {{to the public for}} the protection of the children. However, if the design is successful, it will help to heal the children. This thesis will analyze on three issues with Behavioral Health facilities. The first problem is the design of Behavioral Health centers, which creates a feeling of enclosure and imprisonment. The second issue is the traditional architecture vernacular of these facilities. They are not well thought-out with the interest of the children. The third issue is the stigma that is attach to Behavioral Health centers. Society overlooks and stereotypes these children. These issues can be resolved through architecture. •	Architecture can translate nature and natural elements into spatial experiences of reflection. •	Architecture can affect mental health through space, form, function, light, and materials. •	Architecture can provide an aesthetic that can sway or influence negative social stigmas and images that society <b>holds</b> <b>on</b> behavioral <b>centers.</b> •	Architecture can provide defined enclosure without restrained containment while simultaneously offering protection. This thesis will explore these theories and apply them to the design of the children residential treatment facility in the Cheverly neighborhood in Prince George’s County, Maryland where at risk children can come together for support, to be treated, and become part of the community...|$|R
50|$|The Packers won {{the coin}} toss, {{and decided to}} kick. On the first drive, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's six-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Brandon Marshall, which the Packers responded with Eddie Lacy's two-yard touchdown run. During Chicago's next drive, on 4th and 1, Cutler fumbled the snap, and upon picking up the ball, recorded a 16-yard run on an accidental fumblerooski. The drive continued into the second quarter, ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged touchdowns on the final three plays: Aaron Rodgers' three-yard pass to Nelson, Cutler's eight-yard pass to Jeffery, and Rodgers' 22-yard pass to Cobb. The Bears reached the Packers' nine-yard line by the final play of the first half; on the play, Cutler's pass for Bennett was ruled short of a touchdown. During the television review, Micah Hyde covered the camera angle, preventing the touchdown and ending the half with the Packers leading 21-17. In the third quarter, the Packers drove to the Bears' 34-yard line, where Rodgers completed a touchdown pass to Davante Adams, which would be nullified by a <b>holding</b> penalty <b>on</b> <b>center</b> Corey Linsley; Crosby would eventually kick a 53-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler's pass for Josh Morgan would be tipped by Williams and intercepted by Clay Matthews, with Green Bay capitalizing on the takeaway with Rodgers' 11-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On the next drive, Shields intercepted Cutler, and Crosby kicked a 23-yard field goal; however, a <b>holding</b> penalty <b>on</b> Jon Bostic led to Rodgers' three-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. On Chicago's next drive, Williams intercepted Cutler, but the play would be nullified; the Bears would subsequently punt. On the Packers' next drive, they would reach the Bears' 20-yard line before Crosby's field goal was blocked by Willie Young, the first block by the Bears in over a year. Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler on the final drive, and the Bears ran out the clock to end the game.|$|R
