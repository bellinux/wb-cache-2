50|$|The {{limiting}} factor in shell deposition may be saturation state, especially for aragonite, {{which is a}} more soluble and less stable form of CaCO3 than calcite. In 1998, the average global aragonite saturation state was 390%, a range commonly experienced since the last glacial period and a percentage above which calcification rates plateaued. However, there is a precipitous drop in calcification rate with aragonite saturation state dropping below 380%, with a three-fold decrease in calcification accompanying a drop to 98% saturation. By 2100, pCO2 of 560 and pH drop to 7.93 (global ocean average) will reduce the saturation state to 293%, which is unlikely to cause calcification decreases. The following 100-200 years may see pCO2 increase to 1000, pH drop to 7.71, and aragonite saturation state drop to 192, which {{would result in a}} 14% drop in calcification rate based on this alone. This could be exacerbated by low salinity from higher precipitation in estuaries, but could also be mitigated by increased temperature which could increase calcification rates. The <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>pH,</b> temperature and salinity in estuaries and in the world ocean will drive calcification rates and determine future species assemblages based on susceptibility to this change.|$|E

The hierarchical quadratic model represents adequately the response surface space based on the adjusted determination coefficient (R 2 adj =  0.9868) and the adequate precision ratio (40.483). By using this model, at the optimal conditions (pH 2.1, 0.72  g of biomass, 30  min contact time and 15.57  mg L− 1 of carbaryl concentration), the predicted removal efficiency achieved near 100  % of carbaryl from aqueous solutions when using P. stratiotes biomass.

To achieve this goal, we examined the influence of acidification and shading of the larval environment on amphibian skin-associated innate immune defense traits, pre and post-metamorphosis, across two populations of American Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), a species known for its wide-ranging environmental tolerance and introduced global distribution. We assessed treatment effects on 1) skin-associated microbial communities and 2) post-metamorphic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production and 3) AMP bioactivity against the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). While habitat acidification did not affect survival, time to metamorphosis or juvenile mass, we found that a change in average pH from 7 to 6 caused a significant shift in the larval skin microbial community, an effect which disappeared after metamorphosis. Additionally, we found shifts in skin-associated microbial communities across life stages suggesting they are affected by the physiological or ecological changes associated with amphibian metamorphosis.

We found that 1) acid-tolerant taxa are generally associated with nutrient-poor conditions, {{with only a few}} exceptions; this is probably more a consequence of habitat availability than reflecting true ecological niches; 2) correlation coefficients between nutrient indices and TP, as well as acid conditions indices and pH were barely affected when the confounding factor was removed; 3) the association of acid-tolerant taxa with nutrient-poor conditions means that the lowest possible nutrient index at a site, as indicated by benthic algae, is lower at acid than at circumneutral sites. Although this may be an artifact of the datasets from which taxa-specific indicator values were derived, it could lead to a drift in nutrient indices with recovery from acidification; 4) the response of non-diatom taxon richness follows a complex pattern with a synergistic <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> nutrient supply and pH. In contrast, diatom richness follows a simple additive pattern; this suggests structural differences between diatoms and non-diatom benthic algae in their response to nutrient supply and pH; diatom taxon richness tended to increase with nutrient supply, while non-diatom richness decreased.

A two-step simple sequential strategy was employed for the optimization of carotenoid production by Rhodotorula rubra. In the first step, one factor at a time was employed to evaluate the impact of pH on carotenoid production. The outcome revealed that pH has noteworthy influence on pigment production at ambient conditions with constant temperature and agitation. The produced carotenoid was characterized and confirmed by UV-Visible and FT-IR spectroscopic analyses.

Ten samples of the longissimus dorsi muscles of each group were collected and distributed in an entirely randomized design, in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement, with two conditions (pH 45 5. 7), and four marinade solutions: TC, no marinade; TM 1, sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride; TM 2, sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium chloride; TM 3, sodium bicarbonate, sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium chloride. There was no <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>pH</b> 45 of the meat and the marinade treatments. Meat with pH 45 < 5. 7 showed higher values for lightness, and for purge loss (PL), exudate loss (EL), cooking loss (CL) and shear force (SF). Marinating increased the pH, reduced the lightness, EL, CL and SF, and improved tenderness, juiciness and flavor of meat. Marinades with solutions containing chloride, bicarbonate, and sodium tripolyphosphate are effective in the improvement of pork quality, making physical characteristics of marinated meat similar to those of fresh pork, as a consequence of accelerated postmortem glycolysis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDbl {{proteins}} are {{guanine nucleotide}} exchange factors for Rho GTPases, containing adjacent Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. This domain architecture is virtually invariant and typically required for full exchange potential. Several structures of DH/PH fragments bound to GTPases implicate the PH domain in nucleotide exchange. To more {{fully understand the}} functional linkage <b>between</b> DH and <b>PH</b> domains, we have determined the crystal structure of the DH/PH fragment of Dbs without bound GTPase. This structure is generally similar to previously determined structures of Dbs bound to GTPases albeit with greater apparent mobility between the DH and PH domains. These comparisons suggest that the DH and PH domains of Dbs are spatially primed for binding GTPases and small alterations in intradomain conformations that may be elicited by subtle biological responses, such as altered phosphoinositide levels, are sufficient to enhance exchange by facilitating <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> the <b>PH</b> domain and GTPases...|$|R
30|$|The {{response}} surface in Fig.  4 e is steep, indicating the notable influence of temperature and pH {{on the total}} number of living bacteria. In addition, the contour line in Fig.  4 f is oval and the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> temperature and <b>pH</b> was significant. Under a constant shaking speed (the level is 0), {{the total number of}} living bacteria first increased and then decreased as the temperature and inoculum volume increased and the vertex of the surface indicates the maximum amount of total living bacteria.|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal fluid is {{a complex}} milieu and it is {{recognised}} that gut drug solubility is different to that observed in simple aqueous buffers. Simulated gastrointestinal media have been developed covering fasted and fed states to facilitate in vitro prediction of gut solubility and product dissolution. However, the combination of bile salts, phospholipids, fatty acids and proteins in an aqueous buffered system creates multiple phases and drug solubility is therefore a complex <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> these components, which may create unique environments for each API. The impact on solubility can be assessed through a statistical design of experiment (DoE) approach, to determine the influence and relationships between factors. In this paper DoE {{has been applied to}} fed simulated gastrointestinal media consisting of eight components (pH, bile salt, lecithin, sodium oleate, monoglyceride, buffer, salt and pancreatin) using a two level D-optimal design with forty-four duplicate measurements and four centre points. The equilibrium solubility of a range of poorly soluble acidic (indomethacin, ibuprofen, phenytoin, valsartan, zafirlukast), basic (aprepitant, carvedilol, tadalafil, bromocriptine) and neutral (fenofibrate, felodipine, probucol, itraconazole) drugs was investigated. Results indicate that the DoE provides equilibrium solubility values that are comparable to literature results for other simulated fed gastrointestinal media systems or human intestinal fluid samples. For acidic drugs the influence of pH predominates but other significant factors related to oleate and bile salt or <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> them are present. For basic drugs pH, oleate and bile salt have equal significance along with <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>pH</b> and oleate and lecithin and oleate. Neutral drugs show diverse effects of the media components particularly with regard to oleate, bile salt, pH and lecithin but the presence of monoglyceride, pancreatin and buffer have significant but smaller effects on solubility. There are fourteen significant <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> factors mainly related to the surfactant components and pH, indicating that the solubility of neutral drugs in fed simulated media is complex. The results also indicate that the equilibrium solubility of each drug can exhibit individualistic behaviour associated with the drug’s chemical structure, physicochemical properties and interaction with media components. The utility of DoE for fed simulated media has been demonstrated providing equilibrium solubility values comparable with similar in vitro systems whilst also providing greater information on the influence of media factors and their interactions. The determination of a drug’s gastrointestinal solubility envelope provides useful limits that can potentially be applied to in silico modelling and in vivo experiments...|$|R
