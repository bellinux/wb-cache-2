5|$|On January 31, 2008, Dutch crime {{reporter}} Peter R. de Vries {{claimed that}} he had solved the Holloway case. De Vries stated that he would tell all on a special television program on Dutch television on February 3. On February 1, the Dutch media reported that Van der Sloot made a confession regarding the disappearance of Holloway. Later that day, Van der Sloot stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the individual {{what he wanted to}} hear, and that he had no role in her disappearance. That same day, the Aruba prosecutor's office announced the reopening of the case.|$|E
5|$|In Bhattikavya, Jatayu dies in {{the arms}} of Rama without {{revealing}} that Sita is in the clutches of Ravana. After his arms are chopped, the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. The demon tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana. The demon praises Rama, who purified the demon by his sword. The demon urges Rama to believe him as he is telling the truth. At last, the demon transforms into a radiant divine being as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth and plunges into the sky.|$|E

5|$|Twenty {{years after}} Sarah's death, Joel {{works as a}} {{smuggler}} in the Boston quarantine zone with his friend and partner Tess. While out searching for a former accomplice who stole some of their merchandise, Joel and Tess are tasked by Marlene, an acquaintance and leader of a rebel militia called the Fireflies, to smuggle Ellie to a rendezvous point at the Massachusetts State House. Making their way there, Joel discovers that Ellie is immune to the infection. Upon their arrival, Tess reveals that she has sustained a bite on the journey, and insists Joel finds Tommy {{in order to continue}} the mission. Joel is initially surly and short towards Ellie, though he begins to warm up to her as their journey continues. This is compounded when Joel, having initially asked Tommy to carry on in his place after meeting up with him at his settlement in Jackson County, Colorado, changes his mind and carries on as planned. Their bond deepens when Ellie nearly loses Joel to a severe injury, and when he comes to her aid after she is nearly killed by a band of cannibals. Ultimately, Joel shows his devotion to Ellie when he chooses to rescue her from the doctors who plan to remove and examine her brain, as opposed to allowing her to die. To ensure they are not pursued, Joel kills Marlene. Driving away, Ellie wakes up, after which Joel tells her the doctors gave up on discovering a cure. Ellie later confronts him about the events, and Joel swears to her that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth.|$|E
25|$|Mantle {{spoke with}} great remorse of his {{drinking}} in a 1994 Sports Illustrated cover story. He said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> {{the same old}} stories, and realizing {{how many of them}} involved himself and others being drunk – including at least one drunk-driving accident – he decided they were not funny anymore. He admitted he had often been cruel and hurtful to family, friends, and fans because of his alcoholism, and sought to make amends. Mantle became a Christian because of his former teammate Bobby Richardson, an ordained Baptist minister who shared his faith with him. After the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, Mantle joined with fellow Oklahoman and Yankee Bobby Murcer {{to raise money for the}} victims.|$|E
500|$|The head of British Secret Intelligence Service, Stewart Menzies, {{stated that}} Cicero {{was indeed a}} double agent and that among the {{documents}} submitted to the Germans were documents of misinformation. Author James Srodes states in his biography of Allen Dulles that some British historians believed that Cicero was [...] "'turned' into a double agent to send disinformation via von Papen". Malcolm Gladwell, author of Pandora's Briefcase, said that an interviewer had questioned Menzies before he died about whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. Menzies told the interviewer [...] "Of course, Cicero was under our control," [...] but his truthfulness is questioned. Gladwell stated {{in an article in}} The New Yorker; [...] "if you had been the wartime head of M.I.6, giving an interview shortly before your death, you probably would say that Cicero was one of yours." [...] Gladwell also mentions that while Ribbentrop was wary of Bazna, which curtailed the dissemination of some of Bazna's intelligence, most German intelligence officials were not wary of him.|$|E

500|$|It {{was clear}} that Lasseter and Jobs {{believed}} that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot's Technicolor facility in Universal City, where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. When Katzenberg asked {{what they were doing}} next, Lasseter described what would become A Bug's Life in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas. Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. [...] "If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after Star Wars" [...] for computer animation companies, he told various friends. [...] "I should have been wary," [...] Lasseter later recalled. [...] "Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released." ...|$|E
500|$|Knight {{appreciated}} {{that there were}} problems with Gorman's claims, but he [...] "either misinterpreted, or deliberately ignored" [...] them. Knight admitted that parts of Gorman's story were wrong but claimed that such mistakes were [...] "stronger support {{of the fact that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> the truth". Realising that Anderson's absence in Switzerland meant that Anderson could not have been an accomplice, Knight considered Walter Sickert a much more likely culprit than Anderson, and suggested that he was the [...] "third man" [...] to participate in the crimes. This was not the first accusation made against Sickert. He had been previously mentioned as a potential suspect in Donald McCormick's 1959 book The Identity of Jack the Ripper. However, Sickert was in France with his mother and brother in the late summer of 1888, and is unlikely even to have been in London at the time of at least four of the murders. After Knight implicated Sickert, Joseph Gorman withdrew his testimony, admitting to The Sunday Times newspaper that [...] "it was a hoax... a whopping fib".|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> me about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' {{or anything like that}} at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Master Teacher" [...] was {{conceived}} by Georgia Anne Muldrow on her Rhodes piano at Sa-Ra's Cosmic Dust Studio with Badu present and was originally intended {{for one of}} their albums. Its idyllic music blends mellow soul and glitchy hip hop, featuring a chopped sample of Curtis Mayfield's 1972 song [...] "Freddie's Dead". The song's lyrics envision {{a higher degree of}} African-American identity. Its vocalists ask in refrain, [...] "What if there was no niggas, only master teachers?", and answering [...] "I stay woke", with Badu responding [...] "I'm in the search of something new / Search inside me, searching inside you". Midway through the song, Poyser's keyboards lower the music's tempo, with a fluid, jazzy sound. [...] "That Hump" [...] concerns the topic of drug dependency. The closing track [...] "Telephone" [...] is a tribute to J Dilla, who died in 2006 from complications with blood disorder, and has themes of sorrow and hope. It serves as a departure from the preceding songs' edgier musical direction, featuring soft melodies and an acoustic feel similar to Badu's live sound. The song opens with the sound of ominous sirens, referencing J Dilla's 2006 album Donuts. The song's lyrics are based on a story told to Badu by J Dilla's mother on the day of his death. Poyser explained in an interview, [...] "Dilla's mom told Erykah about one day when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> her about this dream he had where Ol'Dirty was telling him to get on a different color bus and giving him directions home". According to Poyser, the song's music was inspired by Dilla's passing: ...|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Method Man {{starred in}} a Fox sitcom called Method & Red. However, {{after only a}} short time on the air, the show was put on hiatus and never returned.

When Lillard reached the punch line, Palmer, {{laughing}} heartily, slapped Lillard on the back with the hand holding the heavy book he had been reading.

2500|$|On November 13, 2006, Knight {{was shown}} {{allegedly}} hitting player Michael Prince under the chin {{to get him}} to make eye contact.

2500|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the match, Norwich manager, Mike Walker, {{remained}} resolutely optimistic: [...] "Clearly nobody had alerted Walker to the doomed nature of his mission ... the day before the game <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> anybody who would listen that he fancied it". Walker had focused his attention on an unlikely weak link in Munich's team: Lothar Matthäus was the captain of Germany, a player with a distinguished pedigree in European football. He had won most of the major honours available to him, including the most recent World Cup, the Ballon d'Or, and the FIFA World Player of the Year. Yet by now Matthäus was 32 years old, perhaps past his best. He was no longer playing in the position of midfield in which he had enjoyed so much success for club and country, he was operating for Munich as a sweeper. [...] "With the bravado of a European novice it was Walker's opinion that ... wasn't good enough. Delightfully, he was right".|$|E
