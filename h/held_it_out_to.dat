500|$|U2 {{found that}} they were neither {{prepared}} nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and {{felt that they were}} not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of [...] "Mysterious Ways". During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Bono, saying, [...] "You tell me what to play and I'll play it. You want to play it yourself? Go ahead." [...] With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' [...] "desire to hold on to solid song structures". Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song [...] "One". While working on [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—The Edge played two separate chord progressions sequentially on guitar at Lanois' encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became [...] "One". It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing [...] "blank page approach" [...] to writing and recording together.|$|E

60|$|He {{drew the}} jacket gently over Austin's swollen arm, and the latter, who <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> bare <b>to</b> the shoulder, felt the {{perspiration}} start {{from him as}} he watched the doctors bend over the limb. They said nothing for a space of seconds, and Austin fancied he would remember that time while he lived. Then, to his astonishment, the grey-haired man glanced at his companion with a little smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it is I who am foolish {{about my}} burnt hands," [...] {{answered}} Abby, in her frank, impetuous way. [...] "See how ugly it is!" [...] And she <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> as if <b>to</b> punish {{herself for the}} girlish feeling she despised.|$|R
60|$|Glenn led {{her along}} {{the base of}} the wall to three other pens, in each of which was a fat old sow with a litter. And at the last enclosure, that owing to dry soil was not so dirty, Glenn picked up a little pig and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> {{squealing}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Carley as she leaned over the fence. It was fairly white and clean, a little pink and fuzzy, and certainly cute with its curled tall.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Zane took a long, {{feathered}} arrow {{from where}} it lay on a bench, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Jonathan.|$|E
60|$|The brandy was brought--and three glasses. Frenhofer {{promptly}} {{took the}} hint and, filling {{one to the}} brim, <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the landlord.|$|E
60|$|She {{slipped his}} ring from her finger and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> him. He took it mechanically. He still felt dazed and unreal.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. I know. I am left now <b>to</b> work <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> <b>to</b> {{stick to}} the tasks that held me so {{strongly}} when my moments came. You say I have success--this vulgar, tawdry, irksome, envied thing. I have it." [...] He had a walnut in his big hand. [...] "If that was my success," [...] he said, and crushed <b>it,</b> and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for me <b>to</b> see.|$|R
60|$|But {{why this}} {{contrast}} between the forecastle and the quarter-deck, between the man-of-war's-man and his officer? Because, though war would equally jeopardize the lives of both, yet, while <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the sailor no promise of promotion, and what is called glory, these things fired the breast of his officers.|$|R
60|$|He gave {{no direct}} reply, but from his little finger he {{detached}} a ring and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for her <b>to</b> see. I saw it too, for I was standing close by Mme. la Marquise, and the flickering {{light of the}} tallow candle fell full upon the ring. It was of gold, and upon it there was an exquisitely modelled, five-petalled little flower in vivid red enamel.|$|R
60|$|Fresnel dipped a {{hand into}} his pocket, and fetched thence a key. He <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Andre-Louis in fingers that shook--more in anger than in fear.|$|E

60|$|He had {{tossed his}} purse upon the table. As {{he fell into}} this dim cogitation with himself, the student took it up, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Once when I was {{climbing}} {{with a friend}} of mine in the [...] Engadine, we saw a white flower growing virtually out of a [...] cleft in the rocks, high above our heads. My friend was a [...] botanist, and he would have that flower! I lay on my back [...] and watched him struggle to reach it, watched him often [...] slipping backwards, but gradually crawling nearer and [...] nearer, until at last, breathless, with torn clothes and [...] bleeding hands, he grasped the tiny blossom, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> [...] <b>to</b> me in triumph! Together we admired it ceaselessly as we [...] retraced our steps. But as we left the high altitudes and [...] descended into the valley, a change took place in the [...] flower. Its petals drooped, its leaves shrank and faded. [...] White became grey, the freshness which had been its chief [...] beauty faded away with every step we took. My friend kept [...] it, but he kept it with sorrow! It was no longer a beautiful [...] flower.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{surprise}} {{turned to}} suspicion when the customer, {{a man with}} a faint American accent, returned to ask for a brand of `cider champagne' that, though advertised {{on the front of the}} pub, had long been discontinued. `But the real giveaway,' recalls her nephew, Eddie Baker, 73, `was when he went to pay. Aunt Mabel told him, [...] "That'll be one and a tanner" [...] - a shilling and sixpence. She totally confused him with that bit of slang. He pulled some cash out of his pocket and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for her <b>to</b> take.' Convinced he was up to no good, Mabel had the police called - and German spy Karl Heinrich Meier, 24, was apprehended. He was hanged a few weeks later at Pentonville.|$|R
6000|$|I never, to {{the best}} of my recollection, felt the fear of death but once; that was {{yesterday}} when I delivered the picture to Hamilton. I felt, and shivered as I felt it, that I should not like to die by land or water before I see my wife and the little one; that I hope yet remains to me. But it was an idle sort of feeling, and I should not like to have it again. Poole half mentioned, in a hasty way, a circumstance that depressed my spirits for many days:--that you and Thomas were on the point of settling near Stowey, but had abandoned it. [...] "God Almighty! what a dream of happiness <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> me!" [...] writes Poole. I felt disappointment without having had hope.|$|R
6000|$|I {{struck a}} match, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> him, shaded by my hands. As the faint light illumined his face, I started back, {{and let the}} match fall:-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{interpreted}} {{her wish}} to Umslopogaas who <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> her {{but refused to}} loose it from his wrist to which it was attached by the leathern thong.|$|E

5000|$|CITATIONMAJOR DHAN SINGH THAPA1/8 GORKHA RIFLES (IC-7990)Major Dhan Singh Thapa was {{in command}} of a forward post in Ladakh. On 20 October it was {{attacked}} by the Chinese in overwhelming strength after being subjected to intensive artillery and mortar bombardment. Under his gallant command, the greatly outnumbered post repulsed the attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the aggressors. The enemy attacked again in greater numbers after heavy shelling by artillery and mortar fire Under the leadership of Major Thapa, his men repulsed this attack also with heavy losses to the enemy.The Chinese attacked for the third time, now with tanks to support the infantry. The post had already suffered large numbers of casualties in the earlier two attacks. Though considerably reduced in number <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the last. When it was finally overrun by overwhelming numbers of the enemy, Major Thapa {{got out of his}} trench and killed several of the enemy in hand-to-hand fighting before he was finally overpowered by Chinese soldiers.Major Thapa’s cool courage, conspicuous fighting qualities and leadership were in the highest traditions of our Army.|$|R
5000|$|P. Rajagopalachari, {{the then}} Diwan of Travancore, was {{the centre of}} attacks of the newspaper. The paper accused the Dewan of immorality and corruption. But [...] "the most serious thing against the Swadeshabhimani," [...] wrote the Dewan, [...] "has always been the {{remarkable}} persistence with which it preached the gospel of government by the people, and the exhortation which <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the people of Travancore to unite and demand self-government.". He also attacked the kingship of the Maharaja of Travancore: [...] " [...] The monarchs believe and force others {{to believe that they}} are God's representatives or incarnations. This is absurd. Did God create a special kind of dog to be the king of dogs, or a special kind of elephant to rule over all elephants? [...] "Swadeshabhimani's pen moved against corruption in the state and injustice in the society. He irritated the Maharajah Moolam Thirunal himself by criticizing the large expenses incurred by the Royal consort, the Panapillai Amma, by constructing private palaces and publicly celebrating the wedding of the daughter of the Maharajah.|$|R
6000|$|Sage as {{this advice}} was, and {{comfortable}} {{as was the}} prospect <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> me, I profited but little by the exhortation--partly, perhaps, because, as often as I raised my eyes from the table, I observed Miss Vernon's looks fixed on me, in which I thought I could read grave compassion blended with regret and displeasure. I began to consider how I should seek a scene of explanation and apology with her also, when she gave me to understand {{she was determined to}} save me the trouble of soliciting an interview. [...] "Cousin Francis," [...] she said, addressing me by the same title she used to give to the other Osbaldistones, although I had, properly speaking, no title to be called her kinsman, [...] "I have encountered this morning a difficult passage in the Divina Comme'dia of Dante; will you have the goodness to step to the library and give me your assistance? and when you have unearthed for me the meaning of the obscure Florentine, we will join the rest at Birkenwood-bank, and see their luck at unearthing the badger." ...|$|R

60|$|He was right. She {{unearthed}} {{it from a}} cupboard. I trotted {{back with}} it to the sitting room. Archie took the paper from me, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> his wife, Doughnuts uppermost.|$|E
