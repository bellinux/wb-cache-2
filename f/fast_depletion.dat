30|$|Each node in {{the network}} is {{connected}} in a single-hop communication to its corresponding cluster head in the above hierarchy level using link correlation, whereas in level-k hierarchy multi-hop communication is adopted between cluster heads. The level-k cluster heads form the bottleneck zone of the sink which has heavy traffic flow. This results in <b>faster</b> <b>depletion</b> of its energy reducing the network life time. To overcome it, the heterogeneous nodes are adopted as level-k cluster head, since it have more energy compared to normal nodes. After establishing a level-k cluster hierarchy using link correlation as described in section 3.1, the level-k cluster head forms a TDMA time slot for its corresponding a level-(k- 1) cluster head, while the level-(k- 1) cluster head forms a TDMA time slot for a level-(k- 2) cluster head and it is followed for all the sub-clusters. The TDMA time slot adopted between cluster heads in subsequent levels of hierarchy helps to remove the data collision and cutback the data aggregation (DA) time.|$|R

The malware at each infective node may seek to contact more susceptible nodes by amplifying the transmission range and the media scanning rate and thereby accelerate its spread. This may however lead to (a) easier detection of the malware and thus more effective counter-measure by the network, and (b) <b>faster</b> <b>depletion</b> of the battery which may in turn thwart further spread of the infection and/or exploitation of that node. We assume the viewpoint of the malware and cast the problem of dynamically selecting the transmission range and media access rate of the infective nodes as an optimal control problem.
