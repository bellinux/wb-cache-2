40|$|<b>Double</b> ion <b>beams</b> {{are often}} {{observed}} in the solar wind, but little {{work has been done}} in relating these beams to structures within the solar wind. <b>Double</b> ion <b>beams</b> are observed as beams of a given ion species and charge state occurring at two different energies. We use the three-dimensional ion plasma instrument on board the Ulysses spacecraft to look for evidence of such beams associated with the heliospheric current sheet. In a subset chosen independently of plasma parameters consisting of 8 of cover 47 crossings of the current sheet made during the inecliptic phase of the Ulysses mission we find that these <b>double</b> ion <b>beams</b> are always present {{on either side of the}} current sheet. The <b>double</b> <b>beams</b> are present in both the proton and helium species. The secondary beam typically has a higher helium abundance, which suggests that these beams are formed in the helium-rich corona rather than in interplanetary space. The <b>double</b> <b>beams</b> are not present in the interior of the current sheet. Neither collisions nor effects of plasma beta can account for the disappearance of the <b>double</b> <b>beams</b> inside the current sheet in all eight cases. We postulate that these beams are formed by reconnection occurring near the Sun in the boundary region between the open field lines of the coronal holes and the closed field line region of the heliospheric current sheet. Such a scenario would be consistent with previous X ray measurements which suggect that reconnection is occurring in this region...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two major}} classes of devices: single <b>beam</b> and <b>double</b> <b>beam.</b> A <b>double</b> <b>beam</b> {{spectrophotometer}} compares the light intensity between two light paths, one path containing a reference sample and the other the test sample. A single-beam spectrophotometer measures the relative light intensity of the beam before and after a test sample is inserted. Although comparison measurements from double-beam instruments are easier and more stable, single-beam instruments can have a larger dynamic range and are optically simpler and more compact. Additionally, some specialized instruments, such as spectrophotometers built onto microscopes or telescopes, are single-beam instruments due to practicality.|$|R

40|$|Coronal mass ejections (CME's) {{are thought}} to result {{from the loss of}} {{stability}} within a magnetically confined coronal structure leading to its radial expansion into interplanetary space. As the CME expands into the corona current sheets will form between the expanding CME and surrounding field lines in the ambient wind. This configuration may lead to reconnection between the CME and adjacemt field lines. Such reconnection may produce <b>double</b> ion <b>beams</b> as has been observed in the terrrestrial magnetosphere. We examine all 24 distinct signatures of CME's observed by Ulysses during the in-ecliptic portion of the mission. In 5 of these 24 cases the ion spectra were not clear and thus the presence of <b>double</b> ion <b>beams</b> could not be determined. In 13 of the remaining 19 CME's <b>double</b> ion <b>beams</b> were found on the leading and/or trailing edge of the CME but not in the interior of the CME. In 3 of the CME's <b>double</b> ion <b>beams</b> were found throughout the CME while in the remaining 3 CME's <b>double</b> ion <b>beams</b> were not present near or just inside of the CME. In contrast in a control sample of 19 randomly chosen intervals, <b>double</b> ion <b>beams</b> were present at the leading and/or trailing edges of the random intervals in only 3 of the 19 cases. There appears to be no correlation between probability of occurrence of <b>double</b> ion <b>beams</b> and a magnetic cloud or non-cloud configuration of the CME and no correlation between the presence of the <b>double</b> ion <b>beams</b> {{at the edges of the}} CME and the CME being a fast or slow CME...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLaser brazing {{processes}} of aluminum with both single <b>beam</b> and <b>double</b> <b>beam</b> techniques were developed {{using a new}} AlZn 13 Si 10 Cu 4 filler wire which has a lower solidification range comparing to normal AlSi 12 filler wire and the base material. Brazing experiments on both bead on plate and flange joints showed that the new wire {{has a very good}} wettability on the aluminum samples. Comparing to the AlSi 12 wire one needs a lower heat input (in some cases 73 % less heat input) for joining the same samples with the new filler wire and reaches a high hardness value in the joint.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to closed-loop control of optical jitter with a new liquid crystal <b>beam</b> steering <b>device.</b> In contrast to conventional fast steering mirrors, where the laser beam is reflected of the controlled mirror surface, the transmissive liquid crystal <b>beam</b> steering <b>device</b> optically redirects the laser <b>beam.</b> The new <b>device</b> has no moving parts and requires low operating power. This research suggest the new device can replace the fast steering mirrors in a variety of electro-optic systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The round <b>double</b> <b>beam</b> loaded in {{eccentric}} compression {{has been shown}} to produce usable data when determining the fracture properties of materials with a relatively large characteristic length. In order to reduce these data, the geometry calibration factor must be known for the combination of specimen geometry and loading technique. Numerical simulations using the boundary element method have been used to determine the geometry calibration factor for a round <b>double</b> <b>beam</b> with a length to diameter ratio of 2 : 1 loaded in {{eccentric compression}}. The factor was determined by compliance calibration and direct calculation of stress intensities. Recognizing that laboratory test specimens will not have exactly the same geometry as the simulated specimen, geometry calibration factors have been determined for variations in the base geometry as well...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{fracture}} toughness tests of concrete using wedge-loaded round <b>double</b> <b>beam</b> specimens with a length to diameter ratio of 2 : 1 show two distinctly different specimen behaviors. Either the crack {{remains in the}} plane of the notch, and a valid test result can be obtained, or there is lateral cracking around mid-length which invalidates the results. Results of a controlled study show that the behavior transitions from desired to lateral cracking as the maximum aggregate size in a particular concrete increases. Two theories are proposed to explain this behavior and transition: new crack branching and crack turning. To prevent the lateral cracking behavior, two alternate testing techniques have been developed for use with the RDB specimen. Key words: Fracture toughness testing, round <b>double</b> <b>beam</b> specimen, crack turning, specimen behavior, unreinforced concrete...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{publication}} {{presents the}} results of calculations of spans for floating bridges with open <b>double</b> T <b>beams.</b> The purpose of research is to analyze the suitability of spans from open <b>double</b> T <b>beams</b> for floating bridges with minimum weight under loads, which is provided by standards for modern floating bridges designing. Methodology. Comparative method, analytical calculation methods (influence lines methodology), strength calculations, endurance, maximum shear stress are used in this paper. Findings. Current loads for bridges calculations are 75 % more than those, for which the spans of floating bridge from NZhM- 56 property are designed. The use of open <b>double</b> T <b>beams</b> that is formed with <b>double</b> T <b>beam</b> no. 70 (the height of the open one is 104 cm) reduces the cross sectional area in a weakened spot, but virtually it does not influence the strength and durability of the material. The use of open <b>double</b> T <b>beams</b> for spans of floating bridges saves up to 22 % of metal that means one in five spans will made of saved metal. Savings on each spans, such as CRP, will be 33. 6 - 263 thous. grn. (considering the price of 1 ton of final product 29 thous. grn.). Originality. Research allows making next step in material saving and use of open <b>double</b> T <b>beams</b> for spans in the whole. Practical value.
