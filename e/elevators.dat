5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} <b>elevators.</b> The <b>elevators</b> are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The <b>elevators</b> of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the <b>elevators</b> can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The <b>elevators</b> have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three <b>elevators</b> to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{control system}} was revised and trim tabs were fitted to the <b>elevators.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} an <b>elevator</b> evacuation {{model for}} ultra-tall building which is implemented by AnyLogic package. Pedestrian {{movement and the}} <b>elevator</b> running can be well combined into the <b>elevator</b> evacuation model. Theoretical analysis is conducted to explore the influencing factors of the <b>elevator</b> evacuation and how the <b>elevator</b> evacuation time is determined by these influencing factors, including the number of occupants evacuating by one <b>elevator,</b> the height of refuge floor, the <b>elevator</b> speed and acceleration speed, the <b>elevator</b> capacity and <b>elevator</b> door width etc. Simulation experiments are conducted to analyze the <b>elevator</b> evacuation time of ultra-tall building. By theoretical and simulation analysis and the <b>elevator</b> evacuation time 说 can be expressed as functions with several variables...|$|R
50|$|Between 1955 and 1979, Dover {{acquired}} fourteen companies. A {{great deal}} of this acquisition activity served to build the Dover <b>Elevator</b> business. This <b>elevator</b> growth began in 1955, as Dover <b>Elevator</b> split from Rotary Lift and became an independent operating company within Dover. Dover's purchase of the Shepard Warner <b>Elevator</b> Company in 1958 {{marked the beginning of}} an effort to grow the <b>elevator</b> business. In 1963, Dover acquired Acme <b>Elevator,</b> and then <b>Elevator</b> Service, Reddy <b>Elevator</b> Company in 1964, and Hunter-Hayes <b>Elevator</b> Company in 1970. With these purchases, Dover soon became the third largest <b>elevator</b> company in the U.S. and remained so for many years. Dover continued to expand its <b>elevator</b> division throughout the 1960s and 1970s with the purchases of Moody & Rowe, Burch, Turnbull, Burlington, Hammond & Champness, Louisiana <b>Elevator,</b> and W.W. Moore. Ultimately, Dover sold its <b>elevator</b> business in 1998 to Thyssen AG for $1.1 billion. Dover <b>Elevator</b> had a pretax operating profit of $93 million in 1997 and the sale was mutually beneficial: it allowed Dover to focus on building its other businesses and moved ThyssenKrupp <b>Elevator</b> Americas to the number three spot worldwide in the <b>elevator</b> and escalator industry.|$|R

5|$|In mid-1913, Howe {{journeyed to}} Northwestern Ontario {{to take up}} his new post. The Board was {{headquartered}} in Fort William, Ontario, where Canadian wheat was transferred from rail to ship. The Board sought to build a series of large terminal grain <b>elevators,</b> which could process as well as store grain. The project would increase both capacity and competition—grain elevator companies had been accused by farmers' interests of charging excessive prices. The first such elevator for the Board was raised in nearby Port Arthur, Ontario, and was acclaimed {{as one of the}} best grain <b>elevators</b> ever built in Canada, and one of the cheapest. Over the next two years, Howe traveled the West, supervising the construction of terminal <b>elevators</b> near major cities and ports. The capacity would be needed, as Canadian farmers increased production during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric <b>elevators,</b> the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 <b>elevators.</b> The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The <b>elevators</b> were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} a new generation of <b>elevator</b> system, the Multi-Car <b>Elevator</b> System. It is an <b>elevator</b> system which contains more than one <b>elevator</b> car in the <b>elevator</b> shaft. In the introduction, it explains why the Multi-Car <b>Elevator</b> System is a new trend <b>elevator</b> system based on its structural design, cost saving and efficiency in <b>elevator</b> system. Different types of Multi-Car <b>Elevator</b> System such as circulation or loop-type, non-circulation and bifurcate circulation are described in section 2. In section 3, researches on dispatch strategies, control strategies and avoidance of car collision strategies of Multi-Car <b>Elevator</b> System since 2002 are reviewed. In the discussion section, it reveals some drawbacks of the Multi-Car <b>Elevator</b> System in transport capability and the risk of car collision. There are recommendations to the future work as well...|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of the elevator was also essential {{to the emergence of}} the early skyscrapers, as office buildings taller than around six stories would have been impractical without them. Powered <b>elevators</b> were first installed in England during the 1830s and spread to U.S. factories and hotels by the 1840s. <b>Elevators</b> using hoist ropes, however, could only function effectively in low-rise buildings, and this limitation encouraged the introduction of the hydraulic elevator in 1870, even though early models contained dangerous design flaws. By 1876 these problems had been resolved, providing a solution for servicing the early skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{inclined}} <b>elevators</b> {{was intended}} to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with a shorter, easier path to the train platform {{as well as to}} reduce tunneling costs. The two <b>elevators</b> were manufactured by Maspero Elevatori, in Appiano Gentile, Italy, using a controller made on Long Island, speed governors made in Ohio, and buttons and other parts in Queens. The software for the elevator was written in the United States. Maspero Elevatori assembled the <b>elevators</b> in Italy, and they failed an operational test there, prior to being shipped to the United States. The MTA said the manufacturer chose to use American subcontractors in place of local Italian suppliers after reading the specifications the transit agency submitted. The MTA worked with the manufacturer to try to resolve the problems caused by a very high level of customization.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} the increased patronage expected after {{the beginning of}} Second Avenue Subway service, the MTA built four new entrances {{at the intersection of}} Third Avenue and 63rd Street, leading to a new mezzanine at the eastern end of the station. Passengers travel between the new mezzanine and the platforms using four high-speed <b>elevators,</b> similar to the layout of several other stations deep underground. These <b>elevators</b> are the most space-efficient means of transporting people. These entrances opened on December 30, 2016. The MTA inaugurated Phase 1 of Second Avenue Subway service on January 1, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture is Saskatchewan's main {{industry}} and taking grain to <b>elevators</b> was first accomplished by horse and cart, {{to be replaced}} around World War I by truck travel. Long haul trucking flourished between 1950 and 1970. Since the 1970s, 17 {{times the number of}} grain trucks and 95 percent of goods transported now are hauled by truck across the Saskatchewan.|$|E
5|$|Angle Lake station {{consists}} of a single island platform elevated above street level, {{on the west side}} of 28th Avenue South. The station has two entrances located on the north and south sides of South 200th Street, connected to the platform by stairs, escalators and <b>elevators.</b> The station also has secure bicycle storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the Hudson Line, the Scarborough station became a Penn Central station once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Penn Central's {{continuous}} financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the MTA's Metro-North Railroad in 1983. In 2007, the MTA overhauled the station, installing new systems such as platforms, canopies, shelters, enclosed staircases, lighting, and benches. The station's overpass was demolished and a replacement was built with <b>elevators</b> on either side. The new overpass was designed in a less modern style and now has glass-sided <b>elevators.</b> During the construction, Metro-North built a temporary wooden station to the station's south.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of <b>elevators.</b> In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of <b>elevators.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} 179th Street station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system. Later in the 1980s, the station was renovated and modernized; {{as part of the}} renovation, the IND-style purple tile band was removed from the station walls, and a design with intertwining blue and orange stripes was added. During a further upgrade that occurred by about 2000, <b>elevators</b> were installed in the station to make it ADA-accessible. The <b>elevators</b> were opened around 2005. Starting in August 2007, the MTA began installing decorative ventilation grates along Hillside Avenue above the station, and sealing other grates, both in order to combat flooding. At the time, the Hillside Avenue subway was considered the most flood-prone area in the subway system.|$|E
5|$|In December 1913, Sifton moved Stewart from Municipal Affairs {{into the}} Public Works portfolio; in this capacity, Stewart {{played a major}} role in the {{incorporation}} of the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company, which was a farmer-run co-operative with a charter to own and operate grain <b>elevators.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge grain elevator, with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no {{demand for more}} grain <b>elevators,</b> as the existing <b>elevators</b> contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company managed to survive on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned from the firm. Although Howe remained a wealthy man, his business prospects were few, {{and he decided to}} seek another line of work.|$|E
