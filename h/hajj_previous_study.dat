40|$|The {{relationship}} between fandoms and religion {{has become an}} increasingly popular topic to study {{within the field of}} the sociology of religion. In <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> there have been different views concerning whether or not fandoms should be regarded as religious from a functional perspective. This issue is especially interesting considering the decreasing popularity of traditional religion in some aspects.   The aim of this essay is to study how Harry Potter fandoms are described in <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> The study aims at discerning both the empirical data and how the data is interpreted. The material in this study consists of three <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> about the communities centered around Harry Potter fandoms. These studies were analyzed in relation to Meredith B. McGuire´s (2002) concept “cultic stance” and Matt Hills (2002) concept “neoreligiosity”.  The studies were analyzed through a hermeneutical text analysis. According to the results, the Harry Potter fandoms examined in the <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> somewhat relate to both abovementioned theories. The cultic stance was applicable when the fans described a desire for some kind of god or supernatural power. The neoreligiosity was applicable when the fans described their fandom with religious language. The <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> in my material describe fandoms from different perspectives. The analyses of the <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> which resulted in that the concepts fit differently on the different <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In most research, linear {{regression}} analyses are performed without {{taking into account}} published results of similar <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> Although the prior density in Bayesian {{linear regression}} could accommodate such prior knowledge, formal models for doing so are absent from the literature. The goal {{of this paper is}} therefore to develop a Bayesian model in which a linear regression analysis on current data is augmented with the reported regression coefficients of <b>previous</b> <b>studies.</b> Two versions of this model are presented. The first version incorporates <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> through the prior density and is applicable when the current and all <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> are exchangeable. The second version models all studies in a hierarchical structure and is applicable when studies are not exchangeable. Both versions of the model are assessed using simulation studies. Performance for each in estimating the regression coefficients is consistently superior to using current data alone, and is close to that of an equivalent model that uses the data from <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> rather than reported regression coefficients. Overall the results show that augmenting data with results from <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> is viable and yields significant improvements in the parameter estimation...|$|R
