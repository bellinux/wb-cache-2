25|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> (Lynx pardinus) is a {{wild cat}} species {{native to the}} Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe that is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
25|$|It {{is one of}} {{the rarest}} and least known native canids in Europe, and is not {{recognised}} as a large carnivore by the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe (LCIE), despite being {{the same size as the}} <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx,</b> which is itself classed as such. Though mostly found in scattered populations within Eastern Europe, its range has grown to encompass parts of its former Eastern European range, as well as in Western Europe, which is thought to be attributable to a decline in grey wolf populations.|$|E
25|$|The European rabbit or common rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is {{a species}} of rabbit native to southwestern Europe (Spain, Portugal and Western France) and {{northwest}} Africa (Morocco and Algeria). It has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus, as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> and the Spanish imperial eagle. It is known as an invasive species {{because it has been}} introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. Australia has the most problems with European rabbits, {{due to the lack of}} natural predators there.|$|E
50|$|On 26 November 2014, 8 <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes</b> were {{released}} into Toledo, Spain, {{one of them}} traveled near Madrid, {{the first time in}} 40 years.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{important}} presence of deer (Cervidae) and wild boars (Sus scrofa); there are authorized hunts of both. There are also <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes</b> (Lynx pardinus) and wolves, as well as small carnivores such as foxes, el Egyptian mongooses (Herpestes ichneumon) and wildcats (Felis silvestris).|$|R

500|$|The name Leptailurus {{may have}} been {{constructed}} from the medieval Greek λεπταλέος or λεπτός meaning [...] "fine, delicate". The name [...] "serval" [...] could have been derived from the Medieval Latin words Lupus cervalis ("deer-like wolf") or from its Portuguese equivalent lobo-cerval (referring to the <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx).</b> The first recorded use of this name dates back to 1771. Another name for the serval is [...] "tierboskat", Afrikaans for tiger-forest-cat.|$|E
2500|$|In the Iberian peninsula, the Eurasian eagle-owl {{is part of}} {{a complex}} guild of predators that have evolved to survive mostly on European rabbits. Among this guild, golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were {{recorded}} per one study to rely on rabbits for 40% of the diet, the eagle-owl for 49% of the diet, the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) for 50% of the diet, the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) [...] for 61% of the diet and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> (Lynx pardinus) for 79% of the diet. Elsewhere, the Spanish imperial eagle and eagle-owl are considered to outflank the golden and even the Bonelli’s eagle as the most specialized avian predator of rabbits in the Iberian region. Other predators, such as common buzzard (Buteo buteo), [...] northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) black kite (Milvus migrans) Iberian wildcat (Felis silvestris tartessia), red fox, stone marten (Martes foina) and introduced Egyptian mongoose also prey heavily on rabbits in Spain, but are more generalized and less reliant than the above predators. All these powerful predators do not generally compete directly for food but conflicts may ensue over the rights to territories and nesting sites amongst the birds. Being nocturnal in activity, however, the Eurasian eagle-owl does not tend to compete as directly as do the three eagle species and even these are discreetly segregated by habitat preferences, the goldens preferring open, steep cliffs, the Bonelli's favoring densely vegetated areas mixed with rocky spots and the imperial favoring relatively flat open woodlands. Among these eagles, the golden eagle tends to have the most similar habitat preferences to the Eurasian eagle-owl and across a broad band of overlapping distribution, the two are considered nearly ecological equivalents by day and night. However, good-sized female golden eagles are up to twice as heavy as an average eagle-owl, so seem to have a considerable advantage in size and power. Conversely, to support their large size and large territory needs, the golden eagle cannot survive on small and diverse prey nearly as successfully as the eagle-owl. Among the Iberian peninsula rabbit-eating guild, the species with wider ranges, the eagle-owl and the golden and Bonelli's eagles, have had some degree of success living off of alternate prey following the devastation of the rabbit population due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease. The two rabbit predators endemic to Iberia, the <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> and Spanish imperial eagle, have been devastated by the reduction and other causes and both are threatened species today.|$|E

40|$|External and cranial {{measurements}} were determined for live-trapped lberian lnxes and lynx skulls from Doñana National Park, Spain, and its surroundings. Skins of <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes</b> {{from the same}} population collected between 1895 and 1986 were examined to de­ termine pelage-pattern characteristics. Adult (n” 2 years old) males were larger and heavier (273 %) than adult females. Age-classes were statistically different for most skull measure­ ments. Considerable variation was found between juveniles (05 - 1 year old) and subadults (1 - 2 years old). In 10 of the 19 skull measurements, adult males were significantl) larger than adult females, including length of ml, mandibular fossa—length of P 4, height of mandible, length of skull, and condylobasal length. <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes</b> were similar ifl size to the Nearctic bobcat (L. rufus) and the Canadian lynx (L canadensis).

40|$|Abstract Previous studies {{carried out}} in the Doñana National Park {{reported}} that red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were killed by <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes</b> (Lynx pardinus), whereas similar-sized Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) were not. Therefore, we predicted that fox would avoid lynx pre-dation risk by niche segregation whereas we did not expect such a segregation between badger and lynx. As an approach for evaluating our predictions, we com-pared their diet, activity patterns, and habitat use in an area of Doñana where the three carnivores are sympat-ric. Lynxes preyed almost uniquely on European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and though badgers and foxes were omnivorous, rabbits also were a major prey, re-sulting in high overlaps throughout the year. However, badgers preyed largely on small rabbits, whereas lynxe...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> {{is smaller}} than its {{northern}} relatives, and typically hunts smaller animals, usually no larger than hares. It also differs in habitat choice, with <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> inhabiting open scrubland and Eurasian lynx inhabiting forests.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, a Spanish {{government}} {{survey showed}} just two isolated breeding populations of <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> in southern Spain, totaling about 100 lynx (including only 25 breeding females). An agreement signed in 2003 by the Spanish Environment Ministry and the Andalusian Environment Council seeks to breed the <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> in captivity. Three <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> cubs were born {{as part of}} the Spanish program in 2005, at the Centro El Acebuche facility in Doñana National Park.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> is {{critically}} endangered, {{and is considered}} the world's most threatened feline species. Studies conducted in March 2005 estimated the number of surviving <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> to be as few as 100, which is down from about 400 in 2000 and down from 4,000 in 1960. If the <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynx</b> were to become extinct, {{it would be the}} first big cat species to do so since the Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago.|$|E
40|$|Infections with feline hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) {{have been}} {{documented}} in domestic cats and free-ranging feline species with high prevalences in <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes</b> (Lynx pardinus), Eurasian lynxes (Lynx lynx), European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris), African lions (Panthera leo) in Tanzania and domestic cats in South Africa. The prevalence of hemoplasmas {{has not yet been}} investigated in free-ranging felids in southern Africa. In this study we screened 73 blood samples from 61 cheetahs in central Namibia for the presence of hemoplasmas using quantitative real-time PCR. One of the cheetahs tested PCR-positive. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequencing of the 16 S rRNA and RNAse P genes revealed that the isolate belongs to the Mycoplasma haemofelis/haemocanis group. This is the first molecular evidence of a hemoplasma infection in a free-ranging cheetah...|$|R
5000|$|Rabbits are prey {{animals and}} are {{therefore}} constantly aware of their surroundings. For instance, in Mediterranean Europe, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes.</b> If confronted by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground. Rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, {{and a good deal}} of it is devoted to overhead scanning. They survive predation by burrowing, hopping away in a zig-zag motion, and, if captured, delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs. Their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite in order to escape a struggle. The longest-lived rabbit on record, a domesticated European rabbit living in Tasmania, died at age 18. The lifespan of wild rabbits is much shorter; the average longevity of an eastern cottontail, for instance, is less than one year.|$|R
40|$|Hematological and serum {{chemical}} {{values were}} determined for 16 wild <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes,</b> Lynx pardina (5 adult males, 4 adult females, 4 juvenile males, and 3 juvenile females) captured with box traps and coil-spring traps. The results include reference values, analysis {{of sex and}} age differences, and data {{on the influence of}} capture method on blood values. Males had higher red blood cell counts (p =  0. 03) and packed cell volumes (p =  0. 06) than females, which presented higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels (p =  0. 08) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations (p =  0. 07) than males. Juveniles had higher serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (p =  0. 01), urea (p =  0. 02), and cholesterol (p =  0. 02) and lower levels of creatinine (p  =  0. 07) than adults. Four hematological variables (mean platelet volume, platelet size distribution, white blood cell count, and mean corpuscular volume) and two serum variables (concentrations of amylase and calcium) were influenced by capture method. The use of standard procedures to assess base-line blood values in wild carnivores is encouraged. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{assisted}} reproductive {{techniques for}} endangered species {{is a major}} goal for conservation. One of these techniques, testis tissue xenografting, allows {{for the development of}} spermatozoa from animals that die before reaching sexual maturity. To assess the potential use of this technique with endangered species, testis tissue from six <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes</b> (one fetus, two perinatal cubs, two 6 -month-old and one 2 -year-old lynx), two Cuvier's gazelle fetuses and one 8 -month-old Mohor gazelle were transplanted ectopically into nude mice. Tissue from the lynx fetus, perinatal cubs and 2 -year-old donors degenerated, whereas spermatogonia were present in 15 % of seminiferous tubules more than 70 weeks after grafting in transplanted testis tissue from 6 -month-old donors. Seminal vesicle weights (indicative of testosterone production) increased over time in mice transplanted with tissue from 6 -month-old lynxes. Progression of spermatogenesis was observed in xenografts from gazelles and was donor age dependent. Tissue from Cuvier's gazelle fetuses contained spermatocytes 40 weeks after grafting. Finally, round spermatids were found 28 weeks after transplantation in grafts from the 8 -month-old Mohor gazelle. This {{is the first time that}} xenotransplantation of testicular tissue has been performed with an endangered felid and the first successful xenotransplantation in an endangered species.

40|$|Felids show {{different}} reproductive strategies {{related to}} the luteal phase. Domestic cats exhibit a seasonal polyoestrus and ovulation is followed by formation of corpora lutea (CL). Pregnant and non-pregnant cycles are reflected by diverging plasma progesterone (P 4) profiles. Eurasian and <b>Iberian</b> <b>lynxes</b> show a seasonal monooestrus, in which physiologically persistent CL (perCL) support constantly elevated plasma P 4 levels. Prostaglandins (PGs) represent key regulators of reproduction, and we aimed to characterise PG synthesis in feline CL to identify their contribution to the luteal lifespan. We assessed mRNA and protein expression of PG synthases (PTGS 2 /COX 2, PTGES, PGFS/AKR 1 C 3) and PG receptors (PTGER 2, PTGER 4, PTGFR), and intra-luteal levels of PGE 2 and PGF 2 α Therefore, CL of pregnant (pre-implantation, post-implantation, regression stages) and non-pregnant (formation, development/maintenance, early regression, late regression stages) domestic cats, and prooestrous Eurasian (perCL, pre-mating) and metoestrous Iberian (perCL, freshCL, post-mating) lynxes were investigated. Expression of PTGS 2 /COX 2, PTGES and PTGER 4 was independent of the luteal stage in the investigated species. High levels of luteotrophic PGE 2 in perCL might be associated with persistence of luteal function in lynxes. Signals for PGFS/AKR 1 C 3 expression were weak in mid and late luteal stages of cats but were absent in lynxes, concomitant with low PGF 2 α levels in these species. Thus, regulation of CL regression by luteal PGF 2 α seems negligible. In contrast, expression of PTGFR was evident in nearly all investigated CL of cat and lynxes, implying that luteal regression, e. g. {{at the end of}} pregnancy, is triggered by extra-luteal PGF 2 α...|$|R
