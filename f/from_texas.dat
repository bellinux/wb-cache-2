The cold front, {{combined with the}} remnants of the storm, dropped moderate to heavy rainfall <b>from</b> <b>Texas</b> through the Mid-Atlantic.

The southernmost portion of highway, connecting it to Texas, became solely SH-6 in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Two {{species of}} African spider are {{named after the}} film and main character: Anelosimus biglebowski and Anelosimus dude, both {{described}} in 2006.

5|$|After the Civil War {{and until}} his {{transfer}} back East in 1887, he served {{primarily on the}} western frontier. He engaged many Native American tribes, dealt with many types of renegades and explored vast areas of uncharted territory <b>from</b> <b>Texas</b> to Arizona. During the Spanish–American War, he commanded an occupation force {{and became the first}} military governor of Puerto Principe, Cuba. After 38 continuous years of service to his country, he retired from the Army on October 19, 1899, as a brigadier general. After his retirement, he became a speaker and a writer.|$|E
5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme <b>from</b> <b>Texas</b> history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair {{as well as his}} collection of walking sticks. She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E

5|$|Bryan {{had hoped}} to sweep the rural vote and make inroads on urban labor, {{but he was not}} successful. McKinley became the first Republican {{candidate}} to win in New York City, and won in its rival city of Brooklyn as well. He lost only one city with a population of over 45,000 in the Midwest, and won many rural counties in crucial states. Although Bryan won all states south of Kentucky and <b>from</b> <b>Texas</b> east, McKinley won most urban centers there.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1835, Texians had {{expelled}} all Mexican troops <b>from</b> <b>Texas.</b> Believing the war ended, many Texians {{resigned from}} the army and returned home. In January, the provisional government essentially collapsed; {{despite a lack of}} authority for any branch of government to interfere with other branches, the legislature impeached Governor Henry Smith, who in turn disbanded the legislature. No one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{attempted}} assassination of Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, Vice President George H. W. Bush did not assume the presidential powers and duties as Acting President. Reagan {{was unable to}} invoke Section 3, {{because he was in}} surgery. Bush did not invoke Section 4, because he was on a plane returning <b>from</b> <b>Texas.</b> Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush arrived in Washington. In 1995, Birch Bayh, the primary sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked.|$|E

5|$|From 1971 Texas Instruments {{had been}} making {{available}} the building block for a simple calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared {{in a number of}} Sinclair calculators. Clive Sinclair wanted to design a calculator to compete with the HP-35 using this series of chips. Despite scepticism about the feasibility of the project <b>from</b> <b>Texas</b> Instruments engineers, Nigel Searle was able to design algorithms that sacrificed some speed and accuracy in order to implement scientific functions on the TMS0805 variation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids <b>from</b> <b>Texas</b> were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E
5|$|In March 1892, the cattlemen sent {{agents to}} Texas from Cheyenne and Idaho to recruit gunmen and finally {{carry out their}} plans for exterminating the homesteaders. The cattle barons have always used hired guns <b>from</b> <b>Texas</b> to take out {{suspected}} rustlers and scare away the nesters in Wyoming. One particular act of violence perpetrated by the Texans was recounted by cowboy John J. Baker, where the Texans ambushed and killed nine trappers whom they mistook for rustlers in Big Dry Creek, Wyoming. They received a $450 bonus for the slaughter.|$|E
