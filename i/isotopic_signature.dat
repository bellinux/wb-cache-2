5|$|Boron has two {{naturally}} occurring and stable isotopes, 11B (80.1%) and 10B (19.9%). The mass difference {{results in a}} wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay. It has a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and −. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the − ion onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in 11B(OH)3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an <b>isotopic</b> <b>signature.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{team at the}} Carnegie Institute of Washington {{reported}} the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks. To their surprise, the team found that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an <b>isotopic</b> <b>signature</b> that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology announced that there {{was less than a}} 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures. Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth, which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth's orbit or from Theia. Variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data.|$|E

30|$|In the guinea pig, the {{turnover}} times for carbon and nitrogen {{in the liver}} are several months because of the regular mitosis of hepatocytes, whereas {{the turnover}} of carbon and nitrogen is much slower in the cerebellum than in the liver. The <b>isotopic</b> <b>signatures</b> of cerebellar DNA acquired in utero are retained {{for at least the}} first 6 months of life (Strable et al. 2011). It has also been demonstrated that the neuronal DNA in the human cerebellum turns over little after maturity (Slatkin et al. 1985). This slowness or absence of protein turnover in the brain could explain why its <b>isotopic</b> <b>signatures</b> differ from those of other organs with normal cellular turnover. If tissues are not metabolized, their <b>isotopic</b> <b>signatures</b> should be fixed at the point of production or equilibrated with the chemical substances around them. It is still too early to draw a clear picture, but the compartmentalization effect complicates the <b>isotopic</b> <b>signatures</b> of higher animals.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} sites in Ireland during this period is Ross Island. A series of copper mines from here are the earliest known in Ireland, starting from around 2500 BC (O'Brien 2004). A comparison of chemical traces and lead isotope analysis from these mines with copper artifacts strongly suggests that Ross Island was the sole source of copper in Ireland between the dates 2500–2200 BC. In addition, two thirds of copper artifacts from Britain also display the same chemical and <b>isotopic</b> <b>signature,</b> strongly suggesting that Irish copper was a major export to Britain (Northover et al. 2001). Traces of Ross Island copper can be found even further afield; in the Netherlands it makes up 12% of analysed copper artifacts, and Brittany 6% of analysed copper artifacts After 2200 BC there is greater chemical variation in British and Irish copper artifacts, which tallies well with the appearance of other mines in southern Ireland and north Wales. After 2000 BC, other copper sources supersede Ross Island. The latest workings from the Ross Island mines is dated to around 1700 BC.|$|E

Third, the Earth and Moon have the same oxygen <b>isotopic</b> <b>signature</b> (relative abundance of the oxygen isotopes).

30|$|In aquatic environments, it is {{technically}} difficult to rigorously separate autotrophs (i.e., algae and cyanobacteria) from heterotrophs and detritus. Consequently, the carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of {{particulate organic matter}} (POM) have long been substituted for those of photoautotrophs in surface water. However, these records must {{be more or less}} overprinted by the <b>isotopic</b> <b>signatures</b> of the detritus from other organisms.

2500|$|Dating a {{specific}} sample of fossilized carbonaceous material is more complicated. Such deposits often contain trace amounts of carbon-14. These amounts can vary significantly between samples, ranging up to 1% of the ratio found in living organisms, a concentration comparable to an apparent age of 40,000. This may indicate possible contamination by {{small amounts of}} bacteria, underground sources of radiation causing the 14N(n,p) 14C reaction, direct uranium decay (although reported measured ratios of 14C/U in uranium-bearing ores would imply roughly 1 uranium atom for every two carbon atoms in order to cause the 14C/12C ratio, measured {{to be on the}} order of 10−15), or other unknown secondary sources of carbon-14 production.

We address this question in landscapes that include contrasting forest habitat patches with either deciduous Downy Oak Quercus humilis or evergreen Holm Oak Quercus ilex as dominant tree species. First, we examine the spatial variation across habitats and sites in the stable isotope ratios of carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) along the oak leaf-Tortrix moth Tortrix viridana caterpillar-Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus food chain.

Five known sesquiterpene cyclases, regulating three different pathways, representing simple to complex biosynthetic sequences, were heterologously expressed and used for in vitro assays with farnesyl diphosphate as substrate. Compound specific isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements of the enzyme substrate farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and the products of all the five cyclases were performed.
