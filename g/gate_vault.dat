5000|$|The Saint-Jean-Baptist Church {{is located}} near the vault Saint-Anthony, these two {{buildings}} being integrated in the [...] "Ways of the Baroque". It is impossible to determine the date of its construction, but {{it is certain that}} it existed already in 1376; it underwent many changes over the centuries. Like all the churches High-Maurienne, it possessed a closed hall. The vault of this hall is decorated in plaster existing already in 1827 and representing the miracle with the Holy Host in Turin. At the interior of the church, eight arched windows introduce enough light to make it possible to contemplate the vault with medallions. The sight is first of all attracted by the high altar, whose marble is of a beautiful Carrara marble white, decorated of a Jean-Baptist Saint on the front, of fine facets and drawings. The steps are with notched edges and, on the <b>gate</b> <b>vault,</b> a slim dome is profiled on four elegant posts. This furnace bridge was carried out in 1858. Four other small furnace bridges are on both sides nave of the church. They are dedicated to Saint Antoine, Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel, Notre-Dame du Rosaire, and Saint Joseph. Inside the church are murals and religious statues carved by local artists. The bell-tower is of an ancient date. Its structure is the same one as that of the towers known as [...] "Sarrasines" [...] that one still finds throughout the valley. It is decorated of four bells ...|$|E

The site includes the ruins of a medieval church with a small <b>gated</b> <b>vault</b> (locked) — where sculptural fragments are stored — and a gateway constructed with stones from the church. The church was remodelled in 1447 with a new roof added. The site seems to have been abandoned after a murder on the altar effectively deconsecrated the church.|$|R

40|$|Crime {{prevention}} {{is on the}} minds of most people today. The concern for public safety and the theft of valuable assets are being discussed at all levels of government and throughout the public sector. There is a growing demand for security systems that can adequately safeguard people and valuable assets against the sophistication of those criminals or adversaries who pose a threat. The crime in this country has been estimated at $ 70 billion in direct costs and up to $ 300 billion in indirect costs. Health insurance fraud alone is estimated to cost American businesses $ 100 billion. Theft, warranty fraud, and counterfeiting of computer hardware totaled $ 3 billion in 1994. A threat analysis is a prerequisite to any security system design to assess the vulnerabilities with respect to the anticipated threat. Having established a comprehensive definition of the threat, crime prevention, detection, and threat assessment technologies can be used to address these criminal activities. This talk will outline the process used to design a security system regardless of the level of security. This methodology has been applied to many applications including: government high security facilities; residential and commercial intrusion detection and assessment; anti-counterfeiting/fraud detection technologies (counterfeit currency, cellular phone billing, credit card fraud, health care fraud, passport, green cards, and questionable documents); industrial espionage detection and prevention (intellectual property, computer chips, etc.); and security barrier technology (creation of delay such as <b>gates,</b> <b>vaults,</b> etc.) ...|$|R

6000|$|Descending, {{advancing}} {{through your}} Lime-tree Avenue, you come upon {{the backs of}} office-houses, out-houses, stables or the like,--on your left hand I have guessed,--extending along the Highway. And {{in the middle of}} these you come at last to a kind of <b>Gate</b> or <b>vaulted</b> passage (ART VON THOR, says Zollner), where, if you have liberty, you face to the left, and enter. Here, once through into the free light again, you are in a Court: four-square space, not without prospect; right side and left side are lodgings for his Majesty's gentlemen; behind you, well in their view, are stables and kitchens: in the centre of the place is a Fountain [...] "with hewn steps and iron railings;" [...] where his simple Majesty has been known to sit and smoke, on summer evenings. The fourth side of your square, again, is a palisade; beyond which, over bridge and moat and intervening apparatus, you perceive, on its trim terraces, the respectable old Schloss itself. A rectangular mass, not of vast proportions, with tower in the centre of it (tower for screw-stair, the general roadway of the House); and looking though weather-beaten yet weather-tight, and as dignified as it can. This is Wusterhausen; Friedrich Wilhelm's Hunting-seat from of old.|$|R
5|$|The eastern gate, {{constructed}} between 1213 and 1215, is {{the only}} one that opens toward the area enclosed by the city walls of Damascus. It is located in one of the citadel's square towers and protected by another tower immediately south of the gate tower and a barbacan running between these towers. It is a bent-axis <b>gate</b> running through <b>vaulted</b> passages before reaching the courtyard. Behind it is a square hall in which four columns support a central unusually shaped dome. It incorporates a gate tower from the old Seljuq citadel. The gate lacks defensive structures like murder-holes and is more decorated than the northern gate, which must be related to the fact that the gate faces the city. The gate is decorated with a superb muqarnas canopy that is now hidden because the outer door is blocked.|$|R
60|$|The two unhurt men pursued me. They {{were both}} good runners--the road {{was smooth and}} level, {{and for the first}} five minutes or more I was {{conscious}} that I did not gain on them. It was perilous work to run for long in the darkness. I could barely see the dim black line of the hedges on either side, and any chance obstacle in the road would have thrown me down to a certainty. Ere long I felt the ground changing--it descended from the level at a turn, and then rose again beyond. Downhill the men rather gained on me, but uphill I began to distance them. The rapid, regular thump of their feet grew fainter on my ear, and I calculated by the sound that I was far enough in advance to take to the fields with a good chance of their passing me in the darkness. Diverging to the footpath, I made for the first break that I could guess at, rather than see, in the hedge. It proved to be a closed <b>gate.</b> I <b>vaulted</b> over, and finding myself in a field, kept across it steadily with my back to the road. I heard the men pass the gate, still running, then in a minute more heard one of them call to the other to come back. It was no matter what they did now, I was out of their sight and out of their hearing. I kept straight across the field, and when I had reached the farther extremity of it, waited there for a minute to recover my breath.|$|R
50|$|The monastery makes {{sporadic}} {{appearance in}} the Statutes of the Cistercian General Chapter {{and it was one}} of the houses granted special exemption from the compulsory annual attendance at the General Chapter, and along with the houses in Syria and the Crusader States it was only required to attend once every seven years. The monastery was abandoned in 1276. The main surviving structures are the imposing <b>vaulted</b> <b>gate</b> house and the church, especially its western end as well as parts of the defensive wall around the monastery. Excavation to the NE of the east end of the church (possibly a narthex was originally planned but never completed) revealed an arched entrance probably to the refectory which had fallen in an earthquake. The PIMS excavations demonstrated that the abbey was resettled in the late 14th century and inhabited perhaps intermittently until the mid 16th century. A number of graves from this later reoccupation were excavated in and around the cloister, including a headless man and one with a German banker's token of the mid 16th century.|$|R
50|$|Yuling, {{the tomb}} of the Qianlong Emperor (the fourth emperor of the Qing dynasty), {{is one of the most}} splendid one of all royal tombs in Chinese history. Yuling has the finest tomb chamber, a series of nine vaults {{separated}} by four solid marble doors located at a depth of 54 m. Beginning with the first marble <b>gate,</b> all walls, <b>vaulted</b> ceilings, and <b>gates</b> are covered with Buddhist imagery such as the four heavenly kings, the eight bodhisattvas, the 24 buddhas, lions, the Eight Treasures, as well as ritual instruments and more than 30,000 words of Tibetan scripture and Sanskrit. The 3-ton doors themselves have reliefs of bodhisattvas (beings on the road to enlightenment) and the four protective kings usually found at temple entrances. The Qianlong Emperor (died 1799) selected the site of his mausoleum in 1742 and construction began in the following year. Construction was completed in 1752, but the mausoleum was expanded further in the years between 1755 and 1762. During this time, the square city, memorial tower, the precious citadel, as well as the two side halls were newly built.|$|R

50|$|Particularly {{interesting}} are {{the remains}} of an aqueduct starting several kilometres away at the Baspinar spring in Denizli, and possibly having another more distant source. Unusually, to cross the valley {{to the south of}} Laodicea, instead of the usual open channel carried above the level of the city on lofty arches as was the usual practice of the Romans, an inverted siphon was employed consisting of a double pressurised pipeline, descending into the valley and back up to the city. The low arches supporting the siphon commence near the summit of a low hill to the south where the header tank was located, and thence continue to the first terminal distribution tank (castellum aquae) {{at the edge of the}} hill of the city, whose remains are visible to the east of the stadium and South Baths complex. The water was heavily charged with calcareous matter, as several of the arches are covered with a thick incrustation where leaks occurred at later times. The siphon consisted of large carved stone pipes; some of these also are much incrusted, and some completely choked up. The terminal tank has many clay pipes of various diameters for water distribution on the north, east and south sides which, because of the choking by sinter, were replaced in time. To the west of the terminal is a small fountain next to the <b>vaulted</b> <b>gate.</b> The aqueduct appears to have been destroyed by an earthquake, as the remaining arches lean bodily on one side, without being much broken. A second distribution terminal and sedimentation tank is visible 400 m north of the first, to which it was connected via another siphon of travertine blocks, and this one is bigger and supplied most of the city.|$|R

Combining a variety of approaches with insightful perspectives of professionals working {{on a wide range of}} film technology-related issues, Exposing the Film Apparatus reveals the richness, diversity, and relevance of the topic for archivists, curators, projectionists, theorists, film and media historians, media artists, educationists and film students today. «If dreams come true! The long desired collaboration between film archivists and film scholars has never been as fully realized as in this work, which is, itself, a genuine "research laboratory. " Adopting an approach that constantly combines fundamental and applied research, the "materiality of the medium" is studied here in an entirely novel way. Starting with the digital turn, the essential problems of technique and technology have (finally!) returned to academic zeitgeist. » André Gaudreault, Canada Research Chair in Cinema and Media Studies, Université de Montréal. «This excellent collection fizzes with new approaches to understanding the apparatuses of cinema.

60|$|XV. No limit: {{it is one}} of the affectations {{of architects}} to speak of {{overcharged}} ornament. Ornament cannot be overcharged if it be good, and is always overcharged when it is bad. I have given, on the opposite page (fig. 1), one of the smallest niches of the central gate of Rouen. That gate I suppose to be the most exquisite piece of pure flamboyant work existing; for though I have spoken of the upper portions, especially the receding window, as degenerate, the gate itself is of a purer period, and has hardly any renaissance taint. There are four strings of these niches (each with two figures beneath it) round the porch, from the ground to the top of the arch, with three intermediate rows of larger niches, far more elaborate; besides the six principal canopies of each outer pier. The total number of the subordinate niches alone, each worked like that in the plate, and each with a different pattern of traceries in each compartment, is one hundred and seventy-six.[4] Yet in all this ornament there is not one cusp, one finial that is useless--not a stroke of the chisel is in vain; the grace and luxuriance of it all are visible--sensible rather--even to the uninquiring eye; and all its minuteness does not diminish the majesty, while it increases the mystery, of the noble and unbroken vault. It is not less the boast of some styles that they can bear ornament, than of others that they can do without it; but we do not often enough reflect that those very styles, of so haughty simplicity, owe part of their pleasurableness to contrast, and would be wearisome if universal. They are but the rests and monotones of the art; it is to its far happier, far higher, exaltation that we owe those fair fronts of variegated mosaic, charged with wild fancies and dark hosts of imagery, thicker and quainter than ever filled the depth of midsummer dream; those <b>vaulted</b> <b>gates,</b> trellised with close leaves; those window-labyrinths of twisted tracery and starry light; those misty masses of multitudinous pinnacle and diademed tower; the only witnesses, perhaps that remain to us of the faith and fear of nations. All else for which the builders sacrificed, has passed away--all their living interests, and aims, and achievements. We know not for what they labored, and we see no evidence of their reward. Victory, wealth, authority, happiness--all have departed, though bought by many a bitter sacrifice. But of them, and their life, and their toil upon the earth, one reward, one evidence, is left to us in those gray heaps of deep-wrought stone. They have taken with them to the grave their powers, their honors, and their errors; but they have left us their adoration.|$|R
5000|$|In {{that soft}} season, when {{descending}} showers Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flowers, When opening buds salute the welcome day, And earth relenting feels the genial ray; As balmy sleep had charm’d my cares to rest,And love itself was banish’d from my breast, (What time the morn mysterious visions brings, While purer slumbers spread their golden wings) A train of phantoms in wild order rose, And join’d, this intellectual scene compose. [...] I stood, methought, betwixt earth, seas, and skies, The whole Creation open to my eyes; In air self-balanced hung the globe below, Where mountains rise and circling oceans flow; Here naked rocks and empty wastes were seen,There towery cities, and the forests green; Here sailing ships delight the wand’ring eyes, There trees and intermingled temples rise: Now a clear sun the shining scene displays, The transient landscape now in clouds decays. [...] O’er the wide prospect as I gazed around, Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound, Like broken thunders that at distance roar, Or billows murm’ring on the hollow shore: Then gazing up, a glorious Pile beheld, Whose tow’ring summit ambient clouds conceal’d; High {{on a rock}} of ice the structure lay, Steep its ascent, and slipp’ry was the way; The wondrous rock like Parian marble shone, And seem’d, to distant sight, of solid stone. Inscriptions here of various names I view’d, The greater part by hostile time subdued; Yet wide was spread their fame in ages past, And poets once had promis’d they should last. Some fresh engraved appear’d of wits renown’d; I look’d again, nor could their trace be found. Critics I saw, that other names deface, And fix their own with labour, in their place: Their own, like others, soon their place resign’d, Or disappear’d and left the first behind. Nor was the work impair’d by storms alone, But felt th’ approaches of too warm a sun; For Fame, impatient of extremes, decays Not more by envy than excess of praise. Yet part no injuries of Heav’n could feel, Like crystal faithful to the graving steel: The rock’s high summit, in the temple’s shade, Nor heat could melt, nor beating storm invade. Their names inscribed unnumber’d ages past From Time’s first birth, with Time itself shall last: These ever new, nor subject to decays, Spread, and grow brighter with the length of days. [...] So Zembla’s rocks (the beauteous work of frost) Rise white in air, and glitter o’er the coast; Pale suns, unfelt, at distance roll away, And on th’ impassive ice the lightnings play; Eternal snows the growing mass supply, Till the bright mountains prop th’ incumbent sky: As Atlas fix’d, each hoary pile appears, The gather’d winter of a thousand years. [...] On this foundation Fame’s high temple stands; Stupendous pile! not rear’d by mortal hands. Whate’er proud Rome or artful Greece beheld, Or elder Babylon, its frame excell’d. Four faces had the dome, and ev’ry face Of various structure, but of equal grace: Four brazen gates, on columns lifted high, Salute the diff’rent quarters of the sky. Here fabled Chiefs in darker ages born, Or Worthies old whom Arms or Arts adorn, Who cities raised or tamed a monstrous race, The walls in venerable order grace: Heroes in animated marble frown, And Legislators seem to think in stone. [...] Westward, a sumptuous frontispiece appear’d, On Doric pillars of white marble rear’d, Crown’d with an architrave of antique mould, And sculpture rising on the roughen’d gold. In shaggy spoils here Theseus was beheld, And Perseus dreadful with Minerva’s shield: There great Alcides, stooping with his toil, Rests on his club, and holds th’ Hesperian spoil: Here Orpheus sings; trees moving to the sound Start from their roots, and form a shade around: Amphion there the loud creating lyre Strikes, and beholds a sudden Thebes aspire; Cithæron’s echoes answer to his call, And half the mountain rolls into a wall: There might you see the length’ning spires ascend, The domes swell up, and widening arches bend, The growing towers, like exhalations, rise, And the huge columns heave into the skies. [...] The eastern front was glorious to behold, With diamond flaming, and barbaric gold. There Ninus shone, who spread th’ Assyrian fame, And the great founder of the Persian name; There in long robes the royal Magi stand, Grave Zoroaster waves the circling wand; The sage Chaldeans robed in white appear’d, And Brahmans, deep in desert woods revered. These stopp’d the moon, and call’ th’ unbodied shades To midnight banquets in the glimm’ring glades; Made visionary fabrics round them rise, And airy spectres skim before their eyes; Of talismans and sigils knew the power, And careful watch’d the planetary hour. Superior, and alone, Confucius stood, Who taught that useful science,—to be good. [...] But on the south, a long majestic race Of Egypt’s priests the gilded niches grace, Who measured earth, described the starry spheres, And traced the long records of Lunar Years. High on his car Sesostris struck my view, Whom sceptred slaves in golden harness drew: His hands a bow and pointed jav’lin hold; His giant limbs are arm’d in scales of gold. Between the statues obelisks were placed, And the learn’d walls with hieroglyphics graced. [...] Of Gothic structure was the northern side, O’erwrought with ornaments of barb’rous pride. There huge Colosses rose, with trophies crown’d, And Runic characters were graved around; There sat Zamolxis with erected eyes, And Odin here in mimic trances dies. There on rude iron columns, smear’d with blood, The horrid forms of Scythian Heroes stood, Druids and Bards (their once loud harps unstrung) And youths that died to be by poets sung. These and a thousand more of doubtful fame, To whom old fables gave a lasting name, In ranks adorn’d the temple’s outward face; The wall in lustre and effect like glass, Which o’er each object casting various dyes, Enlarges some, and others multiplies; Nor void of emblem was the mystic wall, For thus romantic Fame increases all. [...] The temple shakes, the sounding <b>gates</b> unfold, Wide <b>vaults</b> appear, and roofs of fretted gold, Rais’d on a thousand pillars, wreath’d around With laurel foliage, and with eagles crown’d. Of bright transparent beryl were the walls, The friezes gold, and gold the capitals; As Heav’n with stars, the roof with jewels glows, And ever-living lamps depend in rows. Full in the passage of each spacious gate The sage Historians in white garments wait; Graved o’er their seats the Form of Time was found, His scythe revers’d, and both his pinions bound. Within stood Heroes, who thro’ loud alarms In bloody fields pursued renown in arms. High on a throne, with trophies charged, I view’d The youth that all things but himself subdued; His feet on sceptres and tiaras trod, And his horn’d head belied the Libyan God, There Cæsar, graced with both Minervas, shone; Cæsar, the world’s great master, and his own; Unmov’d, superior still in ev’ry state, And scarce detested in his country’s fate. But chief were those who not for empire fought, But with their toils their people’s safety bought: High o’er the rest Epaminondas stood; Timoleon, glorious in his brother’s blood; Bold Scipio, saviour of the Roman state, Great in his triumphs, in retirement great; And wise Aurelius, in whose well-taught mind With boundless power unbounded virtue join’d, His own strict judge, and patron of mankind. [...] Much-suff’ring heroes next their honours claim. Those of less noisy, and less guilty fame, Fair Virtue’s silent train: supreme of these Here ever shines the godlike Socrates: He whom ungrateful Athens could expel, At all times just, but when he sign’d the shell: Here his abode the martyr’d Phocion claims, With Agis, not the last of Spartan names: Unconquer’d Cato shows the wound he tore, And Brutus his ill genius meets no more. [...] But in {{the centre of the}} hallow’d choir Six pompous columns o’er the rest aspire: Around the shrine itself of Fame they stand, Hold the chief honours and the fane command. High on the first the mighty Homer shone; Eternal adamant composed his throne; Father of verse! in holy fillets drest, His silver beard waved gently o’er his breast; Tho’ blind, a boldness in his looks appears; In years he seem’d, but not impair’d by years. The wars of Troy were round the pillar seen; Here fierce Tydides wounds the Cyprian Queen; Here Hector, glorious from Patroclus’ fall, Here, dragg’d in triumph round the Trojan wall. Motion and life did ev’ry part inspire, Bold was the work, and prov’d the master’s fire: A strong expression most he seem’d t’ affect, And here and there disclosed a brave neglect. [...] A golden column next in rank appear’d, On which a shrine of purest gold was rear’d; Finish’d the whole, and labour’d ev’ry part, With patient touches of unwearied art. The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate, Composed his posture, and his look sedate; On Homer still he fix’d a rev’rend eye, Great without pride, in modest majesty. In living sculpture on the sides were spread The Latian wars, and haughty Turnus dead; Eliza stretch’d upon the funeral pyre; Æneas bending with his aged sire: Troy flamed in burning gold, and o’er the throne ‘Arms and the man’ in golden ciphers shone. [...] Four swans sustain a car of silver bright, With heads advanced, and pinions stretch’d for flight: Here, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode, And seem’d to labour with th’ inspiring God. Across the harp a careless hand he flings, And boldly sinks into the sounding strings. The figured games of Greece the column grace: Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race; The youths hang o’er the chariots as they run; The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone; The champions in distorted postures threat; And all appear’d irregularly great. [...] Here happy Horace tuned th’ Ausonian lyre To sweeter sounds, and temper’d Pindar’s fire: Pleas’d with Alcæus’ manly rage t’ infuse The softer spirit of the Sapphic Muse. The polish’d pillar diff’rent sculptures grace; A work outlasting|$|R
