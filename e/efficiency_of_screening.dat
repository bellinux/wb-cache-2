40|$|Predicting gestational {{diabetes}} by clinical scoring {{is meant}} to improve the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the usefulness of clinical scoring in a Malaysian population. Using a retrospective cohort of 1997 women, a predictive model was developed and validated on a separate set of 1, 000 patients. The <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> with risk scores was then compared with universal screening. The model derived was well calibrated (p = 0. 80) with an AUC 0. 74 (95 CI 0. 71 to 0. 76). Different combinations of thresholds for the risk score produced a screening reduction between 26 and 29 (Sensitivity- 86 compared to 97 from universal screening) in Strategy 1. Strategy 2 had no screening reduction but had a higher sensitivity of 95. The performance of the risk score was moderate and the screening reduction minimal. Therefore the usefulness of clinical scoring in our population is of limited value...|$|E

Optimal contractual arrangements are showm to consist of a sequence of two contracts with nondecreasing prices and nonincreasing quality and volume of exchange. In the absence of switching costs, an increase in the frequency of trade is absorbed by the first contract. For high frequencies of trade, switching costs may enhance welfare by improving the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> through a better allocation of time between contracts. ...|$|E

40|$|Size {{of organisms}} is {{frequently}} the prime criterion in selecting {{a mesh size}} to sample benthic assemblages. This study quantified the accuracy in estimating the sampling <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>screens</b> from body size of macrozoobenthos in the upper, sandy, reaches of a small, shallow estuary, where the community consisted primarily of peracarid crustaceans and polychaetes. Body size of organisms retained by a 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mm screen was used to predict the retention <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> each gear by multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), or by simply assuming that an animal of known size will be retained by a <b>screen</b> <b>of</b> the same aperture size ('body aperture match').

Regardless of the method employed, hotly size {{was found to be}} an extremely poor predictor of mesh retention. Consequently, sampling performance of each mesh size in a particular habitat x community combination should be determined experimentally and not from body size measurements obtained during pilot studies...|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{existing}} video coding standards in use today were developed primarily using camera-captured content as test material. Today, with the more widespread use of connected devices, there is an increased interest in developing video coding tools that target screen content video.

Adjustment of planting date to synchronize flowering with the period of peak abundance of adults, planting infested rows of susceptible cultivars 20 days before the test cultivars, spreading damaged sorghum panicles containing diapausing larvae in infested rows and using sprinkler irrigation during flowering in the post-rainy season, helped to increase abundance. Careful and selective use of contact insecticides to control the mirid Calocoris angustatus and the eulophid Tetrastichus diplosidis [Aprostocetus diplosidis] were useful in screening and selecting sorghum cultivars for resistance. Planting 2 sets of test material at 14 day intervals reduced the chances that the sorghum would escape damage.

In an effort to re-address the (in) <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> the programme, the French National Cancer Institute has drafted an expert-group review of the ethical issues surrounding breast cancer mammography screening. Discussion: Prompted by emerging debate over the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>screening</b> scheme and its allied public information provision, we keynote the experts' report based on analysis of epidemiological data and participation rate from the public health authorities. The low coverage of the OS scheme may be partly {{explained by the fact}} that a significant number of women undergo mammography outside OS and thus outside OS criteria. These findings call for further thinking on (i) the ethical principles of beneficence and non-malfeasance underpinning this public health initiative, (ii) the reasons behind women's and professionals' behavior, and (iii) the need to analyze how information provision to women and the doctor-patient relationship need to evolve in response to scientific controversy over the risks and benefits <b>of</b> conducting mammographic <b>screening.</b> Summary: This work calls for a reappraisal of the provision <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> programme information.
