5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car to propel two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified to add a <b>driving</b> <b>cab,</b> entering service from 1 June.|$|E
25|$|Handedness {{of traffic}} can affect {{locomotive}} design. For the driver, visibility is good {{from both sides}} of the <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> so the choice on which side to site the driver less important. For example, the French SNCF Class BB 7200 is designed for using the left-hand track and therefore uses LHD. When the design was modified for use in the Netherlands as NS Class 1600, the <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> was not completely redesigned, keeping the driver on the left despite the fact that trains use the right-hand track in the Netherlands. Generally, the left/right principle in a country is followed mostly on double track. On single track, when trains meet, the train that shall not stop often uses the straight path in the turnout, which can be left or right.|$|E

25|$|DTSO(B) {{originally}} {{featured a}} lockable sliding door between the <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> {{and the first}} set of power doors and tip-up longitudinal seating to enable parcels to be carried securely. This facility was rarely used and the sliding door has since been removed – but the tip-up seat area has been retained for carrying bicycles and wheelchairs.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 {{an order}} was placed for 35 six-car trains {{to replace the}} CP and CO stock on the Hammersmith & City and Circle lines. These were {{arranged}} as two units with a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> in the motor car at one end only, and were normally run as three pairs. These trains were designated C69 stock.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 2008, an East Midlands {{train was}} {{involved}} in an incident at Barrow upon Soar. The train hit a footbridge in its path, after a road vehicle had struck and damaged the bridge causing it to be foul of the line. Six passengers were on board the service and the driver had to be cut free from the <b>driving</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|E

25|$|The line used Metropolitan line A60 and A62 sub-surface {{rolling stock}} built by Cravens of Sheffield in two batches between 1960 and 1962. It was {{upgraded}} in 1994 with improved suspension, lighting, heating and ventilation. The rolling stock was regularly interchanged with that {{used on the}} main Metropolitan line and usually carried both East London and Metropolitan line maps, but ELL trains were four-car units with a <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> at each end, unlike Metropolitan line trains, which, aside from the Chesham shuttle, ran as eight-car trains. Metropolitan line trains were mostly two single-ended units coupled together with fully operational driving cabs at each end: the Met could use any ELL trains, but the ELL could use only double-ended units.|$|E
500|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was also}} provided {{on both the}} locomotive and the footplate, supplied by a steam-powered generator fitted below the footplate. [...] The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. [...] This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum gauge, whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. [...] Close attention was also paid to the ergonomics of the <b>driving</b> <b>cab,</b> which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both fireman and driver, thus promoting safe operation. [...] As an aid to the fireman, a steam-operated treadle was provided that used steam pressure to open the firehole doors (where the coal is shovelled into the firebox). [...] The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter.|$|E
500|$|On 19 November, SNCF {{announced}} the initial findings of their investigation. The train's event recorder {{indicated that the}} train entered the curve at [...] and was travelling at [...] at the moment it derailed, which investigators have determined to {{be a result of}} centrifugal forces. The speed at the moment of derailment was [...] above the train's assigned operating speed on the curve. According to the SNCF, the [...] "immediate cause" [...] of the accident was [...] "a late braking sequence"; the braking should have begun at least [...] or 12 seconds earlier. The investigation has found no fault for the accident in the infrastructure, train, or member of the technical team. There were seven people in the <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> {{at the time of the}} accident, all of whom survived. Investigators have suggested that this may have been a factor in the late braking. SNCF will begin disciplinary proceedings and take punitive measures against employees responsible for, among other things, the [...] "reckless presence" [...] of children on the test train, presence of seven people in the cab, the lack of rigor in creating lists of those onboard and controlling access to the train, and [...] "without doubt" [...] the human errors in the cab.|$|E

2500|$|In North American railroading, a cow-calf set {{is a pair}} of switcher-type locomotives: one (the cow) {{equipped}} with a <b>driving</b> <b>cab,</b> the other (the calf) without a cab, and controlled from the cow through cables.

50|$|Initially {{stations}} and <b>driving</b> <b>cabs</b> were equipped with UHF/FM radios operating on 8 simplex channels between 418.6 and 418.775 MHz, which were replaced with TETRA radios in 2004.|$|R

2500|$|By October 2011, former Hutt Valley sets DM 27 [...] "Robin", DM 216 [...] "Phoenix" [...] and the now {{shortened}} DM 556 were {{pressed into}} service {{due to a lack}} of available Johnsonville DM/D sets. Following the failure of DM 216 in December, DM 556 was {{pressed into service}} with one trailer removed and coupled to the uphill end of DM 27 due to the loss of the second <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> in DM 556. Three further sets comprising DM 182, DM 441 and DM 510 were later repaired to maintain service with buses supplementing trains at peak times.|$|E
2500|$|The {{class was}} {{designed}} to meet Channel Tunnel safety regulations, and consists of two independent half-sets, {{each with its own}} power car. Most of the trailers rest on Jacobs bogies shared between adjacent carriages, supporting both of them, with the cars next to the power cars and the two central cars (coaches 9 and 10 in a full-length set) not articulated. [...] Non-shared bogies are coupled with Scharfenberg couplers, providing three points for separation {{in the event of an}} emergency in the Channel Tunnel. The electrical supply cables between a power car and the first carriage are designed to break apart during an emergency separation. In the event of a serious fire in the Tunnel the passengers would be transferred into the undamaged half of the train, which would then be uncoupled from the damaged half and driven out of the tunnel. If the undamaged part is the rear half of the train, this would be driven by the [...] who is a fully authorised driver and occupies the rear <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> in the tunnel for this purpose. [...] Due to limitations on driving hours, the driver and Chef du Train exchange roles for the return journey.|$|E
50|$|One single car was {{converted}} in February 1986 from former Iyo Railway 100 series car MoHa 106, purchased in October 1985. This car {{was built in}} 1950 by Teikoku Sharyo as KuHa 405, and converted to become single-car MoHa 106 with an additional <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> in 1961. The second <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> was subsequently taken out of use and a gangway door added, but from 1967, the <b>driving</b> <b>cab</b> was reinstated, with the gangway door left in place.|$|E
