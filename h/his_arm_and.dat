5|$|After Edward Elric recovers <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> {{his brother}} Alphonse's body, Edward is dragged from his homeworld through the Gate of Alchemy—the source of alchemical energy—to a {{parallel}} world of Earth in 1923.

When Edward arrives there, he discovers that he has been stripped of his alchemical powers and his newly restored arm and leg.|$|E
5|$|That night, Mulder {{talks to}} Dana Scully, {{telling her that}} he's {{thinking}} of leaving the FBI. He shoots down Scully's idea that he request a transfer to Quantico, believing the FBI doesn't want them working together. Scully performs the autopsy on the crewman's body, finding a Russian language tattoo on <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> a flukeworm inside his liver.|$|E
60|$|The latter exclamation {{was caused}} by Rosco falling backwards; to prevent which {{catastrophe}} he made a wild flourish with <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> a sweep with his staff, which just grazed the negro's cheek. Zeppa, however, caught him in <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> set him up again.|$|R
60|$|Slackbridge laughed, folded <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> frowned sarcastically.|$|R
60|$|He rose, {{stretched}} <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> went. Presently he returned.|$|R
5|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, the 3rd Australian Brigade—of which the 12th Battalion was part—was designated as the covering force for the ANZAC landing, and as such was the first unit ashore on 25 April 1915, at approximately 04:30. Newland {{was wounded in the}} days following the landing, suffering a gunshot wound to <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> was evacuated to the 1st General Hospital. While at the hospital, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 22 May, before returning to the 12th Battalion four days later.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Edge and Randy Orton. Edge took early {{control of the}} match by driving Orton into the {{barricade}} outside the ring. Orton was able to recover, and performed a rope hung DDT on Edge. While setting up for his finishing move, the RKO, Orton appeared to injure <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> went outside the ring {{in an attempt to}} recover. Edge followed him, trying to perform the spear, but Orton was able to avoid it, and Edge hit the barricade. Neither man was able to return to the ring before the count of ten, and as a result, the match ended in a double countout.|$|E
5|$|For {{their third}} {{game of the}} season, the Bearcats {{returned}} to Nippert Stadium—their home field—to play {{the first of two}} Mid-American Conference (MAC) opponents, in-state rival Miami. In the 113th Battle for the Victory Bell, Cincinnati won, 45–20. Following the victory against Miami, the Bearcats traveled to Akron, Ohio to play the Akron Zips. Against the Zips, Pike broke <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> was replaced by redshirt freshman Chazz Anderson, who was also injured during the game. Fellow redshirt freshman Zach Collaros then entered the game and led the Bearcats to a 17–15 victory. The close win against Akron was followed by a 33–10 win over Marshall, the Bearcats' final nonconference game before beginning Big East play.|$|E

60|$|John crossed <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> looked gloomily {{out of the}} window.|$|R
60|$|He {{caught the}} boy in <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> hugged him to his breast, sobbing the {{meanwhile}} like a little child. He spoke {{of his wife and}} her death, of his lost money, and a hundred other things, and then, in the midst of it all, threw up <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> sank to the floor in a dead faint.|$|R
5|$|In a December 23, 2008 {{game against}} the Phoenix Coyotes, Paul {{suffered}} a fractured forearm after being struck by a shot from Phoenix's Olli Jokinen in the last regulation minute of the game. He successfully underwent surgery on <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> missed 24 games, but also his chance {{to play in the}} 2009 All-Star Game in Montreal. This was the second consecutive season that he missed such an opportunity. He was injured again later in the season when he broke his foot while blocking a shot during a March 17, 2009 {{game against the}} Minnesota Wild, putting him out of play {{for the rest of the}} season. He scored 36 points in just 45 games that year.|$|E
5|$|In his plebe (first) year at West Point, Patton {{adjusted}} {{easily to}} the routine. However, his academic performance was so poor {{that he was}} forced to repeat his first year after failing mathematics. Patton excelled at military drills though his academic performance remained average. He was cadet sergeant major his junior year, and cadet adjutant his senior year. He also joined the football team but injured <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> ceased playing on several occasions, instead trying out for the sword team and track and field, quickly becoming one of the best swordsmen at the academy. Ranked 46 out of 103, Patton graduated from West Point on June 11, 1909 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Cavalry Branch of the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Millburn (Rafe Spall) is a {{biologist}} {{who is a}} part of the Prometheus expedition. After awakening, he tries to become friends with Fifield (who rejects him). Millburn joins the initial expedition to the Engineers' artificial structure concealing the Juggernaut, tagging along with Fifield after he is upset by the number of corpses. Separated from the rest of the expedition, they are stranded in the ship. Millburn and Fifield enter the room containing the thawed black liquid and encounter the Hammerpedes. When Millburn tries to pet one it attacks him, breaking <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> jumping down his throat. When the crew of the Prometheus returns the next day, they find Millburn's body with the Hammerpede still in his throat.|$|E

5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on the doorstep of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Mana {{opens on}} the fictional island of Illusia, {{a place where}} the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a {{continent}} composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the labyrinth of roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker began collaborating {{under the}} name TRV$DJAM. They {{performed}} at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2008. On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a Learjet 60 when it crashed upon takeoff in Columbia, South Carolina. The crash killed both crew members {{and the other two}} passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered third-degree burns to <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence {{on the part of the}} pilots, and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane. He asked for damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Han-Pashi was still distraught and suicidal over the loss of <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> so joined ranks with those planning to assault Beslan, where he was armed with a pistol. It is claimed that Nur-Pashi tagged along to act as a bodyguard for his brother.|$|E
25|$|Buenoano's son Michael Buenoano (1961–80) became {{severely}} ill in 1979, {{his symptoms}} including paraplegia; post-mortem examination {{indicated that he}} had been the victim of severe arsenic poisoning, which caused his disability. In 1980, Buenoano took Michael out in a canoe; the canoe rolled, and Michael, weighed down by <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> leg braces, drowned.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Boxing Day 1995, Australian umpire Darrell Hair called Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan for {{throwing}} {{in front of}} a crowd of 55,239. The off-spinner was no-balled seven times in three overs by Hair, who believed the then 23-year-old was bending <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> straightening it in the process of delivery; an illegal action in cricket.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the early}} months and spring of 1985, Petrelis {{suffered}} from a persistent illness that one doctor diagnosed as influenza; by that summer, he had developed a “bump” on <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> was referred to a dermatologist at New York University (NYU) Hospital. At first, Petrelis balked; earning his living as a temporary office worker, he had neither insurance nor money to pay a dermatologist. Urged by the referring physician, he relented.|$|E
25|$|Staines {{and his two}} lieutenants {{were wounded}} in the action, Staines losing <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> one of the lieutenants dying the {{following}} summer while at home. Cyane lost two killed, as well as 17 more men wounded; the French acknowledge losing 50 men killed and wounded. Cyane was so damaged by the three days of fighting that Admiral Lord Collingwood ordered her home for a refit. Cyane arrived back in Britain on 16 October.|$|E
25|$|In one case, a {{criminal}} planted fake DNA evidence {{in his own}} body: John Schneeberger raped one of his sedated patients in 1992 and left semen on her underwear. Police drew what they believed to be Schneeberger's blood and compared its DNA against the crime scene semen DNA on three occasions, never showing a match. It turned {{out that he had}} surgically inserted a Penrose drain into <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> filled it with foreign blood and anticoagulants.|$|E
