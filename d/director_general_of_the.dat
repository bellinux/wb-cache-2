5|$|Sir R.E.M.Wheeler, the <b>Director</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archaeological Survey of India, in the 1940s {{saw a few}} {{potsherds}} of Arikamedu site {{displayed in}} the Madras Museum, which he identified as Arrentine ware, an expensive ceramic made until 50 CE in Arizzo, Italy. Thereafter, when he visited the Pondicherry Museum and saw more of {{the findings from the}} Arikamedu site, he was impressed and thought that he had found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the penultimate year of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that could establish its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest led him to the Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were trained on the site.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ widely on {{the number}} of {{children}} Amin fathered; most say that he had 30 to 45. Until 2003, Taban Amin (born 1955), Idi Amin's eldest son, was the leader of West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), a rebel group opposed to the government of Yoweri Museveni. In 2005, he was offered amnesty by Museveni, and in 2006, he was appointed Deputy <b>Director</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internal Security Organisation. Another of Amin's sons, Haji Ali Amin, ran for election as Chairman (i.e. mayor) of Njeru Town Council in 2002 but was not elected. In early 2007, the award-winning film The Last King of Scotland prompted one of his sons, Jaffar Amin (born in 1967), to speak out in his father's defence. Jaffar Amin said he was writing a book to rehabilitate his father's reputation. Jaffar is the tenth of Amin's 40 official children by seven official wives.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage to}} Lal Masjid was extensive. The {{entrance}} hall was completely burned out, the ceiling scorched, {{and the red}} walls above the oval doorway blackened. However, the mosque itself sustained less damage than the Jamia Hafsa seminary. Bullet casings were found all over the mosque roof, and the inside of Lal Masjid was turned coal black from the militants trying to set the mosque on fire using gasoline bombs. Militants used the mosque's two white minarets as vantage points, resulting in damage to the minarets. One minaret was completely destroyed, and its speakers were hanging from their wires. The dome, however, was not damaged during the 36-hour battle. The <b>director</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Inter Services Public Relations said photographs of the bodies {{seem to indicate that}} there were foreigners among the dead.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 Serong {{served as}} General Staff Officer 2 with the {{combined}} 6th and 7th Divisions on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland, {{where they were}} resting and retraining prior to conducting further operations. In early 1944 he instructed on the staff course at Cabarlah. That August, he moved to Aitape {{to prepare for the}} deployment of the 6th Division. He was later attached to American forces for the landing on Morotai Island in the Netherlands East Indies in mid-September 1944. In the last few weeks of the war, Serong was mentioned in despatches for his actions fighting the Japanese at Wewak, whilst serving with the infantry in the 35th Battalion. During an incident on 21 July 1945, he commanded a force of three platoons and native police on a patrol to destroy a Japanese ammunition dump. Although serving more time in training roles than in combat, during the war Serong had made important contacts with whom he would later work in future postings, including Colonel Reg Pollard, who went on to become Chief of the General Staff (CGS), and Colonel Charles Spry, later the Director of Military Intelligence and the <b>Director</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).|$|E
