500|$|On November 23, 2005, the Canadian {{government}} announced a $1.9billion compensation package to benefit {{tens of thousands}} of former students. National Chief of the AFN, Phil Fontaine, said the package was meant to cover [...] "decades in time, innumerable events and countless injuries to First Nations individuals and communities". Justice Minister Irwin Cotler applauded the compensation decision noting that the placement of children in the residential school system was [...] "the single most harmful, disgraceful and racist act in our history". At an Ottawa news conference, Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan said: [...] "We have made good on our shared resolve to deliver what <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> will be a fair and lasting resolution of the Indian school legacy." ...|$|E
500|$|Outside of China and the {{traditional}} [...] "Sinosphere", the Zhuangzi lags far behind the Tao Te Ching in general popularity, and is rarely known by non-scholars. A number of prominent scholars have attempted to bring the Zhuangzi to wider attention among Western readers. [...] In 1939, the British translator and Sinologist Arthur Waley described the Zhuangzi as [...] "one of the most entertaining {{as well as one}} of the profoundest books in the world." [...] In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the Zhuangzi, the American Sinologist Victor H. Mair wrote: [...] "I feel a sense of injustice that the Dao De Jing is so well known to my fellow citizens while the Zhuangzi is so thoroughly ignored, because <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> that the latter is in every respect a superior work." ...|$|E
500|$|It was a {{night of}} {{contrasting}} emotions at Home Park. A 2–0 win for the visitors confirmed Argyle's relegation to League One and Newcastle's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. Hours after the match, the club's board declared that it remained determined to steer {{it to the top}} flight of English football. Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club, vowing to put things right. [...] "I feel the pain of the supporters because this is the club that gave me my first start," [...] he said. [...] "The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership. Now we've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> that we can do it." [...] Argyle's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest, who had already qualified for the play-off's, and they secured a comfortable 3–0 victory against the relegated side. The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May. Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach. He said: [...] "I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that." [...] Work on a new state-of-the-art Fibrelastic pitch at Home Park began the following week.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1932, Copeland {{made her}} maiden speech on import duties, which she {{approached}} [...] "entirely {{from the point}} of view of the pottery industry". It was an industry under threat from foreign competition and she welcomed the protection that tariffs afforded. She believed that overseas manufacturers paid starvation wages to their workers, and it was with a critical eye on the opposition benches that she asked:"Can we allow goods manufactured under those conditions to come into this country and lower the standard of living of our own people? I say 'no', and <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> that, if we raise these tariffs, the time will come when our industry will be on its feet again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gail Dines, {{writing in}} Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality, {{describes}} the money {{shot of a}} man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman as [...] "one of the most degrading acts in porn". To Dines, the ejaculate on the female performer's body [...] "marks the woman as used goods", conveying a sense of ownership, and she quotes veteran porn actor and producer Bill Margold as saying, [...] "I'd like to really show what I believe the men want to see: violence against women. <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have." [...] She adds that at least for some posters on adult forums discussing such scenes, the pleasure is derived from watching a woman suffer.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1909, The Washington Post {{published}} Cochems {{comments on}} the game under the headline, [...] "FOOTBALL LIKE AN AIRSHIP WOULD OPEN UP THE GAME." [...] Cochems advocated the redesign of the football to render it more aerodynamic and easy to handle:"The story in a nutshell is this. [...] The ball is too large and too light. Some of the best teams in the country find it impossible to use the pass owing to lack of players who can make it. ... Since {{it is impossible to}} grow larger hands and it is possible to make the ball conform to human dimensions, why not make the ball fit the needed conditions? ... With a ball such as I have proposed, longer, narrower, and a bit heavier, so that it would carry {{in the face of a}} strong wind, <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> that the game of rugby would develop [...] into one of the most beautiful and versatile sports the world ever saw." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mutual aid was a {{foundation}} of social welfare in the United States until the early 20th Century. Early societies not only shared material resources, but often advanced social values related to self-reliance and moral character. Many fraternal organizations were first organized as mutual aid societies when government {{at the state and}} local level supplemented private aid societies more than the converse of this being true. In 1890, 112,000 American residents lived in private charitable institutions, while only 73,000 resided in public almshouses. Towards the latter part of the nineteenth century, public aid was reduced as it was seen as contributing to sloth and dependency while private aid was judiciously provided with greater checks for reform and recovery. Writing in 1890, Jacob Riis, commenting on the extent of private charity, says: [...] "New York is, <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe,</b> the most charitable city in the world. Nowhere is there so eager a readiness to help ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{industry}} {{reaction was}} somewhat different. The news {{coincided with the}} end of the NFU conference where NFU president Peter Kendall, Agriculture Minister Jim Paice and food critic Jay Rayner were among those defending the concept of large scale farming. The news was greeted with concern that the dairy industry would find it hard to meet future challenges if it could not evolve and develop. [...] Mansel Raymond, chair of the NFU's dairy board, said: [...] "It is disappointing that the application has been withdrawn. Any planned investment in the dairy industry is a positive step. Nocton was an imaginative and innovative proposal, and <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> that there remains a place in Britain for this type of investment if we are to meet the growing demand for food.” The Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers also expressed its disappointment at the withdrawal. The British Cattle Veterinary Association, which leads the industry in managing the health and welfare of dairy cows in the UK, also took the steps of dismissing claims that Nocton Dairies would have been a [...] "cow prison", saying its developers demonstrated a commitment to good welfare.|$|E

And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that [...] "except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it." [...] <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel:...

2500|$|In a {{comprehensive}} {{examination of the}} KLF's announcement and its context, Select called it [...] "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction {{in the history of}} pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva [...] "friend zoned" [...] Tony in the finale. He explained, [...] "It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there — she even reaches {{up with her}} hand and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but <b>I</b> <b>firmly</b> <b>believe</b> a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. So I think they would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take." ...|$|E
