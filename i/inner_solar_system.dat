5|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is {{the region}} {{comprising}} the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. Composed mainly of silicates and metals, {{the objects of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region {{is less than the}} distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In addition, most {{solar panels}} on {{spacecraft}} are also made of high efficient multi-junction photovoltaic cells to derive electricity from sunlight when {{operating in the}} <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> history.|$|R
5|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> {{period of}} giant impacts {{probably}} {{played a role}} in the Earth acquiring its current water content (~6kg) from the early asteroid belt. Water is too volatile to have been present at Earth's formation and must have been subsequently delivered from outer, colder parts of the <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The water was probably delivered by planetary embryos and small planetesimals thrown out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter. A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has been also suggested as a possible source for Earth's water. In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water. The panspermia hypothesis holds that life itself may have been deposited on Earth in this way, although this idea is not widely accepted.|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} the flux of gamma-rays {{that result from}} collisions of high energy galactic cosmic rays with the solar atmosphere. An important aspect of our model is the propagation of cosmic rays through the magnetic fields of the <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems.</b> We use diffusion to model propagation {{down to the bottom}} of the corona. Below the corona we trace particle orbits through the photospheric fields to determine the location of cosmic ray interactions in the solar atmosphere and evolve the resultant cascades. For our nominal choice of parameters, we predict an integrated flux of gamma rays (at 1 AU) of F(E(sub gamma) greater than 100 MeV) approximately = 5 x 10 (exp - 8) /sq cm sec. This can be an order of magnitude above the galactic background and should be observable by the Energetic Gamma Ray experiment telescope (EGRET) ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> also {{contains}} near-Earth asteroids, {{many of which}} cross the orbits of the inner planets. Some of them are potentially hazardous objects.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a near {{collision}} with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E
40|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system’s</b> {{biggest and}} most recent known {{collision}} was the Moon-forming giant impact between a large protoplanet and proto-Earth. Not only did it create a disk near Earth that formed the Moon, it also ejected several percent of an Earth mass out of the Earth-Moon system. Here, we argue that numerous kilometer-sized ejecta fragments from that event struck main-belt asteroids at velocities exceeding 10 kilometers per second, enough to heat and degas target rock. Such impacts produce ~ 1000 times more highly heated material by volume than do typical main belt collisions at ~ 5 kilometers per second. By modeling their temporal evolution, and fitting the results to ancient impact heating signatures in stony meteorites, we infer that the Moon formed ~ 4. 47 billion years ago, which is in agreement with previous estimates. I nsights into the last stages of terrestrial planet formation can be gleaned from the abun-dances and chondritic signatures of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) (such as Re, Os...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere is {{a long-standing}} debate {{regarding}} {{the origin of}} the terrestrial planets' water as well as the hydrated C-type asteroids. Here we show that the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> water is a simple byproduct of the giant planets' formation. Giant planet cores accrete gas slowly until the conditions are met for a rapid phase of runaway growth. As a gas giant's mass rapidly increases, the orbits of nearby planetesimals are destabilized and gravitationally scattered in all directions. Under the action of aerodynamic gas drag, a fraction of scattered planetesimals are deposited onto stable orbits interior to Jupiter's. This process is effective in populating the outer main belt with C-type asteroids that originated from a broad (5 - 20 AU-wide) region of the disk. As the disk starts to dissipate, scattered planetesimals reach sufficiently eccentric orbits to cross the terrestrial planet region and deliver water to the growing Earth. This mechanism does not depend strongly on the giant planets' orbital migration history and is generic: whenever a giant planet forms it invariably pollutes its inner planetary system with water-rich bodies...|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Earth and its {{neighbor}} planets may have formed from fragments of planets after collisions with Jupiter destroyed those super-Earths near the Sun. As Jupiter came toward the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> in what theorists call the Grand Tack Hypothesis, gravitational tugs and pulls occurred causing {{a series of}} collisions between the super-Earths as their orbits began to overlap.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E

40|$|In {{the closing}} {{years of the}} 20 th Century {{humankind}} began its exploration of the planetary <b>systems</b> in the <b>solar</b> neighborhood. Precision radial velocity measurements have now yielded the discovery of over 160 planets. Direct imaging of these planets, as opposed to detection {{of the effects of}} orbital motion on their parent star, is now feasible, and the first young planet in a wide orbit may have been detected using adaptive optics systems. Gemini and the VLT are building the first generation of high contrast adaptive optics systems, which deliver planet-imaging performance within few Airy rings of the host star. These systems will make the first surveys of the outer regions of <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> by detecting the self-luminous radiation of young planets. These instruments will establish whether Jovian planets form predominantly through 'top-down' (global gravitational instability) or 'bottom-up' (core accretion) processes. The 8 -m 'extreme' AO systems cannot see close enough to the host stars to image Doppler planets, and they cannot reach the relatively distant, young clusters and associations where planets are forming. The Planet Formation Instrument will use the nearly four-fold improved angular resolution of TMT to peer into the <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> <b>systems</b> of Doppler-planet bearing stars to yield a unified sample of planets with known Keplerian orbital elements and atmospheric properties. In star formation regions, where T Tauri stars (young solar type stars) are found in abundance, PFI can see into the snow line, where the icy cores of planets like Jupiter must have formed. Thus, TMT will be the first facility to witness the formation of new planets...|$|R

5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E

5|$|In {{the outer}} Solar System, comets remain frozen and {{inactive}} and are extremely {{difficult or impossible}} to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned. As a comet approaches the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.|$|E

50|$|The overall {{success rate}} of jumping-Jupiter models with a late {{instability}} reproducing both the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is small. When Kaib and Chambers conducted {{a large number of}} simulations starting with five giant planets in a resonance chain and Jupiter and Saturn in a 3:2 resonance, 85% resulted in the loss of a terrestrial planet, less than 5% reproduce the current AMD, and only 1% reproduce both the AMD and the giant planet orbits. In addition to the secular-resonance crossings, the jumps in Jupiter's eccentricity when it encounters an ice giant can also excite the orbits of the terrestrial planets. This led them to propose that the Nice model migration occurred before the formation of the terrestrial planets and that the LHB had another cause. However, the advantage of an early migration is significantly reduced by the requirement that the Jupiter-Saturn period ratio jump to beyond 2.3 to reproduce the current asteroid belt.|$|R

These measurements reinforce our knowledge of comet CG and enable us to describe the nucleus and the sources with more details. The observations allow us to better constrain and accordingly develop much more realistic models of the comet’s coma. We show a 3 D simulation of the gas and dust coma of comet CG using a Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo model performed with the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (Tenishev et al. 2008, 2011). The coma model presented includes a realistic nucleus shape, with a gas flux distribution and a surface temperature that takes into account irregularities and concavities of the nucleus. Along with the gas drag, the gravity field drives the dust dynamics and is therefore accurately computed around the irregular nucleus shape. This constitutes the state-of-the-art of cometary coma models, which are crucial to interpret instrument data and for further mission planning.
