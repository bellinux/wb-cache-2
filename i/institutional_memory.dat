25|$|While {{awaiting}} the long-ballyhooed communist spring offensive, the U.S. improved its forward air control procedures. Lacking the <b>institutional</b> <b>memory</b> to recall prior experience during World War II, the Americans reinvented all-weather bombing and night FAC operations. Newer radio jeeps with 12 channels replaced {{the older ones}} that had only four. Ordnance specialists began loading proximity fused bombs matched to specific targets. Forward airfields were opened to stage aircraft closer to the enemy. When the communist offensive began on 22 April 1951, the 337,000 attacking troops disregarded UN air power and paid a heavy price for it. Tactical aviation from three aircraft carriers became available for close air support on 18 May. In mid-May, radar guided night air strikes killed communist troops within 400 yards of the U.S. 2nd Division, to General Almond's delight. However, even with copious air support, the UN forces gave ground until the communist attack petered out. Then they counter-attacked. Although they drove the communists back, {{for the first time}} the latter did not withdraw out of artillery range as usual to regroup, but clung in place. On 1 July 1951, North Korean Premier Kim Il Sung and General Peng Te-huai agreed to a cease fire as both sides settled into fixed positions. As the communists dug in, there were fewer and less worthy targets vulnerable to tactical air strikes.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the changing conditions for schools and the teaching profession from a teachers’ perspective. The process of the global restructuring of national educational systems that gained momentum in Sweden in the 1990 s, involved {{the introduction of a}} school voucher system, competition mechanisms and the decentralization of responsibilities to schools and teachers.   The aim of this dissertation is to examine teachers’ professional identities in relation to changes in local and global conditions for schools and the teaching profession.     Empirically, this study is anchored in 15 life history interviews conducted with eight teachers who have been working at the same secondary school in a Swedish mid-sized town. The school opened in 1965 in a residential area and closed down 2007 facing difficulties in attracting students. The teachers’ professional identities are analyzed in terms of identity performances, that is, the socially situated actions embedded in the stories and the interviews, in which they express and negotiate who they are or would like to be as a teacher. Methodologically this study contributes to a new way of investigating the relation between local school contexts and teacher identities by analyzing the <b>institutional</b> <b>memories</b> of a school.     Results show that educational restructuring in this local school context entailed shifts in the meanings of previously known social relationships and phenomena, such as the school’s mixed student base, reputation and forms of cooperation, and that the local press became an important actor when market mechanisms were introduced. The study highlights the complexity and variability when professional identities take shape in the teachers’ stories. Some features of the professional identities focused on in this study appear to be relatively stable, while others appear to be more varying. Self biographical factors, culturally available narratives of the teaching profession, as well as local factors tend to have a stabilizing effect on the identities shaped in the stories. However, diverse professional aims, life events and changing working conditions contribute to changes in the identity constructions. In the analysis of the <b>institutional</b> <b>memories</b> presented in the thesis, it is evident that identity performances are shaped in the teachers’ retellings of those memories. In different teachers’ versions of <b>institutional</b> <b>memories,</b> identity performances that stress e. g. the importance of discipline in school and opposition to women’s subordination are shaped...|$|R

Based on extensive documentary analysis of British and German diplomatic sources from various archives this paper examines the legacies, <b>institutional</b> <b>memories,</b> and policy instincts that inform British and German policy towards China. What emerges from the empirical evidence is not how specifically-defined interest guide foreign policy but how often diffuse perceptions, expectations, and economic success influence diplomatic strategies and foreign policy behaviour. The comparative analysis of Britain and Germany is emblematic of the different foreign policy pathways that European countries have taken in their engagement with China. The documentary evidence reveals the difficulties Britain and Germany face in safeguarding their access to China’s opaque regime and casts doubt on the ambition of the EU and its member states to ‘constructively engage’ China and gradually alter its economic and political systems...|$|R

40|$|Nichols {{calls for}} a {{rethinking}} of the classroom as space for disrupting heteronormative discourses—discourses that Nichols links to settler colonialism—to open a space where we can hear, or sometimes re-hear, queer voices. Settler colonialism is a heteronormative project that relies on rhetorics of reproductive “inheritance” to naturalize the erasure of indigenous cultures. Pedagogies attuned {{to the realities of}} heteronormativity and settler colonialism require a pedagogical commitment to interrupting these discourses, especially in institutional structures whose existence relies on and supports settler ideologies. Queerscapes, per Gordon Brent Ingram, are spaces and planes of queer alliances formed within and overlapping with heteronormative spaces; the university classroom, with its imbricated personal histories, <b>institutional</b> <b>memories,</b> and power dynamics, is always-already a queerscape. Importantly, the classroom is also a “settlerscape,” composed of the multiple subjectivities that constitute modern settler society and made meaningful through histories of indigenous displacement. Recognizing this dynamic opens a space for unheard queer voices, argues Nichols, and lets us “re-hear” how non-queer stories and perspectives are made meaningful through their unspoken proximity to queerness and colonization. Nichols proposes a decolonial queerscape pedagogy that foregrounds the marginalized and oppressed identities that populate every classroom, while also denaturalizing the supposedly “natural” and “inevitable” rhetorics of heteronormativity, white supremacy, and settler colonization that inform the American academy...|$|R

40|$|Many {{important}} ecological management {{issues can}} only be addressed by long-term monitoring or through studies carried out over extended periods. But such studies require institutional settings that ensure funding is sustained and that data arising from these studies are securely managed. Recent experience suggests both are difficult to achieve. This is because management agencies and research bodies are periodically restructured, especially in recent years. This has often led to long-term work being terminated. But there is anecdotal evidence that the data collected {{in at least some}} of these studies are not always lost. Instead, it can remain stored in the back rooms of agencies or in the personal files of former staff. Such data are clearly at risk; with time fewer people remain aware of the work or of the existence of data that were collected, thereby increasing the likelihood that the information will eventually disappear. This seems a waste. Securing funds for any long-term ecological study is always likely to be difficult, and many of these previous long-term studies are likely to be relevant to some of our present management problems. One approach to taking advantage of these earlier studies would be to ask scientific and professional associations to survey their older members to identify relevant previous investigations. But any re-establishment of former studies will require the creation of new institutional arrangements, more robust <b>institutional</b> <b>memories</b> and sufficient funds that are able to sustain any resurrected investigations into the future...|$|R

A segmentalist approach results in people working in parallel isolation rather than in collaborative relationships. Although teaching and service are viewed as important functions, the reward structure recognizes those who do research. Governance patterns are based on hierarchy where rank and title are the first conditions for membership. Rank and gender affect whose voices are heard. Information, rather than being openly shared, is held closely and sometimes used to control. Concrete, rational discourse is highly valued, limiting the opportunity for other ways of knowing to be recognized and respected. The words of the informants are filled with contradictions about what is and a yearning for what might be in this community of scholars. ^ Department members must decide whether to live from their <b>institutional</b> <b>memories</b> or move through the challenges that face them and emerge with a look that may be significantly different than today 2 ̆ 7 s reality. ...|$|R

40|$|Comprehensive, coordinated {{international}} cooperation among botanic gardens is an emerging concept, being {{based on the}} mutual benefits for all concerned. Established, oftentimes, as manifestations of European colonial expansionism, the botanic gardens of today have become increasingly isolated and found their positions eroding with the dissolution of world empires. In this research, I propose the following thesis: For the world's botanic gardens and similar institutions to continue {{to play an important}} role in the plant sciences, it is imperative that these institutions cooperate at not only the national and regional levels but ultimately at the international level. Furthermore, if significant and effective {{international cooperation}} is to occur among botanic gardens, it is best to formalize agreements, by developing written documents. As the traditional stewards of the world's plant resources, botanic gardens must accept the growing challenge of conserving plant taxa for posterity. Complete conservation coverage of all threatened and endangered plant taxa can not be accomplished by individual botanic gardens. The reduction of duplications of effort dictate the need for botanic gardens to engage in international cooperation activities. Plant conservation is not the only reason for botanic gardens to engage in international cooperation activities. Given the new political, cultural and economic factors facing the world's botanic gardens, international cooperation in plant exploration, plant exchanges, institution building and information exchanges is becoming increasingly requisite for successful institutional operation now and into the future. Informal cooperation must be expanded to more formalized levels with commitments to international cooperation being supported by written documents of agreement. By writing agreements, botanic gardens insure a greater probability of success by providing for clearly documented statements of intentions, expectations and abilities as well as long-term <b>institutional</b> <b>memories</b> of cooperation efforts, a means by which external sources of funding may be obtained and gauges by which progress may be assessed and activities may be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Five years ago, on the {{occasion}} of our 30 th anniversary, we published ICRISAT’s first history book. This book was a chronicle of <b>institutional</b> <b>memories</b> – the early years of building up, the teething problems, the first set of challenges and the initial successes. Essentially, it captured the birth and growth of an institution with a noble mission to help stakeholders of semi-arid agriculture, especially the poor. As we commemorate ICRISAT’s 35 th year, we have put up a sequel to the aforementioned book. This edition takes off from the first one and focuses on the four themes, which are the hallmarks of our achievements in the last 35 years: innovations, information, institutions and impact. I am most honored to mention that our 35 -year journey in the semi-arid tropics has led to scientific triumphs that have vastly improved the lives of the poor. Moreover, national research and extension systems have been strengthened through our capacity building programs, research networks and innovative information sharing initiatives. As a global center of scientific excellence for dryland agriculture, ICRISAT is staffed with dedicated experts who have keenly studied the needs of poor farmers especially in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Let me emphasize we have not been alone in this journey. I am proud to acknowledge the unwavering support of our partners from various disciplines and sectors across the globe. Henceforth, ICRISAT further pursues its excellence and relevance by continuously striving to improve the livelihoods of the poor people of the semi-arid tropics. Over the last 35 years, we have recognized the vulnerability of poor farming communities in harsh and unyielding environments. As if semi-arid environments were not punishing in themselves, we find that {{the poorest of the poor}} are concentrated in the drylands. It is a vicious circle – dryland denizens are poor because the land is poor, and the land becomes poorer from continuous degradation and over farming, making the poor even poorer. Out of this, we are empowering dryland people to mitigate and adapt to emerging global challenges – climate change, desertification, drought, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, the aftermath of AIDS and wars, fuel shortages, and the ongoing and ever-present need for food. During the last 35 years, ICRISAT has indeed made a big difference. Consequently, ICRISAT is encouraged by its scientific triumphs as much as by the smiles of pride and joy brought to the faces of poor farm families in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. I thank you for your interest in ICRISAT. I hope you enjoy reading about our history as Team ICRISAT, partners and stakeholders have enjoyed the journey of making it...|$|R
