This is optimal when it is costly for society <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>sanctions,</b> since it can yield the same degree of deterrence while requiring fewer resources to be spent on sanctioning. Furthermore, when the unfairness of convicting an innocent defendant increases with the size of the sanction, this provides a further rationale for graduating sanctions with the probability of guilt. Some objections are briefly discussed, mainly that it is inherently unfair <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> different <b>sanctions</b> on people, who have committed the same offense, and that the legal system will lose legitimacy if it allows sanctions to vary in the way suggested. ...|$|R

Emotional reaction to free-riding incites individuals <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>sanctions</b> when they are available. The application of sanctions activates a "virtuous emotional circle " that accompanies cooperation. Emotionally aroused cooperators relieve negative emotions when they punish free riders. In response, the free-riders experience negative emotions when punished, and increase their subsequent level of cooperation.
