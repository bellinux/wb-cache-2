This paper will consider non-professional healthcare workers: {{do they have a}} moral obligation to work during an influenza pandemic? If so, is this an obligation that outweighs others they might have, e. g., as parents, and should such an obligation be backed up by the coercive power of law? This paper considers whether non-professional healthcare workers—porters, domestic service workers, catering staff, clerks, IT support workers, etc. —have an obligation to work during an influenza pandemic. It uses data collected as part of a study looking at the attitudes of healthcare workers to working during a pandemic to suggest the philosophical arguments explored. These include: being {{in a position to do}} good, the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> competing obligations to family members and in particular to children and the obligations of citizens in a state of national emergency. We also look at whether compulsory measures are justified to support a national health service during a health emergency. We conclude that even if they are, compulsion should not be restricted to non-professionals who happen to be working in the health service at the time. Rather, compulsion involving a larger pool of people with the relevant skills and abilities is more equitable...|$|E
40|$|This {{article has}} {{unpacked}} issues surrounding workers� poor attitude {{in terms of}} work and focuses on Nigeria and on Africa at large. It addresses the lapses of labour for both employers and the employees, which include misconduct, non-commitment, unfaithfulness, apathy and exploitation, amongst other things. It is the argument of this article that a misconception of work {{and a lack of}} work ethics are some of the major factors responsible for these negative attitudes. In order to get around this perceived problem, the article suggests a theological solution which is rooted in the Christian Scriptures. Thus polemic approaches as well as an exegesis of the Scriptures concerning the right concept and attitude to work are employed in this study. The synchronic approach to exegesis is employed in this work. This approach looks at the final form of the text as it stands in the Bible. The particular components of this approach applied in this article are narrative and rhetorical criticism whilst others involve lexical, grammatical and syntactical analysis. In addition, the Intercultural Hermeneutics approach of contextualization is employed. The article points out how work which, from a theological perspective, originated with creation and was not intended to be evil later became conceived as a kind of punishment. It also demonstrates how work became bifurcated into secular and spiritual spheres with its attendant negative consequences in the Middle Ages. It concludes with a presentation of the biblical <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> which is recommended as a benchmark for attitudinal change in stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the delivery of}} humanitarian assistance in Somalia {{at the turn of}} the 21 st Century. Humanitarian assistance is considered as an ideal and the key question is, can it be effective in a chronic emergency? Humanitarian assistance itself is examined in detail and placed in a broader context of ideas of vulnerability, resilience and adaptive capacity in response to disasters. The thesis is grounded on evidence based evaluation to generate conclusions for programme and project management. The method taken is one of using conventional social science methods to come to evaluative judgement. The nature of evaluative judgement requires an understanding of the purpose and content of evaluation itself, which is extensively discussed in the methods chapter. The <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in disaster situations is also addressed. The case material comes from two evaluations namely for Action by Churches Together and Norwegian Church Aid conducted in Somalia in 2006 - 07. The key findings from the case material is that humanitarian projects in chronic emergencies must be delivered within the cultural context i. e. religion supported delivery. The reasons for this are that such delivery pays attention to the critical role of beneficiaries in ensuring effective and sustainable project implementation. This raises key issues about the validity of the top down delivery of humanitarian assistance as well as an understanding of chronic emergency as development rather than disaster projects. The thesis concludes with observations on the limitations of evaluation in the context of humanitarian assistance. It reinforces the central directive of humanitarian delivery as ‘do no harm’ and shows that there are opportunities to ‘do some good’...|$|E

Define themselves as people who are dedicated to program so passionate and believe that it is a duty for them to share information and develop free software.

40|$|Abstract – In this essay, I {{investigate}} {{the role played}} by the work ethic in The Nigger of the “Narcissus”. I interpret the novel, in the wake of Fredric Jameson and Giuseppe Sertoli, as a political allegory expressing Conrad's views on the crisis of the value <b>of</b> <b>work</b> which took place during the fin de siècle. The novel represents an idealized pre-modern organic community, based on discipline and work, and embodied by the crew of the Narcissus, as it is attacked by the evil forces of degenerate modernity, embodied by the two antagonists James Wait and Donkin and their refusal <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> On the one hand, Wait stands for the turn-of-the-century decadent culture, which was undermining the Victorian faith in work. On the other hand, Donkin stands for contemporary social movements and criticism of the labour system of the time. By analysing the way the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and its discontents are represented in The Nigger of the Narcissus, and by highlighting the ambiguous stance taken by the narrator and the author in the face of it, I intend to show how, in spite of his veneration <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> Conrad was well aware that such an attitude was quickly becoming anachronistic. The organic community in which the Victorian worship <b>of</b> <b>work</b> could be a meaningful social experience rather than a mere glorification of profit and social climbing was on the wane, and a new and more modern <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> had to be invented...|$|R
40|$|It aims at {{contributing}} {{to the formation of}} a proper theology of work for modern world, through critical reflection on the two dominant theological approaches to human work after the Reformation. Modern theology of work originated from Luther and Calvin' s interpretation towards ℓvocation', an idea which had a long history in Christian theological tradition. However, this theological understanding of human work became inadequate when facing the structural alienation of work in modern capitalist society. Against this background, a paradigm shift in the area of theology of work happened in the 20 th century's Christian theology. The new approach that views human work as cooperatio Dei stresses one-sidely the theological significance of human work {{and at the same time}} fails to highlight the distinctively Christian virtues which are required in the human work. This research is intended to emphasize another dimension of work, that is, work as "gift", a concept inherent to the Reformers' <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> This approach affirms both accepting work as a gift from God and practicing it as the "gift giving" towards other people. It also emphasizes the virtues and the proper mode of work as such. This approach does not mean to totally negate the understanding of human work as cooperatio Dei, but it maintains that the approach of cooperatio Dei should be supplemented and balanced by the understanding of work as gift. This thesis offers a theological inquiry into the meaning of human work, especially the one in the domain of economy. 高喆. Adviser: Pan-chin Lai.

I have worked in preschools and schools for nearly fifteen years and have met a great many children with different needs during these years. I tell in this essay about my relationship with Lucas who is a child I feel need special support in his everyday life. Lucas has what we in the preschool world call impulse controlled behavior. I also feel that he is disturbed by external stimuli such as sound and he has difficulty with social interactions with friends. This places demands on me {{as an educator}} to know how I can best meet Lucas at preschool.    In my essay, I lift up my feeling of being a divided teacher. I find that I occasionally find it difficult to be on hand and {{meet the needs of the}} group, the other teachers as well as those of the individual child. I have chosen to use Henriksen & Vetlesen´s book Etik i arbete med människor (The <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> with people) where they discuss empathy and its role in professional life to reflect on this. In my essay, I discuss the special education´s entry in the preschool world. I reflect on the differences in education and special education and its importance in my profession. I use Eva Björck-Åkesson´s book Specialpedagogik i förskolan (Special education in kindergarten) which is based on a system theoretical perspective. I also use Claes Nilholm´s book Perspektiv på specialpedagogik (Perspectives on special education) in my reflections on special education. Through my selected literature and my own reflections I review myself.   I have in my story related events with Lucas where his vulnerability in the children's group becomes apparent. I have critically reviewed these events and discussed if I in my educator role contributed to this vulnerability. I find using the literature that my role as an educator is complex and I examine myself during the writing of this essay. My own personal experience turns out to play a role in my role as an educator...|$|E
40|$|In Kuwait the Government, {{represented}} {{in its various}} authorities, has started to import theories and practices from western countries, particularly the United States. [ncluded in these imports, are managerial skills models. From this perspective, the main argument tor this research was whether managerial skills are generic in nature or not. [n other word, the universality and the situational hypothesis were investigated {{within the context of}} managerial skills. Furthermore, it aimed at understanding. the components of managerial skills for the industrial manager, through developing a model. This moud consists of three stages. The first stage aimed at measuring the role of demographic variables, national culture, organizational culture, and organizational variables, in determining the required managerial skills for the industrial manager. The second stage aimed to determine the most important factors that lead to acquiring managerial skills. The third stage of the model, aimed at determining the relationship of managerial skills with organizational effectiveness,. and the relationship of independent variables (national culture, organizational culture, and organizational variables) with organizational effectiveness. The sample of the study, represented the industrial companies working in Kuwait, where a questionnaire was distributed to 318 managers from 56 industrial companies (governmental, private, and joint venture), and those managers represent various management levels. The results suggest that managerial skills are not absolutely universal, but there is tendency to universality. The first stage of the model, suggested that the effect of the independent variables is minor. However, organizational culture showed the highest effect, compared with the other variables. For the second stage of the model, {{it was found that the}} main four elements that lead to acquiring managerial skills are good quality education, experience acquired through work, the values and <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> and finally, learning from a mentor. Three of these factors are usually acquired before managers are appointed to their positions. In the third stage of the model, it was found that the most important variable which impacts on effectiveness is organizational culture, while the other variables, including managerial skills, have shown a minimal effect. Nevertheless, these variables, combined, have had an affect on effectiveness by a value ofone third. Finally, specific recommendations have been introduced for policy makers and managers to benefit from this study. Furthermore, suggestions are made for future studies.

40|$|Gianni Vattimo from Weak Thinking to Hermeneutics as “Second Realism” and Philosophy of Praxis In 1974 Vattimo {{suggested}} {{in his book}} The subject and its mask a revolutionary lecture of Nietzsche. Nietzsche {{was seen as an}} anarchist and libertarian prophet, who intended to pull down the totalitarian ratio of platonic metaphysics but first of all that hierarchical social order that, coming from the Socratic turn in the conception of trugh, has finally found its stability in the capitalistic state. Vattimo tried to combine Nietzsche with Marx, in order to promote a junction between the avant-gardist bourgeois intellectuals (radicalized students and professors) and a new movement of workers finally post-hegelian and free from the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and (the “mass-worker”, in Toni Negri’s language). The snake’s bite on the haed in Nietzsche’s Zarathustra was in that book the act of foundation of a new dionisyan world. It was the liberation of the human creativity and the regaining of our ability to reinsert the Novum in the history, a history that seemed to be “finished” now in the capitalistic steel-cage. The destruction of metaphysics should facilitate “a new way of existence” but also “a radical change in the conditions of work, in the discipline of production, {{in the structure of the}} social control”. It should facilitate therefore a real revolution. During the Eighties, on the contrary, the grounding of Vattimo’s “weak thought” was the acknowledgment of the absurdity of his previous revolutionary and dialectical lecture of Nietzsche. But first of all this elaboration testified Vattimo’s relief to the exhaustion of any reconstructive effort, of any hypothesis about new political and social order: the season of marxist terrorism in Europe bared the indissoluble link between dialectics and violence. So, after the crisis of the myth of Development in Real Socialism, “The possibility to join Nietzsche’ idea of liberation… to dialectical perspectives, appears today very problematic”, explains Vattimo. This possibility was only “a dream”, the idea of “beyond-humanity as possible condition of reconcilement between existence and meaning”. At the end of the First Republic begins in Italy and the berlusconian age and Vattimo rediscovers the joy of political commitment. In these years appears the book Ecce Comu, with its appeal to “become what we were” (we need to pursue “a project of human emancipation”, a project that can be founded “only on the search for equality and on a political culture that correct the “natural” disequalities”). And in these years appear also Della realtà and Hermeneutic Communism. These two book are theoretically focused in rejecting the realistic philosophies, seen as cultural supports of the existing neoconservative order. But they are addressed at the same time to “build a philosophy not merely descriptive but ‘projectual’”. With an unexpected and suddenly jumping-back to the Seventies, this is a philosophy that wants to change again the world and the reality. A reality that other scholars - as Maurizio Ferraris, whose polemic about Hermeneutics and New Realism I reconstruct in my article – want simply to contemplate as a pure fact. In this conclusive perspective, even Heidegger’s “Andenken” or “poetic thinking” becomes now “the source of any legitimacy for the transformative action”, until at least in Vattimo’s view “hermeneutics” becomes synonymous of “philosophy of praxis”...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho são analisadas as relações entre escolarização (configurada na Casa Familiar Rural) e as estratégias de reprodução das organizações sociais representativas do campesinato em {{interface}} com as famílias de agricultores na Transamazônica, frente pioneira de colonização no Oeste do Pará, particularmente no município de Medicilândia. Esta escola, pensada por estes agentes sociais e coletivos em um cenário nacional e regional de publicização dos quadros que fragilizam a agricultura de base camponesa, a partir de meados da década de 1990, tem sido instrumento da luta social. As tensões no espaço social, lidas como ‘crise da base’ e ‘crise dos sistemas de produção’, teriam desenhado simultaneamente uma ‘crise de formação’ na qual as finalidades da escola foram sendo construídas por desafios sócio-econômico e políticos. Este cenário teria constituído os jovens agricultores como categoria social, investidos da expectativa coletiva de tornarem-se, sob a mediação da CFR, técnicos agrícolas e/ou dirigentes, a fim de dar continuidade ao grupo (seja dos atores, nos campos das organizações sociais/sindicais e comunitário-religiosas; seja das famílias, na sucessão agrícola e na manutenção de sua posição social). As repercussões da CFR na condição camponesa destes jovens são analisadas a partir de dados qualitativos e quantitativos, tomando-se como referência os interesses e investimentos dos agentes sociais, das famílias, bem como as inserções sócio-profissionais no campo e/ou na cidade destes jovens após a escolarização. Os resultados da CFR, considerando-se esta escola como estratégia coletiva organizada que visa transformar para conservar o campo de lutas enquanto sistema de relações objetivas do grupo social que a constitui, revelam que a mesma tem possibilitado a permanência dos jovens agricultores no campo sob diversos arranjos em que se imbricam as relações com o campesinato, com a cidade, com o conhecimento escolar/técnico, e com uma ética de trabalho e relação com a terra/natureza “ambientalizada”. No âmbito dos grupos domésticos e da coletividade camponesa (nas quais se incluem as organizações representativas do grupo estudado), a posição social destes jovens caracteriza-se por formas de distinção social visíveis nas práticas sócio-produtivas intercedidas pelo capital escolar, bem como na posição de mediadores dirigentes e técnicos. ABSTRACT: This paper analyses {{the relations}} between schooling (configured in the Rural Familiar House) and the strategies for reproduction of the social organizations, representative of the peasants in its interface with {{the families of the}} farmers in the Transamazonian region, pionnering front of the colonization of the West of the Pará State (Brazil), especially in the town of Medicilância. This school, thought through this social and collective agents in a national and regional setting of public-making of the scenes that weaken the agriculture of the countrymen basis, starting in the mid- 90 s, has been an instrument of social conflict. The tensions in the social space, interpreted as ‘crisis of the basis’ and ‘crisis of the production systems’, had simultaneously drawn a ‘formation crisis’ in which the purposes of the school were built through socio-economic and political challenges. This setting had established the young farmers as a social category invested in the collective expectation of becoming, under the mediation of the RFH, agricultural technicians and/or managers, in order to give continuity to the group (either the agents, {{in the land of the}} social/ union and community-religious or in the families, in the agricultural succession and in the social position). The repercussion of the RFH in the farmer’s condition of the youth are analysed from quantitative and qualitative data, taking as reference the interests and investments of the social agents, the families, as well as the socio-professional insertions of the land and/or in the city of this youth after the schooling. The results of the RFH, considering this school as organized collective strategy that attempts to transforming for conserving the field of conflicts while system of objective relations of the social group that constitutes it, reveals that it has made possible the permanence of the young farmers on the land under several arrangements in which the relations with the peasants, the city, the technical/ school knowledge, and the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and relation with the “surrouning” land/ nature overlap. At the level of the domestic groups and of the rural collectivity (in which the representative organizations of the studied group are included), the social position of the young ones is charaterized by forms of visible social distinction in the socio-productive practices endorsed in the school capital, as well in the position of mediator managers and technicians...|$|E
