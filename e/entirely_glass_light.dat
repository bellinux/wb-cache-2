5000|$|VMware: ARC was {{retained}} by VMware to fit-out 53000 sq ft on three floors of their office space in Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA. The space includes offices, conference rooms and a 3000 sq ft data center. A large multi-purpose room {{is used for}} all company meetings, for catered events and as a staff lounge. Elements of design include the exposure of the waffle slab ceiling in the corner conference rooms and in specific corridor locations to increase the height, lightness and airiness of the space.

5000|$|Built for a workers' {{cooperative}} by {{that name}} and designed to house shops, storage for products and a dental clinic as well as offices, the De Volharding (Persistence) Building (1927 - 28) is De Stijl or cubistic in conception, influenced also by Russian Constructivism, and clad <b>entirely</b> in <b>glass.</b> A <b>light</b> tower rises from the roof above a large sign which bore {{the name of the}} cooperative; these are in white, yellow and blue glass, the blue extending downwards to form a divider between the lift tower and the staircase tower, which consist of glass bricks, as does the strip above the ground-floor windows. The remainder of the façade consists of ribbon windows separated by opal glass spandrels, which can be reached from gangways and had lettering mounted behind the glass advertising the benefits of membership. In response to the client's requirement that he include as much advertising space as possible, Buijs designed a building the entirety of which advertised both the organisation and the cooperative movement itself. It was [...] "a city-scale luminescent sculpture", an internationally famous example of architecture of the night, [...] "probably the most frequently cited example for the potential applications of a future 'light architecture' in 1920s Europe", referred to in 1935 as [...] "the most famous of all luminous buildings". However, it was criticised by some in the modern movement for combining expressionist elements and thus not being entirely devoid of ornamentation.|$|R
