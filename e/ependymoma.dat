5|$|On microscopy, {{the tumor}} cells are {{typically}} described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright rosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright rosettes are tumor cells around the neuropil, {{not to be}} confused with pseudorosettes, which are tumor cells around a blood vessel. They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an <b>ependymoma</b> which consist of tumor cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive processes tapering off toward a blood vessel (thus a combination of the two). A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' tumor.|$|E
5000|$|Significant debate remains over grading of ependymomas, {{though the}} WHO 2007 {{classification}} lists subependymoma (grade I), myxopapillary <b>ependymoma</b> (grade I), <b>ependymoma</b> (grade II), and anaplastic <b>ependymoma</b> (grade III) {{as the primary}} classifications. [...] This classification scheme further designates four subtypes within the <b>ependymoma</b> group. However, there are several recognized subtypes of <b>ependymoma</b> with differing pathologies. These include myxopapillary <b>ependymoma</b> (MEPN) which tend to grow slowly and are restricted to the conus medullaris-cauda equina-filum terminale region of the spinal cord, intracranial, infratentorial (posterior fossa), intracranial supratentorial, and spinal <b>ependymoma,</b> and subependymomas. Reports have shown that location-based classification is most relevant to the molecular characteristics, implicating underlying tissue-specificity effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ependymoma</b> is a tumor {{that arises}} from the ependyma, a tissue of the central nervous system. Usually, in {{pediatric}} cases the location is intracranial, while in adults it is spinal. The common location of intracranial <b>ependymoma</b> is the fourth ventricle. Rarely, <b>ependymoma</b> can occur in the pelvic cavity.|$|E
5000|$|Comparative genomic {{hybridization}} (CGH) {{experiments have}} shown pediatric <b>ependymomas</b> possess {{a number of}} genomic anomalies not seen in adult <b>ependymomas.</b> [...] In addition, <b>ependymomas</b> from different locations within {{the central nervous system}} (spinal, supratentorial, and infratentorial) can be distinguished by their chromosomal, immunohistochemical, and gene expression differences.|$|R
40|$|Ependymal {{tumors are}} {{heterogeneous}} {{with regard to}} morphology, localization, age at first clinical manifestation, and prognosis. Several molecular alterations {{have been reported in}} these tumors, including allelic losses on chromosomes 10, 17, and 22 and mutations in the NF 2 gene. However, in contrast to astrocytic gliomas, no consistent molecular alterations have been associated with distinct types of ependymal tumors. To evaluate whether morphological subsets of <b>ependymomas</b> are characterized by specific genetic lesions, we analyzed a series of 62 ependymal tumors, including myxopapillary <b>ependymomas,</b> subependymomas, <b>ependymomas,</b> and anaplastic <b>ependymomas,</b> for allelic losses on chromosome arms 10 q and 22 q and mutations in the PTEN and NF 2 genes. Allelic losses on 10 q and 22 q were detected in 5 of 56 and 12 of 54 tumors, respectively. Six <b>ependymomas</b> carried somatic NF 2 mutations, whereas no mutations were detected in the PTEN gene. All six of the NF 2 mutations occurred in <b>ependymomas</b> of WHO grade II and were exclusively observed in tumors with a spinal localization (P = 0. 0063). These findings suggest that a considerable fraction of spinal <b>ependymomas</b> are associated with molecular events involving chromosome 22 and that mutations in the NF 2 gene may be of primary importance for their genesis. Furthermore, our data suggest that the more favorable clinical course of spinal <b>ependymomas</b> may relate to a distinct pattern of genetic alterations different from that of intracerebral <b>ependymomas...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Ependymomas</b> are {{believed}} to arise from radial glial cells. Tumorspheres derived from <b>ependymomas</b> display a radial-glial like phenotype, expressing neuronal stem cell markers CD133 and nestin, as well as radial glial specific markers RC2 and brain lipid binding protein (BLBP/FABP7). Tumorspheres with radial glial characteristics form tumors in orthotopic mouse xenografts, suggesting radial glial as cell of origin for <b>ependymomas.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} genetic syndromes are {{associated}} with the development of <b>ependymoma,</b> including neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), Turcot syndrome B, and MEN1 syndrome. However, gene mutations linked to the familial syndromes are rarely found in sporadic cases of <b>ependymoma.</b> [...] For example, NF2 mutations have rarely been observed in ependymomas and MEN1 mutations have only been found in a small number of cases of <b>ependymoma</b> recurrences.|$|E
50|$|In November 2006, {{the concept}} of {{creating}} an international group to develop new treatments for <b>ependymoma</b> was proposed to Mark Gilbert, M.D., Deputy Chairman of Neuro-Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center, during a meeting with an <b>ependymoma</b> survivor.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY <b>Ependymomas</b> are glial tumors. They {{constitute}} approximately 5 %- 10 % of intracranial tumors. <b>Ependymomas</b> are tumors {{which can}} recur. Predictive factors of outcome in <b>ependymomas</b> {{are not well}} established. Karyotypic studies are relatively scarce and loss of chromosome 22 has been described to correlate with recurrence. We are unaware of any reports involving chromosome 1 aberrations in the malignant progression of <b>ependymomas.</b> Cytogenetic analysis of 4 <b>ependymomas</b> was performed using double-target fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and focusing on chromosomes 1 and 22. One patient had recurrent tumor. FISH was performed on 500 nuclei/tumors. All four cases showed a loss of chromosome 22 q, while only one showed an additional loss of chromosome 1 p, {{and it was the}} one with tumor relapse. We support the presence of tumor suppressor gene on 1 p associated with relapse in <b>ependymomas</b> and suggest that the chromosome 1 p status by FISH may identify a high risk group of patients harboring this tumor. Additional studies in this direction are needed, as our results refer to a minimal number of individuals analyzed...|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} oncogenes and tumor {{suppressor}} genes {{have been found}} to be mutated or possess altered expression in pediatric <b>ependymomas.</b> KIT receptor tyrosine kinase and phospho-KIT have been suggested to play a role in the development of pediatric <b>ependymomas,</b> NOTCH1 mutations have been found in approximately 8% of pediatric <b>ependymomas,</b> and MEN1 mutations are occasionally found in pediatric <b>ependymomas.</b> [...] MMP2 and MMP14 appear to also play a role in tumor growth and progression in intracranial cases. [...] Two candidate genes, TPR and CHIBBY, have been identified on commonly altered chromosome regions in pediatric <b>ependymomas,</b> chromosomes 1q25 and chromosome 22q12-q13. [...] Expression of two additional candidate genes, S100A6 and S100A4 on chromosome 1q have also been found to correspond to supratentorial tumor development and tumors occurring before the age of 3 years old, though it is unclear exactly what role these genes play in the etiology.|$|R

40|$|Objective- The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the clinico-pat-hological characteristics, treatment, {{complications}} and outcome in paediatric patients with infratentorial <b>ependymomas.</b> Patients and Methods- A retrospective analysis of 6 patients younger than 15 years and hospitalized for surgical treatment of infratentorial <b>ependymomas</b> was performed. The intracra-nial hypertension, neurological status, radiological CT or MRI findings, tumours localization, type of resection, hydrocepha-lus treatment, histopathology, complications and outcome were analysed. Results- There were 6 (12 %) of children with infratentorial <b>ependymomas</b> among the posteror cranial fossa tumours. The average age of the patients was 48 ± 55 months. The average size of <b>ependymomas</b> was 42 mm. The most common neurological signs and symptoms before diagnostic procedures were high in-tracranial pressure and ataxia. Conclusion- The best treatment option for infratentorial <b>ependymomas</b> is surgery with a complete resection whenever possible, followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy taking into consideration the age of the patients and histological charac-teristics of the tumours...|$|R
40|$|Using {{comparative}} genomic hybridisation, we have analysed genetic {{imbalance in}} a series of 86 <b>ependymomas</b> from children and adults. Tumours were derived from intracranial and spinal sites, and classified histologically as classic, anaplastic or myxopapillary. <b>Ependymomas</b> showing a balanced profile were significantly (P< 0. 0005) more frequent in children than adults. Profiles suggesting intermediate ploidy were common (44 % of all tumours), and found more often (P< 0. 0005) in tumours from adults and the spinal region. Loss of 22 q was the most common specific abnormality, occurring in 50 % of spinal (medullary) <b>ependymomas</b> and 26 % of tumours overall. Genetic profiles combining loss of 22 q with other specific abnormalities - gain of 1 q, loss of 6 q, loss of 10 q/ 10, loss of 13, loss of 14 q/ 14 - varied according to site and histology. In particular, we showed that classic <b>ependymomas</b> from within the cranium and spine have distinct genetic profiles. Classic and anaplastic <b>ependymomas</b> with gain of 1 q tended to occur in the posterior fossa of children and to behave aggressively.
