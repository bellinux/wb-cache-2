5|$|The Little Mermaid was {{originally}} planned {{as part of}} one of Walt Disney's earliest feature films, a proposed package film featuring vignettes of <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen</b> tales. Development started soon after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in the late 1930s, but was delayed due to various circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Remembered {{above all}} for his fairy tales, <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen</b> {{was born in}} Odense in 1805. It is thought his birthplace is the small yellow house {{on the corner of}} Hans Jensens Stræde and Bangs Boder in the old town. In 1908 the house was opened as the <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen</b> Museum. It {{documents}} his life from his childhood years as the son of a struggling shoemaker, to his schooling, career as an author, and later life, with artefacts providing an insight into his acquaintances and adventures. Andersen's childhood home is on Munkemøllestræde not far from the cathedral. He lived in the little half-timbered house from the age of two until he was 14. Opened as a museum in 1930, the house contains an exhibition of the cobbling tools used by his father and other items based on Andersen's own descriptions.|$|E

5|$|Bellman {{has been}} {{translated}} into at least 20 languages, including English, most notably by Paul Britten Austin, and into German, for example by Hannes Wader. German Communist leader Karl Liebknecht liked Bellman's songs and translated some into German. <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen</b> {{was one of the}} first to translate Bellman into Danish. Bellman's songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic (by Bubbi), Italian, French, Finnish (for instance by Vesa-Matti Loiri), Russian, Chuvash and Yiddish.

5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{first began}} {{exploring}} a possible live action/animation biography film of author and poet <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen</b> sometime in late 1937 before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first feature-length hand-drawn animated film ever made. In March 1940, Walt Disney suggested a co-production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn, where Goldwyn's studio would shoot the live-action sequences of Andersen's life and Disney's studio would animate Andersen's fairy tales. The animated sequences {{would be based}} on some of Andersen's best known works, such as The Little Mermaid, The Little Match Girl, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, The Ugly Duckling, The Red Shoes, and The Emperor's New Clothes. However, the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow Queen, as it could not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow Queen character to modern audiences. Even {{as far back as the}} 1930s and 1940s, it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities, but the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic. After the United States entered World War II, the studio began to focus on making wartime propaganda, which caused development on the Disney–Goldwyn project to grind to a halt in 1942. Goldwyn went on to produce his own live-action film version in 1952, entitled <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen,</b> with Danny Kaye as Andersen, Charles Vidor directing, Moss Hart writing, and Frank Loesser penning the songs. All of Andersen's fairy tales were, instead, told in song and ballet in live-action, like the rest of the film. It went on to receive six Academy Award nominations the following year. Back at Disney, The Snow Queen, along with other Andersen fairy tales (including The Little Mermaid), were shelved.|$|E
5|$|Odense Municipality is the {{administrative}} unit which covers {{not only the}} city of Odense but surrounding suburbs and villages. Odense City Council consists of 29 members, including a mayor. The mayor of Odense, Anker Boye, {{is a member of}} the Social Democratic Party. His first term was from 1993 to 2005 when he was defeated by Jan Boye, a Conservative. He was re-elected in the 2009 election, forming a coalition with the Red–Green Alliance, the Socialist People's Party and the Social Democrats. The city council's motto is At lege er at leve (Playing is living) summarising a new approach addressing learning, innovation, development and growth with targets for 2017. Boye and his administration have been criticised for mismanaging the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen</b> in 2005, above all for allegedly signing a contract with Tina Turner for a show which resulted in a deficit of 13 million kroner.|$|E
5|$|The {{company also}} began a close working {{relationship}} with Ida Lupino of Four Star International. She starred in two suspense films with Robert Ryan—Nicholas Ray's On Dangerous Ground (1952, though shooting had been completed two years earlier) and Beware, My Lovely (1952), a coproduction between RKO and Lupino's company, The Filmakers. Of more historic note, Lupino was Hollywood's only female director during the period; of the five pictures The Filmakers made with RKO, Lupino directed three, including her now celebrated The Hitch-Hiker (1953). Exposing many moviegoers to Asian cinema for the first time, RKO distributed Akira Kurosawa's epochal Rashomon in the United States, sixteen months after its original 1950 Japanese release. The only smash hits released by RKO in the 1950s came out during this period, but neither was an in-house production: Goldwyn's <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen</b> (1952) was followed by Disney's Peter Pan (1953).|$|E
40|$|The {{essay is}} devoted to study of the <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen?s</b> fairy tales that were dramatized for {{presentation}} by Czech children theatre groups. It`s first part deals with the analysis of Andersen's fairy tale literary output, with regard to his narrative style and his contribution to the genre of fairy tale. Second {{part of the work}} analyzes the Swineherd story in terms of qualities, which it offers to children?s theater, and compares it with other stories dramatized for the same purpose. The final part discusses six dramatizations of Swineherd, which were staged with children groups, especially in terms of how to convert a literary narrator in theatrical form, and the influence of the nature of such conversion on the structure of the production and its characters. In respect to each of the scripts, the essay studies the extent to which their authors managed to preserve the genre and style of the original and what influence any shifts had on the transmission of the Swineherd `s message...|$|R
5000|$|Argyle {{had left}} London in 1933 {{to go to}} Paris, where she danced with George Balanchines {{short-lived}} company Les Ballets 1933, led by Tamara Toumanova and Tilly Losch. Back in London in 1934, she rejoined the Ballet Club and created {{the role of the}} barmaid in Ninette de Valoiss Bar aux Folies-Bergère, inspired by the famous painting by Édouard Manet. (This role was later taken by Elizabeth Schooling, who bore a remarkable resemblance to the girl in Manets painting.) As the Fille du Bar, Argyle shared the stage with Alicia Markova as the can-can dancer La Goulue and Frederick Ashton as her partner Valentin le désossé. Argyle also created the title role in Andrée Howards The Mermaid, based on <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersens</b> story [...] "The Little Mermaid," [...] which was her last new role for the Ballet Club. She also appeared in other ballets in the companys repertory, notably Les Sylphides and The Sleeping Beauty. In the latter, she {{is said to have been}} the first British ballerina to perform Marius Petipas choreography for the grand pas de deux in act 3.|$|R
50|$|Bruno Bettelheim observes in The Uses of Enchantment {{that the}} Ugly Duckling is not {{confronted with the}} tasks, tests, or trials of the typical fairy tale hero. “No need to {{accomplish}} anything is expressed in “The Ugly Duckling”. Things are simply fated and unfold accordingly, {{whether or not the}} hero takes some action.” In conjunction with Bettelheim’s assessment, Maria Tatar notes in ’’The Annotated <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> Andersen’’ that <b>Andersen</b> suggests the Ugly Duckling‘s superiority resides in {{the fact that he is}} of a breed different from the barnyard rabble, and that dignity and worth, moral and aesthetic superiority are determined by nature rather than accomplishment.|$|R
5|$|Most of Denmarks's major {{publishing}} {{houses are}} based in Copenhagen. These include the book publishers Gyldendal and Akademisk Forlag and newspaper publishers Berlingske and Politiken (the latter also publishing books). Many {{of the most important}} contributors to Danish literature such as <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen</b> (1805–1875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) and playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) spent much of their lives in Copenhagen. Novels set in Copenhagen include Baby (1973) by Kirsten Thorup, The Copenhagen Connection (1982) by Barbara Mertz, Number the Stars (1989) by Lois Lowry, Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (1992) and Borderliners (1993) by Peter Høeg, Music and Silence (1999) by Rose Tremain, The Danish Girl (2000) by David Ebershoff, and Sharpe's Prey (2001) by Bernard Cornwell. Michael Frayn's 1998 play Copenhagen about the meeting between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1941 is also set in the city. On 15–18 August 1973, an oral literature conference took place in Copenhagen as part of the 9th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the couple's {{popularity}} resulted in their being invited {{to set up a}} children's theater in line with the government's socialist restructuring policy. Her husband arranged for the theater in the Mamonovski Passage to be dedicated to puppet productions. By focusing on children's productions, the Efimovs avoided government pressure to perform communist-oriented themes. Simonovich-Efimova developed glove puppets and shadow puppets to re-enact fables and fairy tales based on the works of Krylov and <b>Hans</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Andersen.</b> They included adaptations of traditional themes such as the Mena stories, Baba Yaga, Shrovetide, and Nikolay Nekrasov's Peasant Children. In a second theater, they staged marionette productions. The Effimovs put on twenty shows per month for the next eight months, while simultaneously performing with their traveling theater. The theater in the Mamonovski Passage then closed, marking their last engagement in a permanent location. For the next six years, the couples' main means of support came from the traveling theater. Between 1916 and 1924, sometimes assisted by their son Adrian, the couple staged around 600 performances. They were able to help people forget the famines and violence of the times. Simonovich-Efimova performed in children's hospitals and mental asylums, contributing to her family's history of philanthropy.|$|E
