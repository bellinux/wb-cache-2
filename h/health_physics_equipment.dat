40|$|Radiation is {{used for}} many {{beneficial}} purposes to support this countryâ€™s energy, medical, and security needs. Radiation safety (health physics) {{is one of the}} science and engineering disciplines in which a shortfall of sufficiently trained and educated individuals is projected in this country in the near future. The Health Physics Society advocates for a substantial financial commitment by the Congress and federal agencies to support education of scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians (STEM 1), STEM educators, research associated with these programs (including <b>health</b> <b>physics),</b> <b>equipment</b> and supplies for STEM teaching in secondary schools, and scholarships and financial support to colleges and universities in STEM. This support is needed to ensure an adequate supply of qualified scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians and, specifically, radiation safety professionals. Health physics is the scientific discipline responsible for protecting humans and their environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation while providing for its beneficial uses. Health physics requires fundamental abilities in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and biology, with specialized training in radiation physics, radiation detection and measurement, radiochemistry, radiobiology, and other subdisciplines. Well-educated people in STEM and health physics are needed to meet growing needs in industry, government (Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, etc.), medicine...|$|E

40|$|A 1991 {{independent}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{audit of}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) identified {{the need for}} establishing a cross-connection control program for the potable and nonpotable water systems at the facility. An informal cross-connection policy had {{been in place for}} some time, but the formal implementation of a cross-connection program brought together individuals from the Quality Engineering and Inspection Section of the Office of Quality Programs and Inspection, Industrial Hygiene, <b>Health</b> <b>Physics,</b> Plant and <b>Equipment</b> Division, and the Atomic Trade and Labor Council. In January 1994 a Cross-Connection Control Committee was established at ORNL to identify potential and actual cross connections between potable and nonpotable water systems. Potable water is safe to drink, and nonpotable or process water (e. g., sewage, laboratory wastewater, cooling water, and tower water) is not intended for human consumption, washing of the body, or food preparation. The program is intended to conform with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act Amendment of 1986 and with state and local regulations. Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration addresses cross-connection functions, it does not define specific program requirements. The program at ORNL is designed to ensure that necessary recommendations are implemented to safeguard all internal and external potable water distribution lines. Program responsibilities include a thorough engineering assessment to (1) identify the potable water lines, (2) identify any existing or potential cross connections, and (3) inspect the integrity of the water lines. If any cross-connection deficiencies are found, corrective actions are initiated according to industry standards...|$|R
