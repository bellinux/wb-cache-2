5000|$|Roughing or Finishing: Different {{types of}} cutter are {{available}} for cutting away large amounts of material, leaving a poor surface finish (roughing), or removing a smaller amount of material, but leaving a good surface finish (finishing). A <b>roughing</b> <b>cutter</b> may have serrated teeth for breaking the chips of material into smaller pieces. These teeth leave a rough surface behind. A finishing cutter may have a large number (4 or more) teeth for removing material carefully. However, {{the large number of}} flutes leaves little room for efficient swarf removal, so they are less appropriate for removing large amounts of material.|$|R

During the primary transformation in wood industry, logs are faced with conical <b>rough</b> milling <b>cutters</b> commonly named slabber or canter heads. Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Numerical simulation of chip fragmentation can allow some useful chip thickness prediction. In this complex situation in wood cutting, the utilization of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is relevant. In this method, solids are modeled with spherical discrete elements linked by cohesive bonds. However the Discrete Element Method requires a previous calibration step with simple mechanical loading. For example the nature and the mechanical properties of the cohesive bonds must be determined. After an analysis of the different mechanical loadings in green wood milling, a complete study of green wood compression is carried out. This experimental study covers the strain rates range of 10 - 3 to 103 s- 1 using a hydraulic compression machine and the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar technique. Wood specimens at different moisture content states are compressed longitudinally. This study enables us to observe the viscoelastic and hygroscopic behaviour of wood. The experimental and qualitative simulation results show that elastic brittle beams are not well adapted to be used in quantitative green wood milling simulations.

Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Thus, this study aims at better understanding and predicting chips production in wood milling. The different mechanisms of their formation are studied through orthogonal cutting experiments at high cutting speed for beech and Douglas fir. Within these conditions, ejection of free water inside wood can be observed during fragmentation, particularly on beech. As previously seen in quasi-static experiments, chip thickness {{is proportional to the}} nominal cut thickness. Moreover, the grain orientation has a great influence on the cutting mechanisms, so as the nominal cut and the grows rings widths. This chip fragmentation study finally allows the improvement of the cutting conditions in rough milling. In order to optimize machine design as well as cutting geometry, a geometrical model of a generic slabber head is developed. This model allows the study of the effective cutting kinematics, the log-cutting edges interactions and the effective wood grain direction during cutting. This paper describes the great influence of the carriage position on cutting conditions. The results obtained here can be directly used by milling machine manufacturers.

50|$|There was {{a crew of}} two. The driver sat at {{the right}} front, behind a large cast double hatch and next to the {{combined}} gearbox and steering unit. Behind him was a round escape hatch {{in the bottom of}} the hull. Driving the vehicle was very hard work. The Hotchkiss lacked the Cleveland differential ("Cletrac") of its Renault competitor, and it responded unpredictably to direction adjustments. The brakes were little help in compensation: they were too weak, especially when driving down a slope. No less troublesome was the gearbox: it was difficult to engage the highest fifth gear and so the theoretical top speed of 27.8 km/h was rarely reached. There was one reverse <b>gear.</b> The inevitable <b>rough</b> handling of the tank by the driver resulted in much wear and tear. Mechanical reliability was poor.|$|R

However Schumann did not immediately return to the plane after the inspection, even after numerous attempts to recall him or even a threat to blow up the aircraft on the ground.

40|$|Micropitting is {{a contact}} {{initiated}} fatigue failure {{on the scale}} of surface roughness features that occurs in lubricated concentrated contacts which are subject to combined sliding and rolling motion. It is a significant problem in hardened and ground gears which, due to the surface roughness, operate in a micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication (micro-EHL) regime, causing cyclic loads as the roughness features interact. To gain a much clearer understanding of the failure mechanism that is associated with rough surface elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), a full theoretical model of the lubrication of <b>gear</b> contacts under <b>rough</b> surface and micro-EHL conditions is presented in this thesis. In addition, the study offers some important insights in to the influence of residual stresses on the fatigue life of rough surfaces. This significant residual stress, resulting from plastic deformation of rough surface asperities during the initial running-in process, has been instrumental in our understanding of the micropitting phenomenon. The Abaqus FEA package has been used to perform a full elastic-plastic contact analysis of real rough surfaces using profiles taken from the surfaces of unrun test disks, which are used in micropitting tests. The analysis provides a detailed view of the plastic deformation, and the magnitude and distribution of the residual stress fields at the asperity level. The residual geometry and stress field obtained over a range of applied loads are then used to introduce the residual stress in elastic fatigue calculations based on Micro-EHL simulations. Fatigue damage and fatigue life is then obtained at the scale of the surface roughness asperities by using multiaxial and variable amplitude fatigue models based on a critical plane approach. The results obtained allow the effects of the residual stress due to running-in to be quantified. The analysis method is also applied to test disk experiments to compare the predicted fatigue life with the observed onset of micropitting...|$|R
40|$|This keynote is {{a review}} of {{previous}} works on the measurement of the roughness, {{on the influence of}} roughness on the fatigue lifetime of gears, on an investigation. This presentation deals first with the development of measurement standard for three- dimensional roughness. This first work was done by A. Fabre, J. Vincenti (Arts et Métiers PArisTech, MSMP lab.) and S. Raynaud (INSA de Lyon). Using contact or non-contact facilities (contact stylus, confocal microprobe, interferometry), three-dimensional roughness is quantified by the calculation of pertinent parameters defined by the international standard EN ISO 25178 - 3 : 2010. The quantification of these specific parameters is required with a good accuracy because of the optimized design of parts. Roughness must be qualify and quantify with pertinent and sensible parameters in order to correctly define the capability and in consequence the integrity of the surface, for example in the contact zone on some mechanical parts. Previous investigations were published about the influence of measurement on particular parts [1, 2]. Contact and non-contact facilities, different conditions of measurement and different software of data treatment can influence the results. With the new international standards and the possibility to use non-contact apparatus to qualify normalized roughness, the impact of the instrumental choice on the results must be analysed. In continuity with the previous studies [1, 2], in this current study, a development of a measurement standard is conducted in order to qualify roughness by different apparatus. Roughness is characterized on this new standard with confocal, and interferometric apparatus and contact apparatus. Analysis of roughness parameters is investigated in order to detect the influence of different methods of measurement. On the other hand, because of the particular shape of the standard sample developed, measurements are qualified on different zones on the standard sample. It is corresponding to different angular positions of the surface measured with the reference of measurement. This analysis is conducted in order to qualify if the incidence of the position of the measured area is quite similar using different apparatus. The second part of this presentation deals with the influence of roughness on fatigue damage : the micropitting. This second work was done by A. Fabre, L. Barrallier, M. Desvignes (Arts et Métiers ParisTech, MSMP lab.) and H. P. Evans, K. J. Sharif (Cardiff University, Tribology and Contact Mechanics Group). Micropitting is considered to be fatigue damage induced by variation of mechanical loading close to the contact zone for example on gear teeth due to surface roughness effects. In order to improve fatigue lifetime, new superficial treatment can be investigated to achieve sufficiently high yield strength or endurance, but it must be developed with the associated control of surface roughness. Some studies that have been developed {{in order to create a}} model of the effect of real initial roughness on the damage mechanism are reported on scientific literature. In our first original study [3], a generic rough profile was developed. This parametric approach was followed in order to define the main geometrical parameters that affect the fatigue lifetime. The superficial loading was given for different values of roughness parameters on one rough surface sliding against a smooth surface. In complementary to this first study, the current study is conduced in the case of meshing of two rough teeth. Seven parameters are used to describe the microgeometry of the rough surface. The method is based on the model of surface loading given by two- dimensional approach with the elasto-hydrodynamic code developed by Holmes et. al. [4]. Using the plane strain hypothesis, an analytical model is developed to assess the sub-surface mechanical loading on the <b>rough</b> <b>gear</b> teeth in the contact zone [5]. The load history is obtained for materials points beneath the surface to a depth. The Crossland criterion is used to qualify the points where fatigue damage based on quenched and tempered 32 CrMoV 13 material properties. Furthermore, the influence of gaseous nitriding on this steel is investigated. The prediction of fatigue life is conducted taking into account the modification of the material properties due to this thermo-chemical treatment. The third part of this presentation deals with an investigation in order to characterize the damage induced by the running-in stage. This third work was done by A. Fabre, S. Jégou, L. Barrallier (Arts et Métiers ParisTech, MSMP lab.). This study is conducted in order to complete this previous study about the influence of roughness on surface fatigue damage taking the plastic deformation due to running-in into account. Moreover the damage concerning a large volume of material is difficult to correlate directly with a global physical variable. Directly linked with the local plastification of material, damage can be described with the notification of local changes in crystallites with the increase of dislocations. The peak of X-ray diffraction is sensible to the dislocation density [6] and to the structure of dislocations. Financement sur fonds propre...|$|R
