5|$|The city {{government}} {{is involved in}} the economic development process, helping firms grow and attracting new firms. A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some going into the Grand Forks Growth <b>Fund.</b> <b>Companies</b> can request low-interest loans or grants from this fund provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city's trade region. The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that receives funding from banks and other major businesses. The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they are suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} with mutual fund trading that cast market timing {{in a negative}} light occurred because the prospectuses written by the mutual <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> strictly forbid short-term trading. Despite this prohibition, special clients were allowed to do it anyway. So, the problem was not with the trading strategy but rather with the unethical and unfair implementation of that strategy, which permitted some investors to engage in it while excluding others. All of the world's greatest investors rely, to some extent, on market timing for their success. Whether they base their buy-sell decisions on fundamental analysis of the markets, technical analysis of individual companies, personal intuition, {{or all of the}} above, the ultimate reason for their success involves making the right trades at the right time. In most cases, those decisions involve extended periods of time and are based on buy-and-hold investment strategies. Value investing is a clear example, as the strategy is based on buying stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values and selling them when their value is recognized in the marketplace. Most value investors are known for their patience, as undervalued stocks often remain undervalued for significant periods of time.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{extended}} version of our earlier study (Abd. Majid and Maulana 2010) to further re-examine the relative efficiencies of selected Islamic and conventional mutual <b>funds</b> <b>companies</b> in Indonesia {{during the period}} 2004 to 2007 and their determinants. To measure their efficiencies, the output-input data consisting of a panel of conventional and Islamic mutual <b>funds</b> <b>companies</b> are empirically examined based on {{the most commonly used}} non-parametric approach, namely, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It also attempts to investigate the influence of the mutual funds companies’ characteristics on efficiency measures using the Generalized Least Square (GLS) estimation. The study finds that, on average, the Indonesian mutual <b>funds</b> <b>companies</b> experienced a decrease in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth. It is mainly caused by a decline in both efficiency and technical efficiencies, where the efficiency change is largely contributed by the changes in pure efficiency rather than scale efficiency. Additionally, the study also documents that the funds size negatively affects efficiency. This indicates that due to its diseconomies of scale, a larger mutual <b>funds</b> <b>company</b> is less efficient than a smaller <b>funds</b> <b>company.</b> Finally, in comparing the efficiency of the mutual <b>funds</b> <b>companies,</b> the study finds that, on average, the Islamic unit trust companies perform more poorly than their conventional counterparts...|$|R

In its review of AIC, investigators found no evidence of late trading and market timing activity by AIC staff. However, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) did find that over the 1999-2003 period, AIC permitted specific third party investors to engage in market timing trades in AIC Funds that generated profits of $127 million. [...] In the Settlement Agreement between AIC and the OSC, the OSC stated that [...] "Accordingly, the conduct of AIC in failing to protect fully {{the best interests of the}} Relevant Funds in respect of the frequent trading market timing was contrary to the public interest." [...] As a result, in December 2004, AIC Limited was forced to return CAD $58.8 million to affected investors, which was the largest penalty imposed on any of the <b>fund</b> <b>companies</b> in the OSC investigation.|$|E
