40|$|The chapter {{analyses}} key images which, although personal to the Welsh poet/painter David Jones's particular experiences, became conduits for {{his expression}} of universal themes that he explored though his painting and poetry {{in terms of}} his Welsh identity. Metamorphoses, characteristic of Celticity, and the evolving history and culture of Britain, accounted for his perception of the world as a natural phenomenon in a flux whereby mutuality and mutability oscillate between images and words. Rationale of the chapter: The essay positions David Jones as the leading exponent of uniting word and image. Unlike his fellow imagists, he created a synthesis of image and text, whereas the others’ paintings are largely responses to words which influence particular works, rather than images prompting poetry, as in <b>Jones’s</b> <b>case...</b>|$|R

500|$|The Court {{has heard}} several {{cases that have}} had {{a major impact on}} Indiana as well as others that have set {{nationwide}} precedents. The first of these cases, Lasselle v. State (1820), where the Court overturned a circuit court decision that tested slave ownership in the new state by stating [...] "the framers of our constitution intended a total and entire prohibition of slavery," [...] and resulted in all slaves in Indiana being freed. In the Fall Creek Massacre case (1823), State v. Hudson, the Court upheld a lower court's finding that crimes committed against Native Americans were punishable under American laws. This decision lead to the first execution of a white man for crimes against natives. In the Falkenburg v. <b>Jones</b> <b>case</b> (1889), Indiana became the first state to establish the right for a defendant to obtain court records free of charge. The 1909 case of Woessner v. Bullick established that the Court could invalidate a governor's veto if proper veto procedures were not followed, in effect ruling the pocket-veto as unconstitutional. In 1917 the state {{was among the first to}} adopt an Exclusionary rule, established in the case of Callendar v. State, which prevented illegally obtained evidence from be submitted in court. In William v. Smith, a case heard in 1921, the Court overturned Indiana's eugenics laws, the first of their kind in the nation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Jones's</b> last <b>case</b> was in 1942, when he {{teamed up}} with Thurgood Marshall of NAACP's Legal Defense Fund to sue the Little Rock School District to obtain equal pay for a black school teacher.

50|$|Thomas Hearne in his Curious Discourses prints a {{paper by}} Jones {{on the early}} Britons, read before the Society of Antiquaries in Elizabeth I's reign, and calls him a person of {{learning}} in British antiquities. <b>Jones's</b> ‘Reports of <b>Cases</b> from 18 James I to 15 Charles I’ appeared in 1675.|$|R
5000|$|Literary {{discussions of}} the {{expanding}} potential for women in English society date {{back at least to}} Maria Edgeworth's Belinda (1801) and Elizabeth Barrett's Aurora Leigh (1856), which explored a woman's plight between conventional marriage and the radical possibility that a woman could become an independent artist. In drama, the late nineteenth century saw such [...] "New Woman" [...] plays as Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879) and Hedda Gabler (1890), Henry Arthur <b>Jones's</b> play The <b>Case</b> of Rebellious Susan (1894) and George Bernard Shaw's controversial Mrs. Warren's Profession (1893) and Candida (1898). According to a joke by Max Beerbohm (1872-1956), [...] "The New Woman sprang fully armed from Ibsen's brain" [...] (an allusion to the birth of Athena).|$|R
500|$|Jones {{had been}} {{attracted}} to the Methodist faith because it advocated teetotalism and that the Indians must convert to the white settler lifestyle. [...] In June 1823, he attended a camp-meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Ancaster Township, along with his half-sister Mary. [...] The camp-meeting touched Jones, who converted there to Christianity. [...] At this time Reverend William Case saw the potential to convert the Mississauga Indians through <b>Jones.</b> <b>Case</b> soon {{assumed the role of}} a mentor to Jones as a missionary. [...] As Jones was bilingual and bicultural, he could speak to and relate to the Mississaugas and the white Christian settlers in Upper Canada. [...] Later that year, Reverend Alvin Torry set up a congregation centered around Jones and Chief Thomas Davis (Tehowagherengaraghkwen) composed entirely of Indian members. [...] The pair encouraged converted Indians to settle around Davis' home, which acquired the name [...] "Davis' Hamlet" [...] or [...] "Davisville". [...] Jones and Seth Crawford taught Sunday school for the growing community, which began building a chapel in the spring of 1824. [...] Many of Jones' relatives were quickly converted and moved to Davis' Hamlet, including his mother Tuhbenahneequay, her daughter Wechikiwekapawiqua and Chief Wageezhegome (Wegiizhigomi, [...] "Who Possesses the Day"), Wechikiwekapawiqua's husband and Jones' uncle Joseph Sawyer (Nawahjegezhegwabe (Nawajii-giizhigwabi, [...] "He who Rests Sitting upon the Sky")). [...] Jones received his first official position in the church [...] exhorter [...] on March 1, 1825. [...] In this role, he spoke at services after local preachers and assisted travelling preachers during their circuit rides. [...] Church officials including Torry and Case recognised the need for a member fluent in Ojibwe who could translate hymns and bible passages, and present the Christian religion to the Indians in terms they could understand. [...] Jones was put to work as a teacher at the Grand River mission. [...] Around this time he began speaking to groups about Methodism. [...] In 1824, a few of his relatives came to see him speak and stayed at the Grand River mission so they could enroll their children in Jones' day school. [...] The Methodists of Upper Canada commissioned Jones, along with his brother John, to begin translating religious and instructive works in Ojibwe for use in the Methodists' schools. [...] In 1825, over half his band had converted to Christianity, and Jones decided to devote his life to missionary work.|$|E
2500|$|After the Lewinsky scandal broke, Barr was {{the first}} lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation. During debate on the {{impeachment}} resolution on the House floor, Barr argued that Clinton's attempt to interfere with Lewinsky's testimony in the Paula <b>Jones</b> <b>case</b> endangered the Constitution. In doing so, Barr said, Clinton violated what Barr called a [...] "fundamental right" [...] of any American citizen – [...] "the unshakable right {{each one of us}} has to walk into a courtroom and demand the righting of a wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{a lengthy}} United Service Organizations (USO) {{tour in the}} Philippines, Jones fell ill in 1945, and was treated by a doctor who was still alive when Candy publicised her mind-control claims; Donald Bain gave this doctor the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Gilbert Jensen". According to researcher Martin Cannon, who interviewed Jones before she died in 1990, the [...] "Marshall Burger" [...] pseudonym in Bain's book who worked with Jensen on the <b>Jones</b> <b>case</b> was actually Dr. William S. Kroger, a psychologist at one time associated with UCLA.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in the Paula <b>Jones</b> <b>case</b> denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in the <b>Jones</b> <b>case.</b> Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to dry clean what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E
2500|$|Lewinsky {{confided in}} [...] Linda Tripp about her {{relationship}} with Clinton. Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean a semen-stained blue dress. Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them, which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr {{and bring them to}} the attention of people working on the Paula <b>Jones</b> <b>case.</b> In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of Newsweek) about the tapes.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1998, Tripp {{discovered}} that Lewinsky had sworn an affidavit in the Paula <b>Jones</b> <b>case,</b> denying {{a relationship with}} Clinton. She delivered tapes to Kenneth Starr, the Independent Counsel who was investigating Clinton on other matters, including the Whitewater scandal, the White House FBI files controversy, and the White House travel office controversy. During the grand jury testimony, Clinton's responses were carefully worded, and he argued, [...] "It {{depends on what the}} meaning of the word 'is' is," [...] with regard to the truthfulness of his statement that [...] "there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the {{deposition}} in the <b>Jones</b> <b>case,</b> Clinton was asked, [...] "Have {{you ever had}} sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit1, as modified by the Court?" [...] The definition included contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of a person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of that person, any contact of the genitals or anus of another person, or contact of one's genitals or anus and any part of another person's body either directly or through clothing. The judge ordered that Clinton be {{given an opportunity to}} review the agreed definition. Clinton flatly denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Later, at the Starr grand jury, Clinton stated that he believed the definition of [...] "sexual relations" [...] agreed upon for the Jones deposition excluded his receiving oral sex.|$|E
2500|$|The Lewinsky scandal was an American {{political}} {{sex scandal}} that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The sexual relationship {{took place between}} 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998. Clinton ended a televised speech {{with the statement that}} he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky. [...] Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial. Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula <b>Jones</b> <b>case</b> regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{had also}} said, [...] "there {{is not a}} sexual relationship, an {{improper}} sexual relationship or {{any other kind of}} improper relationship" [...] which he defended as truthful on August 17, 1998 because of his use of the present tense, famously arguing [...] "it depends on what {{the meaning of the word}} 'is' is" [...] (i.e., he was not, at the time he made that statement, still in a sexual relationship with Lewinsky). Under pressure from Starr, who had obtained from Lewinsky a blue dress with Clinton's semen stain, as well as testimony from Lewinsky that the President had inserted a cigar tube into her vagina, Clinton stated, [...] "I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate." [...] Clinton denied having committed perjury because, according to Clinton, the legal definition of oral sex was not encompassed by [...] "sex" [...] per se. In addition, relying upon the definition of [...] "sexual relations" [...] as proposed by the prosecution and agreed by the defense and by Judge Susan Webber Wright, who was hearing the Paula <b>Jones</b> <b>case,</b> Clinton claimed that because certain acts were performed on him, not by him, he did not engage in sexual relations. Lewinsky's testimony to the Starr Commission, however, contradicted Clinton's claim of being totally passive in their encounters.|$|E
