5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> to mediate discussions {{between them and the}} management of the business. On October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to mediate. To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem and said no attempt at unionizing was being made. They insisted that only a small minority of workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> claimed that had their offer of mediation been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Tankersley {{created an}} {{apprenticeship}} program to train people both for work as employees at her ranch and for positions {{elsewhere in the}} horse industry.

5|$|At {{the request}} of federal {{authorities}} before sentencing, Vick agreed to deposit nearly $1 million in an escrow account with attorneys to reimburse others for the costs of caring for the confiscated dogs, {{most of which were}} being offered for adoption on a selective basis under supervision of a court-appointed specialist.

During the administration of his bankruptcy case, the U.S. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owned.|$|E

In the latter position he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky, Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the United States Bullion Depository. When the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back President Wilson and supported the League of Nations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that {{they would need to}} relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|The United States <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> filed another {{lawsuit in}} federal {{district}} court in Newport News on March 25, 2009, alleging Vick and others violated federal employee benefits laws by withdrawing $1.35 million from a retirement plan sponsored by MV7, one of Vick's companies. The money was held in trust under pension laws to fund retirement plans for nine MV7 employees. The Labor Department simultaneously filed a complaint in federal bankruptcy court to prevent Vick from discharging his alleged debt to the MV7 pension plan. The complaint alleged {{that some of the}} funds were used to pay restitution ordered in his dogfighting case.|$|E

5|$|The Department of Treasury has had {{the most}} {{foreign-born}} Secretaries, with five. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> and Interior follow with three, and the departments of Housing and Urban Development and State have each had two. Former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright were the highest-ranking foreign-born Cabinet members ever in accordance to the United States presidential line of succession. The majority of foreign-born Cabinet members were born in Europe. Most European-born Cabinet members originated from the United Kingdom and Germany with five and four respectively, {{and the others were}} born in Ireland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and Italy. Four Cabinet members were born in the Americas, and one was born in Asia. The departments of Defense, Justice, Health and Human Services, Energy, Education, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security have not had foreign-born Secretaries.|$|E
5|$|Towns {{around the}} forest, {{including}} Stanley, Ketchum, and Sawtooth City, were founded as mining {{towns in the}} latter part of the 19thcentury by prospectors and trappers, including Civil War veteran Captain John Stanley, after whom the town of Stanley is named. Ketchum is named after the trapper and guide David Ketchum, while the Sublett Mountains are named after trapper William Sublette, who lived in the area in the 1830s. Most of the logging in the region was for firewood and timber for miners and homesteaders. For much of the 20thcentury, sheep and cattle grazing were the primary large-scale land uses of the forest. Sheep drives were common in the Wood River Valley after the mining boom and shepherds from southern Idaho drove their flocks north to graze the upper elevation areas in Sawtooth National Forest. The original sheepherders were Basque Americans, while today many of the sheepherders are Peruvians contracted through the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Polish culture {{persisted in}} {{underground}} education, publications, even theater. The Polish Underground State created a Department of Education and Culture (under Stanisław Lorentz) which, {{along with a}} <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> and Social Welfare (under Jan Stanisław Jankowski and, later, Stefan Mateja) and a Department for Elimination of the Effects of War (under Antoni Olszewski and Bronisław Domosławski), became underground patrons of Polish culture. These Departments oversaw efforts to save from looting and destruction works of art in state and private collections (most notably, the giant paintings by Jan Matejko that were concealed throughout the war). They compiled reports on looted and destroyed works and provided artists and scholars with means to continue their work and their publications and to support their families. Thus, they sponsored the underground publication (bibuła) of works by Winston Churchill and Arkady Fiedler and of 10,000copies of a Polish primary-school primer and commissioned artists to create resistance artwork (which was then disseminated by Operation N and like activities). Also occasionally sponsored were secret art exhibitions, theater performances and concerts.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to claims of bias, researchers and investigators have {{found evidence of}} fraud. In 1995, the state of Oklahoma conducted {{an investigation into the}} WHD-provided prevailing wages being used in state projects. Oklahoma had a Little Davis-Bacon law that, in an attempt to save on administrative costs, adopted the federal standards. When the state office was notified that some rates had increased 162%, it requested information from the WHD. The WHD denied the Oklahoma <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> access to the survey forms used to determine the wages, so the Oklahoma <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> undertook a criminal investigation. According to Brenda Reneau, then-Commissioner of the Oklahoma <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor,</b> “This investigation found that grossly inaccurate information had been reported to the Federal Government by what the U.S. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> calls interested third parties. We found inflated numbers of employees on projects, inflated wage rates reported for these same non-existent workers and we found projects that were never built. We also noticed {{what appears to be a}} pattern in the reporting method on many of the wage survey forms, as our visual presentation will show here today.” In response to this, “a follow-up investigation conducted by the U.S. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> confirms that not only was a great deal of inaccurate information reported, as we had alleged, but U.S. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> documents show certain unions in Oklahoma City as the parties who submitted that information. It appears that false information may have been submitted to the U.S. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> in an attempt, purposefully, to inflate Davis-Bacon wage rates.” In the wake of the state investigations, the WHD withdrew many prevailing wage findings for the state, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court found their Little Davis–Bacon statute to be in violation of the state constitution.|$|E
