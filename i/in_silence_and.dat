5|$|The lay {{attendees}} at Tinh Xa Trung Tam {{are predominantly}} female by {{a ratio of}} around 5 to 1, {{and most of the}} temple-goers are over 40. Most of the younger lay disciples are relatives of regular, older attendees. In addition to local residents, who make up the bulk of the disciples, some are from other parts of Vietnam, as well as overseas Vietnamese who are temporarily in the country. According to the American professor of Vietnamese history and religion Mark W. McLeod, who did fieldwork at Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm, he did not survey the laypeople about their income, for fear of embarrassing them, but conjectured that most had an above average income as they were able to devote a considerable amount of time to organized religious activity instead of working longer hours. A regular occurrence at the temple is the weekly Bát Quan Trai Giới (Eight Precepts Ritual). As part of this, the participants take on three additional vows apart from the Five Precepts and stay at the temple for a 24-hour period. These vows prohibit adornments such as makeup and jewellery, the use of comfortable beds and chairs, and eating impurely. During the retreat day, meals are taken <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>and</b> talking is avoided, apart from during dharma talks, sutra chanting and religious debate. Meditation is also a part of the routine. Tinh Xa Trung Tam holds the Eight Precepts Ritual more often than any other institution in the city; the next most frequent temple holds the retreat once every two weeks. Dharma talks are held weekly by the resident monks and nuns, which is generally more frequent than at other places in the city. The disciples and monks at the temple told McLeod that they chose Tinh Xa Trung Tam because of what they regarded as a higher level of discipline, rigor and scholarship at the institution. The monks are transported by their disciples as they are forbidden to drive.|$|E

Then, the priest lights a single candle from the eternal flame on the altar (which is never extinguished). The light is spread {{from person to person}} until everyone holds a lighted candle.|$|E

25|$|Cameron, meanwhile, was {{attracting}} sharp {{criticism from}} both the colonist press and Grey himself {{about the lack of}} progress in the eight weeks since Ngaruawahia's capture. Finally, on the night of 20 February, he set out on the narrow bush track to bypass Paterangi with 1230 men led by one of his guides and the Forest Rangers, leaving a large masking force in front of Paterangi. The force marched through rough bush <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>and</b> complete darkness, passing within 1500 metres of the Paterangi pā without detection and arriving in Te Awamutu at dawn. They advanced to the town of Rangiaowhia, where they encountered about 100 men as well as many women and children. Many of the village's residents retreated to their raupo huts and one of the village's two churches and opened fire, while others gathered in the second church to surrender. The Rangers began advancing through the village, exchanging fire with their foe, hidden in their homes. About a dozen homes were set alight—either accidentally or intentionally—adding to the Māori toll. The British claimed they killed 12 Māori, including two chiefs, and took 30 prisoners. Their own losses totaled five, including several officers.|$|E

[...] Speaking of her meeting with Waddle, Terata stated, [...] "I am first and foremost the family member of a victim and Mr. Waddle is first and foremost a victimizer. But when I saw Mr. Waddle as a person who was crying and apologizing, I thought he was apologizing from the heart." ...|$|E

He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. [...] The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. [...] The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a [...] "thing of evil" [...] and a [...] "prophet". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical [...] "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the [...] "Plutonian shore"—but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven [...] "still is sitting" [...] on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted [...] "Nevermore".|$|E

500|$|Both the King and Queen were fond {{of their}} niece, Princess Victoria of Kent. Their {{attempts}} {{to forge a}} close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the Duchess of Kent, the young princess' widowed mother. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. He said, [...] "I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not {{in the hands of a}} person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed." [...] The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears, while her mother sat <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>and</b> was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner (the two left the next day). William's outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria's tempered view of him as [...] "a good old man, though eccentric and singular". William survived, though mortally ill, to the month after Victoria's coming of age. [...] "Poor old man!", Victoria wrote as he was dying, [...] "I feel sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because Grossman was {{committed}} to commercial success for his clients, and was frequently surrounded by socialist enthusiasts of the American folk-music revival, his manner could generate hostility.
