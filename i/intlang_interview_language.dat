Data from the 2003 California Health Interview Survey were used to study the sample of 4, 170 US-born and foreign-born Asians by acculturation indicators. We performed t-tests to compare differences in demographics, health status and behaviors, and access to care between the foreign-born and US-born Asians, and between various classifications within foreign-born and the US-born Asian group. Our results showed that foreign-born Asians who interviewed in English more closely resembled US-born Asians than foreign-born Asians who <b>interviewed</b> in <b>languages</b> other than English. Compared to <b>interview</b> <b>language,</b> dichotomizing the sample by other acculturation indicators showed smaller differences between the divided groups. <b>Interview</b> <b>language</b> {{may serve as a}} better measure for acculturation especially among foreign-born populations with a high proportion of limited English proficiency.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the predictors of self-rated health status for Texas adults using the current 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. Self-rated health is generally accepted as a valid measure of health status in population studies, and understanding its correlates may help public health professionals prioritize health-promotion and disease-prevention interventions. MethodsThe two research questions addressed by this study involved the predictors of self-rated health: 1) "Do demographic characteristics, health care coverage, leisure-time physical activity, and body mass index predict self-rated health status for Texas residents aged 18 to 64 years?" and 2) "Does choice of <b>interview</b> <b>language</b> (English vs Spanish) predict self-rated health status for Texas residents of Hispanic ethnicity aged 18 to 64 years?" Key analysis variables were identified, and descriptive statistics were used to describe the major variables and determine whether the number of respondents for each variable was sufficient for analysis. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the variables. ResultsMultiple logistic regression analysis (controlling for diabetes and arthritis) of the self-rated health predictors indicated that older age, lack of health care coverage, lack of a college education, being Hispanic, having a lower income, obesity, and not exercising explained 19. 4 % of the variance of fair and poor self-rated health. The <b>interview</b> <b>language</b> (English or Spanish), age, sex, education, income, obesity, health insurance coverage, and physical activity (controlling for chronic illness) explained 22. 8 % of the variance in fair and poor self-rated health for Hispanic respondents. ConclusionThe results of this study suggest that a college education, a lower body mass index, non-Hispanic ethnicity, and participation in physical activity are associated with good, very good, or excellent self-rated health status. The finding that the <b>interview</b> <b>language</b> significantly predicted fair and poor self-rated health substantiates previous research and emphasizes the importance of culturally sensitive approaches to health care services...|$|R

ObjectiveTo examine the racial and ethnic differences in reported dietary practices among the largest minority groups of California children. MethodsData from the 2007 and 2009 California Health Interview Survey were analyzed using multivariate regression with survey weights to examine how race, ethnicity, socio-demographics, and child factors were associated with specific dietary practices. ResultsThe sample included 15, 902 children ages 2 - 11. In multivariate regressions, substantial differences in fruit juice, fruit, vegetable, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, and fast food consumption were found among the major {{racial and ethnic groups}} of children. Asians regardless of <b>interview</b> <b>language</b> were more likely than Whites to have low vegetable intake (Asians English interview OR, 1. 20; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 43; Asians non-English-interview OR, 2. 09; 95 % CI, 1. 23 - 3. 57) and low fruit (Asians English interview OR, 1. 69; 95 % CI, 1. 41 - 2. 03; Asians non-English interview OR, 3. 04; 95 % CI, 2. 00 - 4. 62) consumption. Latinos regardless of <b>interview</b> <b>language</b> were also more likely than Whites to have high fruit juice (Latinos English interview OR, 1. 54; 95 % CI and 1. 28 - 1. 84; Latinos non-English interview OR, 1. 29; 95 % 1. 02 - 1. 62) and fast food (Latinos English interview OR 1. 74; 95 % CI, 1. 46 - 2. 08 2. 16; Latinos non-English interview OR 1. 48; 95 % CI, 1. 16 - 1. 91) consumption; but Latinos were less likely than Whites to consume sweets (Latinos English interview OR, 0. 81; 95 % CI, 0. 66 - 0. 99; Latinos non-English interview OR, 0. 56; 95 % CI 1. 16 - 1. 91). ConclusionsSignificant racial and ethnic differences exist in the dietary practices of California children. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption appears to be associated with parental education but not income. Our findings suggest that anticipatory guidance and dietary counseling might benefit from tailoring to specific ethnic groups to potentially address disparities in overweight and obesity.

The proportion of infants ever breast-fed increased sub-stantially in recent years. Weighted proportions were 30. 7 % for 1970 - 1974, 38. 1 % for 1975 - 1978, and 47. 6 % for 1979 - 1982. By use oflogistic regression models, children born into house-holds with a college-educated head were shown to be more likely to be breast-fed than were other children; breast-feeding was also positively associated with birth weight. Infants in house-holds for which the preferred <b>interview</b> <b>language</b> was Spanish {{were more likely to be}} breast-fed than were infants living in households for which the interview was conducted in English. Analysis of the factors influencing the distribution of weaning times among infants was less definitive because reported weaning times are heaped on multiples of 3 mo.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} {{studies have shown that}} discrimination contributes to poorer mental health, the precise mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. In this paper, we consider the possibility that the association between day-to-day discrimination (being disrespected, insulted, and harassed) and depressive symptoms is partially mediated by religious struggles (religious doubts and negative religious coping). To test our mediation model, we use data collected from the 2011 Miami-Dade Health Survey (n = 444) to estimate a series of multiple regression models assessing associations among day-to-day discrimination, religious struggles, and depressive symptoms. We find that day-to-day discrimination is positively associated with religious struggles and depressive symptoms, net of adjustments for general religious involvement, age, gender, race, ethnicity, immigrant status, <b>interview</b> <b>language,</b> education, employment, household income, financial strain, and marital status. We also observe that religious struggles are positively associated with depressive symptoms. Our mediation analyses confirm that day-to-day discrimination can contribute to depressive symptoms by stirring religious struggles. Our key finding is that religious struggles may serve as a maladaptive coping response to discrimination.
