40|$|Having {{reviewed}} {{the analysis of}} Fula crude oil prior to desalting treatment, {{it was observed that}} the crude has high density of 936. 2 kg/m 3 at 15 o C, high viscosity of 69. 42 mm 2 /s at 100 oC and high calcium content of 1287 ppm (table(2. 1)). On the other hand it was observed that the calcium content after <b>electrical</b> <b>desalting</b> was also high amounting up to 307 ppm((table (2. 3)). The high calcium content affects the price and the environmental specifications. Inefficient separation process of salts causes serious problems such as discount of oil price, corrosion risks at the distillation columns, catalytic poisoning, formation of scale deposits in pipes and heat - exchangers. Although the <b>electrical</b> <b>desalting</b> treatment is very efficient for dehydration of crude, the efficiency of such device for calcium separation was low. Equipment other than the <b>electrical</b> <b>desalting</b> unit were reviewed, and it was found that a mixer – settler type of contactors was quite suitable and might improve the efficiency of calcium separation. A Preliminary investigation was undertaken to investigate the factors of temperature, dilution ratio, water to oil ratio, time and speed of agitation on the fluid properties mainly the density and viscosity. From the preliminary study the range of the low and high levels of the above mentioned factors were (90 - 120 oC, 5 - 30 %, 10 - 80 %, 5 - 20 minutes and 300 - 400 rpm) respectively. Once determining the range of the above mentioned parameters, factorial experiments were designed to investigate the effects of these parameters on dehydration and salt separation. 9 One set of the experiments were carried out {{with the addition of a}} demulsifier and the other set was carried out without any addition as shown in tables (4. 12) and (4. 13). These experiments showed that the demulsifier had improved the dehydration and settlement, but in both sets of factorial experiments no improvement was observed on calcium separation. This was because the calcium was fixed to the crude in form of calcium naphthanate which was difficult to remove. Hence, it was decided to use acetic acid as a decalcinizing agent, as the acetic acid has the ability to break this fixation. Various concentrations of the decalcinizer were studied, the results showed that the concentration level at 0. 8 % and pH level of 5 improved the calcium removal, table(4. 19). Having specified the levels of all factors as well the concentrations of the demulsifier and the decalcinizer, a controlled experiment was carried out to determine the number of actual stages required to remove the calcium content up to 98. 0 ppm. A mixer – settler contactor was designed at the same levels taking the input rate of the desalter of Khartoum refinery, the dimensions of the mixer-settler were shown in tables(4. 22) and (4. 23). In conclusion a mixer –settler is recommended to be used for desalting of Fula crude due to its high separation efficiency of calcium and its low cost...|$|E
