[...] For the mandibular arch, this function is provided primarily by the buccal shelf, a region extending laterally from the back or posterior ridges, and by the pear-shaped pad (the most posterior area of keratinized gingival formed by the scaling down of the retro-molar papilla after the extraction of the last molar tooth). Secondary support for the complete mandibular denture {{is provided by the}} alveolar ridge crest. The maxillary arch receives primary support from the horizontal hard palate and the posterior alveolar ridge crest. [...] The larger the denture flanges (that part of the denture that extends into the vestibule), the better the stability (another parameter to assess fit of a complete denture). [...] Long flanges beyond the functional depth of the sulcus are a common error in <b>denture</b> <b>construction,</b> often (but not always) leading to movement in function, and ulcerations (denture sore spots).|$|E

The study of these elements was conducted in oral fluid and dental deposits and removable denture bases. Correlations between the level of oral hygiene and contents of chemical elements in oral fluid of people with removable dentures were found. With the increase in Ca / Mg, Ca / P, Ca / P / Mg ratios, the risk of stone formation was still observed in patients with “good” and “satisfactory” integral index of oral hygiene. The tendency {{to the formation of}} dental deposits is caused by the redistribution of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and their correlations, as well as zinc ions content in the different environments of the oral cavity in people with removable dentures. On the basis of correlation connection between the concentration of magnesium and zinc ions in oral fluid in people who use removable <b>dentures</b> <b>constructions,</b> and values of integral index of oral hygiene (r = 0. 53, r = 0. 72), we can claim the existence of inhibition mechanisms in stone formation processes in the mouth.

40|$|Introduction. Double {{telescopic}} crowns are {{connecting elements}} of partial dentures and {{are considered to}} be prosthetic devices of high aesthetic and biological value. Their basic drawback is the assessment of retention force value which has to be strong enough to balance the opposite forces but, nevertheless, must not result in harming the periodontal tissue of retention teeth while taking the denture off. The retention force is the highest immediately after the <b>denture's</b> <b>construction</b> and is progressively declining {{until the end of the}} 'settling in phase', i. e. until the retention force value becomes well-established. Aim of the study was the measurement of the overall retention force of completed telescopic dentures and a survey of 'settling in phase' duration. Methods. The measuring was conducted on 20 telescopic dentures consisting of 2, 3 or 4 telescopic crowns made of gold alloy type IV and executed by dynamometer. Results. An optimal retention force was detected in only 37 % of telescopic dentures. An insufficient retention force was observed in 16 %, while in the remaining 47 % an excessive force was detected. In the largest number of dentures (35 %) the settling in phase began after 33 cycles, which shows that this phase takes on average 10, 6 days. Conclusion.

40|$|Changes in {{the oral}} cavity {{resulting}} {{from the loss of}} teeth and the ensuing reconstruction of a set of teeth by dentures (partial or complete) may cause changes in the speech and voice of the patient. The aim of the present investigation was to study the changes in speech and voice in patients suffering from teeth loss and the degree of speech improvement using dentures. Voice and speech parameters of a set of tested syllables were analysed in 10 patients at the 2 nd Clinic of Stomatology. The analysis was carried out by means of an FFT, SoundForge 5. 0 programme. Differently expressed acoustic changes in both consonants and vowels were ascertained in a percentage of the patients under examination. These concerned especially the sibilant (“s”, “š”), labiodental (“f”, “v”) and vibrating (“r”, “ř”) consonants. Changes in the FFT spectrum and air leakage in constrictive consonants were also found. In some patients the vowels, especially the closed ones (“i”, “u”), may change their fundamental frequency and show noise admixture manifested as a blurred delimitation of the formants. A denture should, inter alia, render it possible for the patient to produce the same articulation to which he/she had been accustomed before the loss of teeth. For the construction of dentures the most important factors from a phonetic point of view appear to be the following: overbite, overjet, the height of the plate, the thickness of the palatal material, the incisor position, and the modelling of the ruga palatina on the hard palate. In case of wrong <b>denture</b> <b>construction</b> the acoustic changes may continue, resulting in the patient’s stress load dependent upon sex, age, psychic condition and seriousness of the problem...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) It is {{generally}} agreed that the most troublesome procedure during the fabrication of complete dentures is the measurement of the Vertical Dimension at rest. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the reliability and validity of a new instrument called the Facial Anthropological Device (FAD). The measurements recorded were compared to the Willis gauge (being the gold standard) and dividers, which are mechanical aids used to quantify lower third facial height during <b>denture</b> <b>construction.</b> This thesis presents data on 35 edentulous and 35 dentate patients in the age range of 30 to 70 years, who presented at the University of the Western Cape Dental faculty. The FAD incorporates a ‘spirit‐level’ and uses more anatomical landmarks than any other measuring device noted in the literature. It measures facial landmarks in the midline and is not only used to measure the vertical dimension of the face, but with further research, may also be used in forensic studies. The Willis gauge is designed to measure the distance from the lower border of the septum of the nose to the lower border of the chin, and the distance from the outer canthus of the eye to the corner of the relaxed lip with the teeth in occlusion. The dividers measures two arbitrary points on the face. The study showed that the FAD was most similar to the Willis gauge where reliability and reproducibility was compared. There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0. 05) between the two devices. The FAD has shown to be a reliable and valid instrument that could be used to measure facial vertical dimension in the edentulous as well as dentate patients, however with some modifications to its design...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Infection {{control is}} an {{integral}} part of dentistry and dental impressions are considered an important issue in cross contamination. The aim of this study was to investigate the dimensional stability of two irreversible hydrocolloid materials, Alginoplast and Iralgin after disinfection with 5. 2 % sodium hypochlorite, used with immersion and spraying methods. Material and Methods: In this experimental study, impressions were made of a master mandibular arch (Typodont) containing three stainless steel inserts on the occlucal surface of both mandibular first molars and in the lingual surface of the mandibular central incisors, which served as reference marks for making measurements. Two types of irreversible hydrocolloid (Iralgin and Alginoplast) were tested. 5. 2 % sodium hypochlorite was used in two methods of spraying and immersion to disinfect the samples. The control group was not disinfected. Casts were made of type III gypsum. Stone casts were measured with a Nikon profile projector. Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Witney test were used for statistical analysis using p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: Casts prepared from Alginoplast disinfected by spraying method, were 0. 38 % larger in anteroposterior and 0. 06 % smaller in cross arch dimensions, whereas those prepared from Alginoplast immersed in hypochlorite were 0. 47 % larger in anteroposterior and 0. 11 % smaller in cross arch dimensions. Casts made from Iralgin were smaller after both methods of disinfecting, (0. 01 % smaller in anteroposterior and 0. 001 % smaller in cross-arch dimensions after spraying and 0. 04 % smaller in anteroposterior and 0. 03 % smaller in cross-arch dimensions after immersing in sodium hypochlorite). Conclusion: Alginoplast and Iralgin impressions can be immersed or sprayed for disinfection without compromising the accuracy needed for diagnostic and opposing casts, as well as removable partial <b>denture</b> <b>construction...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to re-examine Leon Williams {{geometric}} theory and to find the degree of correspondence between the face and the tooth form in the population of Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two thousand individuals with intact frontal teeth, in age between 17 and 24 years, were measured for 3 horizontal distances on the face: temporal width (Ft-Ft), zygomatic width (Zyg-Zyg) and gonial width (Go-Go) and for 3 horizontal distances on the both upper incisors: cervical width (CW), contact point width (CPW) and incisal width (IW). The length of the face (Tr-Gn) as well as the length of the central maxillary incisors were also measured. The results revealed: 1. Men had significantly larger dimensions for all facial and tooth dimensions (p 0. 05); the left and the right central incisors were of identical dimensions and forms (p > 0. 05). 2. The width of upper central incisors were smaller approximately 1. 5 mm than in west Europeans. 3. Upon the relation between the 3 horizontal dimensions measured on the face and upper maxillary incisor, 11 facial forms and 10 upper central tooth forms could be recognised in the study population, but 98 % of the population had only 3 tooth and face forms. Face shapes: oval face – 83. 3 %, square-tapered face – 9. 2 % and tapered face – 7 %; tooth forms: tapered-square incisor – 53 %, oval incisor – 30 %, tappered incisor – 16 %. 4. Reversed and enlarged tooth form was in line associated with the facial form in only 30 %, while the most common combination was of the oval face form and the tapered-square central incisor (45 %). 5. These results disapprove William’s theory and may be helpful for the choice of artificial teeth in complete <b>denture</b> <b>construction</b> and the dental industry...|$|E
40|$|An {{historical}} {{overview of}} the methods used to aid artificial tooth selection was undertaken. This showed that no universally reliable method has been found for determining tooth form. It also revealed that the aesthetic outcome of complete <b>denture</b> <b>construction</b> has received little attention in the dental literature, although some surveys {{have focused on the}} perception of aesthetic dentistry in relation to dentures (Brisman, 1980; McCord et al., 1994; Hyde et al., 1999). Sellen et al. (2001, 2002) carried out two studies to assess the ability of dental undergraduates and dental school staff to choose appropriate artificial teeth when prescribing complete dentures. From these studies it was concluded that there was a need for improved training and guidance on artificial tooth selection and arrangement. The studies of Sellen et al. (2001, 2002) have been the springboard for this particular study to assess the variation of choice made by general dental practitioners, final year dental students and fine art students when it comes to choosing appropriate artificial teeth for the age and gender of the denture wearer. Aims and objectives Central to the study was to determine if any significant differences, in choices made, exist between the three groups of participants. It was also important to determine if any significant preferences exist when different moulds and arrangements of teeth were considered for different age groups and genders of individuals. Finally, determining if an obvious need for improved training and guidance, in this area of dentistry, was needed. Methods and materials Photographs of six subjects representing youth, middle age and old age for both genders were produced for the study along with two three-dimensional aesthetic guides. Using the guides, 40 general dental practitioners, 40 final year dental students and 40 fine art students were each asked to select the teeth that they would use to construct a denture for the subjects detailed in the photographs. Results Data analysis showed that there were no relevant, significant differences in tooth or arrangement choice between the three groups. Similar trends in tooth and arrangement choice were shown when testing for significance within the individual groups. There was a highly significant association for all three groups between the subject and tooth size, with a tendency to choose large teeth for males and smaller teeth for females. There was also a highly significant association for all three groups between the age of the subjects and the age arrangement, with a tendency to choose arrangements indicative of youth for young subjects and arrangements indicative of old age for old subjects. No significant associations were found within the groups surveyed when choosing a tooth shape or gender arrangement. Discussion Certain trends within all three groups of participants, with regards tooth size and age arrangement, may suggest that an obvious training need does not exist. Inconsistent choices with regards gender arrangement and tooth shape may be as a result of factors which are too subtle to perceive and not necessarily because of inadequate training. Subsequently, it may be argued that, tooth shape and gender arrangement are less important than other aesthetic factors. The idea that a reliable method of selecting artificial anterior teeth exists has lessened as this study has progressed and with it the idea of providing specific training in this area of dentistry. Making assumptions about what may exist in the natural dentition and rigidly trying to impose this in a clinical setting may increase the likelihood of failure. Attempting to instil a strong perception of an individualised approach to <b>denture</b> <b>construction</b> may make the process more difficult if patient perceptions are generally different. Building an understanding of the methods used for tooth selection over the years can help provide dentists with a starting point and allow them to develop their own selection methods in combination with patients’ preferences...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{outcomes}} of treatment and patient’s satisfaction with removable partial dentures in adult Croatian population. Therefore patient’s satisfaction with their partial dentures in relation to some socio-economic variables was studied. Patient’s satisfaction with denture retention, speech, aesthetics, comfort of wearing dentures, chewing ability was also studied in relation to different denture classification, construction, material, denture base shape (major connectors), denture support and the number of missing teeth. A total of 165 patients, 59 males and 105 females between 38 and 87 years took part in this study. A questionnaire, devised for a purpose of the study, was divided into three parts. In the first part, patients answered questions about age, gender, marital status, education, general health, socio-economic status, self-supporting life, period of tooth loss and number of previous denture experiences and in the second part, patients graded their partial dentures, depending on the level of satisfaction, by using a scale from 1 to 5. In the third part a dentist determined Kennedy classification and their modifications, denture material and denture support, denture base shape and the number of missing teeth and graded a <b>denture</b> <b>construction.</b> Influence of these factors on patient’s satisfaction was analyzed. A majority of the examined patients were satisfied with the partial prosthesis, but a small amount of dissatisfaction existed. More then half of them scored all the examined parameters to the best score category. Considering chewing with lower partial dentures, women were more satisfied than men (p < 0. 05). Patients with more missing teeth gave lower grades for the comfort of wearing dentures (p< 0. 05). Patients of higher education gave lower grades (p< 0. 05) for the aesthetics. Patients were not satisfied with speech if the dentist graded a construction of alower partial denture low (p< 0. 05). Dissatisfaction was related to mastication, aesthetics, number of missing teeth and ability of speech. These findings can aid a clinician in discussing a treatment plan and help a patient understand the risk of dissatisfaction in the presence of certain factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of ‘fit’ and the functional efficiency of prosthetic appliance depend upon {{how well the}} model replicates the natural oral tissues. The {{accuracy of}} the model is mainly dependant on {{the accuracy of the}} impression in which it was casted. The impression stage {{is one of the first}} stages involved in the production of dentures. It is of great importance, therefore, that minute inaccuracies at this stage, will be carried through and possibly compounded later on. Purpose: The aim of this survey is to record the methods used in handling of impressions by dentists (Taking, pouring, storing and disinfection); identify impression disinfection and the chemical disinfectants used and to investigate the reasons behind the choice and preference of materials used routinely. Method: A questionnaire was sent out to (112) (appendix. 1) dentists in different governmental hospitals, dental schools and private clinics in Khartoum State. The names and addresses of the dentists were obtained from the Sudanese Medical council lists. The aim of the questionnaire was to find out current clinical practice rather than to test textbook knowledge. The study was designed so that there will be no way of tracing an individual reply to a specific practitioner. Results: The majority of the clinician (76. 9 %) selected their stock trays according to the suitable size and shape. Alginate is a popular material for both primary and secondary impression (84. 8 %) with immediate pouring (65. 9 %). Most of the dentists who delayed pouring of the impression stored the impression by wrapping it in wet cotton and plastic bag (70. 9 %). High percentage of the clinicians (87. 5 %) used special trays in the fabrication of complete dentures. Shellac was the material of choice for construction of the special tray (51 %). While Selfcure acrylic resin was found to be the second option (43. 7 %). Most of the participants specified requirements to the lab regarding construction of the special tray. Border molding prior to taking secondary impression was not very much appreciated in routine practice. A high percentage of practitioners (80. 9 %) routinely disinfects impressions by just rinsing under tap water. It was evident that 31. 3 % rinse as well as immerse their dentures in tap water & sodium hypochlorite, respectively. A few (12. 5 – 18. 8 %) for half to two minutes only. Prolong time is minimal (3. 1 - 9. 4 %) for 3 minutes to one hour. Instruction to laboratory technician throughout the steps of complete <b>denture</b> <b>construction,</b> 71. 8 % of dentists instructed technicians verbally, 28. 2 % used written instructions. The greatest number of responding dentists was in mixed practice (39. 3 %), private practice (27. 7 %), public hospitals (21. 4 %) and in an academic institute was (15. 2 %). Only 16. 1 % of respondents in the mixed practice (39. 3 %) did use different impression technique materials in their different practices. The reason stated for using such different impression techniques materials in their practice was variable. However, availability of material was the common reason, followed by case requirements and/or availability, material cost, economic status, type of impression material and teaching purposes. From the result of the present study we may conclude that Quality improvement should be obtained by making proper impression, including tray selection, correct manipulation of impression materials, impression technique, the materials used for making casts, and proper time of cast fabrication. Attention should be given to the mechanism of disinfection followed for each impression material. Communication between dentist and dental laboratory is crucial to Prosthodontic practice. Continuous training programs should be carried out to improve the prosthetic service achieved in dental practice...|$|E
