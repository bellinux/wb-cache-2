5|$|The {{elections}} were originally planned for December 1956 {{but due to}} significant political changes in the government, resulting from Gomułka's ascension to power, they were delayed until early 1957. Among the various promises made by First Secretary Gomułka, during the Polish October peaceful revolution, to the restless Polish population was that of free elections. He <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a promise {{that he could not}} keep without seeing his party defeated. In the January 1957 elections the new 'democratic' aspect was the reintroduction of the secret ballot, and more importantly, there were more candidates than available seats in the parliament; in the 1952 elections the number of candidates equaled the number of seats in the Sejm. Another liberalizing factor was that unlike in previous elections, intimidation by the secret police (Służba Bezpieczeństwa) and the government against the opposition was limited.|$|E
5|$|During late 1596, Michael {{was faced}} with an {{unexpected}} attack from the Tatars, who had destroyed the towns of Bucharest and Buzău. By the time Michael gathered his army to counterattack, the Tatars had speedily retreated and so no battle was fought. Michael was determined to continue {{the war against the}} Ottomans, but he was prevented because he lacked support from Sigismund Báthory and Rudolf II. On 7 January 1597 Hasan Pasha declared the independence of Wallachia under Michael's rule, but Michael <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> only an attempt to divert him from preparing for another future attack. Michael again requested Rudolf II's support and Rudolf finally agreed to send financial assistance to the Wallachian ruler. On 9 June 1598 a formal treaty was reached between Michael and Rudolf II. According to the treaty, the Austrian ruler would give Wallachia sufficient money to maintain a 5,000-man army, as well as armaments and supplies. Shortly after the treaty was signed, the war with the Ottomans resumed and Michael besieged Nicopolis on 10 September 1598 and took control of Vidin. The war with the Ottomans continued until 26 June 1599, when Michael, lacking the resources and support to continue prosecuting the war, signed a peace treaty.|$|E

25|$|Matthew Gravelle {{was cast}} as Joe Miller, DS Miller's husband. Gravelle auditioned {{along with many}} other actors for the role, but Chibnall says that the casting team early on {{considered}} Gravelle their top choice for the role. The producers <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a critical casting decision. Whoever they hired to play Joe Miller would need to step up their acting game significantly in the final episode, so they researched Gravelle's past acting roles and watched as many of his performances as they could find. Chibnall paid particularly close attention to the Welsh language television series Teulu, in which Gravelle had recently played a lead role.|$|E

If from behind he seemed unexciting and unemotional, the players could see the animation in his face – and {{he was capable of}} frightening outbursts of temper at rehearsals. Tall and erect, with something of the military in his appearance... he seemed the personification of the English gentleman. But recipients of his cutting wit and occasional sarcasm <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not the whole picture." [...] Grove's Dictionary similarly said of him: ...|$|E

500|$|In a 1991 {{interview}} with Izvestia, Major Genadi Osipovich, pilot of the Su-15 interceptor that shot the 747 down, spoke about his recollections {{of the events}} leading up to the shootdown. Contrary to official Soviet statements at the time, he recalled telling ground controllers that there were [...] "blinking lights". He continued, saying that [...] "I saw two rows of windows and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a Boeing. I knew this was a civilian plane. But for me this meant nothing. It is easy to turn a civilian type of plane into one for military use." [...] He furthermore did not provide {{a detailed description of the}} aircraft to the ground controllers: [...] "I did not tell the ground that it was a Boeing-type plane; they did not ask me." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2010 Patel {{introduced}} an ambiguity {{in a second}} report for the CPS, saying he had found [...] "intraabdominal fluid with blood about 3l with small blood clot" [...] (emphasis added). The ambiguity had to be clarified, because {{the second and third}} pathologists had relied in part on Patel's original notes to form their views. Patel was interviewed twice by the CPS. According to Starmer, Patel [...] "maintained that the total fluid was somewhat in excess of three litres but that it was mainly ascites (a substance which forms in a damaged liver), which had been stained with blood. He had not retained the fluid nor had he sampled it in order to ascertain the proportion of blood because, he said, he had handled blood all his professional life and he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not blood but blood-stained ascites." [...] Patel also said he had found no internal rupture that would have led to this degree of blood loss.|$|E
500|$|Clyde Phillips {{claimed the}} Dexter staff {{did not know}} how the finale would {{conclude}} until late in the season, but he said Rita's death began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. Benz said she had been told that Lithgow knew about it {{from the beginning of the}} season. Phillips said the staff felt obligated to do more than kill the Trinity Killer in the final episode, especially because he felt the death of the third season antagonist (played by Jimmy Smits) was not handled [...] "as well as we could have". The writers discussed the idea of having Debra find out about Dexter's secret life, but decided they could not anticipate how drastically the series would be changed by that. Benz heard rumors from David Zayas that her character would be killed in the episode, but she was not notified until much later. [...] The producers met with her the day before the season finale script was distributed to the cast. She said, [...] "It was a tough meeting. In a bizarre way, it felt like a scene from Defending Your Life." [...] Benz described the death scene as [...] "very poetic". Clyde Philips said, [...] "She wasn’t happy. She loved being with us. We loved having her with us. She took it... professionally. She was greatly disappointed. She’s a professional. She works in television. She <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a possibility." ...|$|E

500|$|With no {{heir to the}} throne, Satyavati asked Bhishma {{to marry}} the widows of Vichitravirya (following the {{practice}} of niyoga in its narrower sense, as a levirate marriage) and rule as king. Bhishma refused, reminding Satyavati of the promise he made to her father and his vow of bachelorhood. He suggests [...] that a Brahmin could be hired to father children on the widows, thus preserving the dynasty. Revealing to Bhishma the tale of her encounter with Parashara, Satyavati well <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the time to call her son Vyasa to aid her. Satyavati coaxed Vyasa to have niyoga with his brother's widows, saying: [...] "from affection for thy brother Vichitravirya, for the perpetuation of our dynasty, {{for the sake of}} this Bhishma's request and my command, for kindness to all creatures, {{for the protection of the}} people and from the liberality of thy heart, O sinless one, it behooveth thee to do what I say." [...] After convincing Vyasa, Satyavati managed ( [...] with great difficulty) to obtain the consent of her [...] "virtuous" [...] daughters-in-law. In the Mahabharata, Vyasa agreed immediately to the niyoga. In the Devi Bhagavata Purana version, Vyasa initially refused Satyavati's proposal. He argued that Vichitravirya's wives were like his daughters; having niyoga with them was a heinous sin, through which no good could come. As a master of [...] "realpolitik", the hungry-for-grandsons Satyavati asserted that to preserve the dynasty, wrong directives by elders should be followed if they are going to reduce the sorrow of a mother. Vyasa finally agreed to that [...] "disgusting task", but suggested that offspring of perversity cannot be a source of joy.|$|E

[...] "My grandfather was really my best friend growing up. He was the one who opened me up to a whole world of music that seemed to have been passed over by my generation. Although I like rock and roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the Mills Brothers, something magical happened. The lyrics were so romantic, so real, the way a song should be for me. It was like seeing my future flash before me. I wanted to be a singer and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the music that I wanted to sing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The rest of Dammeier's {{argument}} {{was devoted to}} the issue of the other respondents' privacy expectations in communicating with Quon, after Sotomayor asked him if they could prevail even if Quon did not. Dammeier likened the department's actions to going to the post office to get letters sent to Quon instead of his house. Scalia pointed out that Quon could have obtained hard copies of the messages and circulated them himself. [...] "hen I get a piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well", the lawyer replied, [...] "but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the post office and get my mail before I get it". Richland replied in his rebuttal argument that [...] "the truth is that all of these plaintiffs admitted that they <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a department-issued pager, and this wasn't a post office".|$|E

Two men arrive on the island as they have heard that the Queen of Heaven lives there. Sent by the islanders to the croft where Mary and the man live, they are told no such person lives on the island and they should stop their search for false gods. The two men leave. Soon after, another boat arrives on the island with Jesus in the company of Simon and Andrew. Jesus takes Mary away with him, walking on water to reach the boat.

[...] Marshall Sahlins, an emeritus professor who helped lead {{the fight against the}} CI, said the newspaper article [...] "fulsomely" [...] praised Xu Lin, and told The Wall Street Journal, [...] "They <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a dubious operation to begin with. They knew that there was a large opposition from an important segment of the faculty. And then, given that, the newspaper report simply triggered or changed the balance definitively."

2500|$|Kubrick {{had already}} written a {{detailed}} treatment, and Kubrick and Herr got together at Kubrick's home every day, {{breaking down the}} treatment into scenes. From that, Herr wrote the first draft. The filmmaker worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work and changed it to Full Metal Jacket after discovering the phrase while going through a gun catalogue. After the first draft was completed, Kubrick phoned in his orders, and Hasford and Herr mailed their submissions to him. Kubrick read and edited them, and then the team repeated the process. Neither Hasford nor Herr knew how much he had contributed to the screenplay, {{which led to a}} dispute over the final credits. Hasford remembers, [...] "We were like guys on an assembly line in the car factory.

2500|$|Partition of Ireland, first mooted in 1912, was {{introduced}} with {{the enactment of}} the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which gave a form of [...] "Home rule" [...] self-government to two areas, Southern Ireland, with its capital at Dublin, and [...] "Northern Ireland", consisting of six of Ulster's central and eastern counties, both within a continuing United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Dissatisfaction with this led to the Irish War of Independence, which formally ceased on 11 July 1921. Low-level violence, however, continued in Ulster, causing Michael Collins in the south to order a boycott of Northern products in protest at attacks on the Nationalist community there. The Partition was effectively confirmed by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 6 December 1921. One of the primary stipulations of the treaty was the transformation of Ireland into a self-governing British dominion called the Irish Free State (which later became the sovereign Republic of Ireland), but with the option of a continuation of the home rule institution of Northern Ireland, still within the United Kingdom, if the Northern Ireland Parliament (already in existence) chose to opt out of the Irish Free State. All parties <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> certain to be the choice of the Ulster Unionists who had a majority in the parliament, and immediately on the creation of the Free State they resolved to leave it.|$|E

[...] Her grandmother, Eleanor Sudds, and her grandfather, Clyde Sudds, raised Gloria Foster on a farm.

2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was when I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the real deal, that the magic was about to happen again. Suddenly we could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
