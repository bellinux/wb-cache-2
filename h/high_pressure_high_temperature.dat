Existing models for viscosity prediction are limited by data, especially at <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Studies show that the predicted viscosities of natural gases using the current correlation equations are about 15 % higher than the corresponding measured viscosities at <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> This project proposes to develop a viscosity prediction model for natural gases at <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>high</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The project shows that commercial gas viscosity measurement devices currently available suffer {{from a variety of}} problems and do not give reliable or repeatable results.

50|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} or c-BN was first {{synthesized}} in 1957 by Robert H. Wentorf at General Electric, {{shortly after the}} synthesis of diamond. The general process for c-BN synthesis is the dissolution of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in a solvent-catalyst, usually alkali or alkaline earth metals or their nitrides, followed by spontaneous nucleation of c-BN under <b>high</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> (HPHT) conditions. The yield of c-BN is lower and substantially slower compared to diamond's synthetic route due to the complicated intermediate steps. Its insolubility in iron and other metal alloys makes it more useful for some industrial applications than diamond.|$|E
