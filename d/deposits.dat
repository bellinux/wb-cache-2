5|$|Commercially viable natural <b>deposits</b> of {{graphite}} {{occur in}} many parts of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite <b>deposits</b> are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. <b>Deposits</b> of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood.

5|$|Once {{diamonds}} {{have been}} {{transported to the}} surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds {{is known as a}} primary source of diamonds. Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include alluvial <b>deposits</b> and <b>deposits</b> along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in <b>deposits</b> left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to alluvial <b>deposits,</b> glacial <b>deposits</b> are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are (1) to analyse the condition of third party <b>deposit</b> outstanding, its interest rate, and cost of fund set up by PT. BNI (Persero) Tbk; (2) to analyse effect of third party <b>deposit</b> interest rate to third party <b>deposit</b> outstanding; and (3) to recommend to management an appropriate third party <b>deposit</b> interest rate which is able to optimize composition of third party <b>deposit.</b> Methodology used in this study is descriptive with a case study approach. The study applies Descriptive Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression analysis as the analysis tools. The study shows that, in general, third party <b>deposit</b> interest rate in BNI has experienced a down turn {{over the last three years}} (2002 – 2004) for all <b>deposit.</b> The declining trend of interest rate was followed by a change in composition of current <b>deposit,</b> saving, and time <b>deposit.</b> On one hand, time <b>deposit</b> tended to decrease, on the other hand current <b>deposit</b> indicated an up turn. Finally, the change in this third party <b>deposit</b> composition had an impact of declining BNI cost of fund over that time. Based on result of regression analysis, variables which influenced significantly to time <b>deposit</b> are rupiah denominated time <b>deposit</b> interest rate and foreign currency denominated time deposi interest rate. The variable which influenced significantly to saving is foreign currency denominated time <b>deposit</b> interest rate. Interest rate which influenced to current <b>deposit</b> and total of third party <b>deposit</b> is rupiah denominated time <b>deposit</b> interest rate. Recommendation of a new model to calculate an appropriate third party <b>deposit</b> interest rate which is able to optimize composition of third party <b>deposit</b> in BNI still needs a deep and thorough investigation of rupiah denominated time <b>deposit.</b> By means of decreasing rupiah denominated time <b>deposit,</b> the composition of third party <b>deposit</b> will change and dominated by ‘cheaper deposit’ which is current <b>deposit</b> in order to be able to generate cheaper cost of fund...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{question is whether the}} financial safety net reduces market discipline on bank risk taking.

Internationally, <b>deposit</b> insurance schemes vary widely in their coverage, funding, and management.

5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar <b>deposits</b> will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar <b>deposits,</b> while an investor holding euro <b>deposits</b> will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro <b>deposits,</b> then any excess return on euro <b>deposits</b> must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro <b>deposits</b> must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar.

We present several methodologies {{that can be used}} to set benchmarks for the pricing level of <b>deposit</b> insurance in a country, and quantify how specific design features affect the cost of <b>deposit</b> insurance. The paper makes several contributions to our understanding of what drives the price of <b>deposit</b> insurance.

We also find that <b>deposit</b> insurance is underpriced in many countries around the world, notably in several developing countries. Importantly, our estimates suggest that many countries cannot afford <b>deposit</b> insurance. <b>Deposit</b> insurance is unlikely to be a viable option in a country with weak banks and institutions. The paper does not recommend a funded <b>deposit</b> insurance scheme, but rather argues that for countries that have adopted or are adopting <b>deposit</b> insurance and have decided to pre-fund it, pricing it as accurately as possible is important...|$|R
