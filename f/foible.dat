500|$|After Reinsdorf {{purchased}} {{the team in}} 1981, the team experienced erosion of fan and media support which led to moving the team. [...] He complained about old Comiskey Park with its <b>foible</b> such as numerous obstructed view seats and threatened to move the White Sox. Among his threats was moving the team to Itasca or Addison, Illinois in DuPage County. [...] Reinsdorf, through his real estate business, purchased [...] in Addison. Chicago Mayor Harold Washington lobbied the Illinois legislature, and subsequently then-Illinois Governor James R. Thompson promoted a package of incentives to retain the team in Chicago. The state floated bonds to build New Comiskey Park and let Reinsdorf keep all parking and concession revenues, {{as well as the}} $5 million per year from 89 skyboxes. [...] Reinsdorf and Chicago Blackhawks owner, William Wirtz contributed $175 million to fund the construction of the largest arena in the United States. [...] When the United Center opened in 1994 all of the skyboxes were leased for up to eight years. [...] As per the collective bargaining agreement, Reinsdorf was allowed to exclude 60% of luxury suite revenue from [...] "basketball-related income" [...] and thus it {{is not part of the}} revenue sharing income.|$|E
500|$|Hideaki Sorachi's {{main focus}} in Gin Tama {{is the use}} of gags; during the manga's second year of {{serialization}} he started to add more drama to the story while still keeping the comedy. Various jokes from the manga are comments regarding clichés from other shōnen series. For example, in the first chapter after Gintoki fights a group of aliens to protect Shinpachi and Tae, Shinpachi complains that he only fought for [...] "one page" [...] and Gintoki replies, [...] "Shut up! One page is a long time for a manga artist!" [...] Gintoki's exaggerated desire to read the Weekly Shōnen Jump (which causes him to fight other readers in order to get it) also makes fun of shōnen, since during those parts characters [...] quote them. Other types of comic situations are more general, so that the reader must know about Japanese culture [...] to understand them. The humour is described by publications as being [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "weird". It is also described as being divided between two categories: [...] "sci-fi comedy" [...] and a [...] "samurai comedy" [...] with the former referring to the aliens. It [...] tends to point out [...] "an irritating <b>foible</b> about modern society" [...] including celebrations days or famous mythical figures. Additionally, there are references to several historical figures with a few characters from the story being based on them. Besides the series' comedy, the aliens' invasion in Japan bring several social issues between them and the humans with the most recurring one being the lack of social equality. As a result, one of the main themes involves society trying to preserve their own way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other shōnen series.|$|E
