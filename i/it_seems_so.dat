The casting of Annette Badland was announced on 12 December 2013, when Badland commented, [...] "I'm thrilled to be joining the cast of EastEnders as I've always admired the show and everyone involved in <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> warm-hearted. Aunt Babe is a fabulous and complex woman and I can't wait to get stuck into the role." ...|$|E
2500|$|Therefore {{it seems}} better to me, if <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> to you, {{that we also}} {{translate}} certain books ...and bring it about ...if we have the peace, that all the youth of free men who now are in England, {{those who have the}} means that they may apply themselves to it, be set to learning, while they may not be set to any other use, until the time when they can well read English writings. (Preface: [...] "Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care") ...|$|E
2500|$|The intermediate-sized car {{market segment}} was growing to almost 20% {{of the total}} market by 1973, but the hardtop was the slowest-selling version in the Matador line, [...] "in a segment where two-door hardtops were customarily the most popular (and profitable) models." [...] Automobile Quarterly {{reviewed}} the 1973 cars and summarized that [...] "AMC actually {{has a very strong}} product line, but public awareness of <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> feeble as to be negligible.... The Matador became a typical intermediate, an exact counterpart of the Satellite/Coronet or Torino/Montego", and ranked AMC's car as a [...] "good buy." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was evidently}} very cross with her. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> unkind of him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh dear! I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said the young lady, reddening, with a naive {{mingling}} of hilarity and embarrassment. [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> stuffy in the cabin, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> {{easy to get}} out on deck and pull myself up by the railings; and just as I got up here, I suddenly seemed to be sliding down {{the roof of a}} house." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1666, {{following}} Janet's death, Donald married Marion MacLeod of Harris, but by 1680 he {{was seeking}} a divorce, accusing her of adultery. At {{some point in the}} late 17th century, a small prison (now called [...] "Coroghon Castle") was constructed on the side of an isolated stack at Coroghon; it was described by Thomas Pennant in 1772 as [...] "a lofty slender rock, that juts into the sea: on one side is a little tower, at a vast height above us, accessible by a narrow and horrible path: <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> small as scarce to be able to contain half a dozen people. Tradition says, that it was built by some jealous regulus, to confine a handsome wife in".|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene in}} which Marcus changes his mind while with Jacqueline was a major rewrite to the script. According to Hudlin, in the {{original}} draft, Eddie's character Marcus [...] "never decides anything, things are decided for him by the different women. So, we finally realized {{he had to make}} an affirmative choice. Going through the script with a buddy of mine, we talked about it, and my buddy Tre said 'look, he's got to make a decision.' And I said, 'you're right. He's got to reject her, and choose her.' And <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> obvious now, I'm like 'what's wrong with me? What was wrong with all of us that it took us so long to figure out what we really needed to do to fix the movie?' ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. Only {{makes it}} worse afterwards. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> frightful to them, too.|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} the serene face looking upward, {{and thought it was}} the stars that made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>so</b> noble.|$|R
60|$|Miss Havisham sat {{listening}} (or <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so,</b> for I {{could not}} see her face), but still made no answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{threw the}} grapes away. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> silly," [...] said Sylvia, {{watching}} Mortimer's impassive {{face for a}} sign of annoyance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not of Lady Eustace,--nor of any woman. But <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> {{odd that}} such a person's {{services}} should be required." ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. Nor I. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> strange; and yet, somehow, it doesn't. (Confidently.) You see, {{it could}} have been no one else.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Sally, {{why have}} you such a rooted {{distrust}} of men?" [...] demanded Willard curiously. [...] "Somehow, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> foreign to your character." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{did not say}} why <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so,</b> and he suggested, [...] "The {{privilege}} of comparing the histrionic and the literary Verrian?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> he slept. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> strange. There was {{no court}} physician, no bulletins {{to reassure the}} world that he was {{sleeping}} quietly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Doctor John--I shudder at {{the thought}} of being liable to such an illusion! <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> real. Is there no cure?--no preventive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only because <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> {{hard that}} you should take so much trouble about us, and that then there should be so much vexation." ...|$|E
60|$|Now what {{put that}} mistake into their minds? <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> ridiculous to us now, that we cannot {{understand}} at first how it ever arose.|$|E
6000|$|... (Pleased.) <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> {{strange that}} you, being what you are, {{affiliated}} as you are, should {{be interested in}} the welfare of the common people.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{precisely}} faults," [...] said Ann Veronica. [...] "It's {{something that}} bothers me." [...] Ten thousand! Put that way <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> different.|$|R
60|$|And they wandered {{there by}} day {{and looked at the}} black {{reflection}} of the trees. And in the heat <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> cool and restful....|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> glaringly plain--I {{was ashamed}} of making it so {{outright}} from the beginning. But they did. Even she did, herself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You talk wildly, Jane--wildly, wildly; the air's afloat with listeners; so <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> <b>so</b> it seems. Had I but {{one clear}} lamp in this dark face!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{thought it}} was blowing a gale now!" [...] {{returned}} Miles. [...] "At least <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so,</b> if we may judge from the pitching and plunging." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very nice, se√±or; but I {{should have}} liked it better {{if the water}} {{had not been so}} blue. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> strange bathing in blue water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It looks such awful rot now" [...] he said, mournfully. [...] "And yet <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> {{good when}} I was {{thinking}} about it. What's wrong?" ...|$|R
60|$|Still Mary Enderby {{found herself}} with nothing of {{all she had}} a {{thousand}} times thought she should say to Bessie if she had ever the slightest chance. <b>It</b> always <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> easy, till now, to take Bessie in her arms, and appeal to her good sense, her self-respect, her regard for her family and friends; and now <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> impossible.|$|R
6000|$|Her third {{attempt at}} a letter pleased her {{scarcely}} better than the rest, but she sent <b>it,</b> though <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> blunt and awkward. She wrote:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It won't {{make one}} never wake,' {{returned}} Mysie; 'and I do {{like to give}} my soul to Christ. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> to rest one, and make one not afraid.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of Cousin Jack," [...] she said, a little startled at his abruptness. [...] "Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> strange that he is dead--I scarcely can believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thyme {{has been}} telling me about that poor little thing. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>so</b> dreadful, and I can't {{get rid of the}} feeling that we're--we're all mixed up with it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{representative}} of the less reasonable sex could not understand it, but he agreed recklessly, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> plain to the woman that she continued confidentially-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't write somehow, Anne. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> futile {{to try to}} say {{anything}} with pen and ink. And I {{wanted to get back}} quietly and unobserved." ...|$|R
60|$|But if {{that seems}} to you at times wrong and absurd, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> to them also. They, like all heathens, had at times dreams of one God.|$|R
