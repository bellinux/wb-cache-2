5|$|After {{some hard}} {{fighting}} at the Jabiya Gate, commander Abu Ubaidah and <b>his</b> <b>men,</b> repulsed the sally and the Byzantines hastened {{back to the}} city. The battle was intense at the Small Gate, which was guarded by commander Yazid and <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> Yazid had fewer troops but Dharar came to Yazid's aid with his 2,000 cavalry of the Mobile Guard. The cavalry attacked the flank of the Byzantine sortie force and repulsed the sally.|$|E
5|$|Although Lochry {{knew that}} he was in hostile territory, he landed his little {{flotilla}} after two days of nonstop travel because he needed to feed <b>his</b> <b>men</b> and horses. After landing, the Americans cooked fresh buffalo meat for breakfast and cut grass for their horses, apparently not taking proper security precautions. Concealed in the nearby woods, Brant repositioned <b>his</b> <b>men</b> and then opened fire, taking the Americans completely by surprise. Some Americans fought until their ammunition ran out, although others apparently did not have their weapons ready when the attack began. Some of the Americans attempted to escape by boat, but Brant had anticipated this and had positioned men in canoes to cut off any retreat. Seeing that he was hopelessly trapped, Lochry called for <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to surrender.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{approached}} and their ammunition ran dangerously low, Bouck feared {{they could be}} flanked at any time. He planned to pull <b>his</b> <b>men</b> back just before dusk, when they would have enough light to escape through the woods. Bouck ordered <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to remove the distributor caps from their Jeeps and to prepare to evacuate to the rear. He dispatched Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston through the woods to locate Major Kriz at Regimental HQ and seek instructions or reinforcements.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{defensive}} schemes employ [...] "key" [...] blitzes where {{a player}} will blitz only if <b>his</b> assigned <b>man</b> stays in to block, thus keying his action off {{the action of}} <b>his</b> <b>man.</b> If <b>his</b> <b>man</b> releases into a pass pattern, then the defensive player will cover him. For example, if weak side linebacker has the fullback as <b>his</b> <b>man,</b> if upon the snap of the ball the fullback blocks, the linebacker will blitz.|$|R

5|$|At Zama, Scipio {{arranged}} <b>his</b> <b>men</b> into columns, side by side, {{with large}} lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many {{were killed by}} velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, Scipio formed <b>his</b> <b>men</b> into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry.|$|E
5|$|Augvald {{had set up}} {{his base}} in the {{north-eastern}} part of Karmøy, but {{the western part of}} the island was still ruled by another king, Ferking.

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend Gia Long Palace. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had told <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> The other generals had little sympathy, since the special forces commander had disguised <b>his</b> <b>men</b> in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids. The generals were aware of the threat Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.|$|E
5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered <b>his</b> <b>men</b> who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move <b>his</b> <b>men</b> into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When <b>his</b> <b>men</b> {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E

5|$|On April 30, 1968, Captain Jay R. Vargas, {{who was the}} {{commander}} of Company G, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade, was sent with <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to an area around the village of Dai Do where two other Marine companies were in a battle with a North Vietnamese Army regiment. Even though Company G hadn’t slept for thirty-six hours, they went ashore at about one in the afternoon. The enemy attacked <b>his</b> <b>men</b> and had one of his platoons pinned down. Vargas went to rescue his platoon with a reserve platoon and was wounded by a grenade. He {{was able to take}} out three machine guns nests by himself before leading <b>his</b> <b>men</b> in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy soldiers in the nearby village.|$|E
5|$|On September 26, Anderson and <b>his</b> <b>men</b> reached Monroe County, Missouri, and {{traveled}} towards Paris, but learned of other nearby guerrillas and rendezvoused with them near Audrain County.

Although {{a large group of}} guerrillas was assembled, their leaders felt that there were no promising targets to attack, because all of the large towns nearby were heavily guarded.|$|E
5|$|Piccinino, however, did {{not seek}} to {{maintain}} the agreement {{as one of his}} deserters reported. Upon learning this, Skanderbeg decided to open battle with Piccinino's men. After feeding <b>his</b> <b>men</b> and preparing his horses, Skanderbeg set off by moonlight for the Angevin camp. He found the place empty, however, since one of Piccinino's men had already informed Piccinino on the Albanians' intentions. Skanderbeg then returned to Barletta where he was reinforced by Ferdinand and <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> He then split his army into two, one under Alessandro Sforza's command, the other under his, and he approached Troia. Jean d'Anjou and Piccinino were stationed in Lucera, however, eight miles from Troia. Knowing that battle would come between Troia and Lucera, Skanderbeg set out by night to capture Seggiano, a mountain lying between the two cities, where he stationed some of <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to protect it. Thence, <b>his</b> <b>men</b> could find refuge in case of defeat. Piccinino had the same objective in mind and set out to capture the mountain, but instead met Skanderbeg's men. He thus kept <b>his</b> <b>men</b> in order for the coming battle. The next day, the two armies met. The battle lasted until dusk, but Jean's men suffered a serious defeat and he was forced to flee. Piccinino then retreated from his campaigns. He went northwards where he joined Sigismondo Malatesta and 200 of <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to launch assaults on the papal state.|$|E

5|$|Their {{last major}} {{military}} campaign was the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of November and December 1864. Ross and <b>his</b> <b>men</b> led the Confederate advance into Tennessee. Between {{the beginning of}} November and December 27, <b>his</b> <b>men</b> captured 550 prisoners, several hundred horses, and enough overcoats and blankets to survive the winter chill. Only 12 of Ross's men were killed, with 70 wounded and five captured.|$|E
5|$|This {{order of}} battle was almost always followed, the Battle of the Great Plains and the Battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions. At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed <b>his</b> <b>men</b> up in the usual manner, but once the hastati had begun to engage the enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a {{flanking}} force, routing the opposing Carthaginians. At Zama, Scipio arranged <b>his</b> <b>men</b> into columns, side-by-side, with large lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, Scipio formed <b>his</b> <b>men</b> into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry.|$|E

They were forced to retreat from their position each time as reinforcements failed to arrive. During the battle, Ross, who had acquired a horse, was bucked off, leading <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to believe he had been killed. He was actually unharmed. The Confederate Army retreated from the battle and found themselves facing more Union troops at Hatchie's Bridge. Ross led 700 riflemen to engage the Union troops. For three hours, <b>his</b> <b>men</b> held off 7,000 Union troops, repulsing three major enemy assaults.|$|E
5|$|Adnan led a 42-strong platoon {{from the}} Malay Regiment in the defence of Singapore against the invading Japanese. The {{soldiers}} fought at the Battle of Pasir Panjang, at Pasir Panjang Ridge in the Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill) area on 12–14 February 1942. Although heavily outnumbered, Adnan refused to surrender and urged <b>his</b> <b>men</b> {{to fight on}} until the end. They held off the Japanese troops for two days amid heavy enemy shelling from artillery guns and tanks and chronic shortages of food, medical supplies and ammunition (on {{the last day of}} the battle, Adnan and <b>his</b> <b>men</b> were only left with a few hand grenades and had to fight off the Japanese soldiers with their bayonets and through brutal hand-to-hand combat.

5|$|After this, the Spartans {{sent out}} a new commander, Anaxibius, to Abydos. For a time, he enjoyed a number of successes against Pharnabazus, and seized a number of Athenian {{merchant}} ships. Worried that Thrasybulus's accomplishments were being undermined, the Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius. For a time, the two forces merely raided each other's territory, but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would bring his troops on a return march from a campaign against Antandrus, and ambushed the Spartan force. When Anaxibius and <b>his</b> <b>men,</b> who were strung out {{in the line of}} march, had entered the rough, mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates and <b>his</b> <b>men</b> were waiting, the Athenians emerged and ambushed them, killing Anaxibius and many others.|$|E
