A growing number of countries are experimenting with different approaches to tackling financial barriers to maternal health care. This paper describes an innovative scheme introduced in Ghana in 2003 to exempt all pregnant women from payments for delivery, in which public, mission and private providers could claim back lost user fee revenues, according to an agreed tariff. The paper presents part of the findings of an evaluation of the policy based on interviews with 65 key informants in the health system at national, regional, district and facility level, including policymakers, managers and providers. The exemption mechanism was well accepted and appropriate, but there were important problems with disbursing and sustaining the funding, and with budgeting and management. Staff workloads increased as more women attended, and levels of compensation for services and staff were important to the scheme's acceptance.

40|$|According to the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Green Economy Report (2011), energy {{consumption}} of buildings {{in most of}} the industrialized countries accounts for around one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The building sector also consumes {{more than a third of}} global resources and contributes by about 40 % to solid waste streams (mainly through demolition but also construction) in developed countries (UNEP 2011, p. 341). But while having been identified as the single largest contributor to human-related greenhouse gas emissions, the sector is also considered to hold the greatest potential to lower emissions based on the relatively low case of retrofitting existing or constructing new buildings (IPCC 2014). Following the realization of these potentials, the last years have witnessed the emergence of a green building agenda in many countries across the globe including technical and organizational innovations in the conception of single buildings (both residential and commercial) as well as enlarged approaches to the role and impact of the built environment in cities including neighbourhood and public infrastructures planning. The sector’s dynamic is partly caused and sustained by a high commitment of public authorities (e. g., via co-funding or tax <b>exemption</b> <b>schemes)</b> and seconded by the involvement of semi-public agencies (e. g., municipal building corporations, energy agencies, public housing services, vocational learning centres).

40|$|Background Tanzania is {{experiencing}} {{rapid increase in}} number of Most Vulnerable Children (MVC). Currently {{the total number of}} most vulnerable children is 10 % of all child population. These children are facing serious challenges in utilizing health care due to various reasons including poverty, distance to health facility and ability to pay for health care. Health is an expensive commodity which MVC households fails to foot its costs. Given the existence of health <b>exemption</b> <b>scheme</b> for MVCs, why does utilization remain low was the fundamental question of this study. Materials and Methods The study aimed at exploring peoples’ perceptions on the role of <b>exemption</b> <b>scheme</b> in utilization of health services among most vulnerable children. A qualitative study was conducted in Tanga City Council. Using a purposive sampling technique, a tota of 36 key informants were recruited for participation in in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was followed. Results The study revealed that, majority of the people perceived a poor coordination in the operationalization of health <b>exemption</b> <b>scheme.</b> It was further found that, the scheme covered only one MVC per MVC household. The scheme package of services was selective to cover less costly diseases only. Also the issue of running out of stock of drugs, entailed poor quality of health care was perceived as a challenge in utilization of health care. However, majority of the people perceived a scheme as a useful intervention that would meant a lot if it would cover all health services at the point of need. Conclusions and recommendations It is recommended that, key stakeholders for this intervention should be sensitized on <b>exemption</b> <b>scheme</b> implementation protocol. In addition, the health benefit package must be comprehensive to accommodate all health needs of MVCs. Finally, Tanga City Council vii should take necessary budgetary steps to avail medical supplies in all health facilities, giving special attention to MVCs who have been financially constrained to foot medical costs in health facilities, short of which morbidity and mortality rates among MVCs may increases due to resortment to folk healers, spiritual leaders and self medication...|$|E

Conversely, when credit schemes are applied, foreign investors pay their home country taxes, and there is no particular incentive to evade the national tax system). The issue of fiscal harmonisation is all the more stringent that the scope for tax competition is enhanced with EMU (intra-European exchange rate risk disappears with the euro, which considerably reduces impediments to trade, FDI and labour mobility, and increases the mobility of the tax bases). In the area of corporate taxes however, the scope for competition will depend on the sensitiveness of firms to tax discrepancies across possible locations (for instance, if agglomerations economies are dominant, tax competition would have a negligible impact). Hence {{there is a need to}} assess the importance of taxes in the decision of firms to allocate their activities abroad. This paper provides an econometric analysis of the sensitivity of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), in some OECD countries, to tax rates and to tax regimes. It is shown that inward FDI is negatively affected by a rise in effective as well as nominal corporate tax rates. This result holds, be the fiscal regime (exemption/credit) controlled or not. These results are used to perform some simulations which allow to quantify the impact on inward FDI of a tax competition and of a change in tax schemes in Europe. It is shown that the generalisation of credit schemes in Europe would reduce inward FDI in our sample of countries, because it would remove the opportunity to evade high tax rates at home, whereas the generalisation of <b>exemption</b> <b>schemes</b> in the EU would increase inward investment. We also highlight some externalities produced by tax changes in Europe on extra-European countries. Turning to a comparison of tax harmonisation versus tax competition and dumping, the simulations highlight the potentially negative externality of tax competition in Europe for the foreign partners of the EU, namely the United States and Japan, who would lose from a non co-operative tax game in Europe. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of barriers to {{access to health}} care depends in the complex interaction of supply and demand-side factors, and both these factors will {{determine the extent to which}} access is equitable, based on the principle of equal utilization for equal need. Among these barriers we have cost-sharing that represents a well established tool to control demand, in many OECD countries. Many contributions in literature highlight arguments pro and against user charges: on one side, advocates of them claim that they can reduce demand by encouraging a more responsible use of health services, and raise revenue to sustain and expand the provision of health care, on the other side there is some evidence suggesting that they have a detrimental effect on the utilization of health services, and by extension on health status. The aim of the paper is to assess the extent to which the imposition of statutory user charges deter individuals from using health services and whether they result in health care systems characterized by unequal utilization for equal need. A special attention is given to the case of Italy, where tickets rules have been piling up in recent years, we do have some evidence of inequity of access and a stronger regional autonomy due to the process of federalism could exacerbate local disparities in access to essential assistance level. Can tickets have a positive role in this scenario?

Methods A structured questionnaire was developed, covering individual and household characteristics, working hours and practices, sources of income, and views of the exemptions scheme and general motivation. After field testing, this was administered to 374 respondents in 12 districts of Central and Volta regions. The respondents included doctors, medical assistants (MAs), public and private midwives, nurses, community health nurses (CHNs), and traditional birth attendants, both trained and untrained. Results Health workers were well informed about the delivery fee exemptions scheme and their responses on its impact suggest a realistic view {{that it was a good}} scheme, but one that faces serious challenges regarding financial sustainability. Concerning its impact on their morale and working conditions, the responses were broadly neutral. Most public sector workers have seen an increased workload, but counterbalanced by increased pay. TBAs have suffered, in terms of client numbers and income, while the picture for private midwives is mixed. The survey also sheds light on pay and productivity. The respondents report long working hours, with a mean of 54 hours per week for community nurses and up to 129 hours per week for MAs. Weekly reported client loads in the public sector range from a mean of 86 for nurses to 269 for doctors. Over the past two years, reported working hours have been increasing, but so have pay and allowances (for doctors, allowances now make up 66 % of their total pay). The lowest paid public health worker now earns almost ten times the average gross national income (GNI) per capita, while the doctors earn 38. 5 times GNI per capita. This compares well with average government pay of four times GNI per capita. Comparing pay with outputs, the relatively high number of clients reported by doctors reduces their pay differential, so that the cost per client – $ 1. 09 – is similar to a nurse's (and lower than a private midwife's). Conclusion These findings show that a scheme which increases demand for public health services while also sustaining health worker income and morale, is workable, if well managed, even within the relatively constrained human resources environment of countries like Ghana.

40|$|This study {{examines}} economic implications of India’s trade and trade policy reforms {{during the period}} from 1990 to 2007. It first describes India’s economic growth and the composition and performance of its trade at the product and broad sector level. Next, recent reforms and the current trade policy stance are assessed and recommendations for further policy reforms are discussed. The impact of India’s openness on its total factor productivity is also addressed. The analysis shows that India has gone a long way in reducing its tariffs on non-agricultural products as well as selected non-tariff barriers and that this had a positive impact on the economy. Nevertheless, moderate to high protection still persists and adds to the hurdles faced by Indian enterprises. Overall, India’s pattern of specialisation is still affected by the pre- 1990 s policies; while certain services have recently performed very well, their high reliance on skilled labour and capital means they can only address {{a small portion of the}} Indian jobless growth problem. India’s endowment structure and the recent services-dominated export profile suggest that it needs to improve conditions for the development of its manufacturing sector, with a particular emphasis—at this stage—on labour-intensive activities. The remaining goods and services trade barriers combine with domestic red tape, infrastructure bottlenecks and factor markets rigidities that restrict new entry and competition to keep India’s competitiveness, particularly in agriculture and manufacturing, at relatively low levels. In an effort to offset the remaining protection, India has developed a complex system of duty <b>exemption</b> <b>schemes,</b> special investment and establishment rules and special economic zones (SEZs) that provide incentives particularly to exporting firms.

40|$|European {{competition}} {{policy has been}} one of the common policies since the beginning of European integration. The European level economic policy coordination and the customs union have required a uniform framework for {{competition policy}} covering the whole Community. Nowadays the economic integration of Europe is suffering from its biggest crisis ever, which also affects companies based and/or operating in Europe. This brings about new challenges for common competition policy as it has to assure, on one hand, a legal framework to maintain fair competition. The importance of cooperation between competition authorities, for example in the field of restrictive agreements, has been recognised by the European Commission. The Commission, on the other hand, has to deal with an increasing number of merger cases because, after the decline of the number of cases in 2008 and 2009, concentrations have started to intensify again. This is due to the recovery of companies in 2010 and the relaunch of lending activity. Also, competition policy has to stimulate markets as it is also a way to put the European economy on a growing path. Much more emphasis should be put on state aid because it does not only spur economic growth but it could have negative effects as well. This type of excessive spending is problematic in the sense of competition policy and it could eventually even worsen the long term economic perspectives of Europe. The crisis in Europe escalated three years ago. I summarise the legal development and guidelines relating to competition policy after 2008. I examine the block <b>exemption</b> <b>schemes</b> and the extended state aid activities. These are developments that may contribute to the recovery from the crisis. It is essentially important to shape competition policy so that it effectively guards companies’ adaptation process to the new economic circumstances, and stimulates their economic activity. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cervical {{cancer is}} {{a leading cause of}} death from cancer among women in low-resource settings, {{affecting}} women at a time of life when they are critical to social and economic stability. In addition, the economic burden is important for policy formulation. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate patient side cost and to determine predictors of its variation for the treatment of cervical cancer. Methods Analytic cross sectional study involving 227 cervical cancer cases at Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Ethiopia was conducted. Cost estimation was based on patients' perspective and using the prevalence-based model as a time frame. Productivity losses were estimated from lost working days. Results The mean outpatient cost per patient for cervical cancer was $ 407. 2 (Median = $ 206. 9). Direct outpatient cost (Mean = $ 334. 2) takes the largest share compared with the indirect counterpart ($ 150). The outpatient cost for half of the respondent falls in a range between $ 93. 7 and $ 478. The mean inpatient cost for hospitalized patients was $ 404. 4. The average direct inpatient cost was $ 329 (74 % medical costs and 26 % non medical costs). The mean value for total inpatient cost for half of the respondents was in the range of $ 133. 5 and $ 493. 9. For every additional day of inpatient hospital stay, there is a daily incremental inpatient cost of $ 4. 2. Conclusion As has been found in other studies, our findings revealed that cervical cancer creates an immense financial burden on patients.

40|$|A study {{prepared}} for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) The problem of increasing imports of subsidised renewable electricity from neighboring countries and Member States of the EU, undermining level playing fields for traditional hydropower in Switzerland, can be addressed by means of preferential taxation of electricity produced by means of renewable energy. Both under WTO law and {{the rules of the}} 1972 Free Trade Agreement, distinctions may be drawn on the basis of non-product related production and process methods, provided the same rules apply to domestic and imported electricity produced with similar methods. Differential taxation can be implemented on the basis of certificates of origin (CO) which need to be made available alike to domestic and foreign producers. A privilege exclusively granted to domestic producers cannot be lawfully sustained. Also, quantitative restrictions of imports cannot be properly justified. The study recommends adopting a system comparable to the UK model of renewable electricity <b>exemption</b> <b>scheme,</b> in place since 2001. It has not been challenged under EU law or under WTO law. To the extent that considerations of industrial policy dominate the motivation, rather than the promotion of green electricity, measures could be adopted on the basis of countervailing duties, offsetting foreign subsidies granted. Also, recourse to safeguard measures, albeit limited in time, can be contemplated. As Switzerland has little experience in taking recourse to trade remedies, a proper methodology taking into account WTO law would need to be developed and communicated in advance. Finally, efforts should be made to address the issue in negotiations with the European Union and Member States. Both unilateral measures relating to differential taxation as well as trade remedies may be used as an argument to bring about a settlement with exporting countries of subsidised electricity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Tanzania is {{experiencing}} the increase {{number of people}} who cannot afford to pay for health services, these people includes the elders and those {{in one way or another}} cannot work to earn any income. Poor people are at high risk of facing different disease. Tanzanian Government introduced waivers and <b>exemption</b> <b>scheme</b> to make sure that her people are accessing health services regardless of their ability to pay. It is therefore important to understand the experiences and challenges of patient treated under waivers scheme in accessing health services at MNH. Objective of the study To explore patient’s experiences and challenges on health services provided under waivers scheme at Muhimbili National hospital. Methodology The study was conducted at Muhimbili National Hospital, in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. It was a qualitative study using purposive sampling technique, whereby interview guide was used for in depth interviews to gather the information from respondents, a total of 15 respondents were recruited for participating in the study. Analysis of data was done using NVIVO code version 10 program. Thematic analysis was used to explore the experiences and challenges of patients receiving health services under waiver scheme at MNH. Results In exploring patient understanding on the processes to follow in consideration for waiver the study found that patients understand waiver scheme as: a means of enabling health services access among the poor, aimed at improving access to health services to majority regardless of ability to pay and they also share common understanding that poor people and old people deserve to be included in waiver scheme. Further, the study reveals that patients knew about waiver from their localities but most of them were not informed on the process to be followed in consideration to waiver and patients felt that they spent too much time in receiving services under waiver scheme. Regarding the circumstances encountered by patients, the study revealed that patients treated under waiver encounter different circumstances while receiving health services including change of the system from free services to cost sharing on laboratory services, absence of drugs even when the patient was waived, good relationship between patients and health care providers, long interval between hospital visits for review, misplacement of patient files and patient delay inquiring information due to inadequate instruction signs. With respect to barriers faced by patients under waiver, the study shows different barriers faced by the patients which include: cost of transport, burden of accommodation, cost sharing of drugs and household financial difficulties leading to poverty. Further the study found that waived patient’s opted different strategies to cope with the existing situation including; terminating treatment, begging from relative and non relatives, delaying in receiving health services, placing the burden of cost to close relatives and facing long term effect to the family. Conclusion and recommendations It is recommended that, key stakeholder of waivers scheme should sensitize on the implementation protocol of waivers scheme. In addition, the health system should be comprehensive to accommodate the need of patients identified to be treated under waiver category. Finally, Muhimbili National Hospital should take necessary budgetary steps to make sure that all medical supplies needed are made available, giving special attention to patients identified to deserve a waiver for health services to avoid higher experiences and minimize the challenges to these patients in accessing health services...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the Government’s public discussion document on the way forward for competition policy in Hong Kong, we are pleased to submit this paper for consideration. In summary, our response is as follows. 1. We have no hesitation {{to say that a}} competition law for Hong Kong is necessary, if not long overdue. Our analysis is based on the economic efficiency that a competition law will promote and the market distortion that it will cure. Contrary to what some may believe, small market economies are more prone to anti-competitive conduct, due to their unique features of high industry concentration, substantial entry barriers, and high level of aggregate concentration. 2. Laissez-faire does not guarantee fair competition. Given their tremendous costs to society, a reasonable amount of evidence of anti-competitive behaviours will justify a law. A competition law will also protect Hong Kong consumers from international cartels originated from other countries, whose damages are estimated to far outweigh the costs of setting up and enforcing a law. 3. An unbiased competition regime should be extended to all sectors of the economy, in light of the deficiency of a sector-specific approach. We see two main drawbacks of the latter approach: misallocation of resources of the economy in the long run due to the different rules set for different sectors; and a credibility problem that arises when the very same agency acts as both the traditional industry regulator and competition policy enforcer. Nor is it fair to target certain industries of the economy. 4. On the scope of the proposed competition law, we recommend a broad approach covering anti-competitive conduct as well as market structure. In terms of market structure, we do not mean anti-monopoly, as monopoly per se is not anti-competitive. It is only the abuse of monopoly (via predatory pricing, tying and bundling etc) that would be scrutinized. We argue that mergers and acquisitions (M 2 ̆ 6 As) need to be regulated, as they can be motivated by market power considerations as well as efficiency gains. Reduced competition {{as a result of a}} merger cannot be reversed by regulating the behaviour of the merged firm ex post. We recommend a light-touched merger control regime with the adoption of large safe harbours, on the justifications that the importance of scale economy in Hong Kong sometimes necessitates a certain degree of rationalization. 5. On the enforcement front, we recommend the set-up of a competition authority empowered with investigative function (plus the power to issue civil injunctive orders) and a specialist tribunal with adjudicative function (the Canada model). It combines the benefits of expertise (of the competition authority) and the safeguards from bias (with independent adjudication), and leads to a high degree of transparency. 6. In terms of sanctions, we propose that punitive fines and director disqualifications be imposed on offenders of hardcore cartels (price fixing, market sharing and bid rigging), and monetary fines, civil or administrative, on all other competition infringements. This is to balance the severity of sanctions against the gravity of harm, and to achieve the necessary deterrent effect against blatant behaviour. 7. We strongly recommend that a leniency program be included in the competition law to encourage whistle-blowing. Whistle-blowing is more effective (if not the only possible means) to detect and lead to successful prosecution of hardcore cartels, as demonstrated clearly by the recent experiences in the US and the EU. 8. We recommend “partial exemption” of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) from the new law, similar to the US approach. In our view, exemptions of SMEs from regulations of M 2 ̆ 6 As and abuse of dominant position can be justified on economic efficiency grounds. However, price-fixing (market sharing and bid rigging as well) benefits the sellers more than it hurts consumers and hence should be prohibited by law. 9. The safety zone provided by the partial <b>exemption</b> <b>scheme</b> would help reduce SME’s compliance costs and protect them from excessive litigation. At the same time, the law would enable SMEs to sue other players, an option not feasible absent the law, thereby making them better off. 10. No adverse presumption in law should be construed against any type of enterprises, small or big, domestic or foreign. A competition law should neither penalize big players if they are efficient, nor protect small players if they are inefficient. The law is to protect the competition process, not competitors. The government is recommended to do more to educate the public about the nature and essence of competition law...|$|E
