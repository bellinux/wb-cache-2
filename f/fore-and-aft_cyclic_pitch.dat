40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} centre of gravity location on reducing <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> control for helicopter UAV's (unmanned air vehicles) and MAV's (micro air vehicles). Low <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> is a necessity to implement the swashplateless rotor concept using trailing edge flaps or active twist using current generation low authority piezoceramic actuators. Design/methodology/approach – An aeroelastic analysis of the helicopter rotor with elastic blades is used to perform parametric and sensitivity studies {{of the effects of}} longitudinal and lateral center of gravity (cg) movements on the main rotor <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch.</b> An optimization approach is then used to find cg locations which reduce the <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> at a given forward speed. Findings – It is found that the longitudinal <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> and lateral <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> can be driven to zero at a given forward speed by shifting the cg forward and to the port side, respectively. There also exist pairs of numbers for the longitudinal and lateral cg locations which drive both the <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> components to zero at a given forward speed. Based on these results, a compromise optimal cg location is obtained such that the <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> is bounded within ± 5 ° for a BO 105 helicopter rotor. Originality/value – The reduction in the <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> due to helicopter cg location is found to significantly reduce the maximum magnitudes of the control angles in flight, facilitating the swashplateless rotor concept.

This work was performed to investigate performance fluctuation of a floating wind turbine utilizing <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> control. The experiment was carried out in an open wind tunnel with mainstream wind velocity of 10 m/s with the front inflow wind and the oblique inflow wind conditions. A model wind turbine is two-bladed downwind wind turbine with diameter of 1. 6 m. Moment and force acts on the model wind turbine are measured by a six-component balance. Fluctuation of power coefficient and thrust coefficient is investigated in the <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> control. The model wind turbine and the experimental conditions were simulated by FAST code.

The helicopter model is encapsulated in a background region and the ow eld is solved using Star CCM+. A surface and volume mesh continuum was generated that contained approximately seven million polyhedral cells, where the Finite Volume Method (FVM) was chosen as a discretization technique. Each blade was assigned to an overset region {{making it possible to}} rotate and add a <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> motion. Boundary information was exchanged between the overset and background mesh using a weighted interpolation method between cells. An implicit unsteady ow solver, with an ideal gas and a SST (Mentar) K-Omega turbulence model were used. Hover and forward cases were examined. Forward ight cases were done by changing the rotor shaft angle of attacks and the collective pitch angle 0 at the helicopter freestream Mach number of M = 0 : 128, without the inclusion of a <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> motion. An additional ight case with <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> motion was examined at s = 0 and = 0. Each simulation took roughly 48 hours with a total of 96 parallel cores to compute. Experimental data were taken from an existing NASA report for comparison of the results. Hover ight coincided well with the wind tunnel data. The forward ight cases (with no cyclic motion) produced lift matching the experimental data, but had diculties in producing a forward thrust. Moments in roll and pitch started to emerge. By adding a <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> successfully removed the pitch and roll moments. In conclusion this shows that applying overset meshes as a way to analyze the main-rotor blades using CFD does work.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the use of}} {{individual}} blade pitch control {{as a way to}} reduce ultimate loads. This load alleviation strategy exploits the fact that <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitching</b> of the blades induces in general a reduction of the average loading of a wind turbine, at least for some components as the main bearing, the yaw bearing, or the tower. When ultimate loads are generated during shutdowns, the effect of the use of <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> results in reduced peak loads. In fact, as the machine starts from a less stressed condition, the response to an extreme gust or other event will result in reduced loading on its components. This form of load mitigation {{can be seen as a}} preventative load mitigation strategy: the effect on load reduction is obtained without the need to detect and react to an extreme event, but by simply unloading the machine so that, in case an extreme event happens, the result will be less severe. The effect of peak load mitigation by preventative <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> is investigated with reference to a multi-MW wind turbine, by using high-fidelity aeroelastic simulations in a variety of operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|A heavily {{instrumented}} 1 : 5 scaled {{model of}} the ERICA tilt-wing configuration has been tested in the DNW-LLF wind tunnel {{as part of the}} EU co-funded NICETRIP project. Tests were made for a variety of conditions ranging from pure helicopter and conversion corridor cases up to a low speed aircraft mode, with appropriate changes in tilt rotor and outer wing pitching angles. In total over 400 test conditions were measured. Rotor forces and moments have been measured with rotor balances. Blade bending moment and torsion as well as rotor shaft bending and torque were measured with calibrated strain gauge sensors. Measurements were made for fully trimmed and for non-trimmed conditions. The four bladed rotors are counter-rotating, are rigid in plane and allow <b>cyclic</b> blade <b>pitch</b> control through a remote controlled swash plate. Since <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> control caused damage to the blade pitch bearings, most of the test conditions had to be done without <b>cyclic</b> blade <b>pitch</b> control, leading to a large in-plane moment in the rotor plane and high bending moments in the rotor shaft. Some test cases were both measured with and without <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> control. The present paper analysis the rotor induced forces, moments and nacelle vibrations for the trimmed conditions. Both steady and dynamic contents of the signals are analyzed. It is found that with <b>cyclic</b> blade <b>pitch</b> control the time mean rotor in-plane forces and moments and the 1 /rev rotor shaft and blade bending moments are effectively suppressed, but the dynamic components of the rotor in-plane forces and moments become larger than without <b>cyclic</b> blade <b>pitch</b> control. Without <b>cyclic</b> blade <b>pitch</b> control the 1 /rev blade and rotor shaft bending moments become quite large and, rather surprisingly, for some of these test conditions also a large 2 /rev blade bending moment is observed. Careful analysis of the data suggests that the 2 /rev flap bending is caused by a 1 /rev excitation (in the non-rotating system) of both nacelles, caused by the proximity of the nominal rotor rpm frequency to symmetric and anti-symmetric nacelle torsion eigen-frequency and probably also in combination with other nacelle related eigen-modes. The measured data are well suited to validate or verify existing semi-empirical or CFD methods to predict the steady and unsteady loads of the rotors. A correlation between rotor dynamics and (outer) wing dynamic loading and the influence of the outer wing and/or flaperon setting on the rotor forces and moments is left for future anal-ysis.

The primary objective is to generate a database on aeroelastic stability in trimmed flight for torsionally soft rotors at realistic tip speeds. The rotor test model has four soft inplane blades of NACA 0012 airfoil section with low torsional stiffness. The collective pitch and shaft tilt are set prior to each test run, and then the rotor is trimmed in the following sense: the longitudinal and lateral <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> controls are adjusted through a swashplate to minimize the 1 /rev flapping moment at the 12 percent radial station. In hover, the database comprises lag regressive-mode damping with pitch variations. In forward flight the database comprises <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> controls, root flap moment and lag regressive-mode damping with advance ratio, shaft angle and pitch variations.

The trim analysis of finding, the cyclic controls and the corresponding, periodic responses is based on periodic shooting with damped Newton iteration; the Floquet transition matrix (FTM) comes out as a byproduct. The stabillty analysis of finding the frequencies and damping levels is based on the eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis of the FTM.

5000|$|The Norélic was a {{prototype}} two-seat, single rotor helicopter {{with an unusual}} anti-torque system, without a manual <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> control.

[...] The [...] Mathis G.7R seven-cylinder radial engine was immediately behind them, with its crankshaft vertical; the Norélic was the first French helicopter with its engine in this orientation. The driveshaft rose through the fuselage to the rotor hub, which was slightly offset forwards on a two side-by-side pillar, faired support. The Norélic had a two-blade articulated rotor with undamped flapping hinges; the blades had the same chord and aerofoil from hub to tip and were each built around a single solid spar with ribs and a thin metal skin, all clamped together. Blade pitch was automatically controlled by small servo or pilot airfoils mounted on rods at right-angles to the rotors. Though reminiscent of the servos on the Hiller 360, those on the Norélic were themselves flappable and were intended to control both <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> and the flapping amplitude of the main rotors. Thus the cockpit <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> control was absent, and instead roll was produced by sideways motion of the hub via its parallel support pillars, which separated the centres of lift and gravity. Effects due to variations in the position of the centre of gravity could be trimmed out by longitudinal movements of the hub. The servo blades also served as rotor speed governors; restrained by springs, they could slide outward as the rotor speed began to increase, increasing the pitch and the associated drag to decrease the speed. Collective pitch was thus primarily determined by throttle setting, though there was a collective pitch override lever.|$|R
