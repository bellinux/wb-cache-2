2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads and both the nut and bolt are, ideally, independently supported, the nut by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the thread flanks when subjected to radial loads, which would contribute substantially to <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of nut and bolt be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|E

50|$|An engine {{has many}} moving parts that produce friction. Some of these <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> remain {{constant}} (as long as applied load is constant); {{some of these}} friction losses increase as engine speed increases, such as piston side forces and connecting bearing forces (due to increased inertia forces from the oscillating piston). A few <b>friction</b> <b>forces</b> decrease at higher speed, such as the friction force on the cam's lobes used to operate the inlet and outlet valves (the valves' inertia at high speed tends to pull the cam follower away from the cam lobe). Along with <b>friction</b> <b>forces,</b> an operating engine has pumping losses, which is the work required to move air {{into and out of}} the cylinders. This pumping loss is minimal at low speed, but increases approximately as the square of the speed, until at rated power an engine is using about 20% of total power production to overcome friction and pumping losses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy logic controller {{for the control}} system of the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> in the high-speed trains. <b>Friction</b> <b>force</b> is necessary for reduction of skidding phenomena. It is possible to transmit the maximum traction effort to the wheel {{and to have the}} relative maximum speed only with an optimal control system for the <b>friction</b> <b>force.</b> The value of <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> is under uncertain situations and it depends on many factors. This paper introduces a fuzzy logic approach for the control system of <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> in high speed railway. This kind of approach has been chosen because the fuzzy logic controller is capable of making inferences even under uncertainty. The results have been obtained with a simulator of an italian high speed train the FS ETR 500 and they demonstrate that a train can run at an high speed with minimum skidding phenomena.

40|$|Laparoscopic graspers {{require a}} high pinch force to {{generate}} sufficient <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> (grip) for tissue manipulation. Excessive or insufficient pinch forces distributed along the small contact area of laparoscopic graspers can cause damage and {{are one of}} the reasons why the risk of intraoperative complications during Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures in the abdomen is 2 - 4 % higher compared to open surgery. The goal of this research was to develop and evaluate an 5 mm laparoscopic grasper, which has the same functionality (generated <b>friction</b> <b>force,</b> grasping time) as a conventional grasper for use on the intestine but which requires lower pinch force due to the use of adhesives. To lower the pinch force the adhesive component of the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> was enlarged by introducing a muco-adhesive between tissue and grasper. To lower (local) high pressures a flat surface was used. Two experiments were conducted to find out in which direction the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> generated by the adhesive film was the largest and to find the minimum required area of adhesive film to generate a force of 5 N. Next, a design for the tip and a design for the adhesive film feed mechanism was made. To evaluate the design a prototype was created, which was used to investigate whether the proposed tip design was able to generate a <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> of 5 N using a pinch force lower than 3 N. The prototype of the adhesive grasper was able to generate a <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> of 3. 12 ± 0. 58 N, while using a pinch force of 2. 5 N. The generated <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> did not meet the goal of 5 N, but the concept of lowering the pinch force by introducing an adhesive layer is promising; the pinch force needed by the proposed tip is lower compared to existing graspers and the <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> was independent of the generated pinch <b>force.</b> The <b>friction</b> <b>force</b> can be increased further by developing a new adhesive film or by increasing the contact area.
