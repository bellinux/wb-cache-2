Despite the isosceles triangle restriction is not necessary, in view of the complexity of the explicit algebraic solution for the symmetric case, one can guessing the impossibility of achieving an explicit relationship for the asymmetric case (the more general case: ABC ≡ right-angled scalene triangle). For this case is given a proof of existence and uniqueness of solution and a proof of the impossibility of getting such a relationship, even implicitly, if the sextic equation (2. 54) it isn't solvable. Nevertheless, in (2. 56) - (2. 58) it is shown the way to solve the asymmetric case under the condition that (2. 54) be solvable. Furthermore, it is proved that with a slight modification in the final set of variables (F), it is still possible to establish a relation between them, see (2. 59) and (2. 61), which provides a bridge that connects the primitive relationship by means of numerical methods, for every given right-angled triangle ABC.

40|$|From {{the time}} of the Greeks, primality testing and {{factoring}} have fascinated mathematicians, and for centuries following the Greeks primality testing and factorization were pursued by enthusiasts and professional mathematicians for their intrisic value. There was little practical application. One example application was {{to determine whether or not}} the Fermat numbers, that is, numbers of the form F;, = 2 '" + 1 were prime. <b>Fermat</b> <b>conjectured</b> that for all n they were prime. For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, the Fermat numbers are prime, but Euler showed that F; was not prime and to date no F,, n 2 5 has been found to be prime. Thus, for nearly 2000 years primality testing and factorization was largely pure mathematics. This all changed in the mid 1970 's with the advent of public key cryptography. Large prime numbers are used in generating keys in many public key cryptosystems and the security of many of these cryptosystems depends on the difficulty of factoring numbers with large prime factors. Thus, the race was on to develop new algorithms to determine the primality or otherwise of a given large integer and to determine the factors of given large integers. The development of such algorithms continues today. This thesis develops both of these themes. The first part of this thesis deals with primality testing and after a brief introduction to primality testing a new probabilistic primality algorithm, ALI, is introduced. It is analysed in detail and compared to Fermat and Miller-Rabin primality tests. It is shown that the ALI algorithm is more efficient than the Miller-Rabin algorithm in some aspects. The second part of the thesis deals with factoring and after looking closely at various types of algorithms a new algorithm, RAK, is presented. It is analysed in detail and compared with Fermat factorization. The RAK algorithm is shown to be significantly more efficient than the Fermat factoring algorithm. A number of enhancements is made to the basic RAK algorithm in order to improve its performance. The RAK algorithm with its enhancements is known as IMPROVEDRAK. In conjunction with this work on factorization an improvement to Shor's factoring algorithm is presented. For many integers Shor's algorithm uses a quantum computer multiple times to factor a composite number into its prime factors. It is shown that Shor's alorithm can be modified in a way such that the use of a quantum computer is required just once. The common thread throughout this thesis is the application of factoring and primality testing techniques to integer types which commonly occur in public key cryptosystems. Thus, this thesis contributes not only in the area of pure mathematics but also in the very contemporary area of cryptology...|$|R

40|$|Many {{fundamental}} questions in additive number theory (such as Goldbach's <b>conjecture,</b> <b>Fermat's</b> last theorem, and the Twin Primes conjecture) {{can be expressed}} {{in the language of}} sum and difference sets. As a typical pair of elements contributes one sum and two differences, we expect that |A-A| > |A+A| for a finite set A. However, in 2006 Martin and O'Bryant showed that a positive proportion of subsets of { 0, [...] ., n} are sum-dominant, and Zhao later showed that this proportion converges to a positive limit as n →∞. Related problems, such as constructing explicit families of sum-dominant sets, computing the value of the limiting proportion, and investigating the behavior as the probability of including a given element in A to go to zero, have been analyzed extensively. We consider many of these problems in a more general setting. Instead of just one set A, we study sums and differences of pairs of correlated sets (A,B). Specifically, we place each element a ∈{ 0, [...] ., n} in A with probability p, while a goes in B with probability ρ_ 1 if a ∈ A and probability ρ_ 2 if a ∈ A. If |A+B| > |(A-B) ∪ (B-A) |, we call the pair (A,B) a sum-dominant (p,ρ_ 1, ρ_ 2) -pair. We prove that for any fixed ρ⃗=(p, ρ_ 1, ρ_ 2) in (0, 1) ^ 3, (A,B) is a sum-dominant (p,ρ_ 1, ρ_ 2) -pair with positive probability, and show that this probability approaches a limit P(ρ⃗). Furthermore, we show that the limit function P(ρ⃗) is continuous. We also investigate what happens as p decays with n, generalizing results of Hegarty-Miller on phase transitions. Finally, we find the smallest sizes of MSTD pairs. Comment: Version 1. 0, 19 pages. Keywords: More Sum Than Difference sets, correlated random variables, phase transitio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} {{a family of}} Diophantine triples {c 1 (t), c 2 (t), c 3 (t) } such that the elliptic curve over Q(t) induced by this triple, i. e. : y 2 = (c 1 (t) x + 1) (c 2 (t) x + 1) (c 3 (t) x + 1) has torsion group isomorphic to Z/ 2 Z × Z/ 2 Z and rank 5. This represents an improvement of the result of A. Dujella, who showed a family of this kind with rank 4. By specialization we obtain two examples of elliptic curves over Q with torsion group Z/ 2 Z × Z/ 2 Z and rank equal to 11. This is also an improvement over the known results relating this kind of curves. 1. Diophantine triples and elliptic curves Definition. A set {c 1, c 2, [...] ., cm} of non-zero integers (rationals) is called a (rational) D(n) -m-tuple if ci · cj + n is a perfect square for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m. A D(1) -m-tuple is also called a Diophantine m-tuple. The first rational Diophantine quadruple, the set { 1 / 16, 33 / 16, 17 / 4, 105 / 16 } was found by Diophantus of Alexandria (for {{the history of the}} problem see e. g. [Di]). It is well-known that there exist infinitely many rational Diophantine quadruples and quintuples (see e. g. [D 2]) and several examples of rational Diophantine sextuples were found recently by Gibbs [G 1] and Dujella [D 7]. Euler proved that there exist infinitely many integer Diophantine quadruples (the first such set { 1, 3, 8, 120 } was found by <b>Fermat).</b> A famous <b>conjecture</b> is that there does not exist an integer Diophantine quintuple (see e. g. [Gu]). Baker and Davenport [BD] proved that Fermat’s quadruple cannot be extended to a Diophantine quintuple. It is known that there does not exist a Diophantine sextuple and there are only finitely many (at most 10276) Diophantine quintuples [D 5, F]. Let {c 1, c 2, c 3, c 4 } be a rational Diophantine quadruple. Consider a subtriple {c 1, c 2, c 3 } and define the elliptic curve by the equatio...|$|R
