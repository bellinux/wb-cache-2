[...] The gravitational restoring force from a bend is substantially weaker in finite or inhomogeneous galaxies than in infinite sheets and slabs, {{since there is}} less matter at large distances {{to contribute to the}} restoring force. As a result, the long-wavelength modes are not stabilized by gravity, as implied by the dispersion relation derived above.

The buckling behaviour of these structures in bending is complex due to the coupling between cross-section ovalisation and local bifurcation buckling. Analytical treatments of this problem have a history going back almost a century and still constitute an active and challenging research area. This paper investigates in detail the effect of cylinder length on the nonlinear elastic buckling behaviour of clamped cylindrical tubes under <b>global</b> <b>bending,</b> covering a very wide range of lengths. It is found that the behaviour may be classified into four distinct length-dependent domains with clearly-defined boundaries which have here been assigned the names ‘short’, ‘medium’, ‘transitional’ and ‘long’.

40|$|Nowadays, {{research}} on dynamic behavior of structural components is {{becoming one of}} the important parts in the design process for any mechanical system. In order to determine the dynamic behavior of a vibrating structure, measurements of the dynamic properties of structure are essential. Free vibration analysis is one of the approaches that apply the finite element method in determining the structure modes of vibration. Each mode is defined by its natural frequency and mode shape. In this paper, the free vibration analysis of grass trimmer was performed using commercial finite element software, such as Ansys®. The importance of determining these vibration characteristics are crucial as grass trimmer is a common machine that exposed to the dynamic and static forces coming from the engine and rotating blade.

40|$|Liquid crystal {{variable}} retarders (LCVRs) {{are starting}} to be widely used in optical systems because of their capacity to provide a controlled variable optical retardance between two orthogonal components of incident polarized light or to introduce a known phase shifting (PS) between coherent waves, both {{by means of an}} applied voltage. Typically, the retardance or PS introduced by an LCVR is not homogeneous across the aperture. On the one hand, the LCVR glass substrates present a <b>global</b> <b>bend</b> that causes an overall variation of the retardance or PS. On the other hand, in the manufacturing process of an LCVR, there sometimes appears a set of micro-air bubbles that causes local retardance or PS inhomogeneities. In this work, we present an interferometric technique based on a Mach–Zehnder interferometer that is insensitive to vibrations and capable of inspecting and characterizing the LCVR’s retardance or PS inhomogeneities. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated in the experimental results, where the LCVR retardance is measured with an error of about 0 : 2 rad.

For example, {{it can be used}} to calculate the crack growth rate for stress corrosion cracking and to calculate the elastic J value which is needed to obtain the total J value for crack stability calculations. Thus, numerous SIF solutions have been published for circumferential TWCs in cylinders under axial tension and <b>global</b> <b>bending.</b> However, recently, it has been indicated that there is a need (e. g., for xLPR software code and ASME BPV Code Case N- 513) to expand the solutions to wider ranges of crack lengths and cylinder geometries.

From these comparisons, it was demonstrated that the Zang (SINTAP) solution provided the most accurate results. Hence, additional FE calculations were performed to expand the Zang (SINTAP) solution to cover Ri/t between 2 and 100 and crack length between 1 % and 85 % of the cylinder circumference.

It is established that as a typical structural component a hollow section distinguishes itself from its solid counterpart with two characteristic features of the response. First, a considerably larger kinetic energy is generated in the hollow section beam as the impulsive load is imparted on the upper flange of the beam having a significantly lower mass than the member. Second, a considerable proportion of the blast energy can be absorbed by the local collapse of the section. A two-phase analytical model is proposed. In the first phase, the local collapse of the thin-walled cross-section is determined by using an upper bound approach; and in the subsequent second phase, the <b>global</b> <b>bending</b> of the beam with the distorted section is analyzed by {{taking into account the}} effect of axial force.

40|$|Thin {{cylindrical}} shells {{are commonly}} employed in civil and structural applications {{in which the}} dominant loading condition is <b>global</b> <b>bending.</b> In applications such as wind turbine towers and offshore piles, {{the design of the}} structure is commonly limited by buckling. The traditional approach to improving buckling strength pursuant of greater design economy is to use steel ring and/or axial stiffeners. However, the total steel tonnage may be reduced with stiffeners, but the additional fabrication costs can limit the cost advantage. Meanwhile, it has long been observed in the silo industry that granular filled cylinders exhibit strength gains due to the internal pressure and stiffness of the granular bulk solid against the shell wall. For large diameter fabricated steel tubes in bending, an elastic granular fill may be useful in replacing ring stiffeners, increasing critical buckling moments, and reducing risk by providing more stable postbuckling behaviour. However, the strength gains related to the elastic stiffness of a granular core has received very little attention and has been limited to the axial loading condition. In the project work, the candidate uses theoretical and computational methods to investigate the effects of an elastic granular fill on the buckling strength of cylindrical shells subject to <b>global</b> <b>bending.</b> In particular, cylinders in the elastic-plastic range will be considered in order to represent applications such as wind turbine towers and offshore piles.

It can be noted that the individual cracks are not captured in the given FE model due to the underlying element definitions, i.e. embedded reinforcement and size of the shell elements being equal to the actual crack distance (40 – 50  mm).

With the help of a numerical approach based on a small deflection formulation, three examples are given. The first example which utilizes parameters selected from a typical pipe-whip test is compared with experimental data and gives a good prediction of the degree of ovalization of the cross-section, the distribution of plastic work in the pipe and the instantaneous deformation of the pipe. Additional examples consider various pulse loadings and constitutive relations to demonstrate that the evolution of softening can undergo three stages, viz. initial softening of one cross-section, growth of the softening region and finally shrinking of the softening region to a particular cross-section which exhibits a sharp localization of the bending deformation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sandwich {{structures}} {{consisting of}} high-modulus thin skins and a low-modulus thick core {{are sensitive to}} local loading, which causes local indentation. Classical approaches deter-mine the deflection of sandwich structures by a superposition method where the local compres-sion of the core for a panel on a rigid foundation is added to <b>global</b> sandwich <b>bending</b> without core compression. In this article, a sandwich plate is analyzed using a higher-order sandwich panel theory (HOSPT) where the faces are modelled by classical laminate theory and the core by a three-dimensional elasticity solution. The results are obtained from 14 partial differential equa-tions for displacements of the faces and core. HOSPT determines core compression with a second-order distribution of displacement through the core thickness. The force versus core compression relations in the fully backed and clamped states are compared and it is shown that the core compression assumed in the classical approach differs from the core compression in a clamped state. Results are verified by ANSYS FEM software and experimental data. A few sandwich panel specimens were made with glass reinforced plastic (GRP) skins and a polyure-thane foam core.

Studies of the photochemistry of Pt(IV) complexes by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and spectroscopic methods show close agreement. Broad exploration of cis/trans geometries, trans influences, {{the nature of the}} OR− and (pseudo) halogen ligands, electron-withdrawing/donating/ delocalizing substituents on the N-ligands, and intramolecular H-bonds shows that (1) the design of platinum(IV) complexes with intense bands shifted towards longer wavelengths (330 nm) can be achieved by introducing intramolecular Hbonds involving the OH ligands and 2 -hydroxyquinoline or by iodido ligands, (2) mesomeric electron-withdrawing substituents on pyridine result in low-energy absorption with significant intensity in the visible region, and (3) the distinct makeup of the molecular orbitals in electronic transitions for cis/trans-Pt(N 3) 2 isomers result in different photoproducts. In general, the comparison of the optimised geometries shows that Pt(IV) complexes with longer Pt−L bonds are more likely to undergo photoreduction with longer-wavelength light. Complex trans, trans, trans-[Pt(N 3) 2 (OH) 2 (NH 3) (4 -nitropyridine) ] was first synthesised. The experimental UV-Vis spectrum in aqueous solution correlates well with the intense band in the computed spectrum whereas the overlay in the low-energy absorption region can be improved by a solvent model. This combined computational and experimental study shows that TDDFT can be a design tool to tune the coordination environment for optimizing photoactive Pt(IV) compounds as anticancer agents without immediate need for synthesis. Additionally, molecular modeling is used to study DNA distortions induced by binding metal-containing fragments derived from cisdiamminodichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) and a new class of photoactive platinum anticancer drugs. Ligand field molecular mechanics (LFMM) parameters for Pt– guanine interactions are derived and validated against a range of experimental structures from the Cambridge Structural Database, published quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) structures of model Pt-DNA systems and additional DFT studies. LFMM gives a good description of the local Ptguanine coordination {{at a fraction of the}} computational cost of QM/MM methods. The force field is then used to develop protocols for ligand field molecular dynamics (LFMD) simulations using experimentally characterised bifunctional DNA adducts involving both an intra- and an interstrand crosslink of cisplatin as a prelude to studying the interaction of trans-Pt(py) 22 + (P, py = pyridine), the major photoproduct of the novel platinum(IV) complex trans,trans,trans- [Pt(N 3) 2 (OH) 2 (py) 2] (17), with the DNA duplex dodecamer, d(C 1 C 2 T 3 C 4 T 5 C 6 G 7 T 8 C 9 T 10 C 11 C 12) • d(G 13 G 14 A 15 G 16 A 17 C 18 G 19 A 20 G 21 A 22 G 23 G 24). Based on the observed formation of a trans species when 17 is photoreduced in the presence of 5 ’-guanosine monophosphate plus the major-groove binding mode of the monofunctional complex cis-Pt(NH 3) 2 (py) 2 +, P is proposed to coordinate to G 7 and G 19.

By the numerical and experimental comparison, calibrated model could reproduce accelerations up to 30 Hz both of on the time and frequency domains accurately. Especially, good agreements on sleeper accelerations can indicate the high reproducibility of interaction force, which is one of key factors of train-track-bridge interaction simulation.

The information for the prediction models derive from the visual grading and localized mechanical testing of 20 beams retrieved from the same building, which have been scope of analysis in previous studies. Although the results indicate moderate correlations between predicted and experimental results, significant percentage errors are also found. To minimize the percentage error between experimental and predicted values, coefficients corresponding to the scale effect relation between existing chestnut timber elements with round cross section and sawn beams of smaller dimensions with rectangular cross section were proposed.

40|$|The large {{deflection}} flexural behaviour, particularly in plastic range, of beams of right-angle section under four-point symmetric bending is investigated thoroughly. Experiments {{were carried out}} for symmetric bending of aluminium alloy L-beams to observe the global load-deflection characteristics, {{as well as the}} distortion of cross-sections. The effect of supporting condition in the four-point bending on the global behaviour of the L-beams was also examined experimentally. By considering the geometrical change of beam and the plastic energy dissipations due to the <b>global</b> <b>bending</b> of beam and the angular distortion of cross-sections, a rigid, linear hardening model is proposed. The model is capable of predicting the cross-sectional distortion and the structural softening behaviour observed in the experiments with a reasonable accuracy. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In {{durability}} {{analysis and}} life-cycle assessment of concrete structures transport of chlorides and other aggressive agents is generally described by using Fick’s laws of diffusion. This model is frequently applied in a simplified one-dimensional (1 D) form. However, in practical applications the diffusion process is more properly described by two- or three-dimensional patterns of concentration gradients. In this paper, {{the accuracy of}} the 1 D modelling of diffusion {{and its impact on the}} life-cycle assessment of concrete structures under corrosion is evaluated in deterministic and probabilistic terms with respect to more accurate twodimensional (2 D) formulations. The influence of the diffusion modelling on the time-variant corrosion damage of concrete cross-sections is studied with reference to the local damage of the reinforcing steel bars and the <b>global</b> deterioration of <b>bending</b> moment–curvature capacity curves. The results show that 2 D diffusion models may be necessary for a realistic life-cycle assessment of concrete structures under corrosion, since 1 D models can lead to significant inaccuracies depending on the geometrical aspect ratio of the cross-section, location of reinforcing steel bars and exposure conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Members of the periplasmic binding protein (PBP) {{superfamily}} {{are involved}} in transport and signaling processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Biological responses are typically mediated by ligand-induced conformational changes in which the binding event is coupled to a hinge-bending motion that brings together two domains in a closed form. In all PBP-mediated biological processes, downstream partners recognize the closed form of the protein. This motion has also been exploited in protein engineering experiments to construct biosensors that transduce ligand binding {{to a variety of}} physical signals. Understanding the mechanistic details of PBP conformational changes, both <b>global</b> (hinge <b>bending,</b> twisting, shear movements) and local (rotamer changes, backbone motion), therefore is not only important for understanding their biological function but also for protein engineering experiments. Results Here we present biochemical characterization and crystal structure determination of the periplasmic ribose-binding protein (RBP) from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima in its ribose-bound and unliganded state. The T. maritima RBP (tmRBP) has 39 % sequence identity and is considerably more resistant to thermal denaturation (app T m value is 108 °C) than the mesophilic Escherichia coli homolog (ecRBP) (app T m value is 56 °C). Polar ligand interactions and ligand-induced global conformational changes are conserved among ecRBP and tmRBP; however local structural rearrangements involving side-chain motions in the ligand-binding site are not conserved. Conclusion Although the large-scale ligand-induced changes are mediated through similar regions, and are produced by similar backbone movements in tmRBP and ecRBP, the small-scale ligand-induced structural rearrangements differentiate the mesophile and thermophile. This suggests there are mechanistic differences in the manner by which these two proteins bind their ligands and are an example of how two structurally similar proteins utilize different mechanisms to form a ligand-bound state. </p...|$|R
40|$|Self-gravitating stellar disks with {{random motion}} support both {{exponentially}} growing and, in some cases, purely oscillatory axisymmetric bending modes, unlike their cold disk counterparts. A razor-thin disk with even {{a very small}} degree of random motion in the plane is both unstable and possesses a discrete spectrum of neutral modes, irrespective of the sharpness of the edge. Random motion normal to the disk plane has a stabilizing effect {{but at the same}} time allows bending waves to couple to the internal vibrations of the particles, which causes the formerly neutral modes to decay through Landau damping. Focusing first on instabilities, I here determine the degree of random motion normal to the plane needed to suppress <b>global,</b> axisymmetric, <b>bending</b> instabilities in a family of self-gravitating disks. As found previously, bending instabilities are suppressed only when the thickness exceeds that expected from a naïve local criterion when the degree of pressure support within the disk plane is comparable to, or exceeds, the support from rotation. A modest disk thickness is adequate for the bending stability of most disk galaxies, except perhaps near their centers. The discretization of the neutral spectrum in a zero-thickness disk is due to the existence of a turning point for bending waves in a warm disk, which is absent when the disk is cold. When the disk is given a finite thickness, the discrete neutral modes generally become strongly damped through wave-particle interactions. It is surprising therefore that I find some simulations of warm, stable disks can support (quasi-) neutral, large-scale, bending modes that decay very slowly, if at all.
