5|$|Wyatt {{had been}} an {{assistant}} marshal when he and policeman James Masterson, {{along with a few}} other citizens, fired their pistols at several cowboys who were fleeing town after shooting up a theater. A member of the group, George Hoyt (sometimes spelled Hoy), was shot in the arm and died of his wound a month later. Wyatt always claimed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to shoot Hoyt, although it could have been anyone among the lawmen. Wyatt had developed a reputation as a no-nonsense, hard-nosed lawman, but prior to the gunfight in October 1881, he had been involved in only one other shooting, in Dodge City, Kansas during the summer of 1878.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Skinner arrives home he is met by Mulder, {{who tells}} {{him about the}} case {{and the fact that}} someone is going to great lengths to cover it up. Mulder reveals that Detective Thomas was killed, which shocks Skinner. Mulder tells Skinner that Scully is {{undergoing}} tests regarding her cancer. Later that night Skinner meets with The Smoking Man, who is accompanied by Thomas' murderer, the Gray Haired Man (Morris Panych). Skinner is angry that Thomas was killed and wants to end their arrangement, which The Smoking Man refuses to allow. Mulder calls Skinner, telling him about the woman's body being burned and the blood evidence being tampered with. Mulder tells Skinner that he is trying to match the bullet that killed Thomas to a gun issued to a federal agent or local officer. Skinner searches his drawer and realizes that his gun was missing and must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> used for the murder. Skinner, realizing he has been set up, calls The Smoking Man, who confirms that Thomas was killed with Skinner's gun and that by going to the police Skinner would end up implicating himself in the murder. The Smoking Man refuses to provide any details on what he is covering up.|$|E

25|$|Test {{audience}} reactions led {{to several}} minor changes before {{the film was}} released. Originally, {{it was clear that}} Carmen was torn between Rico and Zander. Test audiences, regardless of gender, strongly felt that a woman could not love two men at once, so scenes which portrayed this were cut. These audiences also felt it was immoral for Carmen to choose a career ahead of being loyal to Rico, to the extent that many commented that, in so doing, Carmen should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to die instead of Dizzy. While admitting {{it may have been a}} bad commercial decision not to change the film to accommodate this, the directors did cut a scene from after Zander's death where Carmen and Rico kiss, which the audience believed made the previous betrayal even more immoral.|$|E
25|$|Saint Rumwold is {{reported}} to have been born in Walton Grounds, near King's Sutton in Northamptonshire, which was at that time part of the Mercian royal estates, possessing a court house and other instruments of government. The field in which he was born, where a chapel once stood on the supposed spot, may still be seen. King's Sutton parish church claims that its Saxon or Norman font may well <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> where Saint Rumwold was baptised. There are two wells associated with his name: in Astrop, just outside Kings' Sutton, and at Brackley and Buckingham, where his relics once lay. Church dedications largely follow the missionary activity of Saint Wilfrid, who was the personal chaplain of King Alhfrith (source: Bede), but once spread as far as North Yorkshire, Lincoln, Essex and Dorset.|$|E
25|$|He was {{involved}} in a bizarre run-out with Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the third Test against New Zealand in 2006. Morton drove the ball to mid-on where Daniel Vettori was fielding and ran to the non striker end. Chanderpaul, at the other end, initially took a few steps down the wicket but then turned {{and went back to the}} non-striker's end. Morton believed he was out, and, furious at his captain, began to walk off. However, following a call to the third umpire, it was decided that Morton had grounded his bat at the non-striker's end just before Chanderpaul, and hence was safe and that Chanderpaul was out. Video evidence suggests that the umpire's decision was wrong: although Morton made his ground first, he then left it before the run-out was made, so he should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> dismissed.|$|E

25|$|Caccini's {{character}} {{seems to}} have been less than perfectly honorable, as he was frequently motivated by envy and jealousy, not only in his professional life but for personal advancement with the Medici. On one occasion, he informed to the Grand Duke Francesco on two lovers in the Medici householdEleonora, the wife of Pietro de' Medici, who was having an illicit affair with Bernardino Antinoriand his informing led directly to Eleonora's murder by Pietro. His rivalry with both Emilio de' Cavalieri and Jacopo Peri {{seems to have}} been intense: he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who arranged for Cavalieri to be removed from his post as director of festivities for the wedding of Henry IV of France and Maria de' Medici in 1600 (an event which caused Cavalieri to leave Florence in fury), and he also seems to have rushed his own opera Euridice into print before Peri's opera on the same subject could be published, while simultaneously ordering his group of singers to {{have nothing to do with}} Peri's production.|$|E

[...] After the Baylor game, Schembechler said the team lacked leadership. [...] Bell may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> player to whom Bo's criticism did not apply, as he had a career-long 64-yard kickoff return against Baylor, scored both of Michigan's touchdowns, and rushed for 89yards in 26carries.

While there, he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who carved his name into the wall of the Sistine Chapel; a [...] "JOSQUINJ" [...] was recently revealed by workers restoring the chapel. Since it was traditional for singers to carve their names into the walls, and hundreds of names were inscribed there during the period from the 15th to the 18th centuries, it is considered highly likely that the graffiti is by Josquin– and if so, it would be his only surviving autograph.|$|E

[...] They travel to Matthew's home in the suburbs, meeting the brother, his wife, and their children. Matthew professes to no knowledge of the location of his brother. Olivia is suspicious of Matthew's behavior but does not explore further. Olivia's suspicion is shown to be correct as Matthew is revealed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> trapped in the amber, having tried to come warn his brother about the quarantine. Joshua, having posed as Matthew for the last few years, was the one that freed him and spoke to Fringe.

[...] He pleaded guilty to motor vehicle theft, aggravated robbery and first-degree murder on September 18, 1987. Parsons' sentence was decided by a jury. Parsons {{said that he was}} defending himself with a four-inch knife when Ernest grabbed his leg and thought that Ernest's multiple wounds were [...] "superficial." [...] Parsons was unable to present evidence to corroborate his claim of a sexual advance by Ernest. Ernest's family and friends stated in court that Ernest was not gay or bisexual. Prosecution witnesses testified of Parsons' homosexual activity in jail. According to forensic psychiatrist David Tomb from the University of Utah, the descriptions of Parsons' sexual history indicated that he [...] "may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> initiating the contact and became angry when [...] turned him down."

As well as Groening, Simon was often at odds with Brooks and production company Gracie Films and left the show in 1993. Before leaving, he negotiated a deal that saw him receive a share of the show's profits every year, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons {{since the start of the}} show, took over as showrunners for the third season. Compared to being an executive producer, the showrunner position is more involved with the show and acts as head writer and manages the show's production for an entire season. As well as a turnover in the staff, The Simpsons moved the production of the animation from Klasky Csupo to Film Roman in season four.|$|E
500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E
