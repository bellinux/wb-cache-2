5|$|Due to the club's {{financial}} situation, {{the reserve}} team had their wages halved <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season, and by January 1886 the payments made to reserve players were withdrawn altogether, {{although there was}} a possibility of them receiving a bonus {{at the end of the}} season if funds permitted. This resulted in Albion's second team refusing to play against Small Heath Alliance and the game was cancelled. Some of the players were suspended as a result of their actions, but were later re-instated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in the Upper East Side) would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than the ventilation grates ubiquitous {{in the rest of the}} subway system.|$|E
5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being that Ronald Reagan was {{originally}} chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film's development, {{but by that time}} the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered. George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.|$|E

50|$|Grimsby won {{the final}} 1-0 {{thanks to a}} goal from Kevin Donovan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th minute to seal their place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second tier of English football. Grimsby had to wait 120 years to reach Wembley and before this game had won the Auto Windscreens Shield <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season.|$|R
5|$|Shakur's defense {{attorneys}} were William Kunstler (the chief of Shakur's defense staff), Stuart Ball, Robert Bloom, Raymond A. Brown, Stanley Cohen (who died of unknown causes <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Turnpike trial), Lennox Hinds, Florynce Kennedy, Louis Myers, Laurence Stern, and Evelyn Williams, Shakur's aunt. Of these attorneys, Kunstler, Ball, Cohen, Myers, Stern and Williams appeared {{in court for}} the turnpike trial. Kunstler became involved in Shakur's trials in 1975, when contacted by Williams, and commuted from New York City to New Brunswick every day with Stern.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to eschew scripts for storyboards {{is one that}} Hillenburg made <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series' development. Rocko's Modern Life had also used storyboarding, and having worked on that series, Hillenburg felt strongly about adopting the process for SpongeBob SquarePants— even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show greater preference for script-driven cartoons. Another writer for the series, Merriwether Williams, described {{in an interview that}} she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4 o'clock.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} sweep by the attack helicopters, two Chinooks carried the SAS to Gberi Bana. The troopers fast-roped {{into the village}} and {{immediately}} came under fire from the West Side Boys. <b>Early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> confrontation, the British operation sustained its first casualty—a round entered Trooper Bradley Tinnion's flank, leaving him seriously injured. He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the medical team aboard the RFA Sir Percivale, dying despite intensive resuscitation attempts on board. The SAS proceeded to clear the village, engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered, including Foday Kallay.|$|E
25|$|Reading's {{next game}} {{was at home}} to Aston Villa. Shorey scored Reading's first goal in five matches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 90th minute for the Royals, {{but it was all}} too late—Villa had scored two goals <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match through Ashley Young and Marlon Harewood, condemning Reading to 2–1 defeat.|$|R

50|$|After saving Iori, {{everyone}} is playing beside the dock, and Itsuki wonders where Yosuke went. The scene after shows {{the local police}} searching for Yosuke's body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, but to no avail. High above the dam, Yosuke appears on a cliff, smiling, and then his spirit fades away. It is assumed that he died from the stabbing wound inflicted <b>on</b> him <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> OVA.|$|R
5|$|Aged 19, Harvey was the {{youngest}} player of the touring party. An attacking left-handed middle-order batsman, he had become {{the youngest}} Australian to score a Test century by compiling 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer of 1947–48. However, Harvey struggled <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tour, having difficulty adapting to English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team {{in the first half}} of the tour, Harvey's performances improved with his increasing familiarity with local conditions and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley after an injury to Sid Barnes. Harvey scored 112 in a first innings counter-attack to keep Australia in contention after they had suffered a top-order collapse. Harvey hit the winning boundary in the second innings as Australia won the match with a Test world record successful run-chase of 3/404. He retained his place for the Fifth Test, ending the series with 133 runs at a batting average of 66.50.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Pringle, {{who played}} in the First and Second Tests, none of the six new {{selections}} had played in the series so far, but the match followed the old pattern, as the England batting again failed twice against the hostile West Indies pace attack, only Lamb and Smith in the first innings and Gooch in the second offering much resistance. The side fell to a relatively facile defeat against a West Indies team whose own batsmen failed to dominate; they had no need. Curtly Ambrose secured his first man-of-the-match award for taking seven wickets {{at a cost of}} 98 runs - despite being hampered <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match, when a blocked drain resulted in the bowler's run-up area being waterlogged and in some places flooded with overflow rainwater, Ambrose being hapless bowler who was forced to bring the situation {{to the attention of the}} umpires so that play could be suspended and the playing area dried out.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Imperial court, {{administration}} and military, the primary language {{used in the}} eastern Roman provinces even before {{the decline of the}} Western Empire was Greek, having been spoken in the region for centuries before Latin. Following Rome's conquest of the east its 'Pax Romana', inclusionist political practices and development of public infrastructure, facilitated the further spreading and entrenchment of Greek language in the east. Indeed, <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> life of the Roman Empire, Greek had become the common language of the Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and, to a large degree, the lingua franca for trade between provinces and with other nations. Greek for a time became diglossic with the spoken language, known as Koine (eventually evolving into Demotic Greek), used alongside an older written form until Koine won out as the spoken and written standard.|$|E
50|$|Antoine-Curier {{then joined}} Kidderminster Harriers, before joining Rochdale on a non-contract basis. He made five starts and five {{substitute}} appearances for Rochdale, scoring <b>on</b> his debut <b>in</b> a 1-1 draw at Lincoln City. He then left Rochdale to join Sheffield Wednesday, a club he had scored against <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season. He made just one substitute appearance for Wednesday, in a 0-0 draw against Luton Town at Hillsborough.|$|R
30|$|Solely {{authored}} by David Harris, Part V {{consists of two}} concluding chapters that pull together {{the results from the}} excavations into the regional context, reviewed <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book, presenting synthetic accounts of the Neolithic settlement and subsistence and the origins of agriculture in western Central Asia. The volume is supported by a number of appendices, which provide data from the archaeological work undertaken by different members of the team.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2009, {{a series}} of {{injuries}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> England senior squad <b>on</b> tour <b>in</b> South Africa prompted Tredwell's call-up to England's Test squad. Coach Andy Flower described him as a [...] "like for like" [...] replacement for Graeme Swann in case Swann's side injury worsened. <b>Earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tour, he had been added to England's limited overs squad, also as cover for Swann, {{although he did not}} play a game as England won the ODI series 2–1.|$|R
5|$|Drogba {{suffered}} {{a string of}} injuries <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2008–09 season and struggled to regain fitness, missing games from August to November due to knee problems. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} mid-November but there was little reason to celebrate: he incurred disciplinary action and a three-match ban for throwing a coin back into the stands and Chelsea {{suffered a}} League Cup defeat against Burnley. Drogba scored his second goal of the season in a 2–1 victory against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League, while his first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2–0 win against West Bromwich Albion in late December 2008. Having missed many games through injury and suspension, Drogba had lost his first team place and manager Scolari favoured playing Nicolas Anelka as a lone striker rather than pairing the two. However, he resolved to regain his position in the squad.|$|E
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1923 season, Coveleski pitched 27 {{straight}} scoreless innings, winning {{three consecutive}} games during that time. However, he won less frequently {{as the season}} wore on, losing three straight games in mid-August. His last game came on August 15, with over a month left in the season. Coveleski finished {{the season with a}} 13–14 record, his first season with a losing record. Despite that, he had an ERA of 2.76 and five shutouts, both of which led the AL. In 1924, Coveleski struggled, {{and at the end of}} May, he had four losses and an ERA of 6.49. By the end of the season, he had a 15–16 record and a 4.04 ERA. In December 1924, after nine years pitching for Cleveland, Coveleski was traded to the Washington Senators for pitcher By Speece and outfielder Carr Smith.|$|E
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2010 outdoor season, Bolt ran 19.56 {{seconds in}} the 200 m in Kingston, Jamaica for the fourth-fastest run of all-time, {{although}} he stated {{that he had no}} record breaking ambitions for the forthcoming season. He took to the international circuit May with wins in East Asia at the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting and then a comfortable win in his 2010 IAAF Diamond League debut at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix. Bolt made an attempt to break Michael Johnson's best time over the rarely competed 300 metres event at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava. He failed to match Johnson's ten-year-old record of 30.85 and suffered a setback in that his 30.97-second run in wet weather had left him with an Achilles tendon problem.|$|E
50|$|From 2005 to 2008, Federer was Nadal's only {{considerable}} test at Roland Garros, {{as he was}} {{the only}} man at the time even capable of winning sets against Nadal on clay. Federer lost three close finals to Nadal <b>on</b> clay <b>in</b> 2006, winning a set in Monte Carlo, another two sets in Rome, and a fourth set at the French Open. Federer lost his first French Open final to Nadal while Djokovic had also lost to Nadal <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarterfinals.|$|R

In 1993 she {{won the gold medal}} at the Eurovision Young Dancers Competition and <b>in</b> 1994 <b>the</b> gold medal at the Jackson International Ballet Competition. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> autumn of 1994, having left the Paris Opera Ballet <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year, she joined the Royal Ballet. She was promoted to the status of Principal Dancer in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Each {{version of}} the game differs {{significantly}} from the others. The PC version, for example, has fewer levels than the console versions and does not implement driving mode. It begins the plot right at Drake's Austrian castle, skipping over the French mission. Also, in this version, Rook dies much <b>earlier</b> <b>on,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> astronaut training facility that Bond infiltrates. The Game Boy Advance version resembles the PC NightFire more than the console versions. However, the very general overall storyline and characters remain <b>the</b> same <b>in</b> all versions.|$|R
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> force's history, {{most of its}} {{equipment}} and weapons had to be imported from abroad, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous Canadian industry. Its early saddlery and wagons were imported from the United States, although the police's uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson's Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, local firms, with the police becoming an important source of business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller's office. All of the police's guns had to be imported, {{due to the lack of}} indigenous manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition from abroad, as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.|$|E
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gold rush, the US Army sent a small {{detachment}} to Circle City, in case {{intervention was}} {{required in the}} Klondike, while the Canadian government considered excluding all American prospectors from the Yukon Territory. Neither eventuality took place and instead the US agreed to make Dyea a sub-port of entry for Canadians, allowing British ships to land Canadian passengers and goods freely there, while Canada agreed to permit American miners {{to operate in the}} Klondike. Both decisions were unpopular among their domestic publics: American businessmen complained that their right to a monopoly on regional trade was being undermined, while the Canadian public demanded action against the American miners.|$|E
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school's history, the Vanderlips {{decided to}} change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal {{approach}} with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for younger children, which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would act out Swiss Family Robinson on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism. Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food. She named some of her foods artistically (rice pudding with raisins was called Bête Noire a la Bolshevik).|$|E
50|$|DCU came {{crashing}} {{back down to}} earth {{at the end of}} May when Cork destroyed the visitors by 52-0 in a lob-sided win. Two weeks later, DCU lost again, this time to the Dublin Rebels, by 27-6. Going into the final game of the regular season, DCU (in a mirror image of the 2008 season, against the Belfast Bulls) needed to beat a team who had beaten them <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year, the Cork Admirals. DCU duly complied, in a defensive battle in which DCU got their only shut-out of the season and earned a tough fought 8-0 victory to qualify for the post season for <b>the</b> second time <b>in</b> their history while simultaneously ensuring Cork would fail to make the playoffs.|$|R
30|$|If {{these first}} {{experiments}} demonstrate that everything works, and that decoherence present is small enough, we can {{switch to the}} second and most important stage of MAQRO: observing high-mass matter-wave interference (see Section  5.3). If {{it should be clear}} already earlier that the prerequisites for performing these experiments are fulfilled, this second sequence of tests can already be started <b>earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mission. The main goals of the mission should be achieved within the first 20 months after commissioning, leaving some time to perform additional experiments or to repeat experiments to increase statistical significance.|$|R
2500|$|After being relegated in 2011, Birmingham {{are still}} yet to gain {{promotion}} {{back to the}} top flight of English football. However, since Alex McLeish was sacked as Villa manager, Villa's poor form continued. Despite several manager changes over the next few years, after several close calls they were finally relegated at the end of <b>the</b> 2015/16 season. <b>Earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2015/16 season the two teams were drawn to play each other <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third round of the League Cup. Aston Villa ran out 1–0 winners thanks to a goal from Rudy Gestede.|$|R
5|$|Eberardo Pavesi {{dominated}} the difficult ninth stage that contained the major climbs of the Nava, Tenda, and San Bartolomeo. Pavesi {{went on to}} win the stage by close to six minutes over the second-place finisher Luigi Ganna. The race's tenth and final stage was marred by rain. Race leader Carlo Galetti crashed into a hay wagon <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stage and sustained some heavy wounds, he would get back on his bike and finish the stage in fifth place. Despite the rain in Milan, many spectators still came to watch the riders arrive. Luigi Ganna was the first rider to cross the finish line in Milan and in doing so, he won his third stage of the 1910 Giro d'Italia. Carlo Galetti won the Giro d'Italia by a margin of eighteen points over Pavesi. Galetti and his team, Atala-Continental, won the team classification.|$|E
5|$|Harley's {{leadership}} {{qualities and}} {{influence on the}} club as captain was commended <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season after his handling of teammate Steve Johnson's off-field discretions. Johnson was banished from the team during the pre-season and demoted to the reserves {{for the first five}} games of the season. However, he successfully returned to the team and finished the season as a Norm Smith Medallist and All-Australian. Harley's leadership influence on the team was reflected in his finishing fourth in the AFLPA Best Captain award during his first year at the helm. He was also awarded life membership of the Geelong Football Club following his 150th team appearance in the round sixteen win against the Western Bulldogs, and named in the end-of-season South Australian State of Origin team.|$|E
5|$|Having {{received}} Nintendo 64DD development kits {{that included}} the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, Iguana Entertainment added an optional high-resolution mode to the game <b>early</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development cycle. In conjunction with the Expansion Pak, this mode allows the game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time. An upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give the game better-formed creatures. However, motion capture was avoided because none of game's enemies are human. Dienstbier felt that if their animations were motion captured, enemies would look like a person {{pretending to be a}} lizard in a costume. The game features different animations for different creatures. Unlike its predecessor, where enemies have two types of death animations, Seeds of Evil includes a third and gorier one.|$|E
5|$|Lead singer Smith {{revealed}} that the band will explore a new direction on their next album, pursuing a new, rawer sound. Before January 2009, Editors had written around eighteen new songs for the new album {{and they have been}} described as some of the most synthetic, raw and anthemic songs they have written to date. <b>In</b> October <b>the</b> band went to the studio to record some demos. The band spent the first week of April recording the album and on 8 April, they released a short video with information about the recording process. It announced that Mark 'Flood' Ellis would be the producer for <b>the</b> album. <b>Earlier</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year, the sound of the album was said to have a very electric feel; the band often using the Terminator theme song as a reference.|$|R
25|$|<b>Earlier</b> <b>on,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third segment, Mrs. Potts' Party, the Beast makes several cameos {{sleeping}} {{in his bed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Wing. Dialogue between Lumiere and Cogsworth shows that {{he had spent the}} entire previous night mending leaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle roof, and is still resting. An argument between Lumiere and Cogsworth about Mrs. Potts' favourite flowers lead to them having to hide several bunches of flowers around the Beast's bed. At one point, the Beast begins to smell one of the flowers and almost wakes up, but it is removed just in time, and he falls asleep again.|$|R
