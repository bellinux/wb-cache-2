At one stage, Harmison had taken three wickets in a 15-ball spell without conceding a run. Plunkett continued to unsettle the batsmen and finished on 3 for 55.

The biotechnology sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought.

Charles' return to Scotland combined with a stunning victory at the Battle of Prestonpans obliged Cumberland to pull his army back to England {{to deal with the}} Jacobite invasion. The British government was greatly concerned with developments in Flanders but the military tide had turned in France's favour.

The positive impact of PML on PMG (the slope coefficients are reported to be positive) means that large potential losses imply future high potential gains—that is, the stock market overreacts to bad news. The negative impact of PMG on PML (the slope coefficients are reported to be negative) means that large potential gains hint at low potential losses—that is, the stock market underreacts to <b>good</b> <b>news.</b>|$|R
