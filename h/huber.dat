50|$|On April 23, 2015, {{after five}} hours of jury deliberation, <b>Hubers</b> {{was found guilty of}} Poston's murder. Following the verdict, the jury {{recommended}} a 40-year prison sentence.

Her attorneys also asked the judge to recognize <b>Hubers</b> as a domestic violence victim, which would reduce the amount of time she would be required to serve before becoming eligible for parole. Under state law, <b>Hubers</b> would be required to serve 85 percent of her term before becoming eligible for parole, but her attorneys' motion would require her to only serve 20 percent of her sentence before she could be released.|$|R
50|$|Four {{months after}} being convicted, <b>Hubers</b> {{was sentenced to}} 40 years in prison, as per the jury's recommendation.
