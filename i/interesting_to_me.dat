Cey Adams, creative director for Def Jam at the time, later said of the creative decision for the artwork, [...] "It was so <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a black hip-hop act did an illustration for their album cover. At that time black hip-hop artists, for the most part, had photos of themselves on their covers. But {{this was the first}} time someone took a chance to do something in the rock'n'roll vein".|$|E

Hired on June 15, she completed her models by July 1, when Louis Ayres, {{a member of the}} commission, came to view them. He was enthusiastic, and sent a letter to commission chairman Charles Moore to that effect, writing [...] "the whole coin looks very <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I think is mighty good."

500|$|Haynes {{had first}} heard about the film in 2012 from costume {{designer}} Sandy Powell, who informed him that Blanchett was attached and Karlsen was producing. Blanchett, who served as an executive producer through her production company Dirty Films Ltd., had {{been involved with the}} project for [...] "a long time". Haynes learned {{they were looking for a}} director when Vachon approached him in 2013. He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett as motivating factors for his involvement. [...] "What was so <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I first read this script", Haynes said, [...] "is how it basically links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... this crazy state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind." [...] Haynes collaborated with Blanchett on a dramaturgical level.|$|E

It's like a mirror of our own psyche. It's almost like the wrong program could be a mental disease." [...] She elaborated that [...] "Fembot" [...] is not [...] "really about the future or about space or anything", {{saying that it is}} about the present time. [...] "Technology is becoming more organic, and using the word 'fembot' or 'robot' in a song makes things more human to me", she said.

So, you take elements of rock and steel and chisel them into interesting shapes." [...] She also describes the creation of the set by stating, [...] "I found the backdrop from Alien, and Bill Roe lit it very dimly and put it behind. And it was just this rotating platform with this humongous dental piece that could rotate around as well and pull his face apart." [...] According to Makeup Supervisor Cheri Montasanto-Medcalf, Matthew Mungle helped {{in the creation of the}} alien torture machine by making the cheeks and putting the hooks in. The makeup supervisor adds that the hooks would actually stretch out and that David Duchovny [...] "sat pretty good through all that." ...|$|E

Of course, that depends on their expertise. As an independent producer, I {{have to be a}} type of skilled laborer. There were many times that I had to make a film quickly. At those times, I kept entertainment-value in mind. Not once have I made a film for the sake of making the film itself. My taste is in looking through the camera. Filming happens to correspond with that taste. Art films are what Yu Hyun-mok makes. That's because director Yu wants to make art films. I just make films by following my heart, so the analysis I leave to all of you." [...] Kim Ki-youngAlthough a critically acclaimed, financially successful independent filmmaker, Kim was not immune from governmental pressure. He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> than the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 2008, Shinoda's second {{public art}} show [...] "Glorious Excess (BORN)" [...] premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. The show {{included}} nine new pieces, with an exclusive signing on opening night. The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E

"There's {{a spirit}} there that's just very <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> She was charming {{and there was}} {{something}} about her so intriguing to watch", stated Rhimes in response to Pomepo's portrayal of her character. Executive producer Betsy Beers stated that the writing staff was going to focus on the balance between her vulnerability and her courage, also dealing with changes in the relationship with her friends. Pompeo noted that the uncertainty of her character's fate is what helped her evolve into a more adaptable actor. Rhimes also disclosed that an episode with Ellis Grey's unexpected lucidity and eventual death was in plans {{since the beginning of the}} series. Rhimes described how Pompeo got through the challenge of sending Meredith in the afterlife: [...] "It was an exciting place to take her. Exciting to watch her find her way back." [...] In response to Izzie's arc, Shonda Rhimes discussed the impact Denny Duquette's death will have on her, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Katherine Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the third season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's playable character, William [...] "B.J." [...] Blazkowicz, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as the playable protagonist of all Wolfenstein games. When developing the character of Blazkowicz for The New Order, MachineGames considered his appearances in previous games in the series. When doing this, they realised that the character had never really developed at all throughout the games; [...] "He's just the guy that you play," [...] said Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda. The team discovered that {{they were interested in}} exploring his story, which is what they later invested in. One particular scenario that the team envisioned is putting Blazkowicz in situations where he is uncomfortable. Matthies said, [...] "that's really <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I love taking things and making them real." [...] Throughout the game, Blazkowicz communicates some of his inner thoughts through short monologues, many of which reveal that he has been traumatized by some of his experiences. [...] "We always loved the idea of a prototypical action hero exterior juxtaposed with a rich and vulnerable interior psychology," [...] said Matthies. One of the largest priorities for the team when developing the character of Blazkowicz was to [...] "reveal whatever needs to be revealed to [...] and the player" [...] simultaneously; Matthies felt that, despite the simplicity of this concept, it is rarely used in games. Prior to developing The New Order, the team had primarily worked on games that involved antihero protagonists. However, id Software wished Blazkowicz to be portrayed differently in the game. Matthies said, [...] "It's really important to [...] that BJ is a hero, and not an anti-hero." [...] The team attempted to develop Blazkowicz into a character that players could relate to, as they felt that players are generally unable to relate to video game protagonists. [...] "The goal is not to have a protagonist that's so neutral that you can project yourself into them; the goal is to have a protagonist that is so relatable that you become them," [...] said Matthies. They also tried to make players become [...] "emotionally in sync" [...] with Blazkowicz, using the morality choice in the game's prologue to do so.|$|E

[...] "That's just what was <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as a postcollegiate bohemian", he later remarked. [...] "We didn't have a manifesto. Nothing was off-limits; it's just that that's what came up most of the time." [...] Many of his songs told miniature short stories of sociopaths doing evil things that the average person might merely contemplate. Some, such as [...] "Cables", [...] "Pigeon Kill", and [...] "Jordan, Minnesota", were based on real events, or things that Albini had witnessed during his midwest upbringing.

Hex said {{what makes a good}} game is [...] "a good story... intuitive controls – we're at a level of technology now where there really is no excuse for clunky controls in games... pretty graphics – our standards for graphics have just gotten so high." [...] Bajo says, [...] "It's always gameplay for me. I don't care what the game is about, if the gameplay is engaging, challenging, and <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I will play the hell out of it and I'll love it.

The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season.
