Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> <b>miss,</b> and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note.

30|$|Participants {{indicated}} {{how much}} money, between 1 and 100 dollars (or Yuan), {{they were willing}} to bet on each of their predictions regarding the basketball player’s <b>hits</b> <b>or</b> <b>misses.</b> Bets were treated as an indication of participants’ confidence in their own predictions. Given that different currencies were used in Canada vs. in China, we recognize that direct cross-cultural comparisons on the bets can be problematic. We caution readers that any direct cross-cultural comparisons should be interpreted with prudence. Although the currencies can be converted based on the exchange rate or big mac index, there is no guarantee of their psychological equivalence across cultures. Thus we decided to use the original amount reported by participants as the dependent variable, and examined confidence within each culture separately. Given that bets are measured as continuous variables, we conducted a 2 (previous outcome: <b>hit</b> <b>or</b> miss) ×  2 (length of streak: 5 or 15) repeated measures ANOVA within each culture separately. On average, Chinese bet 50.03 yuan (SE =  2.00), and Canadians bet 39.35 dollars (SE =  2.73). Results from two separate repeated measure ANOVAs showed similar patterns of results across the two culture groups. First, both Canadian and Chinese participants bet more money after hitting streaks than after missing streaks. The estimated means for Canadians were 44.37 (SE =  3.01) for the hitting streaks and 34.32 (SE =  3.12) for the missing streaks, F (1, 62) =  12.94, p =  0.001, partial η 2  =  0.173. The estimated means for Chinese were 55.66 (SE =  2.05) for the hitting streaks and 44.40 (SE =  2.66) for the missing streaks, F (1, 99) =  19.14, p <  0.001, partial η 2  =  0.162. In addition, participants in general bet more money for a longer streak (15 consecutive <b>hits</b> <b>or</b> <b>misses)</b> than for a shorter streak (5 consecutive <b>hits</b> <b>or</b> <b>misses).</b> The estimated means for Canadians were 47.81 (SE =  3.41) for the long streaks and 30.88 (SE =  2.68) for the short streaks, F (1, 62) =  36.91, p <  0.001, partial η 2  =  0.373. The estimated means for Chinese were 55.03 (SE =  2.35) for the long streaks and 45.03 (SE =  1.89) for the short streaks, F (1, 99) =  44.92, p <  0.001, partial η 2  =  0.312. The interaction between previous outcome and length of streak, however, was significant among Chinese, F (1, 99) =  9.23, p =  0.003, partial η 2  =  0.085, but not among Canadians, F (1, 62) =  0.07, p >  0.78. Specifically, Chinese tendency of betting more after hitting than after missing streaks was stronger for the long streaks, F (1, 99) =  24.25, p <  0.001, partial η 2  =  0.197, than for the short streaks, F (1, 99) =  6.40, p =  0.013, partial η 2  =  0.061.|$|R

If an eyewitness provides a high postdictive confidence judgment at test, is the identified suspect someone the eyewitness had previously said they were highly likely to remember (i.e. a high JOL)? In {{the examination of the}} relationship between JOLs and postdictive confidence, we focused our analysis on hits (i.e. old target faces correctly identified as “old”). This is because we want to assess the relationship between predictive and postdictive judgments on the same subset of faces. JOLs are made on old faces (faces previously studied, resulting in test trials that are either <b>hits</b> <b>or</b> <b>misses)</b> whereas postdictive confidence ratings can be made on old and new faces, with typical analyses of the confidence-accuracy relationship focusing on “old” responses (test faces participants had responded to as having been seen before).
