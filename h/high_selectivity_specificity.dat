40|$|A {{biosensor}} {{based on}} AuNP modified GC electrodes {{has been developed}} for direct detection of methyl parathion. AuNP can be introduced to mixed monolayers of aryldiazonium salt modified GC electrodes by Au-C bonding through aryldiazonium salt chemistry, which provides a stable interface showing efficient electron transfer between biomolecules and electrodes. PEG molecules {{were introduced to the}} interface to resist non-specific protein adsorption. AuNP surfaces were further modified with 4 -carboxyphenyl followed by covalent immobilization of methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH), a specific biocatalytic enzyme to methyl parathion. Exposure of this interface to methyl parathion resulted in a change in amperometric signal due to the MPH catalytic hydrolysis of methyl parathion producing electroactive compound 4 -nitrophenol. This biosensor shows <b>high</b> <b>selectivity,</b> <b>specificity,</b> reproducibility and stability, and is functional for the detection of methyl parathion in real samples.

The process of designing high-performing antibody (protein) microarrays has, however, {{turned out to be}} a challenging process. In this study, we have developed further our human recombinant single-chain variable-fragment (scFv) antibody microarray methodology by addressing two crucial technological issues, choice of sample labeling-tag and solid support. We examined the performance of a range of dyes in a one- or two-color approach on a selection of solid supports providing different surface and coupling chemistries, and surface structures. The set-ups were evaluated in terms of sensitivity specificity, and selectivity. The results showed that a one-color approach, based on NHS-biotin (or ULS-biotin) labeling, on black polymer Maxisorb slides (or Nexterion slide H) was the superior approach for targeting low-abundant (pg/mL) analytes in nonfractionated, complex proteomes, such as human serum or crude cell supernatants. Notably, microarrays displaying adequate spot morphologies, high S/Ns, minimized nonspecific binding, and most importantly a <b>high</b> <b>selectivity,</b> <b>specificity,</b> and sensitivity (>= fM range) were obtained. Taken together, we have designed the first generation of a high-performing recombinant scFv antibody microarray technology platform on black polymer Maxisorb slides for sensitive profiling of low-abundant analytes in nonfractionated biotinylated complex proteomes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Every living {{organism}} on earth owes its viability to its different sizes of nanostructures {{and the interaction}} of these structures at the nano size. Nanotechnology gives {{us an opportunity to}} understand nanoscale processes in {{living organism}}s and interfere with and manipulate them. Today, biocompatible nanosized structures are designed by applying developments in nanotechnology to biomedicine; thus, therapeutic agents are available to reach diseased tissues and even cells. However, it is essential that nanomaterials that would be used for therapeutic aims be targetable to diseased areas and have low toxicity. In addition, these nanomaterials must have high biocirculation and pharmacokinetic properties. Compared to conventional methods, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have the appropriate physical, chemical, mechanical, optical, and electronic properties for the design of nanobiomaterials that exhibit <b>high</b> <b>selectivity,</b> <b>specificity,</b> and sensitivity in the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. Recently, gold has been used in prominent drug and gene carrier platforms because it binds various therapeutic agents and biomolecules in a stable way to create biocompatible complex structures. In addition, it has nontoxic nuclei and surface properties such as charge and hydrophobicity, which are adjustable in a monolayer. In the near infrared region, AuNPs are effective probes for in vivo and in vitro imaging with their high plasmon resonance absorption and scattering. In addition, their ability to rapidly convert optical energy to heat energy enables the ablation of invasive cancer tissues photothermally, even at a low power. This review sheds light on the synthesis, surface functionality, and potential applications of colloidal AuNPs in biomedicine...|$|E

40|$|This update {{summarizes}} the growing application of “click” chemistry in diverse {{areas such as}} bioconjugation, drug discovery, materials science, and radiochemistry. This update also discusses click chemistry reactions that proceed rapidly with <b>high</b> <b>selectivity,</b> <b>specificity,</b> and yield. Two important characteristics make click chemistry so attractive for assembling compounds, reagents, and biomolecules for preclinical and clinical applications. First, click reactions are bio-orthogonal; neither the reactants nor their product's functional groups interact with functionalized biomolecules. Second, the reactions proceed with ease under mild nontoxic conditions, such as at room temperature and, usually, in water. The copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition, azide-alkyne [3 + 2] dipolar cycloaddition, Staudinger ligation, and azide-phosphine ligation each possess these unique qualities. These reactions {{can be used to}} modify one cellular component while leaving others unharmed or untouched. Click chemistry has found increasing applications in all aspects of drug discovery in medicinal chemistry, such as for generating lead compounds through combinatorial methods. Bioconjugation via click chemistry is rigorously employed in proteomics and nucleic research. In radiochemistry, selective radiolabeling of biomolecules in cells and living organisms for imaging and therapy has been realized by this technology. Bifunctional chelating agents for several radionuclides useful for positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging have also been prepared by using click chemistry. This review concludes that click chemistry is not the perfect conjugation and assembly technology for all applications, but provides a powerful, attractive alternative to conventional chemistry. This chemistry has proven itself to be superior in satisfying many criteria (e. g., biocompatibility, selectivity, yield, stereospecificity, and so forth); thus, one can expect it will consequently become a more routine strategy in the near future {{for a wide range of}} applications...|$|E

However, unlike antibodies, they also recognize {{a wide range of}} non-immunogenic targets such as small molecules and even whole cells. The integration of aptamers with semiconducting materials offers a great potential for the development of reliable aptasensors. Besides the wide target range, aptasensorsalso have the advantage of easy regeneration for multiple usedue to the stability and denaturation properties of the nucleic acid receptors. In this paper we presentan aptamer-based impedimetric biosensor using a nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) film as a working electrode for the direct and label-free detection of human IgE. About 1 to 3 % of the adults and up to 8 % of the children show an allergic reaction after the consumption of certain food products resulting in an increased level of IgE in the blood serum. IgE blood levels are typically in the nanomolar range. Amino-terminated IgEaptamersarecovalently attached to carboxyl-modified NCDsurfaces using carbodiimidechemistry, followed by BSA treatment to prevent non-specific binding of IgE. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is applied to measure the changes in interfacial electrical properties that arise when the aptamer-funtionalized NCDsurface is exposed to solutions containing human IgE. During incubation, the formation of aptamer-IgE complexes causesan increase in the imaginary part of the impedance signal. A corresponding electrical circuit analysis reveals a correlation between the complex formation and the capacitance of the double layer. The biosensor detection limit reaches physiologically relevant concentrations in the low nanomolar range (2. 7 nM) and demonstrates to be highly selective even {{in the presence of a}} large excess of IgG.

In addition, the H-SENS can recognize miRNAs with different A/U and G/C content and distinguish between a fully matched miRNA and a miRNA comprising either a terminal or a middle single base mutation. Furthermore, the H- and P-SENS were successfully employed for direct detection and profiling of three endogenous miRNAs, including hsa-miR- 21, hsa-miR- 32, and hsa-miR- 122 in human serum, and the sensor results were validated by qPCR. 9 2013 American Chemical Society.

40|$|Recent food crises have {{increased}} consumers’ awareness {{with respect to}} food safety and quality. An important requirement to guarantee a high quality and safe food chain is the possibility to measure in a fast, reliable and cost-effective way. Most conventional analytical methods applied in food chain analysis display a high sensitivity and accuracy but are however expensive in use. Recent developments in nanotechnology and bionanotechnology allow {{the design of a}} novel class of analytical systems including biosensors and micro total analysis sytems. They offer some interesting advantages such as a <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> and <b>specificity,</b> a low cost of production, a high degree of automation and the possibility to execute the analysis on a miniaturized scale. Because of these characteristics, an increasing number of devices have been reported for use in food diagnostics(1). The medical sector has played a prominent and an indispensable role as driving force in the development of many of these new technologies. A lot of research effort is spent in the development of biosensors for monitoring blood glucose levels in diabetes patients. Later, this knowledge finds its way to other application fields like food and environmental diagnostics. In this paper we will shortly introduce some aspects of biosensor technology with respect to its potential in food diagnostics. We first elaborate on the basic principles of biosensors. Next we introduce the concept of lab-on-a-chip technology and discuss how nanotechnology opens up possibilities to design sensors with improved sensitivity. In a concluding paragraph, we give an example of an optical biosensor for the detection of peanut allergens in food. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{changes within}} {{resident}} skin dendritic cells (DCs) after allergen uptake and processing are critical {{events in the}} acquisition of skin sensitization. Here we describe {{the development of a}} set of selection criteria to derive a list of potential target genes from previous microarray analyses of human peripheral blood-derived (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) -DCs) treated with dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid for predicting skin-sensitizing chemicals. Based on those criteria, a probing evaluation of the target genes has been conducted using an extended chemical data set, comprising five skin irritants and 11 contact allergens. PBMCs-DCs were treated for 24 hours with various concentrations of chemicals and in each instance the expression of up to 60 genes was examined by real-time PCR analysis. Consistent allergen-induced changes in the expression of many genes were observed and further prioritization of the targets was conducted by analysis of the same genes in DCs treated with non-sensitizing chemicals to determine their specificity for skin sensitization. Real-time PCR analyses of multiple chemical allergens, irritants, and non-sensitizers have identified 10 genes that demonstrate reproducibly <b>high</b> levels of <b>selectivity,</b> <b>specificity,</b> and dynamic range consistent with providing the basis for robust and sensitive alternative approaches for the identification of skin-sensitizing chemicals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMelatonin is a pineal {{neurohormone}} whose secretion {{is influenced}} by circadian changes of 24 hour night and day cycle. Over the recent past, several studies have highlighted the ubiquitous influence of the circadian timing in almost all the physiologic functions. An altered/deficient sleep–wake cycle has been correlated with physiological imbalances which {{are linked to the}} development of various disorders, viz depression, anxiety, psychosis, attention deficits, sleep deprivation and others. Melatonin and its oxidation products, viz cyclic 3 -hydroxymelatonin, N 1 -acetyl-N 2 -formyl- 5 -methoxykinuramine and N 1 -acetyl- 5 -methoxykinuramine possess excellent antioxidant properties. Melatonin's beneficial neuroprotective properties are mostly attributed to excellent free radical scavenging properties. A gathering body of evidence has shown that besides strong antioxidant activities, melatonin is a pleiotropic regulator molecule which orchestrates multiple functions through all the three melatonin receptors, i. e. MT 1, MT 2, and MT 3. For example, MT 2 receptor agonistic activity is attributed to neuroprotective, hypnotic and anxiolytic properties while MT 1 and MT 2 agonistic activity is associated with the clinical efficacy of agomelatine. The third melatonin receptor has been identified as quinone reductase (QR) 2, an enzyme involved in detoxification. MT 3 agonist has been linked to strong hypotensive effects in preclinical study. In conclusion, the gathering body of evidence both from preclinical and clinical literatures suggests strong antioxidant activities and diverse pleiotropic mechanisms of melatonin for potential neuroprotective role in diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. However, there is still a lack of melatonergic ligands with <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> and <b>specificity</b> to precisely target any particular neuropsychiatric disorders for which limited therapeutic options are currently available clinically...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is the {{fabrication}} of electrochemical sensor and sorbent for toxic Cd(II) ion using ion-imprinting technique on vinyl-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube. Multiwalled carbon nanotube-based ion-imprinted polymer (MWCNT-IIP) were synthesized using meth acrylic acid as the functional monomer, N,N′methylene-bis-acrylamide as the cross linking agent, and potassium peroxo disulphate as an initiator. The template and porogen used were cadmium chloride and water. To know the importance of MWCNT, ion-imprinted polymer without MWCNT was also prepared. For the purpose of comparison, non-imprinted polymers were also synthesized. The synthesized products were analyzed by FT-IR, XRD, TEM, EDAX, and TGA. An electrochemical sensor was made up by modifying platinum electrode with MWCNT-IIP. Experimental factors that control the routine of the sensor were investigated and optimized. Under optimal conditions, a calibration curve was obtained with a detection limit of 0.03  μM by using differential pulse voltammetric technique. Selectivity studies show irrelevant significance with Zn (II), Cu (II), and Ni (II) ions. The feasibility of modified platinum electrode shows a prospective application in real water sample collected from a lake, pigments, cosmetics, and fertilizers. The synthesized nanostructured material is also used for the extraction of Cd(II) ion from real water samples. The maximum adsorption of Cd(II) by various imprinted and non-imprinted sorbents was calculated, and it was found that maximum adsorption takes place at pH  6. The kinetic studies show that the adsorption of Cd(II) increases with time and reaches equilibrium at 70  min and the kinetic data follow pseudo-second-order kinetics. The adsorption data fitted to the Langmuir adsorption model which confirms the monolayer formation of an IIP layer on MWCNT surface. The selectivity co-efficient of the imprinted sorbent shows <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> and <b>specificity</b> towards Cd(II) ion than other metal ions.|$|R

This study aimed to explore herb-hepatotoxicity associations and to identify a common pharmacophore among the phytoconstituents of implicated herbs. Data from the United States adverse event reporting system (AERS) (2004 - 2011) were analysed retrospectively for herb-hepatotoxicity associations using disproportionality analysis. Chemical constituents in identified hepatotoxic herbs were examined for a common pharmacophore and validated against a set of known hepatotoxic and non-hepatotoxic compounds. Significant herb-liver injury associations (p< 0. 05) were found for 15 herbs including kava, valerian and black cohosh. Analysis of specific adverse reaction groupings revealed new information: HILI with immune features was significantly associated with seven herbs including kava, evening primrose and valerian. Pharmacophore analysis revealed a 3 -point hypothesis with 1 hydrogen bond acceptor, 1 hydrogen bond donor and 1 hydrophobic group that gained a high survival score, <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> and <b>high</b> <b>specificity</b> relative to other hypotheses. This hypothesis may be a clue to a common toxicity pathway shared by these herbs. Further research is required to investigate whether a causal relationship exists between the implicated herbs and liver injury and to identify the toxicity mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Gastric cancer (GC) is {{the second}} leading cause of cancer-related deaths all over the world. miR- 106 a is a circulatory oncogenic microRNA (miRNA), which overexpresses in various malignancies, {{especially}} in GC. In this study, an ultrasensitive electrochemical nanobiosensor was developed {{for the detection of}} miR- 106 a using a double-specific probe methodology and a gold–magnetic nanocomposite as tracing tag. The successful modification of the electrode and hybridization with the target miRNA were confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) methods. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used for quantitative evaluation of miR- 106 a via recording the reduction peak current of gold nanoparticles. The electrochemical signal had a linear relationship with the concentration of the target miRNA ranging from 1 × 10 − 3 pM to 1 × 10 3 pM, and the detection limit was 3 × 10 − 4 pM. The proposed miRNA-nanobiosensor showed remarkable <b>selectivity,</b> <b>high</b> <b>specificity,</b> agreeable storage stability, and great performance in real sample investigation with no pretreatment or amplification. Consequently, our biosensing strategy offers such a promising application to be used for clinical early detection of GC and additionally the screen of any miRNA sequence...|$|R
