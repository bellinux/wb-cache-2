5|$|A teleporting mutant. This was will.i.am's major live-action film debut. Although he {{initially}} did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the casting director, {{he got the}} role {{because he wanted to}} play a mutant with the same power as Nightcrawler. He enrolled in boot camp to get into shape for the part. When filming a fight, he scarred his knuckles after accidentally punching and breaking the camera.|$|E
5|$|Everyone offers their {{condolences to}} Ned, and Bart reluctantly plays a Christian video game with Rod and Todd. Homer accompanies Ned back {{home after the}} funeral and talks with him later that night when Ned is unable to sleep due to his {{loneliness}} and now having to raise his sons alone. To help him <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his life, Homer secretly makes a videotape of Ned to show to single girls across Springfield. Ned gets to date several women thanks to the tape, including Lindsey Naegle and Edna Krabappel, {{but none of them}} are successful.|$|E
5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, was becoming a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E

5|$|Lana is Sindi (Marisa Warrington) and Penny Watts' (Andrea McEwan) cousin. She {{was born}} in Australia, but her family moved to Canada when she was young. They {{returned}} to Australia a few years later, and Lana began attending Wattle Heights High School, where she was bullied over her sexuality. This led her to transfer to Erinsborough High. Lana finds employment at the Coffee Shop alongside Serena Bishop, whom she befriends. Lana is convinced {{that she had seen}} Serena before, and she realises that Serena had been in some photos taken by dodgy photographer Chris Cousens. Lana admits to Serena that she had also been taken in by Chris and that she was not over it. Lana did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Serena's cousin, Sky, and one day they fight at school. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) places them in detention and urges them to work things out.|$|E
5|$|Mindful of the {{enormous}} success of the Philharmonia Chorus, founded in 1957 by Legge to work with his Philharmonia Orchestra, the LSO decided to establish its own chorus. The LSO Chorus (later called the London Symphony Chorus) was formed in 1966 under John Alldis as chorus master. Its early years were difficult; Kertész did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Alldis, and there were difficulties within the chorus. Most of its members were amateurs, but at first, they were reinforced by {{a small number of}} professionals. This led to disputes over the balance between amateurs and professionals. There was a brief crisis, after which the professional element was removed, and the LSO chorus became, and remains, an outstanding amateur chorus.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

5|$|Two months later, Whitney {{returns and}} she helps the Carters repair their new till. Johnny offers her {{the chance of}} moving back into the Vic, which Whitney accepts. Mick also offers her her old job back as a barmaid and Whitney accepts this too. However, Shirley warns Whitney {{to stay away from}} Mick and she tells Shirley that she cannot stop her from being at the Vic. In private, Whitney reveals to Mick that she is engaged to Woody and she shares the news with her family and friends. She asks Mick to give her away and he agrees. Mick struggles with Woody's presence, but agrees to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> him for Whitney's sake and Whitney admits to Mick {{although}} she can't be with him, she loves him. Linda throws her out after she figures out she's the one Mick kissed and Whitney moves in with Stacey, Stacey's husband and Bianca's relative, Martin Fowler (James Bye) and their kids. Mick takes the rest of her stuff round and offers her £200 in lieu of lost wages but she tells him to keep his dirty money, annoyed with him revealing all.|$|E
25|$|In late August 1917 Wilson {{turned down}} {{a chance to go}} on the mission to the USA, as he did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Lord Northcliffe, the mission leader.

25|$|An ecstatic Dakshayani {{returned}} to her father's home to await her bridegroom, but found her father less than elated {{by the turn of}} events. The wedding was however held in due course, and Dakshayani (henceforth called Gauri) made her home with Shiva in Kailasa. Dakshin, depicted in legend as an arrogant king, did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his renunciative son-in-law and cut his daughter away from her natal family.|$|E

He seemed well-qualified {{to serve on}} the arts and library sub-committee, but he did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the sub-committee's chairman, E.W. Swanton. Howat played club cricket as a wicket-keeper for Moreton CC in Oxfordshire until he was 77. He was associated with the club for almost fifty years.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Chatsworth Farm did {{not achieve}} {{the success that}} Joan had envisaged, and was not turning a profit. A trainer had worked there until 1967, but he left {{because he did not}} <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Robinson, and by 1969 Robinson was {{considering}} selling the place. Joan wanted to keep it running, however, and persuaded Diane Settegast, a friend from Dallas, to take on the temporary role of trainer.|$|E
25|$|She was whole-hearted {{not only}} about her work but also about life on Crete. She learned modern Greek, {{got to know the}} island, its people and culture and was known for her ability to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> local workers on site. In this way, she {{can be seen as a}} pioneer of {{contemporary}} approaches to archaeological work, while she also fitted the early 20th century pattern of women assisting senior male archaeologists.|$|E

25|$|On 1 October 1897 Wood succeeded Buller as Adjutant-General to the Forces at the War Office. Wolseley {{had succeeded}} Cambridge as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1895, but his powers were being {{steadily}} reduced as his health was failing {{and he did}} not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Lord Lansdowne (Secretary of State for War), putting the Adjutant-General in a more powerful position. Wolseley accepted the appointment, despite his dislike of Wood, but the two men had very little interaction.|$|E

Macleod established good personal relations with several of his Labour opposite numbers, including both Bevan and James Callaghan, even though he clashed with Callaghan numerous times at the dispatch box while serving as Shadow Chancellor in the 1960s (by contrast, he did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Callaghan's successor as Chancellor, Roy Jenkins, considering him vain and arrogant).|$|E

UNRWA was specifically designed not to proscribe how the outcome of an agreement would take shape.|$|E
25|$|Carey {{was educated}} at Belverdere School, Haywards Heath; a {{relative}} {{paid for the}} brothers' education there. A former pupil of Belverdere had become a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF). The pilot frequently visited the school and performed low fly-pasts in an Armstrong Whitworth Siskin, and this display encouraged Carey to seek {{a career as a}} pilot and leave home. Carey's father had remarried and Frank did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> his new wife or new step-brothers. The family's finances were in a parlous state and coupled with Frank's poor educational performance, he was prevented from applying to join the RAF immediately.|$|E
