5|$|A {{special case}} of <b>intramolecular</b> {{hydrogen}} bonds within proteins, poorly shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own dehydration, are called dehydrons.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds {{suggested}} that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at {{a significantly higher}} than expected rate, between cold (around 63 kelvins) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing <b>intramolecular</b> energy barriers which {{would have to be}} overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the classical Nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by Shoppe to be an <b>intramolecular</b> electrocyclization and is outlined below. Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation, which undergoes a thermally allowed 4π conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the Woodward-Hoffman rules. This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β-hydrogen. Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, <b>intramolecular</b> lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Takemoto {{disclosed}} a concise {{synthesis of}} (−)-epibatidine that {{relied on a}} Michael cascade, catalyzed by a bifunctional catalyst. After initial asymmetric Michael addition to the β-nitrostyrene, <b>intramolecular</b> Michael addition furnishes the cyclic ketoester product in 75% ee. Standard functional group manipulations and an <b>intramolecular</b> cyclization yields the natural product.|$|E
25|$|The Claisen {{rearrangement}} is an exothermic, concerted (bond cleavage and recombination) pericyclic reaction. Woodward–Hoffmann rules show a suprafacial, stereospecific reaction pathway. The kinetics are of {{the first}} order and the whole transformation proceeds through a highly ordered cyclic transition state and is <b>intramolecular.</b> Crossover experiments eliminate {{the possibility of the}} rearrangement occurring via an intermolecular reaction mechanism and are consistent with an <b>intramolecular</b> process.|$|E
25|$|Mechanism of the <b>intramolecular</b> aldol {{reaction}} involves {{formation of}} a key enolate intermediate and an <b>intramolecular</b> nucleophilic addition process. First, hydroxide abstracts the α-hydrogen on carbon 6 to form the enolate. Next, nucleophilic attack of the ketone carbon 2 by the enolate forms the carbon-carbon bond between carbons 2 and 6. At last, usually under heating conditions, the elimination of water molecule forms the cyclized α,β-unsaturated ketone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intramolecular</b> aldol {{reaction}} is the condensation reaction of two aldehyde groups or ketone {{groups in the}} same molecule. Five- or six-membered , -unsaturated ketone or aldehyde is formed as the product. This {{reaction is}} an important approach {{to the formation of}} carbon-carbon bond in organic molecules containing ring systems. For example, under strong basic conditions (e.g. sodium hydroxide), hexane-2,5-dione (compound A in Figure 1) can cyclize via <b>intramolecular</b> aldol reaction to form the 3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one (compound B).|$|E
25|$|Using the A-Values of the {{hydroxyl}} and isopropyl subunit, {{the energetic}} {{value of a}} favorable <b>intramolecular</b> hydrogen bond can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|An {{approach}} to the trans-decalin ring system of salvinorinA {{has been described by}} Forsyth (et al.) utilizing an <b>intramolecular</b> Diels-Alder reaction/Tsuji allylation strategy.|$|E
25|$|A recent total {{synthesis}} of salvinorin A {{was reported by}} Forsyth and co-workers utilizing the <b>intramolecular</b> Diels-Alder / Tsuji allylation approach combined with an asymmetric late-stage addition of the furan moiety.|$|E
25|$|When sterics {{allow for}} attack on only the {{appropriate}} carbon (the terminal carbon {{as opposed to}} the second carbon), direct attack by an <b>intramolecular</b> nitrogen is effective, {{as is the case with}} strychnine synthesis.|$|E
25|$|In organic {{synthesis}} zirconium tetrachloride {{is used as}} a weak Lewis acid for the Friedel-Crafts reaction, the Diels-Alder reaction and <b>intramolecular</b> cyclisation reactions. It is also used to make water-repellent treatment of textiles and other fibrous materials.|$|E
25|$|A total {{synthesis}} of the compound was reported in 1965; that procedure called for the <b>intramolecular</b> alkyl lithium attack on a starting carbonyl to form the fused rings, and a tosyl chloride mediated formation of the ether.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} way to normal ATRP, the {{polymerization}} is started by initiation to produce a free radical, followed by chain propagation and reversible activation/deactivation equilibrium. Unlike the polymerization of single vinyl monomers, for the polymerization of multivinyl monomers, the chain propagation occurs between the active centres {{and one of the}} vinyl groups from the free monomers. Therefore, multiple unreacted pendent vinyl groups are introduced into the linear primary polymer chains, resulting in a high local/spatial vinyl concentration. As the chain grows, the propagating centre reacts with their own pendent vinyl groups to form <b>intramolecular</b> cyclized rings (i.e. <b>intramolecular</b> cyclization). The unique alternating chain propagation/intramolecular cyclization process eventually leads to the single chain cyclized/knotted polymer architecture.|$|E
25|$|In <b>intramolecular</b> Diels-Alder Reaction, {{asymmetric}} induction can be induced through allylic 1,3 {{strain on the}} diene or the dienophile. In the following example, the methyl group on the dienophile forced the molecule to adopt that specific 6-membered ring conformation on the molecule.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{single chain}} cyclized/knotted {{polymers}} are synthesized by deactivation enhanced ATRP of multivinyl monomers via kinetically controlled strategy. There are several main reactions during this polymerization process: initiation, activation, deactivation, chain propagation, <b>intramolecular</b> cyclization and intermolecular crosslinking. The polymerization process is explained in Figure 2.|$|E
25|$|In the Jacobsen {{synthesis}} of (+)-yohimbine, an indole alkaloid, an early enantioselective Pictet-Spengler reaction using a pyrrole-substituted thiourea catalyst produced gram-scale quantities of product in 94% ee and 81% yield. The {{remainder of the}} synthesis was short, using a reductive amination and an <b>intramolecular</b> Diels-Alder reaction.|$|E
25|$|In {{the model}} studies to {{synthesize}} chlorothricolide, an <b>intramolecular</b> Diels Alder reaction gave {{a mixture of}} diastereomers. But by installing the a bulky TMS substituent, the reaction gave the desired product in high diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity in good yield. The bulky TMS substituent helps enhance allylic 1,3 strain in the conformation of the molecule.|$|E
25|$|An amine {{functional}} group displaces the adjacent halide in an <b>intramolecular</b> nucleophilic substitution reaction to generate an aziridine. Amino alcohols {{have the same}} reactivity, but the hydroxy group must first be converted into a good leaving group. The cyclization of an amino alcohol is called a Wenker synthesis (1935), and that of a haloamine the Gabriel ethylenimine method (1888).|$|E
25|$|Like {{these other}} pigments, {{some of the}} double-bonds in {{bilirubin}} isomerize when exposed to light. This {{is used in the}} phototherapy of jaundiced newborns: the E,Z-isomers of bilirubin formed upon light exposure are more soluble than the unilluminated Z,Z-isomer, as the possibility of <b>intramolecular</b> hydrogen bonding is removed. This allows the excretion of unconjugated bilirubin in bile.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{reactions}} proposed to proceed through anion-binding catalysis is the Pictet-Spengler-type cyclization of hydroxylactams with TMSCl under thiourea catalysis. In the proposed mechanism, after initial substitution of the hydroxyl group with chloride, the key ion pair is formed. The activated iminium ion is {{closely associated with the}} chiral thiourea-bound chloride, and <b>intramolecular</b> cyclization proceeds with high stereoselectivity.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{deactivation}} enhanced strategy, {{a relatively}} small instantaneous kinetic chain length limits the number of vinyl groups that {{can be added to}} a propagating chain end during each activation/deactivation cycles and thus keeps the polymer chains growing in a limited space. In this way, unlike what happens in free radical polymerization (FRP), the formation of huge polymer chains and large-scale combinations at early reaction stages is avoided. Therefore, a small instantaneous kinetic chain length is the prerequisite for further manipulation of <b>intramolecular</b> cyclization or intermolecular crosslinking. Based on the small instantaneous kinetic chain length, regulation of different chain dimensions and concentrations would lead to distinct reaction types. A low ratio of initiator to monomer would result in the formation of longer chains but of a lower chain concentration, This scenario would no doubt increases the chances of <b>intramolecular</b> cyclization due to the high local/spatial vinyl concentration within the growth boundary. Although the opportunity for intermolecular reactions can increase as the polymer chains grow, the likelihood of this occurring at the early stage of reactions is minimal due to the low chain concentration, which is why single chain cyclized/knotted polymers can form. However, in contrast, a high initiator concentration not only diminishes the chain dimension during the linear-growth phase thus suppressing the <b>intramolecular</b> cyclization, but it also increases the chain concentration within the system so that pendent vinyl groups in one chain are more likely to fall into the growth boundary of another chain. Once the monomers are converted to short chains, the intermolecular combination increases and allows the formation of hyperbranched structures with a high density of branching and vinyl functional groups.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worthy}} {{to note that}} due to the {{multiple}} reactive sites of the multivinyl monomers, plenty of unreacted pendent vinyl groups are introduced to linear primary polymer chains. These pendent vinyl groups {{have the potential to}} react with propagating active centres either from their own polymer chain or others. Therefore, both of the <b>intramolecular</b> cyclization and intermolecular crosslinking might occur in this process.|$|E
25|$|For hydroxyflutamide, a {{group of}} {{compounds}} that differed in the aromatic ring did not bind to the AR. This suggests that the bisubstitution in the hydroxyflutamide ring is essential for high AR binding affinity. It has also been demonstrated that hydroxyflutamide requires the strong hydrogen bond donor ability of the tertiary hydroxyl group and fixed conformers involved in <b>intramolecular</b> hydrogen binding, to bind effectively to AR.|$|E
25|$|Denaturing {{conditions}} {{are necessary for}} proper estimation of molecular weight of RNA. RNA is able to form more <b>intramolecular</b> interactions than DNA which may result in change of its electrophoretic mobility. Urea, DMSO and glyoxal are the most often used denaturing agents to disrupt RNA structure. Originally, highly toxic methylmercury hydroxide was often used in denaturing RNA electrophoresis, {{but it may be}} method of choice for some samples.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be loosely {{described as}} crystalline if it contains regions of three-dimensional ordering on atomic (rather than macromolecular) length scales, usually arising from <b>intramolecular</b> folding and/or stacking of adjacent chains. Synthetic polymers may consist of both crystalline and amorphous regions; {{the degree of}} crystallinity may be {{expressed in terms of}} a weight fraction or volume fraction of crystalline material. Few synthetic polymers are entirely crystalline.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{self-assembly}} of resorcinarenes and pyrogallolarenes led {{to larger}} supramolecular assemblies. Both in the crystalline state and in solution, {{they are known}} to form hexamers that are akin to certain Archimedean solids with an internal volume of around one cubic nanometer (nanocapsules). (Isobutylpyrogallolarene)6 is held together by 48 intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The remaining 24 hydrogen bonds are <b>intramolecular.</b> The cavity is filled {{by a number of}} solvent molecules.|$|E
25|$|This {{equilibrium}} {{is entirely}} {{in favor of}} the methylene compound. Only by heating a solution of the compound to 200°C does a small amount of the pentacene develop, as evidenced by the emergence of a red-violet color. According to one study the reaction mechanism for this equilibrium is not based on an <b>intramolecular</b> 1,5-hydride shift, but on a bimolecular free radical hydrogen migration. In contrast, isotoluenes with the same central chemical motif easily aromatize.|$|E
25|$|Cyclopropane was {{discovered}} in 1881 by August Freund, who also proposed the correct structure for the new substance in his first paper. Freund treated 1,3-dibromopropane with sodium, causing an <b>intramolecular</b> Wurtz reaction leading directly to cyclopropane. The yield of the reaction was improved by Gustavson in 1887 {{with the use of}} zinc instead of sodium. Cyclopropane had no commercial application until Henderson and Lucas discovered its anaesthetic properties in 1929; industrial production had begun by 1936.|$|E
25|$|Biochemical and {{structural}} data for E1 revealed a mechanism of activation of TPP coenzyme by forming the conserved hydrogen bond with glutamate residue (Glu59 in human E1) and by imposing a V-conformation {{that brings the}} N4’ atom of the aminopyrimidine to <b>intramolecular</b> hydrogen bonding with the thiazolium C2 atom. This unique combination of contacts and conformations of TPP leads to formation of the reactive C2-carbanion, eventually. After the cofactor TPP decarboxylates pyruvate, the acetyl portion becomes a hydroxyethyl derivative covalently attached to TPP.|$|E
25|$|The 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D {{proteins}} are the capsid proteins VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1, respectively.Virus-coded proteases {{perform the}} cleavages, {{some of which}} are <b>intramolecular.</b> The polyprotein is first cut to yield P1, P2 and P3. P1 becomes myristylated at the N terminus before being cleaved to VP0, VP3 and VP1, the proteins that will form procapsids; VP0 will later be cleaved to produce VP2 and VP4. Other cleavage products include 3B (VPg), 2C (an ATPase) and 3D (the RNA polymerase).|$|E
25|$|The acetyl {{group in}} 6.1 (Scheme 6) was removed to give primary alcohol 6.2. The Taxol ring (D) was added by an <b>intramolecular</b> {{nucleophilic}} substitution involving this hydroxyl group to give oxetane 6.3. After acetylation, phenyllithium {{was used to}} open the carbonate ester ring to give alcohol 6.5. Allylic oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate, sodium acetate, and celite gave ketone 6.6, which was subsequently reduced using sodium borohydride to give secondary alcohol 6.7. This was the last compound before {{the addition of the}} amide tail.|$|E
25|$|Cation-π {{interactions}} {{have been}} observed in the crystals of synthetic molecules as well. For example, Aoki and coworkers compared the solid state structures of Indole-3-acetic acid choline ester and an uncharged analogue. In the charged species, an <b>intramolecular</b> cation-π interaction with the indole is observed, {{as well as an}} interaction with the indole moiety of the neighboring molecule in the lattice. In the crystal of the isosteric neutral compound the same folding is not observed and there are no interactions between the tert-butyl group and neighboring indoles.|$|E
