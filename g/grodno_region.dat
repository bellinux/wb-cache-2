500|$|Witold Pilecki {{was born}} on May 13, 1901 {{in the town of}} Olonets, Karelia, in the Russian Empire. He was a {{descendant}} of an aristocratic family (szlachta) originally from the <b>Grodno</b> <b>Region.</b> His grandfather, Józef Pilecki h. Leliwa, {{was a member of the}} Polish landed gentry and a dedicated Polish nationalist. He had been a supporter of the secessionist January Uprising of 1863–1864. Following the brutal defeat of the uprising by Russian forces, Józef Pilecki, like most Polish nobles who supported the rebellion, had his title revoked; his estate near Lida and his other properties were confiscated by the Russian government. He was also condemned to exile in Siberia for seven years. After his release he and his family were forcibly resettled by Tsarist authorities to the remote territory of Karelia. The family was prohibited from living outside this province for the next thirty years and its members were bound by law to be employed only by the Russian state.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the development of a}} new process within Russian-Belarusian-Kazakh integration — interregional transborder cooperation. Network modelling is suggested as a mechanism for its regulation. The authors present a network model of transborder cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus based on the case of the Kaliningrad and <b>Grodno</b> <b>regions.</b> The model is developed on the basis of the well-known and widely accepted PERT. It covers the three main stages of the whole transborder cooperation process identified in the case of the two regions — the Kaliningrad and Grodno: organisational and analytical support, methodological and technological support, and the development of a complex cooperation programme. The working version of the model includes approximately 150 events. As to its purpose, it is a representation of a well-balanced established international coordination programme of transboundary cooperation at a level of two regions. ...|$|R

40|$|Radon is {{the major}} {{contributor}} to the background exposure of the population. In the world practice, the radon risk or radon potential mapping are used for the radon dose assessment. The aim of this work was a radon danger mapping of the Republic of Belarus to assess the radiation situation and determine the radon hazard critical areas. Materials and methods: The mapping is based on measured values of radon volume activity in the living rooms of different buildings on {{the territory of the}} six regions of the Republic of Belarus. We have performed more than 4000 measurements. Integral track radon radiometers based on the polymer Kodak LR- 115 film were used to evaluate radon volume activity. Exposure time ranged from 90 to 120 days. The cartogram was built with using the MAPINFO software package. Results: The low levels of radon concentrations were determined in the Brest and Gomel regions, {{as well as in the}} southern districts of Minsk and south-western districts of the Mogilev region. The high levels radon concentrations were determined in some districts of the Vitebsk and <b>Grodno</b> <b>regions,</b> as well as in the north-eastern districts of the Mogilev region. About 2 – 5 times nonuniformity of radon distribution in settlements of the Republic was observed. The radon hazard critical areas with radon concentrations in the range of 200 – 400 Bq/m 3 were found in some districts of the Vitebsk, <b>Grodno</b> and Mogilev <b>regions.</b> Conclusions: The radon risk map of the Republic of Belarus gives the possibility to estimate the existing radiation risk. Taking into account the low efficiency of countermeasures long after the Chernobyl accident, it is necessary to increase the level of radiation protection through the radon mitigation activities or to change the radon normative documents. </p...|$|R

50|$|Karskiy {{graduated}} from the Nezhin historical-philological institute in 1885 {{in the field of}} Russian and Slavonic philology. Observing the absence of scientific analysis of the Belarusian language, he published his first major scientific work Review of Sounds and Forms of Belarusian Language in 1886. Upon his graduation he taught Russian and Church Slavonic languages and Russian literature in the Vil’na Liceum No.2 in Vilnius, where he also served as the secretary and as elected member of the Resources Committee. He passed his magisterial examination in 1891, and in 1893 left the Liceum and began teaching Russian language in Warsaw University. During his tenure there he also taught Slavonic paleography, Russian dialectology, and Church Slavonic grammar. He would defended his magisterial thesis To the history of sounds and forms of the Belarusian talk at Kiev University, which was the first published academic dissertation concerned with the Belarusian language. He would continue his studies of the Belarusian language, and in 1898 he began studying the local dialects of the Belarusian people, both by the literary artifacts and by ethnographic tours to the <b>Grodno,</b> Vil’na, Minsk <b>regions,</b> among others. In 1901 Karskiy became an associated member of Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, deptartment of Russian language and literacy.|$|R
5000|$|After the Soviet {{deportation}} of Poles and Jews in 1939 - 1941 (see Polish {{minority in}} Soviet Union), The Holocaust and the ethnic cleansing of the Polish population of Volhynia and East Galicia by Ukrainian Nationalists, the Polish {{population in the}} territories had decreased considerably. The cities of Wilno, Lwów, Grodno and some smaller towns still had significant Polish populations. After 1945, the Polish population of the area east of the new Soviet-Polish border was in general confronted with the alternative either to accept a different nationality or to emigrate. According to more recent research, about 3 million Poles lived east of the Curzon line, of which about 2.1 million [...] to 2.2 million persons died, fled, emigrated or were expelled to the newly annexed German territories. There exists a big Polish minority in Lithuania, big Polish minority in Belarus (19.7% in <b>Grodno</b> and Sapotskin <b>region</b> with about 9,000 inhabitants remains almost entirely Polish to this day). The area today is almost entirely Ukrainian in the south. Despite the emigrations and expulsions, there were about 295,000 Poles in Belarus in 2009 (3.1% of the Belarus population).The cities of Vilnius, Grodno and some smaller towns still have significant Polish populations.Vilnius District Municipality and Sapotskin region have Polish majority.|$|R
