25|$|Small-wheeled (wheel {{diameter}} {{less than}} 14cm, or about 5.5inches) instruments are traditionally found in Central and Eastern Europe. They feature a broad <b>keybox</b> and the drone strings run within the <b>keybox.</b> Because {{of the small}} size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings: one melody string, one tenor drone and one bass drone. They sometimes have up to five strings.|$|E
25|$|Large-wheeled {{instruments}} (wheel diameters between 14 and 17cm, {{or about}} 5.56.6inches) are traditionally found in Western Europe. These instruments generally have a narrow <b>keybox</b> with drone strings that run outside the <b>keybox.</b> They also generally have more strings and doubling or tripling of the melody string is common. Some modern instruments {{have as many}} as fifteen strings played by the wheel, although the most common number is six.|$|E

And then I am done for a while. On Tuesday I mean to hang a card to my <b>keybox,</b> inscribed--"Gone out of the City for a week"--and then I shall {{go to work and}} work hard.

5000|$|The {{instrument}} {{consists of}} two strings on a fretless neck. A crank is affixed to a small nylon wheel mounted on the body. The player turns the crank, causing the wheel to spin and [...] "bow" [...] the strings. This concept {{is similar to that}} employed by the hurdy-gurdy. Unlike most hurdy-gurdies, Onoue's instrument has no <b>keybox,</b> but is fingered along the neck. This detail is similar to the dulcigurdy, a hurdy-gurdy variant recorded by Michael Praetorius.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} model the {{friction}} of the strings was achieved by a mechanical bow traveling sideways. The second model featured a single rotating wheel, {{similar to that of}} the earlier hurdy-gurdy, to play strings. It differs in that a hurdy-gurdy has a small number of strings that are constantly in contact with the wheel, rather than a larger number of strings that can be lowered onto the wheel. A hurdy-gurdy has a <b>keybox</b> with tangents that change the pitches of the strings, rather like placing fingers on violin strings. Leonardo's innovation of a keyboard with a lowering mechanism allowed individual notes to be played, alone or in specific desired chords over a large range of pitches.|$|E
50|$|Sometime later, Nicole's body {{is thrown}} {{through a window}} onto Freddy who alerts the others with his screams. The group panic before noticing the word 'TV' cut into Nicole's stomach. After turning on the TV, the group view a video of Nicole being handed a loaded gun and told to shoot Carlos in order to survive. Nicole refuses and instead turns the gun on her {{attacker}} who overpowers her and slits her throat. The unseen man then explains to the group through a walkie-talkie that come 6 a.m. only {{one member of the}} group should be alive or they will all die.The man also explains that Nicole was given the same option as they are, kill to survive, however she failed. Collectively the group decide to barricade themselves into the house, realizing their phones do not work. Carlos decides to make a run toward the boat to retrieve a gun placed in the <b>keybox.</b> Brent follows him and they find the boat has been sunk, but Brent is able to retrieve the gun anyway. Noticing a nearby axe, Carlos runs to get it, but is caught in a giant bear trap. Brent begins to help him, however after hearing someone approach from the trees nearby he leaves Carlos and returns to the house, telling the others that Carlos has been killed.|$|E
40|$|The kernel {{memory area}} is the most secure place to save and manage the secret {{information}} in a normal computer system. User programs cannot arbitrarily access and see the kernel memory area. Even the attacker who has already gained root or super user priviledge cannot see {{the contents of the}} kernel memory area arbitrarily. This memory-access protection is the basic requirement that should be satisfied to support the C 2 -level security evaluation criteria, which is supported by most of the current commercial and non-commercial computer operating systems, such as Linux, Solaris, and Windows NT. But, {{there is no way to}} save and retrieve the secret information into and out of the kernel memory area. In this paper, we propose a new kernel memory key management facility, which we call the <b>KEYBOX</b> system. We describe the major user interface of the <b>KEYBOX</b> system, a system call sys_keybox(), semantics and show how the <b>KEYBOX</b> system can be used to manage the secret information that the CGI application requires...|$|E
