DOE is currently funding demonstrations of gold amalgamation that may also control mercury to the desired levels. Performance data from a variety of sources was reviewed to determine ranges of achievable mercury control. Preliminary costs were estimated for using these technologies to control mercury emissions from mixed waste incineration. Mercury emissions control for mixed waste incineration may need to be more efficient than for incineration of other hazardous wastes because of higher mercury concentrations in some mixed waste streams. However, mercury control performance data for wet scrubbing and carbon adsorption is highly variable. More information is needed to demonstrate control efficiencies that are achievable under various design and operating conditions for wet scrubbing, carbon adsorption, and gold amalgamation technologies. Given certain assumptions made in this study, capital costs, operating costs, and lifecycle costs for carbon injection, carbon beds, and gold amalgamation generally vary for different assumed mercury <b>feedrates</b> and for different offgas flowrates. Assuming that these technologies can in fact provide the necessary mercury control performance, each of these technologies may be less costly than the others for certain mercury <b>feedrates</b> and the offgas flowrates...|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon their}} lead angle, ball screws can be back-driven {{due to their}} low {{internal}} friction (i.e., the screw shaft can be driven linearly to rotate the ball nut). They are usually undesirable for hand-fed machine tools, as the stiffness of a servo motor is required to keep the cutter from grabbing the work and self-feeding, that is, where the cutter and workpiece exceed the optimum <b>feedrate</b> and effectively jam or crash together, ruining the cutter and workpiece.

50|$|Cutting speed (also called {{surface speed}} or simply speed) is the speed {{difference}} (relative velocity) between {{the cutting tool}} and {{the surface of the}} workpiece it is operating on. It is expressed in units of distance along the workpiece surface per unit of time, typically surface feet per minute (sfm) or meters per minute (m/min). Feed rate (also often styled as a solid compound, <b>feedrate,</b> or called simply feed) is the relative velocity at which the cutter is advanced along the workpiece; its vector is perpendicular to the vector of cutting speed. Feed rate units depend on the motion of the tool and workpiece; when the workpiece rotates (e.g., in turning and boring), the units are almost always distance per spindle revolution (inches per revolution or ipr or millimeters per revolution mm/rev). When the workpiece does not rotate (e.g., in milling), the units are typically distance per time (inches per minute or ipm or millimeters per minute mm/min), although distance per revolution or per cutter tooth are also sometimes used.|$|E

To reduce contour error, most of previous studies have focused on developing advanced control strategies. As an alternative strategy, contouring accuracy improvement using an adaptive <b>feedrate</b> planning method is proposed in this paper. First, a typical PID controller is adopted to build the contour error model, from which the <b>feedrate</b> can be scheduled in the contour error violated zones. Then, the relations between each constraint and the cutter tip <b>feedrate</b> are derived. After that, a linear programming model is applied to obtain the optimal <b>feedrate</b> profile on the sampling positions of the given tool path. Finally, illustrated examples are given to validate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed <b>feedrate</b> planning method. The comparison results show that the proposed method has a significant effect on improving contouring accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{free-form surface}} machining, it is {{essential}} to optimize the <b>feedrate</b> in order to improve the machining efficiency.

The overall goal of this research is the integration of geometric and mechanistic milling models for force prediction and <b>feedrate</b> scheduling for free-form surface machining. For each tool move a geometric model calculates the cutting geometry parameters, then a mechanistic model uses this information with the constraint force to calculate desired feedrates.

40|$|International audienceIn {{high speed}} machining, the real <b>feedrate</b> is often {{lower than the}} {{programmed}} one. This reduction of the <b>feedrate</b> is mainly due to the physical limits of the drives, and affects machining {{time as well as}} the quality of the machined surface. Indeed, if the tool path presents sharp geometrical variations the <b>feedrate</b> has to be decreased to respect the drive constraints in terms of velocity, acceleration and jerk. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} smooth 5 -axis tool paths in order to maximize the real <b>feedrate</b> and to reduce the machining time. Velocity, acceleration and jerk limits of each drive allow to compute an evaluation of the maximum reachable <b>feedrate</b> which is then used to localize the areas where the tool path has to be smoothed. So starting from a given tool path, the proposed algorithm iteratively smoothes the joint motions in order to raise the real <b>feedrate.</b> This algorithm has been tested in 5 -axis end milling of an airfoil and in flank milling of an impeller for which a N-buffer algorithm is used to control the geometrical deviations.

In general, this time-optimal <b>feedrate</b> incurs "bang-bang control," i. e., maximum acceleration/deceleration is demanded {{of at least one}} axis throughout the motion. For a path defined by a polynomial parametric curve r(xi), we show that the (square of the) time-optimal <b>feedrate</b> can be determined as a piecewise-rational function of the curve parameter xi, with break-points corresponding to the roots of certain polynomial equations. Furthermore, this type of <b>feedrate</b> function is amenable to a real-time interpolator algorithm that drives the machine directly from the analytic curve description, eliminating the need for linear/circular G code approximations. The theoretical and computational aspects of such time-optimal <b>feedrate</b> functions are presented, together with experimental results from their implementation on a 3 -axis mill driven by an open-architecture software controller.

40|$|In {{machining}} complex dies, molds, aerospace and automotive parts, or biomedical components, it {{is crucial}} to minimize the cycle time, which reduces costs, while preserving the quality and tolerance integrity of the part being produced. To meet the demands for high quality finishes and low production costs in machining parts with complex geometry, computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools must be equipped with spline interpolation, <b>feedrate</b> modulation, and <b>feedrate</b> optimization capabilities. This thesis presents the development of novel trajectory generation algorithms for Non Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) toolpaths that can be implemented on new low-cost CNC's, as well as, in conjunction with existing CNC's. In order to minimize <b>feedrate</b> fluctuations during the interpolation of NURBS toolpaths, the concept of the feed correction polynomial is applied. <b>Feedrate</b> fluctuations are reduced from around 40 % for natural interpolation to 0. 1 % for interpolation with feed correction. Excessive acceleration and jerk in the axes are also avoided. To generate jerk-limited feed motion profiles for long segmented toolpaths, a generalized framework for <b>feedrate</b> modulation, based on the S-curve function, is presented. Kinematic compatibility conditions are derived to ensure that the position, velocity, and acceleration profiles are continuous and that the jerk is limited in all axes. This framework serves as the foundation for the proposed heuristic <b>feedrate</b> optimization strategy in this thesis. Using analytically derived kinematic compatibility equations and an efficient bisection search algorithm, the command <b>feedrate</b> for each segment is maximized. Feasible solutions must satisfy the optimization constraints on the velocity, control signal (i. e. actuation torque), and jerk in each axis throughout the trajectory. The maximized feedrates are used to generate near-optimal feed profiles that have shorter cycle times, approximately 13 - 26 % faster than the feed profiles obtained using the worst-case curvature approach, which is widely used in industrial CNC interpolators. The effectiveness of the NURBS interpolation, <b>feedrate</b> modulation and <b>feedrate</b> optimization techniques has been verified in 3 -axis machining experiments of a biomedical implant...|$|E
