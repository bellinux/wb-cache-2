40|$|The {{chromatic}} {{properties of}} an image yield strong cues for object boundaries and thus hold the potential to facilitate the detection of object motion. The extent to which cortical motion detectors exploit chromatic information, however, remains a matter of debate. To address this further, we quantified the strength of chromatic input to directionally selective neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of macaque cerebral cortex using an equivalent luminance contrast (EqLC) paradigm. This paradigm, in which two sinusoidal gratings, one heterochro-matic and the other achromatic, are superimposed and moved in opposite directions, allows the sensitivity of motion detectors to <b>heterochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> to be quantified and expressed rel-ative to the benchmark of sensitivity for a luminance-defined stimulus. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the chro...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPosttranslational histone {{modifications}} {{are important}} for gene regulation, yet the mode of propagation and the contribution to heritable gene expression states remains controversial. To address these questions, we developed a chromatin in vivo assay (CiA) system employing chemically induced proximity to initiate and terminate chromatin modifications in living cells. We selectively recruited HP 1 α to induce H 3 K 9 me 3 -dependent gene silencing and describe the kinetics and extent of chromatin modifications at the Oct 4 locus in fibroblasts and pluripotent cells. H 3 K 9 me 3 propagated symmetrically and continuously at average rates of ∼ 0. 18 nucleosomes/hr to produce domains of up to 10 kb. After removal of the HP 1 α <b>stimulus,</b> <b>heterochromatic</b> domains were heritably transmitted, undiminished through multiple cell generations. Our data enabled quantitative modeling of reaction kinetics, which revealed that dynamic competition between histone marking and turnover, determines the boundaries and stability of H 3 K 9 me 3 domains. This framework predicts the steady-state dynamics and spatial features {{of the majority of}} euchromatic H 3 K 9 me 3 domains over the genome...|$|R
