50|$|During <b>the</b> 1960s, people <b>in</b> Australia {{frequently}} left cars unlocked and/or with <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition,</b> {{which enabled}} Cooke {{to steal a}} car almost every night. He sometimes returned stolen vehicles without the owners becoming aware of the theft, including several cars that were involved in hit-and-runs. Cooke's first hit-and-run was on Nel Schneider, 29, a mother of four who came to Australia from Amsterdam in September 1955.

In the United States, the VG30E engine, which featured a variable intake manifold on both automatic and manual transmission models, was used on all 1989 to 1994 GXE models and 1989 to 1991 SE models. This generation Maxima was fitted with an independent rear suspension, {{and continued to}} offer the road scanning, electronic Super Sonic Suspension (sonar). An interesting feature was the digital touch entry system on the GXE (in conjunction with the new Luxury Package), which allowed the windows to be lowered and the moon roof opened from outside the vehicle on a keypad integrated {{on the front door}} handle without the <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|E
50|$|A remote starter is a radio {{controlled}} device, {{which is}} {{installed in a}} vehicle by the factory or an aftermarket installer to preheat or cool the vehicle before the owner gets into it. Once activated, by pushing a button on a special key chain remote, it starts the vehicle automatically for a predetermined time. Different models have keyless entry as well. Most newer vehicles {{need some kind of}} bypass module to bypass the factory anti-theft system, so the vehicle can be started without the ignition <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition,</b> this is bypassed only to start the vehicle, which after it is running returns to its original state. For cars with manual transmission additional safety features may need to be added to prevent the car from starting while it's parked in gear. Having a remote starter installed in a vehicle will usually not void the factory warranty when installed properly.|$|E

Besides, it’s my spot and I can stay in it as long as I want. ” “Now you’re being rude, ” Katelyn scolded her friend. “I always try to leave as quickly as I can when another car is waiting. ” “You do not, ” Lisa responded. “I’ve ridden with you and you make the other person wait. ” Lisa pulled out of the parking spot as Katelyn shot back: “Do not. ” “Do too, ” Lisa continued the argument. “Everyone takes longer to leave a parking spot when someone’s waiting.
