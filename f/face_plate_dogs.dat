40|$|The use of patient-specific organ {{models in}} {{three-dimensional}} printing systems {{could be helpful}} {{for the education of}} patients and medical students. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify whether the use of patient-specific stoma models is helpful for patient education. From January 2014 to September 2014, 5 patients who underwent colorectal surgery and for whom a temporary or permanent stoma had been created were involved in this study. Three-dimensional stoma models and three-dimensional <b>face</b> <b>plates</b> were created. The patients’ ages ranged from 59 to 81 years. Four patients underwent stoma construction because of rectal cancer, and 1 underwent stoma construction because of colon stenosis secondary to recurrent cancer. All patients were educated about their stoma and potential stoma-associated problems using three-dimensional stoma models, and all practiced cutting <b>face</b> <b>plates</b> using three-dimensional <b>face</b> <b>plates.</b> The models were also used during medical staff conferences to discuss current issues. All patients understood their problems and finally became self-reliant. The recent availability of three-dimensional printers has enabled the creation of many organ models, and full-scale stoma and <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> models are now available for patient education on cutting an appropriately individualized <b>face</b> <b>plate.</b> Thus, three-dimensional printers could enable fewer skin problems than are currently associated with daily stomal care...|$|R

The intensifier includes fiber optics input and output <b>face</b> <b>plates</b> with a photocathode-microchannel plate amplifier-phosphor combination. Incoming radiation is converted to visible light by the converter which is piped into the intensifier by the input fiber optics <b>face</b> <b>plate.</b> The photocathode converts the visible light to electrons which are amplified by a microchannel plate amplifier. The electrons are converted back to light by a phosphor layer and piped out for viewing by the output fiber optics <b>faces</b> <b>plate.</b> The converter-intensifier combination may be further combined with its own radiation source or used with an independent source...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the {{vibration}} {{of the internal}} structure of a relatively simple flight vehicle structural model consisting of a multicellular box in which two parallel outer <b>face</b> <b>plates</b> (skins) are connected together by several internal plates (ribs) which are {{parallel to each other}} and normal to the <b>face</b> <b>plates.</b> Such a box is representative of a wing or stabilizer structure. Three representations of the structure were considered in the computation. The simplest model which can account for the coupling between the <b>face</b> <b>plates</b> and the ribs is a two-dimensional assembly of beams. A more realistic, yet still simple, three-dimensional model has been developed using the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The third computational method employed was the NASTRAN finite-element displacement method. The computational results are compared with experimental data...|$|R

This paper presented a systematical experimental study on the damage behavior of honeycomb sandwich structure under different configurations. Drop weight tests were carried out to investigate the effect of impact energy, core material and <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> structure on the dynamic response of sandwich plate. Delamination regions were obtained through ultrasonic scanning. Conclusions were made that the damage behavior of the <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> was similar with composite laminates while the energy absorption capacity was related to the parameters of the honeycomb core and the mismatch angle of the <b>face</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{wallpaper}} steamer is an electrical device which boils water continuously {{in order to}} produce steam. This steam is then allowed to pass through a narrow bore tube to a <b>face</b> <b>plate.</b> This <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> is then held against a wallpapered wall. The steam passes through the paper, saturates the backing paper and partially dissolves the desiccated wallpaper paste. This then allows the wallpaper to be pulled from, or scraped off the wall.|$|R
40|$|A {{system to}} provide a two piece robust fluid {{injector}}. According to various embodiments, the fluid injector is a fuel injector for a combustion engine. The injector includes two coaxially formed annuluses. One annulus is formed in a <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> and the second annulus or hole is defined by a tube extending through the <b>face</b> <b>plate.</b> The tube extends through the <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> in {{a portion of a}} through bore which also is used to define the second annulus. The second annulus is formed using a throughbore through which the tube extends. This allows the second annulus to always be formed inherently and precisely substantially coaxial with the first annulus. Moreover, the second annulus can be formed with a much greater tolerance than if other independent components needed to be added...|$|R
5000|$|A {{compensation}} winding in a DC shunt motor is a winding {{in the field}} pole <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> that carries armature current to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field pole plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole <b>face</b> <b>plate.</b> The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a compensating winding in the pole <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> that carries armature current {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a {{compensation winding}} is the expense.|$|R

Once the fluid is inside the seal, it forms a thin film around the entire inner system. After creating the film, the fluids then flow out of the seal {{and on to the}} rear <b>face</b> <b>plate,</b> which cools the system and prevents any excess heat from building up. This fluid cycle is continuously repeated while the seal is in operation.|$|R

40|$|Sandwich {{structures}} {{have been}} widely used for many years in applications such as aircraft panels, marine-craft hulls, racing car bodies and spacecraft solar arrays. Most sandwich panel designs include a lightweight core such as paper honeycomb or closed cell foam encased between two <b>face</b> <b>plates,</b> {{and in the case of}} aircraft panels constructed from carbon fibre reinforced plastics, the core is bevelled and edge pan plies are included to totally enclose the core. This type of design restricts access to the core making it almost impossible for the engineer to measure the shear strain developed in the core during in-service static or dynamic loading. This paper introduces a new measurement technique whereby the shear strain in the core can be estimated from <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> measurements using a linear finite difference approximation. The estimation method is presented and supported by calculations on a statically loaded sandwich beam. Static and dynamic experiments were conducted in order to validate the technique using a honeycomb sandwich beam instrumented with strain gauges on the core and <b>face</b> <b>plates.</b> The results showed excellent agreement between measured and estimated core shear strain for sandwich configurations with thin <b>face</b> <b>plates,</b> such as those encountered in aircraft and marine-craft constructions...|$|R
40|$|A reliability-based {{optimization}} (RBO) {{procedure is}} developed {{and applied to}} minimize the weight of eight fiber-reinforced polymer composite bridge deck panel configurations. The method utilizes interlinked finite element, optimization, and reliability analysis procedures to solve the weight minimization problem with a deterministic strength constraint and two probabilistic deflection constraints. Panels are composed of an upper <b>face</b> <b>plate,</b> lower <b>face</b> <b>plate,</b> and a grid of interior stiffeners. Different panel depths and stiffener layouts are considered. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to identify significant design and random variables. Optimization design variables are panel component ply thicknesses while random variables include load and material resistance parameters. It was found that panels were deflection-governed, with the optimization algorithm yielding little improvement for shallow panels, but significant weight savings for deeper panels. The best design resulted in deep panels with close stiffener spacing to minimize local upper <b>face</b> <b>plate</b> deformations under the imposed traffic (wheel) loads...|$|R
