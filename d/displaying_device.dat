In a letter to Nature published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some [...] "not very successful experiments" [...] he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M.

Although the system itself is “low cost,” the technique enables incorporation into high-fidelity simulation, and it enables trainees to learn the indications of ultrasound, learn precise image interpretation, and finally integrate the findings into patient management.

The chosen target group are children from 0 to 6 years of age. The thesis is based on two hypotheses. Firstly, parents use TV as a babysitter, and do so for various reasons. The second hypothesis assumes that parents do not pay attention to the time and type of programmes that children watch, even {{at a very early age}} when children are most vulnerable. The theoretical part consists of two chapters. The first chapter describes the position and importance of a TV set (as an object), television (as an institution) and television programmes (as watched audiovisual contents) in our households, and deals with the influence of television on the socialisation of the child in the family.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the topic of perceptual image quality. Our visual communication is mainly based on images, either natural or synthetic. Humans are able to judge whether an image is a good image. However, for many applications it would be faster and cheaper to estimate the quality of images using a computer. The major goal of this thesis is to find an objective measure for the quality of a printed image that corresponds to perceptual image quality. In addition to this major goal some secondary goals are defined as: 1) improving insight in the complex topic of perceptual quality, 2) determining the relation between perceptual attributes and image quality and 3) developing methods for color image processing. Two different perceptual attributes are investigated: sharpness and color contrast. Measures are developed {{that can be used to}} obtain an objective prediction of sharpening, smoothing and sharpness. In the color experiments the color of the images was changed with a gamma manipulation and a chroma scaling. These manipulations had a significant effect on perceptual quality. In the last part of this thesis it was evaluated how the gamut, that is the enveloppe of colors in color space that determine the limitations of the <b>displaying</b> <b>device,</b> can be incorporated into achromatic enhancement of color images and how this affects image quality. In this way, some of the differences between images displayed on a monitor and printed images can be taken into account. Applied Science...|$|E

40|$|As {{wireless}} and {{wired network}} connectivity is rapidly expanding {{and the number}} of network users is steadily increasing, it has become more and more important to support universal access of multimedia content over the whole network. A big challenge, however, is the great diversity of network devices from full screen computers to small smart phones. This leads to research on transcoding, which involves in efficiently reformatting compressed data from its original high resolution to a desired spatial resolution supported by the <b>displaying</b> <b>device.</b> Particularly, there is a great momentum in the multimedia industry for H. 264 -based transcoding as H. 264 has been widely employed as a mandatory player feature in applications ranging from television broadcast to video for mobile devices. While H. 264 contains many new features for effective video coding with excellent rate distortion (RD) performance, a major issue for transcoding H. 264 compressed video from one spatial resolution to another is the computational complexity. Specifically, it is the motion compensated prediction (MCP) part. MCP is the main contributor to the excellent RD performance of H. 264 video compression, yet it is very time consuming. In general, a brute-force search is used to find the best motion vectors for MCP. In the scenario of transcoding, however, an immediate idea for improving the MCP efficiency for the re-encoding procedure is to utilize the motion vectors in the original compressed stream. Intuitively, motion in the high resolution scene is highly related to that in the down-scaled scene. In this thesis, we study homogeneous video transcoding from H. 264 to H. 264. Specifically, for the video transcoding with arbitrary spatial resolution conversion, we propose a motion vector estimation algorithm based on a multiple linear regression model, which systematically utilizes the motion information in the original scenes. We also propose a practical solution for efficiently determining a reference frame to take the advantage of the new feature of multiple references in H. 264. The performance of the algorithm was assessed in an H. 264 transcoder. Experimental results show that, as compared with a benchmark solution, the proposed method significantly reduces the transcoding complexity without degrading much the video quality...|$|E
