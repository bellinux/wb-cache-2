50|$|The first basic {{military}} {{map symbols}} {{began to be}} used by western armies in the decades following the end of the Napoleonic Wars. During World War I, there was a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> between the British and French systems, including the adoption of the colour red for enemy forces and blue for allies; the British had previously used red for friendly troops because of the traditional red coats of British soldiers. However, the system now in use is broadly based on that devised by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1917. The infantry symbol of a saltire in a rectangle was said to symbolise the crossed belts of an infantryman, while the single diagonal line for cavalry was said to represent the sabre belt. With the formation of NATO in 1949, the US Army system was standardised and adapted, with different shapes for friendly (blue rectangle), hostile (red diamond) and unknown (yellow quatrefoil) forces.|$|E
40|$|The policy {{problem of}} a post- 2020 {{renewables}} policy framework for the EU is analysed using the multi-criteria decision aid method PROMETHEE, and put into a wider context of the policy formation process using the Multiple Streams Approach. The political debate includes two policy items: Firstly, the EU climate and energy target structure for 2030; and secondly, if the decision is taken for a new renewables target in 2030, whether and to which degree a future renewables support scheme should be harmonised on European level. Analysing 16 future policy pathways in detail, assuming three different decision maker prototypes, we conclude that if a 2030 renewables target exists, policy pathways with lower <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> {{are more likely to}} be implemented. The combined application of Kingdon’s Multiple Streams Approach with PROMETHEE to this policy formation process illustrates how the two methods complement each other. While Kingdon’s approach takes a broader view and is able to explain seemingly irrational behaviour of policy entrepreneurs, PROMETHEE is suitable for analysing one section of the policy formation process in more detail, namely the identification, discussion, and selection of policy alternatives...|$|R

By examining the meaning of the prohibition of Directive 2005 / 60 /EC and the implementation of the directive in the Dutch and Belgian criminal justice systems, the four types of combinations which the European legislator can apply in a directive will be discussed.

40|$|Tax {{harmonisation}} {{between countries}} has been frequently advocated but progress {{has tended to}} be slow and uncertain. This article suggest that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> sought has often been vague and that more progress might be made if it were generally agreed how far the progress should go. The paper examines the case for tax harmonisation and its meaning - concluding that tax harmonisation is consistent with fiscal regional diversity. In Europe the principle of 2 ̆ 2 subsidiarity 2 ̆ 2 has been invoked to attempt to resolve conflict between overall harmonisation while retaining diversity among Member States. The European experience with corporate tax harmonisation is analysed and compared with progress between Australia and New Zealand. It is concluded that technological change will increase the importance of tax harmonisation and greater progress might be made if the aims of tax harmonisation were clearer, specific and modest. In particular it might be advantageous if the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> sought were limited and seen {{to be consistent with}} regional variation in taxation...|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} whether the norms {{laid down in}} the Directive {{in relation to the}} exceptions and limitations on copyright and related rights can be conducive to a sensible <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> across the European Union. Before discussing the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> achieved so far by the Directive, the first part gives a short overview of the main characteristics of the list of exceptions and limitations contained in Article 5 of the Directive. A comprehensive review of the implementation of each limitation by the Member States {{is beyond the scope of}} this article. The following section takes a closer look at three examples of limitations that have led to legislative changes at the Member State level as express measures towards the implementation of the Information Society Directive, that is, the limitations for the benefit of libraries, for teaching and research, and for persons with a disability. These exceptions and limitations were later on also identified by the European Commission as key elements in the deployment of a digital knowledge economy. The analysis will show that the implementation of the provisions on limitations in the Information Society Directive did not, and probably cannot, yield the expected level of harmonisation across the European Union and that, as a consequence, there still exists a significant degree of uncertainty for the stakeholders regarding the extent of permissible acts with respect to copyright protected works...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the {{conditions and limitations}} of mutual recognition and seeks to identify the lacunae in the governance mechanism and the regulatory framework applicable to undertakings in collective investment in transferable securities (‘UCITS’). It assesses the regulatory and supervisory mechanisms that may be applied to address the identified weaknesses. For this purpose, the thesis formulates a theoretical framework for effective mutual recognition based on quasi-maximum harmonisation, reflexive governance of financial supervision and a mechanism for the strengthening of mutual trust between national financial supervisors. The technique for financial regulation {{in the field of}} UCITS should create the right balance between implementing a policy designed to attain a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> of investor protection regulation and making exceptions to address national differences. The picture that emerges is one where a model based on minimum harmonisation causes serious limitations to mutual recognition in the form of inconsistencies in the implementation of EU Law and the application of national discretions. Quasi-maximum harmonisation becomes the optimal technique for UCITS. However, the limitations of a model based on minimum harmonisation of regulation resurface, although to a lesser extent, even in a framework based on quasi-maximum harmonisation. The solution is not one where an even higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> (the single rulebook mechanism) is required, but lies in reflexive governance of financial supervision combined with a framework for the strengthening of mutual trust between national financial supervisors. This framework can form the basis for overcoming the remaining obstacles to the cross-border activity of UCITS, including the barrier to the depositary passport which is the last major bastion that stands {{in the way of a}} complete internal market for UCITS...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: the {{analysis}} of bachelor’s training objectives in “Pedagogical Education”, formulated by the Federal Educational Standards (FES), brings {{to the conclusion that}} there is a mismatch between them. Achiev- ing one assumes fundamentalisation of teacher’s education, and the other - the improvement of its practical orientation. The research reveals that teacher’s education component corresponds to the development of relevant scientific field. Proposed measures to achieve these goals are often in opposition to the components of teacher’s education. Since the training of students in all activities specified by FES, is carried out in a single educational process, there is a necessity to search for means that eliminate this mismatch, i. e., harmonise teacher’s education. Materials and Methods: a number of studies is concerned with identifying the content of fundamental and practical aspect <b>of</b> training Bachelor’s <b>degree</b> students. Fundamentalisation is strengthening the role of teaching methodology, in particular the methods of research, construction of training courses based on the computerised simulation, systems analysis and activity approach. The practical orientation of education is to form students’ skills based on theoretical and methodological knowledge and universal educational actions. Results: modern methodological thinking serves a basis <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> that embodies a number of profes- sional competence of a teacher extended on the fundamentalisation of education, and on a practical orientation as well. Searching for means <b>of</b> <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> fundamentality and practical orientation of Bachelors training leads to the conclusion that among effective means are tasks that simulate real learning situations, a business game, its simulation, training projects, classes where the experiment is carried out.
