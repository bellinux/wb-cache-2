40|$|This study investigates {{success in}} parental {{mental health and}} child welfare work. Research has {{established}} the potential direct and indirect impacts of mental illness on parenting, the parent–child relationship, and the child, {{and the extent to}} which this poses a public health challenge. Problems with how adult and children’s services understand and deliver support to parents with mental health problems and their children have also been identified. In contrast, there has been little research about how parents with mental health difficulties and their children can be supported successfully. ‘What works’, or what constitutes success in parental mental health and child welfare work is missing from the literature. This study aims to begin to address this gap by providing an original contribution to conceptualising and evaluating success in parental mental health and child welfare work. This is an exploratory study, and as such covers a diverse population, i. e. different family members, different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, parents with different diagnoses, and statutory and voluntary sector agencies. The main issue here is to cover diversity; in terms of exploring different opinions of success – both in outcomes and processes – rather than to ensure applicability of the findings to all families in which there are parents experiencing mental illness. An interpretative approach was chosen for the study (within that data) to explore these issues. This was obtained by undertaking a multiple embedded case study methodology (Yin, 2003) with 12 families and their key workers from community mental health, children’s social care and the voluntary sector. Data collection was undertaken in three stages: individual interviews with parents, children and the professionals who support them; a review of the agency case files kept about the same families; and three focus groups. Participants were asked to identify successful situations that had occurred in each case study family during the 18 months prior to interview and give <b>details</b> <b>about</b> <b>why</b> these situations worked out well. The focus groups were convened to discuss the emerging findings from the first two phases of data collection. An examination of emerging themes, and the interplay between themes, gives insight into the shared ideas about what works and the shared methods and practices that are associated with successful outcomes. On the basis of these similarities, the findings offer a contribution to knowledge and practice about a mode of working which seems to make it possible to succeed in helping families previously considered beyond help. What is more, the practitioners also benefit from the helping relationship in this context...|$|E
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that language development plays {{a critical role}} in childrens socio-cognitive understanding, as talking with others provides access to their emotional experiences and differing perspectives on situations (Astington 2 ̆ 6 Baird, 2005). While middle childhood marks a burgeoning awareness of others mental states (de Rosnay 2 ̆ 6 Hughes, 2006), most research on childrens emotion talk has focused on preschool childrens talk about basic emotions (e. g., sad, angry) as opposed to older childrens talk about complex emotions that require self-awareness (e. g., jealousy, envy). The present study used vignettes followed by probe questions to elicit talk about personal experiences involving relationship rivalry versus situations involving the child coveting another persons possessions or skills (i. e., envy). We examined the extent to which school-age children, like adults, would use the term jealous in reference to each type of situation (Smith et al., 1988), {{and the extent to which}} their usage of the term and their explanations of emotions were related to vocabulary size (PPVT), non-verbal intelligence (TONI), social perspective taking skills (Aldrich, 2014; Selman 2 ̆ 6 Byrne, 1974), and a standardized measure of emotion comprehension (TEC, Pons 2 ̆ 6 Harris, 2000). Eighty 5 -to- 11 -year-olds (40 girls, 40 boys) were presented two relationship rivalry (sibling, friendship) and two envy (possession, attribute) vignettes and were asked to identify and explain the main characters feelings as well as relate information about their own feelings in these situations (i. e., using the probe Have you ever felt like [character name]? Can you tell me about it?). Childrens responses to the probe questions were coded for emotion type (e. g., sad, jealous) and explanations of the characters/their own feelings (i. e., inclusion of new story details versus repeating story elements as told by the investigator). Although children used the term jealous to describe instances of both relationship rivalry and coveting anothers possessions and attributes, their speech varied across the two types of situations. Children first began to use the term jealous in their explanations of situations involving potential threats to relationships and status about a year earlier than in their explanations of situations involving envy. Childrens responses to probe questions about relationship rivalry included more frequent mention of sadness, whereas their responses to envy included more frequent mention of anger. Overall the children were more elaborative when explaining feelings of relationship rivalry versus wanting another persons possessions or attributes, by providing more new <b>details</b> <b>about</b> <b>why</b> they (or the character) felt that way. Simultaneous regression analyses showed effects of vocabulary size, but not age or non-verbal intelligence, on childrens use of the term jealous across both types of vignettes. TEC scores were also predictive of use of the term jealous in response to the envy vignettes. Taken together, the study demonstrates the efficacy of vignettes for eliciting talk about complex emotions in children as young as five years of age, and suggests discourse strategies for helping children cope with issues of interpersonal rivalry, envy, and other powerful negative experiences...|$|E

Certainly the death of the Saturday Evening Post should remind us of the essential mortality of all magazines. Many of the magazines that led in circulation, advertising and prestige preceded the Post in death. And in the same month that the Post died, American Builder slipped quietly into the grave. Eight years earlier, American Builder had been its publisher's number one magazine, and only the previous November it had observed its hundredth anniversary.

40|$|Despite framing being a {{powerful}} mechanism in policy agenda setting, {{the planning and}} policy science literature does not yet devote {{much attention to the}} analysis of interactional framing processes in policy change processes. We analyse the framing processes that preceded tipping points in the mobilization of policy attention in a Dutch peri-urban region that over time managed to position the development of landscape values on the agendas of local and regional governments, despite various institutional barriers and blockages. After identifying tipping points in the agenda-setting process, and shifts in frames and coalitions, the paper discusses why these shifts occurred. Two framing mechanisms are identified: (1) framing issues, relationships, and interaction processes in conjunction with one another and (2) resemiotizing original frames to establish a fit to the self-referential frames of targeted supporters within and outside government. The conclusion is that a research focus on human interactions at the grassroots level and on the processes of meaning construction over time reveals <b>detailed</b> insights <b>about</b> <b>why</b> and how structural change and transitions come about.

In recent years, some NCAA members have become increasingly wealthy – grossing annual revenues upwards of $ 100 million per year. However, the NCAA’s rules still deprive these members of the opportunity to share their wealth with student-athletes. This article explains why the NCAA’s ‘no pay’ rules violate Section One of the Sherman Act.

Part II provides a brief overview of Section One of the Sherman Act – the “comprehensive charter of economic liberty” in American trade. Part III provides a <b>detailed</b> explanation <b>about</b> <b>why</b> the NCAA ‘no pay’ rules constitute both an illegal form of wage fixing and an illegal group boycott.

Findings: The findings as such suggest that social theory and critical approaches to research can contribute to understanding of IS at work and in everyday life. The account discusses the complexity of applying social theories and how difficult theoretical tomes are to understand, especially for the novice researcher. Practical implications: The paper highlights the importance of hearing the silent or silenced voices and letting stories be told. A theme throughout is how theory is linked to practice.
