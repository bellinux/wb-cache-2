In an August 1999 interview, Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development, but by December 2000 the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel after the Dreamcast's discontinuation, but later noted in 2003 {{that he would be}} interested in using the licence of Nights into Dreams to reinforce Sega's <b>identity</b> <b>as</b> a video game developer. Discussion concerning a new game in the series had increased in frequency by 2006.
