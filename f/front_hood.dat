The RC F is equipped with vertical G-sensor for VDIM, Torque Vectoring Differential (TVD) with three operating modes, Standard, Slalom, or Track, front and rear coil-spring independent suspension, monotube gas-filled shock absorbers and ball-jointed stabilizer bars, three new 19-inch diameter forged aluminum wheels, spindle grille with F-mesh pattern on the lower half, unique <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> which raises {{the peak of the}} vehicle, hood air vent from the LFA, front cooling ducts, front fender ducts in the L shape, exclusive combination meters from LFA (a large centrally mounted tachometer that alters according to drive mode, digital and analog speedometer, differential torque vectoring monitor, G-force meter, oil and water temperature gauges, mileage information and a stopwatch), elliptical cross-section thick grip steering wheel, all-new high back seats, ornamentation and pedals, Brembo four-wheel power assisted disc brakes with anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (BA), 19x9-inch front and 19x10-inch rear wheels, 255/35R19 front and 275/35R19 rear tires.|$|E
25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E

500|$|The {{pilot model}} was {{built at the}} Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942. The 57mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 recoil {{mechanism}} and installed on a tubular pedestal. The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the [...] "57mm gun mount T5". The gun on the pilot model had a traverse of 27.5 degrees {{either side of the}} centerline (total of 55 degrees), while having an elevation of +15 to -5 degrees. The short-barrelled (43 caliber) British Mark III 6-pounder gun was installed in the pilot, but the longer-barrelled (50 caliber) 57mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models. The original travel lock – to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving – proved to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by a travel lock on the <b>front</b> <b>hood.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} used for Ford Model T cars {{served as the}} basis of these railcars, which came to resemble a red box on wheels. The passenger compartment was a mere [...] long and [...] wide and seated eleven plus the driver. At the front of the railcar, a small <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> extended out from the boxy compartment and housed the engine, and from the bonnet hung large pannier bags for luggage. The railcar weighed two and a half tons, ran on four wheels, and could reach speeds of up to , a speed that was relatively fast for country branch lines of the time. It was designed so that one person could operate it rather than three that were required for a conventional carriage train.|$|E
2500|$|The HH600 {{was nearly}} {{identical}} to the previous #0900 of the New Haven internally and mechanically, but it was clad in new bodywork, with a straight-sided hood and cab sides that {{came all the way}} to the frame. [...] The HH600 was powered by a 6-cylinder McIntosh & Seymour 531 engine of , and was built from July 1932 through May 1939; in all, 78 HH600s were constructed. [...] The first-built units had sharp-edged <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> corners, but in 1934 ALCO employed industrial designer Otto Kuhler to clean up the appearance; he curved the corners and recessed the headlight, and all subsequent HH series units were of this style until another restyling in 1938 where the nose was further rounded. Late versions of this locomotive used the 6-cylinder 538 engine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trend was}} not new, as Béla Barényi is {{credited}} with having conceived the basic design in the mid-1920s. Josef Ganz developed the Standard Superior (going as far as advertising it as the [...] "German Volkswagen"). In Germany, the company Hanomag mass-produced the 2/10 PS [...] "Komissbrot", a small, cheap rear engined car, from 1925 to 1928. Also, in Czechoslovakia, the Hans Ledwinka's penned Tatra T77, a very popular car amongst the German elite, was becoming smaller and more affordable at each revision. Ferdinand Porsche, a well-known designer for high-end vehicles and race cars, had been trying for years to get a manufacturer interested in a small car suitable for a family. [...] He felt the small cars {{at the time were}} just stripped down big cars. [...] Instead he built a car he called the [...] "Volksauto" [...] from the ground up in 1933, using many of the ideas floating around at the time and several of his own, putting together a car with an air-cooled rear engine, torsion bar suspension, and a [...] "beetle" [...] shape, the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> rounded for better aerodynamics (necessary as it had a small engine).|$|E

2500|$|The top of {{the line}} models were named American GFS (Concord DL two-door), American ECD (Concord DL four-door), and Camioneta American Automática (Concord DL wagon). All three {{featured}} automatic transmissions, power brakes, power steering, [...] six-cylinder (258 on ECD) with new-for-the-year Motorcraft two-barrel carburetor and 8.0:1 compression ratio, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio, light group (courtesy, ashtray, glovebox, hood and trunk; the last one unavailable on the wagon), custom steering wheel, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, clock, retractable seat belts, luxury upholstery, tinted windshield, bright molding package (wheel arches, drip rails, rocker panels, <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> edge, hood ornament), engine displacement [...] "4.6" [...] emblems ("4.2" [...] on ECD), wheel covers, and bumper guards. The GFS model included a floor-shift transmission and reclining individual high-back seats, while the ECD and automatic wagon had column-shift coupled with a bench front seat. Both sedan models incorporated vinyl roof either in full form (ECD) or Landau type (GFS). The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line radiator, fan shroud, coolant recovery tank and 55 amp alternator), reading dome light, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|E
2500|$|Pontiac {{produced}} cars offering [...] (3.25x3.75 in, 82.5x95mm) L-head straight 6-cylinder {{engines in}} the Pontiac Chief of 1927; its stroke was the shortest of any American {{car in the}} industry at the time. The Chief sold 39,000 units within six months of its appearance at the 1926 New York Auto Salon, hitting 76,742 at twelve months. The next year, it became the top-selling six in the U.S., ranking seventh in overall sales. By 1933, it had moved up to producing the least expensive cars available with straight eight engines. This was done by using many components from the 6-cylinder Chevrolet Master, such as the body, but installing a large chrome strip {{on the top and}} center of the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> Pontiac called the [...] "Silver Streak". In the late 1930s, Pontiac used a Buick [...] "torpedo" [...] body for one of its models, just prior to its being used by Chevrolet, earning some media attention for the marque. An unusual feature of the [...] "torpedo"-bodied exhibition car was that, with push of a button, the front half of the body would open showing the engine and the car's front seat interior. In 1937, the eight-cylinder had a [...] wheelbase, while the six-cylinder had a [...] wheelbase. In 1940, Pontiac introduced the Torpedo as a production model. On 2 February 1942, a Pontiac was the last civilian automobile manufactured in the United States during World War II, as all automobile factories converted to military production.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, John Wilkinson {{left the}} company, {{allegedly}} though never verified, after a falling-out with Herbert Franklin over the insistence by Franklin {{that the new}} designs should [...] "look more like other cars." [...] The company had {{taken a lot of}} criticism in the popular press and from dealerships because of their unconventional <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> that didn't sport a radiator. Franklin had recently hired [...] J. Frank de Causse, a well-known car designer who had previously worked on the Rolls Royce and Locomobile. Wilkinson may have been alarmed when a new model, designed by de Causse, [...] "wore a fake radiator-grille shell {{to make up for the}} fact that Franklin cars did not have a radiator. Wilkinson, who had always strived for light weight and form following function, could have felt that the faux grille not only looked out of place, but it also weighed more than the traditional one-piece aluminum hood grille that he had designed. [...] It is more likely, however, that Wilkinson left the company well before the deCausse car was designed for other reasons. [...] Since the inception, all engineering was Wilkinson's responsibility, and all sales and business was HH Franklin's responsibility, and there was a tacit understanding that neither would interfere in the other's territory. [...] But a series of small instances began to occur in the early 1920s which appeared to challenge Wilkinson's authority—the Model Z affair, the Stromberg carburetor—culminating with HHF's decision to change the appearance of the car. These were business decisions, for Wilkinson should have been well aware that he could not make advancements in engineering without money from the business, but it could have still been more than John Wilkinson was willing to bear.|$|E

2500|$|Mazda {{introduced}} the 10th Anniversary RX-7 in 1988 as a {{limited production run}} based on the RX-7 Turbo II. Production was limited to 1,500 models. The 10th Anniversary RX-7 features a Crystal White (paint code UC) monochromatic paint scheme with matching white body side mouldings, taillight housings, mirrors and 16-inch alloy 7-spoke wheels. There were two [...] "series" [...] of 10th Anniversary models, with essentially a VIN-split running production change between the two. The most notable difference between the series {{can be found on}} the exterior- the earlier [...] "Series I" [...] cars had a black [...] "Mazda" [...] logo decal on the front bumper cover, whereas most if not all [...] "Series II" [...] cars did not have the decal. Series II cars also received the lower seat cushion height/tilt feature that Series I cars lacked. Another distinctive exterior feature is the bright gold rotor-shaped 10th Anniversary Edition badge on the front fenders (yellow-gold on the Series II cars). A distinctive 10th Anniversary package feature is the all black leather interior (code D7), which included not just the seats, but the door panel inserts as well and a leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel (with 10th Anniversary Edition embossed horn button) and MOMO leather shift knob with integrated boot. All exterior glass is bronze tinted (specific in North America to only the 10th Anniversary), and the windshield was equipped with the embedded secondary antenna also found on some other select models with the upgraded stereo packages.
