50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>plating</b> {{is common}} on all brass {{mouthpieces}} {{because it is}} cost-effective and good in terms of tone quality. It is also moderately germicidal. <b>Silver</b> <b>plating</b> is not as comfortable or as expensive as gold, but has properties and qualities that some feel facilitate certain styles of playing. Some believe that <b>silver</b> <b>plate</b> provides a clearer, darker sound than gold and is good for styles of playing that require clarity and projection. Silver-plate is less expensive than gold, but requires more maintenance because it tarnishes easily. Slightly tarnished silver-plate can be polished back to its brightness with silver polish.|$|R
