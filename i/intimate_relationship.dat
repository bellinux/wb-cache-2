40|$|The 2002 World Report on Violence {{states that}} {{violence}} occurs in about 70 percent of <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> (Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, & Lozano, 2002). New Zealand {{research indicates that}} {{more than a quarter of}} <b>relationships</b> have experienced <b>intimate</b> partner violence (IPV), with Māori (Indigenous people of New Zealand) women three times more likely to experience IPV in their lifetime. Utilising Kaupapa Māori (Māori-centred approach) and narrative methodologies, this paper explores the nature of <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> from a Māori perspective, investigating how Māori initiate <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships,</b> attempt to maintain positive <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> and when applicable, exit <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships.</b> The findings from two case studies reveal that <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> involve identity negotiation and an incorporation of cultural values. Communication processes are highlighted as a facilitating factor of <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background People with {{intellectual}} disabilities face attitudinal {{and service}} barriers {{when attempting to}} form <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships.</b> To date, their experiences and views are under-represented in the existing evidence base. Method The {{aim of this study}} was to carry out an interpretative phenomenological analysis exploring the experience of <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> for nine adults with intellectual disabilities. Results Four main themes were identified: desiring relationships; expressing sexuality; having relationships; and who has control? Together these themes demonstrated that <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> were desired and important to all participants, fulfilling a variety of their needs. In addition, participants faced a number of challenges related to <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships.</b> Conclusion The findings raise questions about how best to support people with intellectual disabilities with sexuality and <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships.</b> Implications for caregivers and services are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on.

5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for his concept of Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E
5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{inspired}} by films such as The Prisoner of Zenda, If I Were King and Viva Zapata!. Ramachandran, in an account about the film he wrote in 1959, mentioned three specific differences from The Prisoner of Zenda. In the original, the look-alike and the queen have an <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> while in Nadodi Mannan, Veerangan rejects Manohari's advances. When she realises that Veerangan is not Marthandan, she addresses him as her brother instead. Secondly, the look-alike {{was related to the}} king and shared the same interests. Veerangan is not related to Marthandan and initially has contrasting qualities until they meet. Thirdly, the character of Vijayavarman, and the sequences in Kanni Theevu, do not feature in the original, while these were incorporated as part of Nadodi Mannans main plot.|$|E

The disciplines involved in the pairfam project are Sociology, Psychology, Demography, and Economics.

25|$|Emotional {{blackmail}} typically involves {{two people}} who have established a close personal or <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> (parent and child, spouses, siblings, or two close friends).

40|$|The aims of {{this review}} were to {{systematically}} identify, critically appraise and synthesize {{the results of}} existing qualitative literature exploring the views and experiences of <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> amongst people with intellectual disabilities. Fourteen peer-reviewed articles were identified through a systematic search of eight databases, reference lists, citations, and relevant journals. The identified articles were appraised for quality, then synthesized using a metaethnography approach. No study met all quality criteria and references to ethical approval were often lacking. Interpretation of the findings suggested three key themes: the meaning of <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships,</b> external constraints and facilitators, and managing external constraints. Though many people with intellectual disabilities desire and benefit from <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships,</b> they experience restrictions that others do not, {{which can lead to}} isolation and loneliness. <b>Intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> are not always necessarily linked with sexual behavior; therefore, <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> warrant their own focus in future research, as well as in education and training for people with intellectual disabilities and their caregivers. Within this, a commitment to transparency over research processes is needed, in particular with reference to how ethical approval was obtained, since this has been a shortcoming of research with this focus to date...|$|R
