40|$|Abstract- There are {{a number}} of factors that need to be {{considered}} when <b>designing</b> high <b>voltage</b> substations. Therefore, <b>designing</b> a high <b>voltage</b> substation is a challenging task. The first step in <b>designing</b> a high <b>voltage</b> substation is to design an earthing and bonding system. An earthing system connection is one to which transformer and generators neutrals or earthing impedances may be connected in order to pass the maximum fault current. In this paper designing an earthing and bonding system for high voltage substation using one and half circuit breaker layout has been briefly explained...|$|R

5000|$|For a fixed {{power and}} life, the {{luminous}} efficacy of all incandescent lamps is greatest {{at a particular}} <b>design</b> <b>voltage.</b> Halogen lamps made for 12 to 24 volt operation have good light outputs, and the very compact filaments are particularly beneficial for optical control (see picture). The ranges of multifaceted reflector [...] "MR" [...] lamps of 20-50 watts were originally conceived for the projection of 8 mm film, but are now widely used for display lighting and in the home. More recently, wider beam versions have become available designed for direct use on supply voltages of 120 or 230 V.|$|E
50|$|Halogen lamps are {{manufactured}} with enough halogen {{to match the}} rate of tungsten evaporation at their <b>design</b> <b>voltage.</b> Increasing the applied voltage increases the rate of evaporation, so at some point there may be insufficient halogen and the lamp goes black. Over-voltage operation is not generally recommended. With a reduced voltage the evaporation is lower {{and there may be}} too much halogen, which can lead to abnormal failure. At much lower voltages, the bulb temperature may be too low to support the halogen cycle, but by this time the evaporation rate is too low for the bulb to blacken significantly. There are many situations where halogen lamps are dimmed successfully. However, lamp life may not be extended as much as predicted. The life span on dimming depends on lamp construction, the halogen additive used and whether dimming is normally expected for this type.|$|E
50|$|There were {{environmental}} {{objections to}} large-scale power generation in Central London, so LESCo {{decided to move}} to a new site in Deptford and to use the Grosvenor Gallery site as a substation. A feature of the Grosvenor scheme was its use of alternating current (AC) in preference to direct current (DC). The use of AC allowed the voltage to be raised to 10 kV for transmission between Deptford and Grosvenor Gallery. High-voltage cables were laid alongside the London & Greenwich Railway line, but cable design at that time was rudimentary, having short lengths and many joints. This caused a voltage drop of some 10% from end to end. In order to supply at 10 kV at Grosvenor Gallery substation, the <b>design</b> <b>voltage</b> at Deptford had to be set at 11 kV, which is why national transmission voltages became standardised in multiples of eleven.|$|E

50|$|Operation of a {{transformer}} at its <b>designed</b> <b>voltage</b> {{but at a}} higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. For example, transformers {{may need to be}} equipped with 'volts per hertz' over-excitation, ANSI function 24, relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In modern <b>designs,</b> <b>voltage</b> drop on {{the power}} grid is be-coming a {{critical}} concern. One important technique to avoid severe voltage drops is to spread the highly power hungrybuffers, such as I/O buffers, around the grid. In this paper, we study the problem of I/O buffer placement so as to avoidhot spots which are locations on the chip characterized by high voltage drops. The problem is defined mathematicallyand formulated as an ILP problem. Then an efficient greedy heuristic is proposed {{as an alternative to}} the expensive ILPsolution...|$|R
50|$|This voltage is not {{directly}} produced by the main power supply circuitry; instead the receiver makes use of the circuitry used for horizontal scanning. Direct current (DC), is switched though the line output transformer, and alternating current (AC) is induced into the scan coils. At {{the end of each}} horizontal scan line the magnetic field, which has built up in both transformer and scan coils by the current, is a source of latent electromagnetic energy. This stored collapsing magnetic field energy can be captured. The reverse flow, short duration, (about 10% of the line scan time) current from both the line output transformer and the horizontal scan coil is discharged again into the primary winding of the flyback transformer by the use of a rectifier which blocks this negative reverse emf. A small value capacitor is connected across the scan switching device. This tunes the circuit inductances to resonate at a much higher frequency. This slows down (lengthens) the flyback time from the extremely rapid decay rate that would result if they were electrically isolated during this short period. One of the secondary windings on the flyback transformer then feeds this brief high voltage pulse to a Cockcroft-Walton generator <b>design</b> <b>voltage</b> multiplier. This produces the required EHT supply. A flyback converter is a power supply circuit operating on similar principles.|$|E
