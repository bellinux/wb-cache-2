In this study, we demonstrate that the RNase P-based strategy is effective in blocking gene expression and growth of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) -associated herpesvirus (KSHV), the causative agent of the leading AIDS-associated neoplasms, such as KS and primary-effusion lymphoma. We constructed 2 ′-O-methyl-modified EGS molecules that target the mRNA encoding KSHV immediate-early transcription activator Rta, and we administered them directly to human primary-effusion lymphoma cells infected with KSHV. A reduction of 90 % in Rta expression and a reduction of ≈ 150 -fold in viral growth were observed in cells treated with a functional EGS. In contrast, a reduction of < 10 % in the Rta expression and viral growth was found in cells that were either not treated with an EGS or that were treated with a disabled EGS containing mutations that preclude recognition by RNase P. Our study provides direct evidence that EGSs are highly effective in inhibiting KSHV gene expression and growth. Exogenous administration of chemically modified EGSs in inducing RNase P-mediated cleavage represents an approach for inhibiting specific gene expression and for treating human diseases, including KSHV-associated tumors...|$|E
40|$|<b>External</b> <b>guide</b> <b>sequences</b> (EGSs) are RNA {{molecules}} that {{consist of a}} sequence complementary to a target mRNA and recruit intracellular ribonuclease P (RNase P), a tRNA processing enzyme, for specific degradation of the target mRNA. We have previously used an in vitro selection procedure to generate EGS variants that efficiently induce human RNase P to cleave a target mRNA in vitro. In this study, we constructed EGSs from a variant to target the overlapping region of the S mRNA, pre-S/L mRNA, and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which are essential for viral replication and infection. The EGS variant was about 50 -fold more efficient in inducing human RNase P to cleave the mRNA in vitro than the EGS derived from a natural tRNA. Following Salmonella-mediated gene delivery, the EGSs were expressed in cultured HBV-carrying cells. A reduction of about 97 % and 75 % {{in the level of}} HBV RNAs and proteins and an inhibition of about 6, 000 - and 130 -fold in the levels of capsid-associated HBV DNA were observed in cells treated with Salmonella vectors carrying the expression cassette for the variant and the tRNA-derived EGS, respectively. Our study provides direct evidence that the EGS variant is more effective in blocking HBV gene expression and DNA replication than the tRNA-derived EGS. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the feasibility of developin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{method for}} {{inhibiting}} {{the expression of}} particular genes using <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> <b>sequences</b> (EGSs) has been developed in bacteria, mammalian cells and maize cells. Results To examine whether EGS technology {{can be used to}} down-regulate gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), we generated EGS-Ngfp-lacZ and EGS-Mtgfp that are targeted against Ngfp-lacZ and Mtgfp mRNA, respectively. These EGSs were introduced, both separately and together, into the C. elegans strain PD 4251, which contains Ngfp-lacZ and Mtgfp. Consequently, the expression levels of Ngfp-lacZ and Mtgfp were affected by EGS-Ngfp-lacZ and EGS-Mtgfp, respectively. We further generated an EGS library that contains a randomized antisense domain of tRNA-derived EGS (" 3 / 4 EGS"). Examination of the composition of the EGS library showed that there was no obvious bias in the cloning of certain EGSs. A subset of EGSs was randomly chosen for screening in the C. elegans strain N 2. About 6 % of these EGSs induced abnormal phenotypes such as P 0 slow postembryonic growth, P 0 larval arrest, P 0 larval lethality and P 0 sterility. Of these, EGS- 35 and EGS- 83 caused the greatest phenotype changes, and their target mRNAs were identified as ZK 858. 7 mRNA and Lin- 13 mRNA, respectively. Conclusion EGS technology can be used to down-regulate gene expression in C. elegans. The EGS library is a research tool for reverse genetic screening in C. elegans. These observations are potentially of great importance to further our understanding and use of C. elegans genomics. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>External</b> <b>guide</b> <b>sequences</b> (EGSs) {{represent}} {{a new class}} of RNA-based gene-targeting agents, consist of a sequence complementary to a target mRNA, and render the target RNA susceptible to degradation by ribonuclease P (RNase P). In this study, EGSs were constructed to target the mRNA encoding human CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR 5), one of the primary coreceptors for HIV. An EGS RNA, C 1, efficiently directed human RNase P to cleave the CCR 5 mRNA sequence in vitro. A reduction of about 70 % in the expression level of both CCR 5 mRNA and protein and an inhibition of more than 50 -fold in HIV (R 5 strain Ba-L) p 24 production were observed in cells that expressed C 1. In comparison, a reduction of about 10 % in the expression of CCR 5 and viral growth was found in cells that either did not express the EGS or produced a “disabled” EGS which carried nucleotide mutations that precluded RNase P recognition. Furthermore, the same C 1 -expressing cells that were protected from R 5 strain Ba-L retained susceptibility to X 4 strain IIIB, which uses CXCR 4 as the coreceptor instead of CCR 5, suggesting that the RNase P-mediated cleavage induced by the EGS is specific for the target CCR 5 but not the closely related CXCR 4. Our results provide direct evidence that EGS RNAs against CCR 5 are effective and specific in blocking HIV infection and growth. These results also demonstrate the feasibility to develop highly effective EGSs for anti-HIV therapy...|$|R
