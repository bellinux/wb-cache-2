5000|$|Mostly {{contained}} within modern-day Chad, Bagirmi emerged {{to the southeast}} of the Kanem-Bornu Empire under Mbang Birni Besse. He seems to have displaced the earlier Bulala.

The Bagirmi carried a tradition that they migrated from far to the east, which is supported by the resemblance of their language to various tribes on the White Nile. The fourth <b>king,</b> <b>Abdullah</b> (1568-1608), adopted Islam and converted the state into a sultanate, permitting the state to extend their authority over many pagan tribes in the area, including the area's Saras, Gaberi, Somrai, Gulla, Nduka, Nuba, and Sokoro.

40|$|The {{effect that}} Dyskeratosis congenita {{mutations}} have on ribosome biogenesis {{has not been}} fully investigated. Here, I am studying the effect of Dyskeratosis congenita mutations using a yeast model system {{with the goal of}} identifying impacts on ribosome biogenesis. I constructed six haploid yeast strains with a single mutation in the CBF 5 gene each using site-directed mutagenesis and chromosomal integration. First, I screened for phenotypic effects on growth on solid and in liquid medium at different temperatures; these experiments show normal growth behavior of the mutant strains compared to wild type. Second, Cbf 5 p expression levels were examined in whole-cell extract via western blotting analysis, which again did not reveal any difference to wild type. Finally, progression through the cell cycle was investigated in synchronized cells. Together, this study indicates that individual Dyskeratosis congenita mutations are well tolerated in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <b>KING</b> <b>ABDULLAH</b> BIN ABDULAZIZ SCHOLARSHI...|$|R
