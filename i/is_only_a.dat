5|$|Black's wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher), a {{clinical}} social worker, warns against questioning Patricia — {{although she is}} an important witness, she <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> child and is in a fragile mental state. Black and Bletcher visit James Glen (Glynn Turman) a graphology expert, having found the killer's signature in the viewing's guestbook. Analysis of the killer's handwriting links him to almost forty open house viewings over the previous six months.|$|E
5|$|Blythe further {{testified that}} he was not under the {{influence}} of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs. Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, {{testified that he}} had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} to avoid the {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> third of that of uranium-235. A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E

5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small part of the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges there <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> single {{report of}} the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
5|$|For 80 of the {{chemical}} elements, at least one stable isotope exists. As a rule, there <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> handful of stable isotopes {{for each of these}} elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.|$|E

5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two halves of the island.|$|E

5|$|In November 2005 the Smoking Popes, with drummer Rob Kellenberger, reunited to play Chicago's Flower 15 festival. The {{performance}} was recorded and released as the CD/DVD package At Metro through Victory Records in February 2006. Ryan Chavez drummed on the band's fifth studio album, Stay Down, released in 2008 through Curb Appeal Records. Neil Hennessy of fellow Chicago punk rock band The Lawrence Arms became the Smoking Popes' permanent drummer {{prior to the}} album's release. In February 2010 Asian Man Records released the compilation album It's Been a Long Day. The band's sixth studio album, This <b>Is</b> <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> Test, was released March 15, 2011 through Asian Man.|$|E

5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It {{also serves as a}} carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Qatar is {{required}} to have a broadcaster which has at least associate membership of the EBU {{in order to have}} a chance to take part, as Qatar Radio <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> radio station and Qatar lies outside the European Broadcasting Area and cannot apply for Council of Europe membership with Australia being the only exception after being an associate member for over 30 years. The broadcaster would most likely be Qatar Television (QTV) also owned and run by the Qatar General Broadcasting and Television Corporation (QGBTC). If Qatar Radio gets accepted too, then they would be able to air the contest alongside the television broadcast.|$|E

5|$|The Doom Bar is a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes, and it has been shown that there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary. This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. There <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary.|$|E
