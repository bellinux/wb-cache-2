25|$|There is {{evidence}} that <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers</b> in North America have a calmer and more even temperament than their European counterparts because of the breeding strategies employed by American breeders. Because of these differences in breeding strategies, different lines of <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers</b> have developed different traits. Although many contemporary <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers</b> in North America are gentle and friendly to strangers, some lines are bred more true to the original personality standard.|$|R

25|$|Canine {{intelligence}} is an umbrella term that encompasses the faculties {{involved in a}} wide range of mental tasks, such as learning, problem-solving, and communication. The <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> has ranked amongst the most intelligent of dog breeds in experimental studies and expert evaluations. For instance, psychologist Stanley Coren ranks the Doberman as the 5th most intelligent dog in the category of obedience command training, based on the selective surveys he performed of some trainers (as documented in his book The Intelligence of Dogs). Additionally, in two studies, Hart and Hart (1985) ranked the <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> first in this category. and Tortora (1980) gave the Doberman the highest rank in trainability. Although the methods of evaluation differ, these studies consistently show that the <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher,</b> along with the Border Collie, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Standard Poodle and Rottweiler, is one of the most trainable breeds of dog.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCurrently {{there is}} no large animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy. The smaller animal models of cardiomyopathy, such as the Syrian hamster, cannot be studied with echocartography and cardiac catheterization, and the {{relevance}} of these models to human dilated cardiomyopathy is open to question. On the basis of some initial observations in <b>Doberman</b> <b>pinschers,</b> it was speculated that these dogs could have occult left ventricular dysfunction. Accordingly, studies were performed in 46 apparently healthy <b>Doberman</b> <b>pinschers</b> and in 41 mongrel dogs: two-dimensional echocardiography (30 dogs in each group), cardiac catheterization (16 <b>Doberman</b> <b>pinschers</b> and 12 mongrels) and coronary blood flow studies (13 <b>Doberman</b> <b>pinschers</b> and 6 mongrels). In the awake, unsedated dogs studied with echocardiography, left ventricular wall thickening was significantly less in the Dobermans than in the mongrels (28 % versus 36 %, p = 0. 0003). In the anesthetized dogs undergoing cardiac catheterization, left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in the Dobermans than in the mongrels (0. 38 versus 0. 63, p = 0. 0001). Rest coronary blood flow and coronary blood flow reserve were similar in the two groups. It is concluded that apparently healthy <b>Doberman</b> <b>pinschers</b> have occult left ventricular dysfunction. These dogs {{may serve as a}} large animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy and should not be used experimentally to study normal cardiac physiology...|$|R

25|$|Breed {{standards}} describe Doberman Pinschers as dogs of medium-large size with {{a square}} build and short coat. They are compactly built and athletic with endurance and swiftness. The <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> {{should have a}} proud, watchful, determined, and obedient temperament. The dog was originally intended as a guard dog, so males should have a masculine, muscular, noble appearance. Females are thinner, but should not be spindly.|$|E
25|$|The breed is {{believed}} to have been created from several different breeds of dogs that had the characteristics that Dobermann was looking for. The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used, remain uncertain to this day, although many experts believe that the <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> is a combination of several breeds including the Beauceron, German Pinscher, Rottweiler and Weimaraner. The single exception is the documented crossing with the Greyhound and Manchester Terrier. It is also widely believed that the old German Shepherd gene pool was the single largest contributor to the Doberman breed. Philip Greunig's The Dobermann Pinscher (1939), is considered the foremost study of the development of the breed by one of its most ardent students. Greunig's study describes the breed's early development by Otto Goeller, whose hand allowed the Doberman to become the dog we recognize today. The American Kennel Club believes the breeds utilized to develop the <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> may have included the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier and the German Pinscher.|$|E
25|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} is a {{major cause}} of death in Doberman Pinschers. This disease affects Dobermans more than any other breed. Nearly 40% of DCM diagnoses are for Doberman Pinschers, followed by German Shepherds at 13%.

25|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 1979 and 1998, the <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> was {{involved}} in attacks on humans resulting in fatalities less frequently than several other dog breeds such as German Shepherd Dogs, Rottweilers, Husky-type, Wolf-dog hybrids and Alaskan Malamutes. According to this Center for Disease Control and Prevention study, {{one of the most}} important factors contributing to dog bites is the level of responsibility exercised by dog owners.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of canine personality, {{there has been some}} research to determine whether there are breed differences in aggression. In a study published in 2008, aggression was divided into four categories: aggression directed at strangers, owner, strange dogs and rivalry with other household dogs. This study found that the <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> ranked relatively high on stranger-directed aggression, but extremely low on owner-directed aggression. The <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans, and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., Cocker Spaniel, Dalmatian, and Great Dane). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Doberman shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation, and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall. In regards to Dobermans attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of over discipline. Dobermans accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.|$|E
25|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) is {{a disease}} of heart muscle resulting in decreased myocardial contractility. The left ventricle compensates for this disease by growing larger (eccentric or volume overload hypertrophy; AKA dilation). The left atrial is also dilated when the disease is severe. It is seen in large/giant dog breeds such as Boxers, Great Danes, and <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers.</b> It is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by taurine deficiency in American Cocker Spaniels or doxorubicin use. A mutation in the gene that encodes for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 is associated with DCM in <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers</b> in the USA. Dilated cardiomyopathy usually ultimately results in congestive heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is common in giant breed dogs with DCM. <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers</b> more commonly have ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., premature ventricular complexes; ventricular tachycardia) that predispose them to sudden death (i.e., ventricular fibrillation).|$|R
40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) vertebral ratio values representing vertebral canal height, vertebral canal shape, and vertebral body shape in <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers</b> with and without disk-associated cervical spondylomyelopathy (DACSM) and clinically normal English Foxhounds. Animals-Doberman Pinschers with (n = 18) and without (20) DACSM and clinically normal English Foxhounds (18). Procedures-All dogs underwent low-field MRI of the cervical vertebral column. From 5 specific measurements made at C 3 through C 7, 4 linear vertebral ratios were calculated and assessed for correlation: vertebral canal height-to-body height ratio (CBHR), vertebral canal height-to-body length ratio (CBLR), caudal canal height-to-cranial canal height ratio (CCHR), and vertebral body length-to-height ratio (BLHR). The CBHR and CBLR described vertebral canal height, CCHR described vertebral canal shape, and BLHR described vertebral body shape. A midvertebral canal-occupying ratio (mVCOR) for the spinal cord was calculated at C 5. Results-Compared with both groups of unaffected dogs, CBHR, CBLR, and BLHR for <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers</b> with DACSM were significantly smaller. The C 7 CCHR was significantly larger in DACSM-affected <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers,</b> compared with clinically normal English Foxhounds. Ratios {{did not differ significantly}} between unaffected <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers</b> and clinically normal English Foxhounds. Correlation coefficients between CBHR, CBLR, and mVCOR were low and not significant. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Doberman Pinschers with DACSM had significantly smaller vertebral canal heights and more square-shaped vertebral bodies, compared with unaffected <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinschers,</b> combined with a funnel-shaped vertebral canal at C 7 Breed-specific differences were not evident. Linear MRI vertebral canal-to-body ratios do not appear to predict relative vertebral canal stenosis...|$|R

25|$|Although the {{aggressiveness}} stereotype is less true today, {{the personality}} of the <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> is unique. There {{is a great deal of}} scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence. As early as 1965, studies have shown that there are several broad behavioral traits that significantly predict behavior and are genetically determined. Subsequently, there have been numerous scientific attempts to quantify canine personality or temperament by using statistical techniques for assessing personality traits in humans. These studies often vary in terms of the personality factors they focus on, and in terms of ranking breeds differently along these dimensions. One such study found that Doberman Pinschers, compared to other breeds, rank high in playfulness, average in curiosity/fearlessness, low on aggressiveness, and low on sociability. Another such study ranked Doberman Pinschers low on reactivity/surgence, and high on aggression/disagreeableness and openness/trainability.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they are}} {{considered}} to be working dogs, Doberman Pinschers are often stereotyped as being ferocious and aggressive. As a personal protection dog, the Doberman was originally bred for these traits: it had to be large and intimidating, fearless, and willing to defend its owner, but sufficiently obedient and restrained to only do so on command. These traits served the dog well in its role as a personal defense dog, police dog, or war dog, but were not ideally adapted to a companionship role. The Doberman Pinscher's aggression has been toned down by modern breeders over the years, and today's Dobermans are known for a much more even and good natured temperament, extreme loyalty, high intelligence, and great trainability. In fact, the Doberman Pinscher's size, short coat, and intelligence have made it a desirable house dog. The <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher</b> is known to be energetic, watchful, fearless and obedient.|$|E

Several scenes in Phantasmagoria involved animals, including a <b>Doberman</b> <b>Pinscher,</b> two cats, a beagle and several rats. Sierra commissioned Dave Macmillian and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals. Two cats were required to portray Adrienne's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform. Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game. The society was thanked in the credits as a result. Ultimately, all of the scenes filmed for Phantasmagoria were used in the final game. Some were edited for length and pacing, but none were cut altogether.|$|E
