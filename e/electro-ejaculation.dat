Pooled semen (n = 4) of six males of each breed was used. In Sika deer, semen collection rate was 96 % (23 / 24) over all <b>electro-ejaculations.</b> Volume, sperm motility and sperm concentration of fresh ejaculates was 0. 5 +/- 0. 4 ml, 77 +/- 6 % and 1471. 3 +/- 940. 0 x 10 (6) ml(- 1), respectively. Post-thaw motility in respective extender was A: 66 +/- 16 %; B: 71 +/- 2 %; C: 73 +/- 6 %; D: 9 +/- 4 % and E: 26 +/- 12 % (mean +/- S. D.). In extender C (74 +/- 14 %) more viable spermatozoa were preserved than in the others (A: 64 +/- 10 %; B: 48 +/- 11 %; D: 41 +/- 16 %; E: 47 +/- 6 %; P 0. 05). In Sambar deer, semen collection rate was 88 % (21 / 24) over all <b>electro-ejaculations.</b> Volume, sperm motility and sperm concentration of fresh ejaculates was 1. 3 +/- 0. 5 ml, 82 +/- 4 % and 379. 1 +/- 252. 2 x 10 (6) ml(- 1), respectively. Post-thaw motility was in respective extenders A: 69 +/- 2 %; B: 74 +/- 6 %; C: 73 +/- 2 %; D: 13 +/- 6 % and E: 31 +/- 120 %. Extenders B and C were superior (P > 0. 05) with respect to sperm motility. Similarly, post-thaw viability in extenders A (70 +/- 7 %), B (76 +/- 7 %) and C (79 +/- 2 %) was higher than that D (25 +/- 19 %) and E (29 +/- 17 %) (P < 0. 01). Sperm acrosomal integrity was better preserved in extenders B (86 +/- 4 %) and C (83 +/- 4 %) than in extenders A (54 +/- 13 %), D (39 +/- 22 %) and E (46 +/- 22 %) (P < 0. 05). Post-thaw sperm longevity in extender A reduced from 69 to 16 % during incubation (P < 0. 05) whereas only a slight decrease was observed in the other extenders after 4 h. In conclusion these data show that eggyolk-Tris-Tes-glycerol based extender C containing Equex STM paste is optimal for freezing semen of Formosan Sika deer while eggyolk-Tris [...] citric acid-glycerol based extender B containing Equex and extender C are superior in semen cryopreservation to others for Formosan Sambar deer.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} <b>electro-ejaculation</b> of free-range eastern grey kangaroos in {{the field}} and assess the efficacy of four diluents to preserve sperm motility over a 48 -h period at 5 degrees C. PROCEDURE AND DESIGN: Under gaseous anaesthesia, 25 free-range kangaroos were electro-ejaculated and characteristics of the ejaculate noted. Spermatozoa obtained from eight ejaculates were diluted in phosphate buffered saline containing various combinations of egg yolk and glucose and refrigerated at 5 degrees C for 48 h. RESULTS: Spermatozoa were recovered from 24 of 28 ejaculates. Mean (+/- SEM) semen volume (mL) and pH were 25. 0 +/- 1. 9 and 7. 1 +/- 0. 1 respectively. The forward motility (%), rate of movement of sperm (0 to 5) and sperm concentration (x 10 (6) /mL) were 77. 4 +/- 1. 5, 3. 8 +/- 0. 9 and 31. 2 +/- 7. 3 respectively.

During the breeding and non-breeding season, samples were collected 60  min before EE and copulation as well as 0 (at the time of ejaculation), 20 and 60  min after EE and copulation. Low testosterone levels were detected from October to February (4. 58 – 5. 06  nmol L − 1), while high levels were noted from May to September (8. 01 – 11. 40  nmol L − 1) with significant differences among months (P   <   0. 001). In contrast, cortisol levels were low from March to October (0. 63 – 2. 27  nmol L − 1) and the highest level was recorded in December (11. 30  nmol L − 1) with a significant month effect (P   <   0. 001). Cortisol reached its maximum concentration in the electrically stimulated rams 20  min post <b>electro-ejaculation</b> with {{no significant difference between}} the two seasons at this end time point.

Semen collection attempts were performed by <b>electro-ejaculation</b> at 3 -months intervals, starting at 14 months of age. Thirty-eight sexually inexperienced males were {{used to evaluate the}} exhibition of sexual behavior at two age ranges: 12. 1 to 17. 4 months of age (G 1) and 18. 4 to 28. 4 months (G 2). Each male was evaluated individually (IND) or in groups under competition (COM); (5 males per group) free in a pasture with 5 cows (3 in heat and 2 not in heat). Body weight increased linearly from 7. 5 to 30. 7 months of age. Scrotal circumference and testicular diameter increased linearly with age and body weight. Testicular length had a quadratic growth with age and weight. First motile sperm cells (considered as puberty) were detected at the 18. 2 ± 2. 1 months of age, 255. 5 ± 32. 0 kg body weight and 24. 2 ± 2. 4 cm of scrotal circumference. The percentage of bulls that exhibited sexual behavior was higher in the G 2 than in the G 1 group for both IND and COM evaluations. The number of sexual events displayed by active males did not differ among age groups. It was concluded that Guzerat bulls, raised in pasture under tropical conditions, reached puberty around 18 months of age, and did not reach testicular growth plateau until 30 months. Expression of sexual behavior started during the prepubertal period and differences between individuals were already detectable during this stage of development...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gain some {{understanding}} {{of the significance of}} the morphological features of spermatozoa within the Macropodoidea, the motility of spermatozoa from two macropodids (Petrogale xanthopus and Dendrolagus matschiei) and the motility, number and distribution of spermatozoa from three potoroidids (Aepyprymnus rufescens, Bettongia penicillata and Potorous tridactylus) were examined. Sperm were collected by <b>electro-ejaculation</b> or from the cauda epididymides. Epididymides from the potoroidids were divided into 12 regions. One epididymidis per animal was fixed for light and transmission electron microscopy and, on the contralateral side, the number of sperm, their distribution and motility were determined. In general, spermatozoa of all five species differed markedly from one another in head and flagella dimensions. Spermatozoa from B. penicillata and P. tridactylus were significantly longer and broader and had a smaller acrosome relative to head length, and there was a radial displacement of dense fibres. They also progressed more rapidly in standard culture media. Spermatozoa from at least three species were able to alter their motility pattern in vitro as media viscosity increased. Sperm movement in all species appeared to be restricted to one plane and showed no evidence of rotation, whereas lateral head displacement was often pronounced; {{there was no evidence of}} a sinusoidal mode of progressive motility. Testicular and epididymal sperm numbers in A. rufescens and P. tridactylus were relatively high (approximately 17. 5 - 50 x 10 (6)). In A. rufescens, approximately 69 % of all epididymal sperm were located in the cauda epididymidis compared with approximately 40 % in P. tridactylus. This study demonstrated that marked radial displacement of the dense fibres is probably closely associated with the ability to develop a sinusoidal mode of progressive movement, and that this feature of the sperm tail structure is not just linked with sperm size. Sperm size, however, is associated with sperm velocity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of two semen collection methods (<b>electro-ejaculation</b> [EE] and transrectal massage [RM]) on in vitro sperm functionality and protein composition of seminal plasma in Bali bulls. Ten untrained Bali bulls were selected for semen collection by EE and RM. Parameters analysed were acrosome and plasma membrane integrity, sperm motility (by CASA), normal morphology, functionality (sperm penetration assay), acrosome reaction, total protein content and protein profiles (by 2 D-PAGE). Bulls collected by RM had a higher (p< 0. 05) percentage of spermatozoa with intact acrosome and plasma membrane, functionality and individual motility, and a lower proportion of seminal plasma, total protein content and lower ratio of low molecular weight proteins than those collected by EE. Analysis of 2 D-PAGE gel detected about 116 spots in the range of 10 – 250 kDa and isoelectric points (pI) ranging from 3 to 10. Approximately 52 % of seminal plasma protein spots were represented by four major protein fractions with molecular weights around 37 – 45 kDa (15. 66 %), 25 – 30 kDa (12. 46 %), 14 – 16 kDa (11. 73 %) and 12 – 15 kDa (11. 52 %). Ten of the seminal plasma proteins identified by mass spectrometry belonged to major bovine seminal plasma proteins. A very significant finding in this study was related to the two proteins identified, PGK and PLA 2, with MW of approximately 37 – 40 and 50 – 55 kDa and pI of 8. 5 – 8. 8 and 5. 2 – 6. 0, respectively. These two protein spots can only be detected in the seminal plasma of ejaculates obtained through RM. In conclusion, semen quality as examined by in vitro sperm functionality was found to be better in RM than EE samples after treatment with heparin and calcium ionophore A- 23187. In addition some low molecular weight proteins were up-regulated in the seminal plasma obtained from the EE method...|$|E

40|$|Many {{workers have}} shown that sheep are {{seasonal}} breeders with peak reproductive activity occurring during the autumn months. The initial experiment in this thesis was designed to define the seasonality of reproduction in rams of the N. Z. Romney breed as determined by repeated measurements of semen characteristics and of plasma hormone levels. These parameters were studied for 16 months in six N. Z. Romney rams on pasture, with five Merino and four Polled Dorset rams included for comparison. Semen from all three breeds showed relatively regular seasonal changes in ejaculate volumes and seminal fructose levels with peak values being recorded during March. Likewise, monthly hormone levels varied in a regular manner with plasma LH, testosterone and prolactin concentration being elevated during the summer months. Many of the other semen parameters measured showed little tendency for seasonal variations, however a change in semen collection technique, from predominantly artificial vagina to entirely <b>electro-ejaculation,</b> may have masked some seasonal changes. All three breeds showed similar seasonal changes in the parameters studied although semen from the Polled Dorsets did not exhibit regular seasonal variations in fructose levels. Further experiments were carried out to define the neuroendocrine mechanisms which regulate the seasonal reproductive changes in N. Z. Romney rams. Three olfactory bulbectomized rams, three cranial cervical ganglionectomized rams and four rams which had undergone both of these surgical modifications, were grazed together with the rams mentioned above. These surgical treatments disrupted the regular seasonal changes in plasma levels of LH and prolactin, but not, of testosterone. Spermatozoal concentrations in ejaculates from operated rams were higher than those from unoperated controls, whereas mean fructose concentrations were lower; however the pattern of seasonal changes in seminal fructose levels was similar in all groups of rams. Cranial cervical ganglionectomy reduced hydroxyindole-O-methyl transferase activity and cell volumes in the pineal glands, so {{it was concluded that}} disrupted seasonal patterns of changes in plasma LH and prolactin levels, plus the altered semen production in the surgically treated rams, resulted from modified pineal gland and/or olfactory system activity. A preliminary investigation into the role of changes in daily photoperiod as the stimulus for seasonality of reproduction, was carried out by placing rams in light-controlled rooms {{at the time of the}} March equinox. Over the following nine months rams exposed to a phase-reversed annual lighting cycle showed earlier elevations of seminal fructose and plasma testosterone levels than rams on either the normal annual or a constant equinoctial lighting regime. In all three groups plasma prolactin levels were directly related to the length of daily photoperiod. The findings of the above experiments were extended by a final study in which both pinealectomized and sham-operated rams were exposed to normal or reversed annual lighting cycles. Effects of lighting on plasma testosterone and prolactin levels, and on seminal fructose levels, were diminished by pinealectomy. Autopsy data related to gonadal and accessory sex gland function showed significant operations x lighting regimes interactions, which supported the conclusion that in rams pineal gland function mediates endocrine and gonadal responses to changes in daily photoperiod. Three short-term investigations of hormonal secretion profiles conducted during the latter experiment, showed that major fluctuations in the release of LH, testosterone, prolactin and cortisol occurred irregularly during the day. A nocturnal elevation of plasma prolactin levels was abolished by pinealectomy. These acute studies tended to confirm the findings of the latter experiment, but in particular they highlighted the pulsatile nature of hormonal secretion...|$|E
40|$|Two {{studies using}} the Booroola Merino {{crossbred}} animals were conducted. In the first, the flock mating performance of Booroola Merino-Romney crossbred ram lambs mated to Perendale ewes was examined. The second study comprised {{observations on the}} incidence of foot "conditions" in young Booroola Merino crossbreds and Perendale sheep grazed on hill country. MATING PERFORMANCE Eighteen Booroola Merino x Romney ram lam's (6 control, 12 mating group) were selected according to weaning weight, fleece characteristics and general body condition. Nine ram lambs were exposed to ewes prior to mating for two weeks (trained) and nine kept separate from any ewes (untrained). The ram lambs of the mating group (6 trained, 6 untrained) were allocated to six groups of ewes which were "single-sire" mated. Groups 1, 2, 3, 4 comprised 140 ewes each and Groups 5 and 6 comprised 100 e';̇res each. The ram lambs were changed after eight, eight, seven and seven days of mating, Periods P 1, P 2, P 3 and P 4 respectively, {{and a total of}} 12 "single-sire" mating groups generated. All ram lambs produced a satisfactory semen sample before joining with the flocks. Mating commenced on 30 March 1981. The flock mating performance of each ram lamb was assessed by recording the percentage of ewes raddled, percentage of ewes returning to service, percentage of pregnant ewes, percentage of ewes lambing, docking rate and weaning rate. Differences among each of these parameters were attributed to various factors. Trained and untrained ram lambs were similar in most of the observed parameters of flock mating performance. There were no differences between individual ram lambs within each sire-group (trained or untrained) in mating performance. There were differences in the percentage of ewes raddled between first and second oestrous cycle of mating. Live weights of the ram lambs were measured from weaning (December 1980) {{until the end of the}} trial (December 1981), at weekly intervals during the mating periods and at monthly intervals during the post-mating and post-shearing periods. There was little loss in the mean live weight of the mating group ram lambs after P 1. Overall the live weights of both groups increased consistently throughout the trial. Semen samples (collected by <b>electro-ejaculation)</b> from the ram lambs of the mating group were microscopically examined for general motility after each mating period at least for three days. Recovery from mating exhaustion occurred four and six days after P 1 and Pz respectively, while three and two days were required after P 3 and P 4 respectively. Semen samples were also collected on two occasions from the rams (only 15) as two-tooths and examined for general motility, sperm concentration and percentage of live sperm. There were no differences in semen characteristics between rams of the mated and control groups. The two-tooth rams were also subjected individually and randomly on three occasions to pen-libido tests, each with two oestrous ewes. Mating ability was assessed by recording the number of mounts attempted on the oestrous ewes, the number of services, the reaction time to mount (in seconds) and the reaction time to service. There were no differences between the mating and control groups in the number of mounts and number of services performed on each occasion of the libido test. Significant differences were found between both groups in reaction time to mount and in reaction time to service but only at the first libido test. It was concluded that the Booroola Merino x Romney ram lambs had achieved satisfactory levels of flock mating performance under the conditions of the trial. No adverse effects of mating on the post-mating body development of the ram lamb could be detected. Semen quality from the ram lambs deteriorated during mating but recovered shortly after mating. The use of ram lambs as sires had no adverse effects on their semen characteristics and libido performance at the two-tooth age. FOOT "CONDITIONS" The incidence of abnormal foot shape, foot scald and footrot was observed in Perendale and Booroola Merino crossbreds. The animals were generated in 1980 and 1981. Observations on foot "conditions" were made at the lamb, hogget and two-tooth ages for animals born in 1980, and at the lamb and hogget ages for those born in 1981. A scoring system was used to rank the various foot "conditions" (shape; scald; footrot) which were assessed separately. Booroola Merino crossbreds showed significantly a higher incidence of abnormal foot shape, foot scald and footrot than did Perendale sheep. Significant differences in foot "conditions" were also found between (Booroola x Romney) x Perendale and Booroola x Romney sheep. Sires of the progeny generated in 1980 and 1981 provided a major source for the variation in the incidence of these foot "conditions". Estimates of heritability of each of the observed foot "conditions" were calculated at different ages (lamb, hogget and two-tooth). Sex of the lamb caused significant effects on the incidence of abnormal foot shape and foot scald between ram lambs and ewe lambs, but not on the incidence of footrot. Differences in the incidence of abnormal foot shape and foot scald occurred between 1980 - and 1981 -born sheep. These differences were attributed partly to the particular climatic conditions in each year (notably the annual rainfall). It was concluded that under environmental conditions similar to that of the present trial, long-term selection programmes could be applied to enhance the natural resistance of sheep against foot diseases...|$|E
40|$|The studies {{described}} in this thesis investigated physiological and behavioural aspects of reproduction in farmed fallow deer. The initial studies examined puberty. Pubertal development in fallow does (Section 2. 1) {{was associated with a}} significant rise in mean serum progesterone levels between 10 and 15 months of age, which declined back to earlier prepubertal levels immediately before the onset of oestrous activity at 16 months of age. Almost all (55 / 56) pubertal does exhibited first oestrus at, or close to, 16 months of age and the mean date of this oestrus was not significantly different from that of first oestrus of the breeding season for older does. Prepubertal fallow bucks (Section 2. 2) exhibited a markedly seasonal growth pattern, with entire bucks growing at a significantly greater rate than castrated bucks from 9 months of age. Both groups of bucks showed a progressive increase of serum testosterone and androstenedione levels from 12 months of age. However, while this increase was sustained until 16 months of age in the entire bucks, the castrated bucks exhibited a more transient and lower magnitude elevation of serum testosterone levels between 12 and 14 months of age. Castrated bucks failed to develop pedicles. Other aspects of reproductive physiology were investigated in adult animals. First oestrus of fallow does (Section 3. 1) was naturally synchronised within a 12 day period in late April to early May. Mean length (±sd) of the first oestrous cycle was 21. 0 ± 0. 64 days, but mean cycle length increased significantly as the breeding season progressed. The duration of the breeding season was 65 - 135 days (3 - 6 oestrous cycles) and was positively related to doe age. There was an indication that one or more short-lived luteal cycles from silent ovulations occurred before first oestrus and these may have helped to synchronise this oestrus. Some does appeared to have silent ovulations at the termination of the breeding season. Hormonal changes around oestrus were investigated by hourly blood sampling of six fallow does (Section 3. 2). The preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge was initiated an hour before the onset of oestrus and there was an indication of a small rise in progesterone secretion at the onset of oestrus. However, serum oestradiol- 17 β levels showed wide variation during the sampling period (46 hours) with only a slight tendency to rise at the onset of oestrus. Serum androstenedione levels exhibited a marked elevation (2 x basal levels) immediately at the onset of oestrus and remained elevated for a further 6 hours. It is proposed that androstenedione may be influential in the expression of oestrous behaviour. Conception rates, gestation lengths and live-weight/serum progesterone profiles during the gestating period were examined (Section 3. 3). Over a 2 year period, 82. 7 % of does run with fertile bucks conceived at first oestrus matings and 96. 0 % conceived by second or third oestrus matings. There were no significant effects of fawn sex, doe age or sire on gestation length and the mean (±sd) overall length (n= 88) was 234. 2 ± 2. 7 days. In 1983, pregnant does (n= 55) exhibited marked live-weight gains (+ 10 kg) during the third trimester of pregnancy, whereas non-pregnant does (n= 14) showed only slight gains (+ 2 kg) over the same period. Pregnant does maintained high levels of serum progesterone (> 5 ng/ml) during gestation, while non-pregnant does exhibited cyclical fluctuations of progesterone secretion during the breeding season (April to October) but low levels (< 1. 0 ng/ml) at the cessation of cyclic activity. The annual cycles of live-weight, neck girth and serum testosterone levels of adult entire and prepubertally castrated fallow bucks were investigated in addition to the annual cycles of testis size and spermatozoal production of the entire bucks (Section 3. 4). Entire bucks, which were always significantly heavier (14 - 18 %) than the castrated bucks, exhibited marked live-weight changes, with most rapid live-weight gains occurring over spring and summer months (October to February) and marked live-weight losses during the rut period (April-May). Castrated bucks exhibited similar, but less pronounced, live-weight changes. Furthermore, pre- and post-rut changes in neck girth and serum testosterone levels observed in entire bucks were apparent to a lesser degree in castrated bucks. However, {{there was no evidence of}} testosterone secretion in adult castrated bucks. Testicular diameter measurements of entire bucks were poorly correlated with live-weight. The seasonal pattern of changes in testicular size was similar to that for neck girth, both presumably reflecting the observed pattern of testosterone secretion. While there was no significant seasonal variation in mean ejaculate volume (collected by <b>electro-ejaculation),</b> there was considerable variation in spermatozoal characteristics. Viable spermatozoa were absent during summer months (November to January). However, concentrations of viable spermatozoa increased progressively from about February, two months before the rut, and reached peak concentrations in September, four months after the rutting period. Rutting behaviour of fallow bucks was observed in 1983 (Section 4. 1). Groaning vocalisations occurred only during the period of first oestrus matings (~ 14 days) and there was a close association between the intensity of groaning activity on anyone day and the number of does exhibiting oestrus on that day. Over a 40 day period spanning the period of first oestrus matings, there were marked changes in primary activities. Of particular interest were the significant decrease in grazing activity immediately before and during the mating period and the associated significant increases in standing, walking, investigatory and agonistic activities. There was a 25 % loss of buck live-weight associated with rutting activity. Mating sequences of fallow deer were recorded on 21 occasions in 1983 (Section 4. 2). Most does were observed to exhibit characteristic pre-oestrous behaviour, including fence pacing and aggression towards herd mates, between 12 and 24 hours before the onset of oestrus. Overt oestrus was always associated with fervent self-grooming (preening) behaviour by the doe and a marked change in receptivity towards the sexual advances of the buck. Courtship was characterised by repeated non-copulatory mounts by the buck (mean ±sd = 16. 4 ± 6. 8 mounts including copulation), although the mean (±sd) interval from the first mount to copulation was only 14. 8 ± 10. 4 minutes. The mount to service ratio was higher than reported for other cervid species, although the courtship interval was similar. Oestrus and courtship were apparently terminated at copulation. The allocation of primary activities during the mating season was investigated in 1983 for 60 fallow does (Section 4. 2). While there was significant circadian variation in group grazing, resting, standing and walking activities, there were only minor changes in group daily activity allocations during a 40 day period spanning the mating period. Artificial manipulation of reproductive seasonality was investigated in a series of experiments. In the first experiment (Section 5. 1) there was no apparent effect of the date of pre-rut buck introduction to mating groups on the onset of oestrus or the incidence of silent ovulations in does. In the second experiment (Section 5. 2) fertile oestrus was induced, three weeks before that of control does, in 20 / 21 (95. 2 %) does each treated intravaginally with a progesterone CIDR (14 days) followed by an i. m. injection of 500 i. u. PMSG. Ovulation rates ranged from 1 to 4 but were inversely related to PMSG dose/kg live-weight. Non-ovulating, luteinized follicles were a feature of PMSG treatment, particularly at higher dose rates and only 3 / 21 (14. 3 %) does conceived at the induced oestrus. Non-conceiving does returned to oestrus 21 - 27 days later, with the length of the oestrous cycle being positively related to the relative mass of luteinized structures. Does with multiple corpora lutea had higher serum progesterone levels during the oestrous cycle than does with a single corpus luteum. There was an indication that induced does influenced the onset of oestrous activity in herd-mate controls. In the third experiment (Section 5. 3) fertile oestrus was induced, eight weeks before that of untreated does, in 6 / 13 (46. 2 %) does treated with progesterone CIDRs followed by the continuous infusion of GnRH (125 ng/h or 250 ng/h) via osmotic mini-pumps. However only one (16. 7 %) of these does conceived and produced a viable fawn. The remaining does returned to anoestrum until the onset of the natural breeding season. In the fourth experiment (Section 5. 4) daily oral administration of melatonin to entire fallow bucks during summer was successful in advancing temporarily some aspects of reproductive seasonality. In particular, treated bucks exhibited a transient phase of accelerated neck hypertrophy and earlier initiation of spermatozoal production...|$|E
