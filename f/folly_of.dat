5|$|Cope {{travels with}} Knight to Europe; Knight with the {{intention}} of visiting Paris zoos, Cope with the intent of selling off much of his bone collection. Cope has also spent much of his money buying The American Naturalist, a paper in which he plans to attack Marsh's dealings. Hatcher arrives in New York to talk about the find Laelaps; in his speech, he subtly hints at the <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> Marsh's elitism and backstabbing, as well as Cope's collecting obsession.|$|E

5|$|Every {{taxpayer}} {{will realize}} that any destruction of property {{will have to be}} paid for by the city, and would by so much increase the burden of taxation. In one day Pittsburgh has put upon herself a load that her taxpayers will struggle under for years. I again earnestly urge upon men of all classes in our city the necessity of sober, careful thought and the criminal <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> any precipitate action.|$|E
5|$|King Alfred's Tower, {{also known}} as The <b>Folly</b> <b>of</b> King Alfred the Great or Stourton Tower, is a folly tower.

The tower stands on Kingsettle Hill and belongs to the National Trust. It is {{designated}} as a grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E
5|$|Stamper {{continued}} as principal songwriter for the <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1920 through 1925, {{with an additional}} summer edition in 1923. He returned for the <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1931, the last edition produced by Florenz Ziegfeld himself.|$|R
500|$|In 1912 Stamper {{began writing}} songs for the Ziegfeld <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1913, {{contributing}} Just You and I and The Moon, Without You and Everybody Sometime Must Love Somebody. He is credited as [...] "additional music" [...] for the <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1914 and 1915, but {{he wrote the}} majority of the music for the <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1916. and was on an equal billing with Louis A. Hirsch, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin. The music <b>of</b> the <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1917 was written by Stamper and Raymond Hubbell and he was described as [...] "an old hand" [...] for his work with Louis A. Hirsch by the <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1918. In addition to his 1918 Follies work, he wrote all the music for Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic with Gene Buck, a series that also had editions in 1919, 1920 and 1921.|$|R
5000|$|Often {{pointed out}} {{as one of}} the best entries in the series, <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1938 was {{produced}} as a special one-shot return to the series' original two-reel (twenty-minute) format, after a season and a half of shorter one-reel films. In addition, <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1938, particularly its extended dream sequence, features lavish production design and filmmaking typical of feature length MGM musicals. MGM in fact helped finance the short beyond its usual contributions to the Roach shorts; as a result its opening titles read [...] "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer presents Our Gang <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1938, A Hal Roach Production," [...] as opposed to the usual [...] "Hal Roach Presents Our Gang in..." [...] At a cost <b>of</b> $58 thousand, <b>Follies</b> <b>of</b> 1938 was the most expensive Our Gang short ever produced.|$|R
5|$|Earlier that afternoon, as Meade {{realized}} the <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> Sickles's movement, he ordered Hancock {{to send a}} division from the II Corps to reinforce the III Corps. Hancock sent the 1st Division under Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell from its reserve position behind Cemetery Ridge. It arrived at about 6 p.m. and three brigades, under Cols. Samuel K. Zook, Patrick Kelly (the Irish Brigade), and Edward E. Cross moved forward; the fourth brigade, under Col. John R. Brooke, was in reserve. Zook and Kelly drove the Confederates from Stony Hill, and Cross cleared the Wheatfield, pushing Kershaw's men back {{to the edge of}} Rose Woods. Both Zook and Cross were mortally wounded in leading their brigades through these assaults, as was Confederate Semmes. When Cross's men had exhausted their ammunition, Caldwell ordered Brooke to relieve them. By this time, however, the Union position in the Peach Orchard had collapsed (see next section), and Wofford's assault continued down the Wheatfield Road, taking Stony Hill and flanking the Union forces in the Wheatfield. Brooke's brigade in Rose Woods had to retreat in some disorder. Sweitzer's brigade was sent in to delay the Confederate assault, and they did this effectively in vicious hand-to-hand combat. The Wheatfield changed hands once again.|$|E

25|$|Running {{themes in}} Bruegel's {{paintings}} are the absurdity, wickedness and foolishness of humans, {{and this is}} no exception. The painting's original title, The Blue Cloak or The <b>Folly</b> <b>of</b> the World, indicates that Bruegel's intent was not just to illustrate proverbs, but rather to catalog human folly. Many of the people depicted show the characteristic blank features that Bruegel used to portray fools.|$|E

25|$|Inevitably, she {{returned}} to baby farming, and murder. Dyer realised the <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> involving doctors to issue death certificates and began disposing of the bodies herself. The precarious {{nature and extent of}} her activities again prompted undesirable attention; she was alert to the attentions of police—and of parents seeking to reclaim their children. She and her family frequently relocated to different towns and cities to escape suspicion, regain anonymity—and to acquire new business. Over the years, Dyer used a succession of aliases.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{experience}} of the intellectual classes following the Hundred Flowers Campaign silenced those aware of the <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> such a plan. According to his private doctor, Li Zhisui, Mao and his entourage visited traditional steel works in Manchuria in January 1959 where he found out that high quality steel could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt to the backyard steel furnaces so as not to dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.|$|E
25|$|Vigorous {{attempts}} for {{the release}} of the princes began to be made. The women of the family were now its heroes. The dowager princess demanded from the parlement of Paris fulfilment of the reformed law of arrest, which forbade imprisonment without trial. Condé's sister Anne Genevieve, duchesse de Longueville entered into negotiations with Spain; and the young Princess of Condé, having gathered an army around her, entered Bordeaux and gained the support of the parlement of that town. She, alone among the nobles {{who took part in the}} <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> the Fronde, earned respect and sympathy. Faithful to a faithless husband, she came forth from the retirement to which he had condemned her to fight for his freedom.|$|E

25|$|Robertson, who {{had been}} sick in bed, wrote to Haig (3 March) {{that he did not}} trust Nivelle. He {{continued}} to lobby the War Cabinet (“it was very unpleasant to listen to” wrote Spears) of the <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> leaving the British Army under French control, passing on Haig’s demand that he keep control of the British reserves, and advising that intelligence reports suggested preparations for large-scale German troop movements in Eastern Belgium. With War Cabinet opinion having turned against Lloyd George – who was also rebuked by the King – Robertson also then submitted a memorandum stating that the Calais Agreement was not to be a permanent arrangement, along with a “personal statement” so critical of Lloyd George that he refused to have it included in the minutes.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{returned}} to first-class action on 11 July in a two-day match at Grace Road, Leicester that was drawn. The AIF opened with 551 for five declared (Pellew 187, Willis 156* and Collins 121) which was their total {{at the end}} of the first day. Leicestershire with 224 and 28 for no wicket held on through the second day. The match was another example of the <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> trying to play first-class cricket over two days only. However, the next one was also a two-day affair and Derbyshire defeated the AIF by 36 runs at the County Ground, Derby. It was a low-scoring game with Derbyshire scoring 181 and 112 while the Australians could only muster 125 and 132 in reply. Derbyshire paceman James Horsley did the damage, taking six for 55 and six for 62.|$|E
25|$|The German {{offensive}} {{proved the}} <b>folly</b> <b>of</b> the border defense {{plan in the}} first days of the war. Army Pomorze was defeated in the battle of Bory Tucholskie, and forced to retreat towards the south-east. Army Poznań, meanwhile, although not facing heavy German assaults, was forced to retreat east due to defeats of its neighbours (Army Pomorze in the north and Army Łódź in the south); both of them were retreating, meaning that Army Poznań was in danger of being flanked and surrounded by the German forces. On 4 September, Army Poznań moved through Poznań and abandoned it to the enemy, althrough at this point it was not in contact with any significant German forces. By 6 September, Armies Pomorze and Poznań had linked, forming the strongest Polish operational unit in the campaign, and general Bortkowski accepted the command of general Kutrzeba.|$|E
