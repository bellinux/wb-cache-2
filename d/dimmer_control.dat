40|$|There is {{a recent}} trend and growing {{popularity}} of using the technique of light pulsation for achieving the <b>dimming</b> <b>control</b> of light-emitting diodes. However, {{it is found that}} such a <b>dimming</b> <b>control</b> technique can result in a significant power loss in terms of luminous efficacy. This contradicts the original motive of energy saving through illumination dimming. Total energy consumed for lighting is an overwhelming 8 % of depleting energy resources. A potential loss of 2 % or more of these resources could go unnoticed owing to poor handling of dimming technology.

40|$|The IRS 2530 D {{is simple}} {{to use with}} any analog and digital control method {{available}} for dimming fluorescent lamps. In addition, it can implement <b>dimming</b> <b>control</b> for LEDs. Fluorescent dimming systems can satisfy visual comfort, and reduce utility costs through daylight harvesting, demand reduction, scheduled dimming, and other strategies. A dimming electronic ballast {{is an essential part}} of this system. To perform dimming functions, the ballast must be configured to understand an input signal from the control device, and act upon the current flowing through the lamp. Typically, this is a challenging task for the ballast designer and is usually achieved using a complex, high-pin-count control IC. The IRS 2530 D is a new <b>dimming</b> ballast <b>control</b> IC in a compact 8 -pin form-factor (Fig. 1). This DIM 8 TM is a 600 -V half-bridge driver IC that includes all the necessary functions for preheat, ignition, and <b>dimming</b> <b>control</b> of the lamp, and protects the circuit against line and lamp fault conditions. With only eight pins to accomplish all dimming ballast functions, the IC can minimize component count and simplify design, and is flexible enough to be used with various <b>dimming</b> <b>control</b> methods. Several reference-design kits have been created to help with the evaluation of the IRS 2530 D. Each of these kits uses a different <b>dimming</b> <b>control</b> method, and they cover various input voltages and lamp types.

The lighting must reflect immediately the subtleties of the intention of the original artist, Archibald MacLeish, and his subsequent interpreters, the director and designer. To approach this task, the following steps were taken: (1) Repeated line readings and meetings with the director. (2) A study of past productions of J. B.

(4) Conferences with the director and designer to understand their interpretations of these Aristotelian terms for the play.

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{introduction}} of a controller area network (CAN) to a house trailer or caravan. The past two decades have seen a large invasion of micro-controllers in modern vehicles. This {{is due in part to}} the miniaturization and decrease in costs of electronics, but also for the increase of services. These services include comfort, safety, diagnostics and fail-safes. Comfort such as controlled temperature or automatic wipers. Safety has the form of anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and electronic stability program (ESP). Diagnostics address the detection of failed systems or the failure of one of its components, while fail-safes enables the systems to achieve a graceful degradation of performance when parts of the system have failed. The increase of electronic control units (ECUs) has resulted in an increase of wiring, which is very expensive and also weights much. Those also are two issues undesirable on a caravan where ECUs can bring an increase of services. The answer to the problem has been the development of a communication network between the ECUs through which messages are sent. The ECUs are referred to as nodes on the network. The system developed consists of four nodes connected together with the Controller Area Network (CAN) : front and rear control units, a combined yaw rate and acceleration sensor and a control panel. As a whole, this base system controls all the lights on the outside of the caravan that are normally connected directly to the car. The most important benefit of this system is the cable reduction, but another advantage is the possibility to control the outdoor lights from the control panel. The front control unit converts the light signals coming from the car to CAN-bus messages. The rear control unit receives these messages and converts them back to light signals. On the same bus and at the same time the control panel can monitor the status of the light bulbs in the tail light ramp. Furthermore the control panel can send <b>dimmer</b> <b>control</b> messages to maneuver the dimmer output on the front control unit. In addition to this, the system contains an in and outdoor temperature sensor, a yaw rate and acceleration sensor. All of this information is available on the CAN-bus and presented on the display in the control panel. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{wireless}} {{data traffic}} is creating {{pressure on the}} conventional dwindling radio frequency spectrum. A new and reliable communication medium becomes a necessity. Visible Light Communication (VLC), a subset of optical wireless communication uses the visible light spectrum between 400 and 800 THz as a medium for communication. VLC utilizes the illumination of LED to establish a communication medium. The research focused on achieving a successful VLC communication link at low intensities of light without affecting the speed, accuracy and efficiency of VLC.

The proposed circuit not only eliminates one auxiliary winding but also reduces the voltage across the switch on the primary side and consequently permits the selection of switches with a lower rating.
