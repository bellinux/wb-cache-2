5000|$|Given {{the task}} of finding a {{suitable}} [...] "Ridgemere Hall", production manager Janet Bone eventually settled on Clayesmore School, a boarding school in Iwerne Minster, Dorset. The school would not give permission for any of its floorboards to be pulled up however, and so the scene with Granddad undoing the <b>fastening</b> <b>nut</b> was filmed {{in a house that}} belonged to Ray Butt's girlfriend. The auction house seen {{at the beginning of the}} episode is the village hall of Sutton Waldron, Dorset.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} holiday season, a charity fair comes into town, run by Monty Muzzle, {{to raise money}} for a new dog shelter, the old one being {{destroyed}} in the storm last episode. After dealing with three strays in their home, Wallace and Gromit go to the fair with Wallace's new invention to create any flavor of ice cream. At the fair, Gromit discovers that Mr. Muzzle is actually attempting to steal away the townspeople's donations and using the strays as manual labor for the fair. When Wallace and Gromit uncover Mr. Muzzle's intentions, he escapes on a makeshift balloon, but Wallace and Gromit give chase, denying Mr. Muzzle of his ill-gotten money while saving all the strays. Ms. Flitt, who dumped Duncan McBiscuit earlier in the episode and has grown to admire the [...] "bravery" [...] of Wallace (unaware that it was actually Gromit that stopped Muzzle), mistakes his confusion at finding a loose <b>fastening</b> <b>nut</b> as an engagement ring and a marriage proposal from him.|$|E

5000|$|The Vulcan Iron Works at Osmaston Road, Derby {{was founded}} in 1874 by Francis Ley (1846-1916). On a site occupying 11 acres by the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway, he {{manufactured}} castings for motor cars. The company became the Ley's Malleable Castings Company Ltd. In the London Gazette of April 14, 1876, Ley was granted a patent for [...] "improvements in apparatus for locking and <b>fastening</b> <b>nuts</b> on fish plate and other bolts". The iron foundry was closed and demolished in 1986.|$|R
40|$|Assembly line {{operations}} generally involve {{physical and}} cognitive demanding tasks. Simultaneous performance under physical and cognitive demanding tasks may create {{physical and mental}} stresses. A within subjects study was carried out {{to determine the effects}} of assembly levels (variable assembly and consistent assembly) on working conditions. Nine participants participated in a study and performed 8 conditions. The objective of the study was to determine the relation between physical and cognitive demands in a simulated task involving simultaneous performance of physical (<b>fastening</b> <b>nuts</b> and bolts) and cognitive (code matching with secondary task of memorizing the code) demanding task. Results showed the significant effects of assembly order (consisted of the concurrent performance of physically and cognitively demanding task) on the working conditions. Quality of performance was affected by variable assembly order, high mental demand and above shoulder heigh...|$|R

Protection for the wood (stain, paint, or wood protectant that repels water) is necessary {{to protect it from}} cracking, warping, or rotting due to moisture. The table-top and bench-top boards are attached to the trusses or beams using wood screws or nails. The legs can be secured with carriage bolts <b>fastened</b> by <b>nuts</b> and washers.|$|R

50|$|This is {{modified}} form of {{the protected}} type flange coupling. This type of coupling has pins and it works with coupling bolts. The rubber or leather bushes are used over the pins. The coupling has two halves dissimilar in construction. The pins are rigidly <b>fastened</b> by <b>nuts</b> {{to one of the}} flange and kept loose on the other flange. This coupling is used to connect shafts which having a small parallel misalignment, angular misalignment or axial misalignment. In this coupling the rubber bushing absorbs shocks and vibration during its operations. This type of coupling is mostly used to couple electric motors and machines.|$|R
25|$|Incorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs; {{the disc}}'s {{retaining}} bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is simply sandwiched {{in place by}} the wheel, as on many cars) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of air tools to <b>fasten</b> lug <b>nuts</b> can be bad practice, unless a torque wrench is also used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for the bolts. Lug nuts should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles are sensitive to the force the bolts apply and tightening should be done with a torque wrench.|$|R
50|$|A {{flange nut}} is a nut {{that has a}} wide flange at one end that acts as an integrated, {{non-spinning}} washer. This serves to distribute {{the pressure of the}} nut over the part being secured, reducing the chance of damage to the part and making it less likely to loosen {{as a result of an}} uneven <b>fastening</b> surface. These <b>nuts</b> are mostly hexagonal in shape and are made up of hardened steel and often coated with zinc.|$|R
6000|$|... "We agreed that, if {{the worst}} {{came to the}} worst, we would try this, and having settled that, went back {{to have a look}} at the main hatch. Feeling about round it, we found the points of the staple on which the {{hatchway}} bar worked above; they were not <b>fastened</b> with <b>nuts</b> as they would have been with us, but were simply turned over and clinched. We had no means of straightening them out, but we could cut through the woodwork round them. Setting to work at that, we took it by turns till we could see the light through the wood; then we left it to finish after dark. All this time we knew we were under sail by the rippling of the water along the sides. The men on board were evidently in high delight at their easy capture, and kicked up so much noise that there was no fear of their hearing any slight stir we made below.|$|R
50|$|This British WWII Airborne BSA {{folding bicycle}} was rigged so that, when parachuted, the {{handlebars}} and seat {{were the first}} parts to hit the ground (as bent wheels would disable the bike). BSA abandoned the traditional diamond bicycle design as too weak for the shock and instead made an elliptical frame of twin parallel tubes, one forming the top tube and seat stays, and the other the chainstay and down tube. The hinges were {{in front of the}} bottom bracket and in the corresponding position in front of the saddle, <b>fastened</b> by wing <b>nuts.</b> The peg pedals could be pushed in to avoid snagging and further reduce the space occupied during transit.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a flanged neoprene bushing with a nut embedded in the non-flanged end. The bolt is passed {{through one of the}} pieces to be fastened and threaded onto the nut from the flanged end. The non-flanged end is then inserted through the other piece to be fastened. As the bolt is tightened, friction from the neoprene flange against the piece being <b>fastened</b> prevents the <b>nut</b> from turning. The bushing is compressed by the nut, forming a lip behind the piece being fastened, which compresses the fastened piece and seals the bolt hole. It can also be used in a solid workpiece. As the screw draws the embedded nut towards it, the walls of the well exert a force on the hole walls, anchoring it.|$|R
50|$|In oil tankers {{and other}} marine vessels used for {{transporting}} fluid products, there are small service openings though the deck into each tank to allow access for miscellaneous reasons such as sampling, inspection, gauging and cleaning. When the service opening {{is not in}} use, it is sealed by a removable cover plate, {{commonly referred to as}} a Butterworth cover. Butterworth hatches are not the main access hatches, but are the servicing hatches, and are generally closed with a metal cover plate with a gasket that is fastened to the deck by a number of bolts which stick up from the deck. Holes on the edges of the plate fit over these bolts and the cover is <b>fastened</b> down with <b>nuts</b> or dogs.|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} {{features of}} screw transmission are effort-saving and self-locking. Based on this, a screw-rod-type actuator is proposed, which {{is driven by}} a nut swung spirally together with piezoelectric transducers. The actuator consists of three parts: a <b>nut</b> <b>fastened</b> to a hollow cylinder, a precise screw rod, and two orthogonal piezoelectric vibrators worked on d 33 mode. The screw rod is forced to rotate and translate by traveling wave within the helical surface of nut, which is generated by two vibrators. First, the actuatorâ€™s running mechanism is preliminarily illustrated. Second, modal analysis and optimal design of the stator are performed through finite element method. Finally, the prototype actuator is manufactured and tested. The experimental results have proven that this driving manner is feasible, and the main characteristics are as follows: the stable working frequency is about at 9. 5 [*]kHz, and the maximum no-load speed and output force are approximately 61 [*]r/min and 2. 1 [*]N, respectively, under 300 [*]Vpp...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{manufacturing}} {{of large-scale}} wind turbines requires the accurate tightening of multiple bolts and nuts, which connect the ball bearings - supporting {{wind turbine blades}} - with the hub, a huge mechanical component supporting blades pitch motion. An accurate tightening of bolts and nuts requires uniformly distributed clamping forces along flanges and surfaces of contact between hub and bearings. Due {{to the role of}} friction forces and the dynamics of the phenomenon, this process is nonlinear and currently performed manually; it is also time consuming, requiring high-cost equipment and expert operators. This paper proposes a set of neural networks, which infer the clamping force achievable with a tightening tool while <b>fastening</b> M 24 <b>nuts</b> on bolts. The tool embeds a torque sensor and shaft encoder, therefore two types of inputs of the neural networks are considered in order to fit the clamping force output: the time signals of (a) the applied torque of the tool and (b) the combination of the torque and of the angular speed of the tool. According to results, neural networks properly model the clamping force, both during the training stage and when exposed to unseen testing data. This approach could be generalized to other industrial processes and specifically to those requiring repetitive tightening tasks and involving highly nonlinear aspects, such as friction forces. ...|$|R
