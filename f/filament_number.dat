40|$|Abstract. The rate of {{filamentous}} actin (F-actin) depolymerization {{is proportional}} to the number of filaments depolymerizing and changes in the rate are proportional to changes in <b>filament</b> <b>number.</b> To determine the number and length of actin filaments in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the change in <b>filament</b> <b>number</b> and length that occurs during the increase in F-actin upon chemoattractant stimulation, the time course of cellular F-actin depolymerization in lysates of control and peptide-stimulated cells was examined. F-actin was quantified by the TRITC-labeled phalloidin staining of pelletable actin. Lysis in 1. 2 M KCl and 10 14 M DNase I minimized the effects of F-actin binding proteins and G-actin, respectively, on the kinetics of depolymerization.

Neurofilaments (NFs), {{which are}} {{composed}} of NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H, are required for the devel-opment of normal axonal caliber, a property that in turn is a critical determinant of axonal conduction ve-locity. To investigate how each subunit contributes to the radial growth of axons, we used transgenic mice to alter the subunit composition of NFs. Increasing each NF subunit individually inhibits radial axonal growth, while increasing both NF-M and NF-H reduces growth even more severely. An increase in NF-L results in an increased <b>filament</b> <b>number</b> but reduced interfilament distance. Conversely, increasing NF-M, NF-H, or both reduces <b>filament</b> <b>number,</b> but does not alter nearest neighbor interfilament distance.

Linearly and circularly polarized pulses give rise to beam breakup and fusion governed by external focusing conditions.

40|$|The {{directed}} polymerization of actin networks is {{an essential}} element of many biological processes, including cell migration. Different theoretical models considering the interplay between the underlying processes of polymerization, capping and branching have resulted in conflicting predictions. One of the main reasons for this discrepancy is the assumption of a branching reaction that is either first order (autocatalytic) or zeroth order in the number of existing filaments. Here we introduce a unifying framework from which the two established scenarios emerge as limiting cases for low and high <b>filament</b> <b>number.</b> A smooth transition between the two cases is found at intermediate conditions. We also derive a threshold for the capping rate, above which autocatalytic growth is predicted at sufficiently low <b>filament</b> <b>number.</b> Below the threshold, zeroth order characteristics are predicted to dominate the dynamics of the network for all accessible filament numbers. Together, this allows cells to grow stable actin networks over a large range of different conditions. Comment: revtex, 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

These species were C. raciborskii, a species with thin and pliant filaments, and A. gracile, which has thicker filaments. Moreover, the strain of A. gracile used in experiments expresses two morphological forms that differ markedly in thickness of filaments. This allowed us to reduce the interspecies variability of the filament’s properties and see how Daphnia’s grazing influences the width distribution. There should be no changes {{in the proportion of}} thin to thick <b>filament</b> <b>numbers</b> after exposure to Daphnia grazing, if the width is not the important factor influencing Daphnia’s life history. In the second experiment, we checked a life history response of D. magna to the presence of cyanobacterial exudates alone.

Micrographs of thin cross sections of stereociliary bundles located at known positions on the cochlea were enlarged and the total number of actin filaments per stereocilium was counted and recorded. By comparing the counts of <b>filament</b> <b>number</b> with measurements of actin filament bundle width of the same stereocilium, we were able to relate actin filament bundle width to <b>filament</b> <b>number</b> with an error margin (r 2) of 16 %. Combining this data with data already published or in the process of publication from our laboratory on the length and width of stereocilia, we were able to calculate the total length of actin filaments present in stereociliary bundles of hair cells located at a variety of positions on the cochlea. We found that stereociliary bundles of hair cells contain 80, 000 - 98, 000 micron of actin filament, i. e., the concentration of actin is constant in all hair cells with a range of values that is less than our error in measurement and/or biological variation, the greatest variation being in relating the diameters of the stereocilia to <b>filament</b> <b>number.</b> We also calculated the membrane surface needed to cover the stereocilia of hair cells located throughout the cochlea.

Lysis in 1. 2 M KCl and 10 microM DNase I minimized the effects of F-actin binding proteins and G-actin, respectively, on the kinetics of depolymerization. To determine <b>filament</b> <b>number</b> and length from a depolymerization time course, depolymerization kinetics must be limited by the actin monomer dissociation rate. Comparison of time courses of depolymerization in the presence (pointed ends free) or absence (barbed and pointed ends free) of cytochalasin suggested depolymerization occurred from both ends of the filament and that monomer dissociation was rate limiting. Control cells had 1. 7 +/- 0. 4 x 10 (5) filaments with an average length of 0. 29 +/- 0. 09 microns. Chemo-attractant stimulation for 90 s at room temperature with 0. 02 microM N-formylnorleucylleucylphenylalanine caused a twofold increase in F-actin and about a two-fold increase in the total number of actin filaments to 4. 0 +/- 0. 5 x 10 (5) filaments with an average length of 0. 27 +/- 0. 07 microns.

In the former studies, spectral analysis of self-guided optical filaments, which were generated with pulses close to the critical power for filamentation in air, showed that the shot-to-shot statistics become heavy-tailed at the short wavelength and long wavelength edges of the spectrum. Termed optical rogue wave statistics, this behavior was studied in simulations, which supported an explanation based on pump noise transfer by self-phase modulation. In the latter experimental study, filaments of extreme intensity described as optical rogue waves were observed to emerge due to mergers between filament strings when multiple filaments are generated.

40|$|An actin {{filament}} bundle approximately 2 - 5 microns {{in length}} {{is present in}} the sperm of the blue mussel, Mytilus. In unfired sperm this bundle extends from the midpiece through a canal {{in the center of the}} nucleus to terminate on the membrane limiting the inside of the cone-shaped acrosomal vacuole. The bundle is composed of 45 - 65 actin filaments which are hexagonally packed and regularly cross-bridged together to form an actin paracrystal so well ordered that it has six nearly equal faces. Upon induction of the acrosomal reaction, a needle-like process is formed in a few seconds. Within this process is the actin filament bundle which appears unchanged in <b>filament</b> <b>number</b> and packing as determined by optical diffraction methods. Using fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin we were able to establish that the bundle does not change length but instead is projected anteriorly out of the midpiece and nuclear canal like an arrow. Existing mechanisms to explain this extension cannot apply. Specifically, the bundle does not increase in length (no polymerization), does not change its organization (no change in actin twist), does not change <b>filament</b> <b>number</b> (no filament sliding), and cannot move by myosin (wrong polarity). Thus we are forced to look elsewhere for a mechanism and have postulated that at least a component of this movement, or cell elongation, is the interaction of the actin filament bundle with the plasma membrane...|$|E

However, birefringence, conventional EM and X-ray diffraction evidence suggests that in certain smooth muscles in vivo (e. g. rat anococcygeus), while myosin filaments exist in the relaxed state, their number increases on contraction.

Despite its large social and economical impact, the mechanisms for VF in the human heart yet remain to be identified. Two of the most frequently discussed mechanisms observed in experiments with animal hearts are the multiple wavelet and mother rotor hypotheses. Most recordings of VF in animal hearts are consistent with the multiple wavelet mechanism. However, in animal hearts, mother rotor fibrillation has also been observed. For both multiple wavelet and mother rotor VF, cardiac heterogeneity plays an important role. Clinical data of action potential restitution measured from the surface of human hearts have been recently published. These in vivo data show a substantial degree of spatial heterogeneity. Using these clinical restitution data, we studied the dynamics of VF in the human heart using a heterogeneous computational model of human ventricles. We hypothesized that this observed heterogeneity can serve as a substrate for mother rotor fibrillation. We found that, based on these data, mother rotor VF can occur in the human heart and that ablation of the mother rotor terminates VF. Furthermore, we found that both mother rotor and multiple wavelet VF can occur in the same heart depending on the initial conditions at the onset of VF. We studied the organization of these two types of VF in terms of <b>filament</b> <b>numbers,</b> excitation periods, and frequency domains.
