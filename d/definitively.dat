5|$|BHD can be {{suggested}} by clinical findings but is <b>definitively</b> diagnosed by molecular genetic testing to detect mutations in the FLCN gene. The classical clinical triad includes benign growths of the hair follicles; pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax; and bilateral, multifocal renal tumors.|$|E
5|$|Few {{details are}} <b>definitively</b> known about Rosenberg's life before he {{traveled}} to Hawaii. He {{is believed to have}} been a Russian Jew born , and possibly lived in Australia and England. He was married and divorced three times, and had several children.|$|E
5|$|The female banded sea kraits {{then lay}} {{as many as}} 10 eggs per clutch. The eggs are {{deposited}} in crevices where they remain until hatching. These eggs are very rarely found in the wild; only two nests have been <b>definitively</b> reported throughout {{the entire range of}} the species.|$|E
5|$|Ukraine: In 2009, the {{possible}} occurrence of M.alcathoe in Ukraine was recorded. In 2011, the species was <b>definitively</b> recorded {{there on the}} basis of two bats caught in the far southwest of the country in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria gallica {{can produce}} cyclobutane-containing {{metabolites}} such as arnamiol, a natural {{product that is}} classified as a sesquiterpenoid aryl ester. Although the specific function of arnamiol is not <b>definitively</b> known, similar chemicals present in other Armillaria species are thought {{to play a role}} in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi, or in killing cells of the host plant prior to infection.|$|E
5|$|At {{several points}} in the book, Bechdel {{questions}} whether her decision to come out as a lesbian {{was one of the}} triggers for her father's suicide. This question is never answered <b>definitively,</b> but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive and negative lights.|$|E
5|$|Centuries after Lisa's death, Mona Lisa {{became the}} world's most famous {{painting}} and {{took on a}} life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made {{the work of art}} a globally recognized icon and an object of commercialization. In 2005, Lisa was <b>definitively</b> identified as the model for the Mona Lisa.|$|E
5|$|In addition, this marriage, {{which was}} {{endorsed}} by Emperor Justinian himself, marked Germanus out as the heir to both the East Roman and the Gothic realms. It was not to be, however: only {{two days before the}} army was to set out, in the early autumn of 550, he fell ill and died. His demise dashed any hopes for the reconciliation of Goth and Roman in Italy, and led to further years of bloodshed, until the peninsula was <b>definitively</b> conquered by the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|In {{almost all}} cases, {{symptoms}} resolve within a week. Fatalities are extremely unlikely. No deaths {{have been reported}} since the introduction of antivenom in 1956. Before this, redback spider bites had been implicated in at least 14 deaths in Australia, however these cases cannot be <b>definitively</b> linked to the Redback bite as the sole cause.|$|E
5|$|Meksi's {{work was}} {{important}} {{for the development of}} written Albanian, and his endeavors strengthened the conviction that a stable Albanian alphabet had to be created. His translation served as the basis for Joseph Ritter von Xylander's studies of the Albanian language, which <b>definitively</b> refuted the thesis that the language had a Tatar origin. Von Xylander concluded that Albanian had an Indo-European root.|$|E
5|$|No {{music that}} can be <b>definitively</b> traced to Nero has been identified, {{although}} Handel scholars have speculated that some of {{it may have been}} used in later works, particularly Agrippina which has a related storyline and some of the same characters. Fragments of music from Florindo and Daphne have been preserved, although without the vocal parts, and some of these elements have been incorporated into an orchestral suite first recorded in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} final {{contract}} with delle Croci was in 1516 whereas Cairano was <b>definitively</b> dead in 1517: if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from the documents {{that he would not}} have had sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently a large part of it must have been done before this date. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested in the documents. Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown what its condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. The implication is that the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to in the documents of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes <b>definitively</b> due to della Croci.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 1835, Jackson {{sent two}} representatives from Washington, D.C., Richard Rush of Pennsylvania and Benjamin Chew Howard of Maryland, to Toledo to {{arbitrate}} {{the conflict and}} present a compromise to both governments. The proposal, presented on April 7, recommended that the re-survey to mark the Harris Line commence without further interruption by Michigan, and that {{the residents of the}} affected region be allowed to choose their own state or territorial governments until the Congress could <b>definitively</b> settle the matter.|$|E
5|$|Operation Tannenbaum, a {{military}} offensive intended to occupy all of Switzerland, most likely in co-operation with Italy (which itself desired the Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland), {{was in the}} planning stages during 1940-1941. Its implementation was seriously considered by the German military after the armistice with France, but it was <b>definitively</b> shelved after the start of Operation Barbarossa had directed the attention of the Wehrmacht elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{scientific}} investigations support Waittâ€™s proposed {{separation of}} layers into records of sequential flood events. Although the various sources support temporal separation of floods, {{they do not}} <b>definitively</b> identify the source of water {{for all of the}} floods, though they all agree that Lake Missoula was source for at least some of them.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{relations}} of early Philippine polities with the various state-level polities of Indonesia and Malaysia, legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early Philippine polities with the Srivijaya empire, {{but there is not}} much archeological evidence to <b>definitively</b> support such a relationship. Considerable evidence exists, on the other hand, for extensive trade with the Majapahit empire.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{worked as}} a scout in his last role in baseball. Late in his life, he {{suffered}} a stroke and lost {{the use of his}} right arm and hand. Ten years after he was acquitted in the murder trial, he was found dead in a hotel room with a gunshot wound to the head. Authorities could not <b>definitively</b> rule out either suicide or murder.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2000s, the New York City Subway has {{undergone}} its biggest expansion program {{since the late}} 1960s, with five stations opened since 2009. There are up to 15 more subway stations <b>definitively</b> planned. Still, the 21st-century expansion plan {{pales in comparison to}} some of the subway system's other previous plans, {{as well as to the}} ambitious expansion of the subway in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Droeshout {{portrait}} or Droeshout engraving is {{a portrait}} of William Shakespeare engraved by Martin Droeshout as the frontispiece for the title page of the First Folio collection of Shakespeare's plays, published in 1623. It {{is one of only}} two works of art <b>definitively</b> identifiable as a depiction of the poet; the other is the statue erected as his funeral monument in Shakespeare's home town of Stratford-upon-Avon. Both are posthumous.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Genji was copied and {{illustrated}} {{in various forms}} as early as a century after Murasaki's death. The Genji Monogatari Emaki, is a late Heian era 12th-century handscroll, consisting of four scrolls, 19 paintings, and 20 sheets of calligraphy. The illustrations, <b>definitively</b> dated to between 1110 and 1120, have been tentatively attributed to Fujiwara no Takachika and the calligraphy to various well-known contemporary calligraphers. The scroll is housed at the Gotoh Museum and the Tokugawa Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} analysis that would <b>definitively</b> identify the dyes used in ancient textiles {{has rarely been}} conducted, and even when a dye such as indigo blue is detected {{it is impossible to}} determine which of several indigo-bearing plants was used. Nevertheless, based on the colors of surviving textile fragments and the evidence of actual dyestuffs found in archaeological sites, reds, blues, and yellows from plant sources were in common use by the late Bronze Age and Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|The edibility of {{the fruit}} bodies of Agaricus deserticola is not known <b>definitively,</b> and there are {{conflicting}} opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided. However, one popular field guide to North American mushrooms suggests they are edible when they are young, and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of these works was {{achieved}} for the 10 June truce and on 19 June a convoy of 140 trucks, each carrying three tons of merchandise as well as numerous weapons and ammunition, reached Jerusalem. The siege {{of the city was}} then <b>definitively</b> over. This Israeli success was punctuated by an incident that became marked in memory: the death of Aluf Mickey Marcus, accidentally killed by an Israeli sentry during the night of 10â€“11 June.|$|E
5|$|The {{most serious}} {{potential}} adverse effect of biguanide use is metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). Though the incidence for MALA about nine per 100,000 person-years, {{this is not}} different from the background incidence of lactic acidosis in the general population. A systematic review concluded no data exists to <b>definitively</b> link metformin to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The oldest fossil {{teeth that}} <b>definitively</b> {{belong to the}} kitefin shark date to the Middle Eocene epoch, such as those {{recovered}} from Bortonian-stage deposits (43.037.0 Ma) in New Zealand. Dalatias fossil teeth dating to various ages have also been discovered in Europe, the former USSR, Japan, and western India. The fossil material now recognized as belonging to this species were historically described under a multitude of different names.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} {{types of}} {{existing}} bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain, including echinoderms and tunicates. It has not been <b>definitively</b> established whether {{the existence of these}} brainless species indicates that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain, or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure.|$|E
5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears {{to obey the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments {{for the existence of}} photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted <b>definitively</b> in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to <b>definitively</b> ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birtâ€“Hoggâ€“DubÃ© syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all <b>definitively</b> connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more <b>definitively</b> distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|Between 1983 and 1989 the {{paintings}} underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical {{analysis of the}} Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings <b>definitively</b> attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, {{the paintings}} were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today {{the consensus is that}} both were painted by the same hand.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is <b>definitively</b> {{diagnosed}} from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|Einstein and De Haas {{demonstrated}} that magnetization {{is due to}} the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it <b>definitively</b> established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.|$|E
5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeansâ€™ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, {{the linchpin of}} Antiquity, as it was perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} AbbÃ© BarthÃ©lemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix <b>definitively</b> the image that Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine is not {{essential}} for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength, but {{this has not been}} <b>definitively</b> established. As there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine, the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon â€“ adenosyl-fluoride synthase â€“ was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following LeRoy's {{death in}} 1932, his film {{collection}} {{was bought by}} the Museum of Modern Art in 1936. The museum's acquisition and subsequent screenings of A Trip to the Moon, {{under the direction of}} MoMA's film curator Iris Barry, opened the film up once again to a wide audience of Americans and Canadians and established it <b>definitively</b> as a landmark in the history of cinema. LeRoy's incomplete print became the most commonly seen version of the film and the source print for most other copies, including the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que franÃ§aise's print. A complete version of the film, including the entire celebration sequence, was finally reconstructed in 1997 from various sources by the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que MÃ©liÃ¨s, a foundation set up by the MÃ©liÃ¨s family.|$|E
