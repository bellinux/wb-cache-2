5|$|After the war, {{construction}} of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated {{the closure of the}} line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922. By this point there were nine trains per day from Hotwells, and eight return. To compensate for the loss of service, the Great Western provided an additional four trains <b>daily</b> <b>from</b> Avonmouth Dock to Bristol and six return. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS.

He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them <b>daily</b> <b>from</b> the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E
5|$|The {{project is}} a {{continuation}} of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's plan to build four tracks along the three main corridors out of Oslo; the Gardermoen Line was completed in 1998, and the Asker Line has been completed in 2011. Between 1989 and 1996, the Østfold Line south of Ski to Moss was upgraded to double track and higher speeds. To take full advantage of this and allow the rest of the Østfold Line to be upgraded for high speeds, it is necessary to increase capacity through the bottleneck from Oslo to Ski. The first plans for the Follo Line were launched in 1995, and also included an intermediate station at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The new line is predicted to increase rush hour rail ridership 63%, and increased freight on rail would remove 750 trucks <b>daily</b> <b>from</b> European Route E18.|$|E

During the summer months there is a cruise service operating between Joensuu and Nurmes. Kajaani railway station opened in 1905 when the railway from Iisalmi to Kajaani was completed as an extension to the Savonia railroad. The station building was designed by Gustaf Nyström.

The study evaluates ambient ozone (O 3) influence on the health of the people living in Prague, the capital of Czech Republic, during the period 2002 - 2006. Its specific theme is to investigate correlation between ambient ozone (O 3) concentrations and <b>daily</b> mortality <b>from</b> all causes, <b>daily</b> mortality <b>from</b> cardiovascular diseases (diagnose I 00 -I 99, ICD- 10), <b>daily</b> mortality <b>from</b> respiratory diseases (diagnose J 00 -J 99, ICD- 10), <b>daily</b> hospitalizations <b>from</b> cardiovascular diseases (dg.

5|$|Eastbourne is {{connected}} by road to London by the A22, and to Brighton and Hove and Hastings by the nearby A27. The car {{is the most}} used form of transport in the town, with only 6% of journeys taken by bus; the local council transport plan aims {{to reduce the amount}} of car usage. Bus services within Eastbourne have been provided by Stagecoach Group under the name Stagecoach in Eastbourne since November 2008, when the company acquired Eastbourne Buses, a service run by the local council, and subsequently the independent company Cavendish Motor Services. Eastbourne Buses had been formed in 1903 by the County Borough of Eastbourne, who were the first local authority in the world authorised to run motor buses. As well as local journeys within the town, Stagecoach also runs routes to Polegate, Hailsham, Tunbridge Wells, Uckfield and East Grinstead at various frequencies, while the two routes to Hastings via Bexhill are run by Stagecoach South East from Hastings. The other main operator into Eastbourne is Brighton & Hove, owned by the Go-Ahead Group, which runs frequent services seven days a week from Brighton via Seaford and Newhaven. Limited numbers of additional buses are run by the Cuckmere Buses, and a regular National Express coach service operates <b>daily</b> <b>from</b> London's Victoria Coach Station.|$|E
5|$|From November 2009 until November 2010, the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{once again}} {{returned}} to Afghanistan, {{this time to}} the provinces of Logar and Wardak. With combat experience already earned in other similar mountain regions in 2007 and 2008, the Brigade distinguished itself in combat regularly against the Taliban and fought tenaciously against them, while still promoting and attempting to legitimize the Afghan government. The 1st and 2nd Battalions saw extensive action in eastern Logar and Wardak. The 1/91st Cavalry was given a mission to transform western Logar province into a secure environment; a mission that was not greeted as an easy task. Given the province and its three major districts saw a massive influx of both foreign and domestic fighters due to the relatively calm winter prior to the brigade's arrival, its company-sized and platoon-sized elements found themselves in combat against anti-Coalition forces almost <b>daily</b> <b>from</b> the start of March 2010 until its relief. The brigade returned to its home station in Europe in November 2010. Seven soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{the couple}} {{purchased}} a house together located on Burlington Crescent in Toronto, near Edith's clinic and lived there until their retirement. In 1965, both women retired and sold their Toronto home, {{moving to the}} farm house owned by the Fraser family in Burlington, Ontario. The farm was located in a very scenic setting on the Niagara Escarpment, near the Bruce Trail. Fraser, who enjoyed gardening, tended the ground and Williams, who was a fine cook, enjoyed cooking for their frequent guests. Having become interested in mountaineering, Williams enjoyed mountain-climbing and both women enjoyed taking excursions which allowed them to be outdoors. In their archives are many photographs taken with groups of women on camping and canoe trips. Williams suffered a severe stroke {{near the end of}} 1976 and never fully recovered from it requiring repeated hospitalizations at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Fraser drove in <b>daily</b> <b>from</b> Burlington to visit Williams.
