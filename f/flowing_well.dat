40|$|The {{analytical}} model for predicting the pressure {{at any point}} in a flow string is essential in determining optimumproduction string dimension and in the design of gas-lift installations. This information is also invaluable in predictingbottom-hole pressure in <b>flowing</b> <b>wells.</b> A variety of model on bottom-hole pressure in <b>flowing</b> <b>wells</b> {{have been reported in the}} literatures. Most of the earlymodels on pressure drop in the <b>flowing</b> <b>wells</b> were based on single phase <b>flowing</b> <b>wells,</b> even the recent investigatorstreated the multiphase (liquid and gas phase) as a homogenous single phase flow without accounting for dissolvedgas in oil. This paper present a modification of Sukkar and Cornell model for single phase <b>flowing</b> gas <b>wells</b> and the model wasadapted to predict the pressure drop in multiphase <b>flowing</b> <b>wells.</b> The key operational and fluid/ pipe parameters whichinfluence the degree of pressure drop in <b>flowing</b> <b>wells</b> are identified through the modification...|$|R
