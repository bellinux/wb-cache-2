The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyse the kinetics of the dewatering process thanks to experiments carried out with a lab-scale pressurised electro-dewatering device. Tests were conducted under constant current density and constant voltage, respectively. Different sludge loads were considered. The kinetics of the dewatering process was monitored by calculating both, the dryness of the sludge cake and the mass flow rate of filtrate over time. It was found that only two key parameters affect significantly the mass flow rate of filtrate during the electro-dewatering process, namely the electric current intensity and the dryness of sludge cake. The dewatering kinetics of tests at constant voltage and constant current were both explained with this analysis. No influence of the sludge load was observed on the flow rate of filtrate...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{dewatering}} on the inactivation rates of enteric viruses in sludge was determined. For this study, water was evaporated from seeded raw sludge at 21 degrees C, {{and the loss}} of viral plaque-forming units was measured. Initial results with poliovirus showed that recoverable infectivity gradually decreased with the loss of water until the solids content reached about 65 %. When the solids content was increased from 65 to 83 %, a further, more dramatic decrease in virus titer of greater than three orders of magnitude was observed. This loss of infectivity was due to irreversible inactivation of poliovirus because viral particles were found to have released their RNA molecules which were extensively degraded. Viral inactivation in these experiments may have been at least partially caused by the evaporation process itself because similar effects on poliovirus particles were observed in distilled water after only partial loss of water by evaporation. Coxsackievirus and reovirus were also found to be inactivated in sludge under comparable conditions, which suggests that <b>dewatering</b> <b>by</b> evaporation may be a feasible method of inactivating all enteric viruses in sludge...|$|R

Results: The research found that the maximum efficiency of the US-EC reactor was achieved at a frequency of 35 KHz and detention time of 5 min for ultrasonic with voltage of 40 V and at detention time of 30 min for electrocoagulation process as under these conditions total EPS concentration reduced by 69 %.

The results revealed that among all the scenarios, cultivation in raceway pond was ascertained {{to be the most}} energy intensive process with the mode of culture mixing and biomass productivity being the principal determinants. The impacts were found to be directly linked to energy demand and had an inverse relationship with biomass productivity. The geographic location of the energy sources affected the environmental implications of a given process.
