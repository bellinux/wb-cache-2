40|$|In this study, {{the varying}} reactivities of Bacillus subtilis tryptophanyl-tRNA {{synthetase}} toward prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and halophile tRNAs {{were employed to}} define the potential <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> on tRNA(TrP). On this basis mutagenesis was performed to obtain, through in vivo heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and in vitro transcription with T 7 RNA polymerase, mutant B. subtilis tRNA(Trp) for comparison with the wild-type. These comparisons served to establish G 73 and the anticodon as major <b>identity</b> <b>elements,</b> and A 1 -U 72, G 5 -C 68, and A 9 as minor <b>identity</b> <b>elements.</b> While the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase from B. subtilis and E. coli require G 73 to function, replacement of G 73 by A 73 favors the enzyme from yeast. This change points to the variation of the <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> for the same amino acid among different organisms. The similarity in these elements between B. subtilis and E. coli tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, however, suggests that <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> on tRNA, like the active centers on enzymes, undergo evolutionary change at slower rates than less essential portions of the macromolecule...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} published discrete mathematical method, extended consensus partition (ECP), identifies nucleotide types at each position that are strictly absent from a given sequence set, while occur in other sets. These {{are defined as}} discriminating elements (DEs). In this study using the ECP approach, we mapped potential hidden <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> that discriminate the 20 different tRNA identities. We filtered the tDNA data set for the obligatory presence of well-established tRNA features, and then separately for each identity set, the presence of already experimentally identified strictly present <b>identity</b> <b>elements.</b> The analysis {{was performed on the}} three kingdoms of life. We determined the number of DE, e. g. the number of sets discriminated by the given position, for each tRNA position of each tRNA identity set. Then, from the positional DE numbers obtained from the 380 pairwise comparisons of the 20 identity sets, we calculated the average excluding value (AEV) for each tRNA position. The AEV provides a measure on the overall discriminating power of each position. Using a statistical analysis, we show that positional AEVs correlate with the number of already identified <b>identity</b> <b>elements.</b> Positions having high AEV but lacking published <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> predict hitherto undiscovered tRNA <b>identity</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

I suggest that the tRNA–protein interaction network is hierarchically organized, and coevolutionarily flexible. Its functional specificity of recognition and discrimination persists despite generic structural constraints and perturbative evolutionary forces.

40|$|Through the {{comparisons}} among 91 tRNA(Trp) sequences from prokaryotes, archea and eukaryotes, the potential species-specific <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> of tRNA(Trp) {{are found to}} be located within acceptor stem, dihydrouridine (D) stem, anticodon(AC) stem and discriminator base. Mutagenesis of B. subtilis tRNA(Trp) to the eukaryotic consensus sequence, in vitro transcription and enzymatic assay of tRNA(Trp) toward different tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases (TrpRS) were employed to shed light on these species-specific <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> and demonstrate the accurate recognition and the coevolution between tRNA and TrpRS. B. subtilis tRNA(Trp) with its acceptor stem and discriminator base transplanted by eukaryotic counterparts exhibited diminished reactivity toward B. subtilis enzyme but could be efficiently aminoacylated by rat liver crude enzyme. In contrast, B. subtilis tRNA(Trp) analog with the eukaryotic anticodon stem and D stem retains its recognition by B. subtilis enzyme. The results provide a strong evidence that the species-specific <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> of tRNA(Trp) are orientated within the acceptor stem and discriminator base of tRNA(Trp), and the anticodon stem and D stem are of little importance to the interaction between tRNA(Trp) and its cognate synthetase (TrpRS) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{methods for}} {{establishing}} synthetic lifeforms with rewritten genetic codes comprising non-canonical amino acids (NCAA) {{in addition to}} canonical amino acids (CAA) include proteome-wide replacement of CAA, insertion through suppression of nonsense codon, and insertion via the pyrrolysine and selenocysteine pathways. Proteome-wide reassignments of nonsense codons and sense codons are also under development. These methods enable the application of NCAAs to enrich both fundamental and applied aspects of protein chemistry and biology. Sense codon reassignment to NCAA could incur problems arising from the usage of anticodons as <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> on tRNA, and possible misreading of NNY codons by UNN anticodons. Evidence suggests {{that the problem of}} anticodon as <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> can be diminished or resolved through removal from the tRNA of all <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> besides the anticodons, and the problem of misreading of NNY codons by UNN anticodon can be resolved by the retirement of both the UNN anticodon and its complementary NNA codon from the proteome in the event that a restrictive post-transcriptional modification of the UNN anticodon by host enzymes to prevent the misreading cannot be obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} genetic code manifests itself in {{the interaction of the}} aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and their cognate tRNAs. The fundamental biological question regarding these enzymes' role {{in the evolution of the}} genetic code remains open. Here we probe this question in a system in which the same tRNA species is aminoacylated by two unrelated synthetases. Should this tRNA possess major <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> common to both enzymes, this would favor a scenario where the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases evolved in the context of preestablished tRNA identity, i. e., after the universal genetic code emerged. An experimental system is provided by the recently discovered O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS), which acylates tRNACys with phosphoserine (Sep), and the well known cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, which charges the same tRNA with cysteine. We determined the <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tRNACys in the aminoacylation reaction for the two Methanococcus maripaludis synthetases SepRS (forming Sep-tRNACys) and cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (forming Cys-tRNACys). The major elements, the discriminator base and the three anticodon bases, are shared by both tRNA synthetases. An evolutionary analysis of archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic tRNACys sequences predicted additional SepRS-specific minor <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> (G 37, A 47, and A 59) and suggested the dominance of vertical inheritance for tRNACys from a single common ancestor. Transplantation of the identified <b>identity</b> <b>elements</b> into the Escherichia coli tRNAGly scaffold endowed facile phosphoserylation activity on the resulting chimera. Thus, tRNACys identity is an ancient RNA record that depicts the emergence of the universal genetic code before the evolution of the modern aminoacylation systems...|$|R
