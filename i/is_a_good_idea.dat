5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

25|$|When the Affirmative team {{presents}} a plan, they take upon themselves the Burden of Proof {{to prove that}} their plan should be adopted.

25|$|There {{are many}} more {{extensions}} to Petri nets, however, {{it is important to}} keep in mind, that as the complexity of the net increases in terms of extended properties, the harder it is to use standard tools to evaluate certain properties of the net.

25|$|Some {{antivirus}} vendors maintain websites {{with free}} online scanning {{capability of the}} entire computer, critical areas only, local disks, folders or files. Periodic online scanning <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> for those that run antivirus applications on their computers because those applications are frequently slow to catch threats. One {{of the first things}} that malicious software does in an attack is disable any existing antivirus software and sometimes the only way to know of an attack is by turning to an online resource that is not installed on the infected computer.|$|E

25|$|Openings {{are also}} {{classified}} as Static Rook openings, where the offense {{is supported by}} the rook in its original position, and Ranging Rook openings, where the rook moves to the center or left of the board to support an attack there, typically with the idea of allowing the opponent to attack while arranging a better defense and aiming for a counterattack. However, as the most powerful piece on the board, the rook invites attack, and in most cases, especially for weaker players, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to keep the king well away from the rook. Relatedly, the static vs ranging classification corresponds to castle development: static rook positions tend to have castles {{on the left side of}} the board while ranging rook positions tend to have castles on the right side.|$|E
500|$|David McNaughton argues that, {{even if the}} agent's {{commitment}} to his/her principles is not undermined, two-level utilitarianism does not succeed in its goal of showing, [...] "how, on utilitarian principles, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to think and reason in a pluralist and non-consequentialist manner." [...] It is impossible, he claims, to compartmentalise one's thinking {{in the way the}} two-level account requires—to simultaneously think like a utilitarian and act in a non-utilitarian way. Hare's response to this type of criticism is that he does his own moral thinking in this way, therefore the challenge that this type of moral thinking is impossible must be false.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} the New York Times noted that the basic premise <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> but [...] "studded {{as it is with}} undigested chunks of {{scientific}} jargon, sociology-speak and polemical rhetoric Batman: The Ultimate Evil misses out almost completely on the pure pulp thrills that {{lie at the heart of}} its title character's appeal." [...] In the St. Petersburg Times, Adam Begley also noted the use of what he called [...] "techno-babble". In The Washington Post, Jack Womack wrote that Vachss describes the Batmobile [...] "lovingly yet gnomically, as if a Motor Trend review had been translated into Slovakian by someone more familiar with Czech" [...] and concluded that the novel was [...] "as satisfying — aesthetically, ethically, morally — as a pulse-pounding yarn in which pulp-fiction hero Doc Savage ransacks the shantytowns of South America in a terribly successful search for Doc Mengele." [...] In Kirkus Reviews, the story was compared to a generic [...] "Destroy All Exploiters" [...] video game where Batman [...] "disposes of each lower-level pimp, then moves up to the next level". Sybil Steinberg in Publishers Weekly noted that [...] "while no classic, this is likely the [...] most stylish adaptation yet of a comic-book figure, its cold stiletto prose and white-hot passions lifting it leagues above recent Spider-man and Incredible Hulk offerings. It's also Vachss' best work since Shella". [...] Both the Library Journal and Booklist predicted heavy demand for it at public libraries.|$|E

I {{personally}} do not {{think that that}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> but I believe in many of these cases where there's real dispute in the country, these things {{are not going to be}} ever resolved. [...] People are going to have different ideas. That's why we have states. We ought to give great leeway to states and not have the federal government and not have the Supreme Court of the United States making social policy that's contrary to the traditions of this country and changing that overnight. And that's what's happened in a lot of these areas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{consensus}} view among guidance advisors {{is that it}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> {{to visit}} colleges, preferably when college is in session and not during a summer break, {{with a chance to}} meet an actual student {{in the form of a}} tour guide, and taking notes for reference later when applying. Sometimes a college will waive the application fee based on the college visit. A benefit is seeing a school as it really is—not just glossy pictures from a brochure or a promotional video from a website. Another suggested that students should ask themselves, when visiting a particular college: [...] "can I see myself here"? Reporter Jenna Johnson in the Washington Post suggested that students contact a professor in an area of interest at the college before visiting, and try to meet with them briefly or sit in on one of their classes. Reporter Brennan Barnard in the New York Times recommended that student visitors should ask good questions (by avoiding factual questions better answered by the college's website), and ask for complimentary passes for dining or free food. Barnard recommends going beyond the usual tour to ask random strangers about life on campus and reading the student newspaper. He recommends arranging to speak with a professor in the department of interest as well as athletic coaches and music directors, possibly by emailing them in advance of the visit, to try to meet them even briefly. A follow-up [...] "thank you" [...] note to the host <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> (avoid texting abbreviations.) ...|$|E
2500|$|A typical hedger {{might be}} a {{commercial}} farmer. The market values of wheat and other crops fluctuate constantly as supply and demand for them vary, with [...] occasional large moves in either direction. Based on current prices and forecast levels at harvest time, the farmer might decide that planting wheat <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> one season, but the price of wheat might change over time. Once the farmer plants wheat, he is committed to it for an entire growing season. If the actual price of wheat rises greatly between planting and harvest, the farmer stands {{to make a lot}} of unexpected money, but if the actual price drops by harvest time, he is going to lose the invested money.|$|E

2500|$|... magine {{the time}} when men lived in caves. One bright guy—let's call him Galt-Magnon—decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> and others notice it. They {{naturally}} imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But {{the first man to}} invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule {{flies in the face of}} the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.|$|E

[...] During a review of the year, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised Phillipps for being [...] "a strong actor" [...] and said he deserved [...] "a chance to shine" [...] as Daniel in the new year. Kilkelly bemoaned the lack of challenging storylines for him and hoped he would be given something more to do that did not revolve around his relationship with Amber.

2500|$|During the winter, travel {{along the}} {{roads in the}} basin can become {{difficult}} to impossible depending on snow accumulation, particularly on the more remote gravel roads that are not regularly plowed. If road conditions or car trouble strand a motorist in the more remote areas of the basin, during the pulses of intense winter cold common to this area, {{there is a real}} risk of death or injury by freezing. The Tongue River basin does not have the [...] "gumbo" [...] type mud that affects road travel in wet weather {{on the north side of}} the Yellowstone River. Traffic on the gravel and dirt roads of the Tongue River basin is a problem at sharp corners, blind hilltops, concealed entrances to side roads, and when suddenly encountering oversized slow ranch/farm vehicles. In warm weather it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to keep an eye out ahead for dust clouds indicating approaching vehicles. The motorist traveling in the Tongue River basin should keep a constant look out for livestock on the road, and especially for deer (particularly at dawn, dusk and at night).|$|E

2500|$|Mice {{are kept}} as pets in many {{countries}} {{for a number of}} reasons: Fancy mice are relatively small, inexpensive, never need bathing, and can learn to enjoy regular handling. Female mice are popular with many owners since they tend to co-habitate with other mice better than males. Additionally, the urine of female fancy mice does not contain as strong an odor as that of the male mice. Bucks will often fight with and kill each other when housed together, despite being raised together, due to their very strong and unchangeable territorial instincts. It is difficult to house male mice together without the risk of injury to one or both males. [...] Some people, however, prefer the personality and curiosity of male mice. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> to keep fancy mice in groups of at least two if possible, as mice are sociable animals. However, if a buck and a doe of breeding age are put in the same cage it is possible for them to reproduce at a maximum frequency of once every three weeks. Litters of 5-18 are not unusual.|$|E
2500|$|Fox Atomic {{stated in}} June 2007 {{that they would}} {{consider}} producing a third film if DVD sales of the film did well. In July 2007, while promoting Sunshine, Boyle {{said he had a}} possible story for the next film. [...] "There is an idea for the next one, something which would move the story on. I've got to think about it, whether it's right or not." [...] In October 2010, when Alex Garland was asked what was happening with 28 Months Later, he declared: [...] "I'll answer that completely honestly. When we made 28 Days Later, the rights were frozen between {{a group of people who}} are no longer talking to each other. And so, the film is never going to happen unless those people start talking to each other again. There is no script as far as I'm aware." [...] In January 2011, Danny Boyle said, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> for it, and once I've got [...] Frankenstein open, I'll begin to think about it a bit more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{teaching}} and film-making, Khouri devotes time to feminist organizations. [...] "Don’t you think {{talking about it}} is important, making the next generation understand that things are still not right for women?" [...] says Khouri. “I feel like I owe aspiring writers at least the warning that they are picking maybe the hardest thing there is {{to do in the}} business,” she says. “It doesn’t matter any more how good you are. In some ways, it never really did. Bad movies get made as often as good ones, but so few movies get made now, period. If you write for a studio, you may be one of eight writers, so it’s not like you can have an artistic vision of your own and achieve it solely through screenwriting. I was very lucky because Ridley really wanted to tell Thelma & Louise. He wanted to make the movie I wanted to make. But often times that’s not the case at all. They think your script <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> and that’s all.
