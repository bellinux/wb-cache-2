5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a <b>decantation</b> basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the <b>decantation</b> basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E

Leaving the pitched wort on the lees beyond the still fermentation period would adversely affect the mead's organoleptic properties because of yeast autolysis. Ageing (maturing) and siphoning (<b>decantation)</b> is repeated as necessary to prevent unwanted processes from {{taking place in the}} lees. During ageing, it is possible to carry out pasteurisation and filtration. This stage is essential for ensuring that the product has the right organoleptic properties.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collapse}} {{was clearly}} due to non-solidification. <b>Decantation</b> {{is the first}} step for proper solidification. 8000 m3 of material with maximum head of 50 meter remaining in slurry form for days together indicate lack of <b>decantation,</b> which can be due to deficient installation of <b>decantation</b> equipment and/or monitoring system. 15 stopes had already been filled successfully, indicating sufficient experience and reliability of method and equipment used. Nobody noticed that 50 meter of filling slurry head had been created inside the stope over days/months. Lack of notifications of non solidification points toward an inadequate alarm system.|$|E

40|$|A {{process for}} making {{chemically}} pure, single-domain magnetite crystals substantially free of structural defects has been invented as {{a byproduct of}} research into the origin of globules in a meteorite found in Antarctica and believed to have originated on Mars. The globules in the meteorite comprise layers of mixed (Mg, Fe, and Ca) carbonates, magnetite, and iron sulfides. Since {{the discovery of the}} meteorite was announced in August 1996, scientists have debated whether the globules are of biological origin or were formed from inorganic materials by processes that could have taken place on Mars. While the research that led to the present invention has not provided a definitive conclusion concerning the origin of the globules, it has shown that globules of a different but related chemically layered structure can be grown from inorganic ingredients in a multistep precipitation process. As described in more detail below, the present invention comprises the multistep precipitation process plus a subsequent heat treatment. The multistep precipitation process was demonstrated in a laboratory experiment on the growth of submicron ankerite crystals, overgrown by submicron siderite and pyrite crystals, overgrown by submicron magnesite crystals, overgrown by submicron siderite and pyrite. In each step, chloride salts of appropriate cations (Ca, Fe, and Mg) were dissolved in deoxygenated, CO 2 - saturated water. NaHCO 3 was added as a pH buffer while CO 2 was passed continuously through the solution. A 15 -mL aliquot of the resulting solution was transferred into each of several 20 mL, poly(tetrafluoroethylene) -lined hydrothermal pressure vessels. The vessels were closed in a CO 2 atmosphere, then transferred into an oven at a temperature of 150 C. After a predetermined time, the hydrothermal vessels were removed from the oven and quenched in a freezer. Supernatant solutions were decanted, and carbonate precipitates were washed free of soluble salts by repeated <b>decantations</b> with deionized water...|$|R

5000|$|After <b>decantation</b> of the disulfides, the {{regenerated}} [...] "lean" [...] caustic {{solution is}} recirculated {{back to the}} top of the extractor to continue extracting mercaptans.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} <b>decantation</b> is the {{regeneration}} of used chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP to be decanted is gently mixed {{in a container}} with a compatible solvent to form a suspension. The suspension is allowed to rest {{for a period of}} time, after which the supernatant is carefully poured off. The supernatant contains the undesirable constituents of the former suspension, while the leftover sediment in the container is clean, reusable CSP. <b>Decantation</b> should be done directly after sedimentation.This process is also used in erected pure iron from iron ore.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{methods of}} {{production}} also include direct evaporation, {{but may also}} be accomplished by <b>decantation</b> and centrifugation followed by vacuum drying; or direct from cream by breaking the emulsion followed by centrifugation.|$|E

50|$|The process {{generally}} involves {{taking a}} mixture of substances, dissolving them in warm water, and then rapidly cooling the mixture. The insoluble compounds precipitate out of the water, while the soluble ones stay dissolved. The solution can then be separated by filtration or <b>decantation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Virgin {{olive oils}} are the oils {{obtained}} from {{the fruit of the}} olive tree solely by mechanical or other physical means under conditions, particularly thermal conditions, that do not lead to alterations in the oil, and which have not undergone any treatment other than washing, <b>decantation,</b> centrifugation and filtration.|$|E
50|$|A {{mixture of}} an {{insoluble}} solid in liquid {{is allowed to}} stand. If the solid is more dense than the liquid it will settle at the bottom if kept undisturbed for some time. This process is called sedimentation.A centrifuge {{may be useful in}} decanting a solution. The centrifuge causes the precipitate to be forced {{to the bottom of the}} container; if the force is high enough, the precipitate may form a compact solid. Then the liquid can be more easily poured away, as the precipitate will tend to remain in its compressed form.Similarly a mixture of two immiscible liquids can also be separated by <b>decantation.</b> For example, the oil and water extracted from fish may be decanted to obtain the oil. A mixture of kerosene and water can also be separated through <b>decantation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{decanter}} is {{a vessel}} {{that is used}} to hold the <b>decantation</b> of a liquid (such as wine) which may contain sediment. Decanters, which have a varied shape and design, have been traditionally made from glass or crystal. Their volume is usually equivalent to one standard bottle of wine (0.75 litre).|$|E

50|$|A stope {{of about}} 50 meters {{horizontal}} length X 25 to 50 meters width X 50 meters vertical depth was excavated. This stope area was drilled completely {{from the top}} of stope throughout its height of 50 meter using long drill hole machines. At the bottom of the stope sufficient area is cleared to draw out muck. The stope is blasted in slices of about 5 meter or so using explosives. Blasted muck is withdrawn using an LHD machine. After blasting a barricade plug is placed {{at the bottom of the}} stope from which muck is withdrawn. This barricade plug has a draw out pipe fitted at bottom with a V notch for proper <b>decantation</b> and monitoring. This empty stope is now equipped with long <b>decantation</b> pipes to be lowered {{from the top of}} the stopes. The empty stope is filled with cement fill. Water is drained from the bottom of the stope, and the fill gradually solidifies.|$|E
50|$|Anhydrous {{magnesium}} sulfate {{is commonly used}} as a desiccant in organic synthesis due to its affinity for water. During work-up, an organic phase is saturated with anhydrous {{magnesium sulfate}} until it no longer forms clumps.

50|$|People {{have used}} olive presses since Greeks first began {{pressing}} olives over 5,000 years ago. Roman olive presses survive {{to the present}} time, with a notable collection present at Volubilis in Morocco. An olive press works by applying pressure to olive paste to separate the liquid oil and vegetation water from the solid material. The oil and vegetation water are then separated by standard <b>decantation.</b>|$|E

The nickel and cobalt in the slurry are removed from it almost completely using a CCD system exchanging the cobalt and nickel with flash steam heated water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Decantation</b> is {{a process}} for the {{separation}} of mixtures, by removing a layer of liquid, generally one from which a precipitate has settled.The purpose may be either to produce a clean decant, or to remove undesired liquid from the precipitate (or other layers).If {{the aim is to}} produce a clean solution, a small amount of solution must generally be left in the container, and care must be taken to prevent any precipitate from flowing with the solution out of the container.|$|E
