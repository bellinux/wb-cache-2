40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} an engine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of crashed aircraft were sent to this laboratory for investigation. The components that were sent for laboratory analysis are (i) fractured rim and diaphragm of stage IV compressor disc, (ii) spline bolt, (iii) HPTR blade, (iv) LPTR blade, (v) <b>HP</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vane, (vi) stage I compressor rotor blades, and (vii) a metallic piece recovered from fuel oil unit. Examination revealed that the diaphragm of stage IV compressor disc had sheared off circumferentially and along the fillet of the rim. While majority of the fracture surface showed reverse slant fracture features, a region spanning about 50 - 60 mm on the fracture surface had smooth and flat appearance. Fractographic study conducted on this region showed presence of a half-moon shape region, indicative of progressive mode of crack propagation. Further examination of this region under a scanning electron microscope confirmed that the crack propagation was by fatigue. The fatigue crack {{was found to have}} initiated at the fillet of the rim of the disc on the side facing stage V compressor. Detailed examination revealed that after initiation, the crack had propagated progressively over about 18 mm in length and 2. 5 mm in depth. Followed by this, the fatigue crack propagation was relatively fast through the remaining thickness of the diaphragm and over a length of 50 - 60 mm on the diaphragm surface. Once the fatigue crack attained this length, the diaphragm sheared off circumferentially and along the fillet of the rim instantaneously by overload. The fatigue crack origin region was severely damaged due to post fracture rubbing and hence, no further study was possible to examine {{whether or not there was}} any localized stress concentrator either mechanical or metallurgical, which could be responsible for the fatigue crack initiation. It may, however, be noted that there were no metallurgical abnormalities in the material of construction of the compressor disc and it was found to conform to specification of BT 3 - 1 Ti-alloy. Study of the surfaces and the metallurgical examination did not reveal any evidences of overheating in the components such as HPTR blade, LPTR blade and <b>HP</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vane. Although certain microstructural changes were observed in the material of HPTR blade, these changes were found to be within the acceptable range, and they are expected to occur in the material over prolonged use at elevated temperatures. Although the features on the fracture surfaces of the spline bolts were completely obliterated due to oxidation/exposure to fire, gross fractographic features and deformation preceding fracture indicated that the failure was by overload. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic piece recovered from the fuel oil unit is a fractured segment of the nose-fairing. Analysis also showed presence of traces of nose-fairing on the damaged regions of stage I compressor rotor blades. Analysis suggests that the compressor disc with a fatigue crack of length 50 - 60 mm at the rim fillet region would not survive, and it is likely to fracture during engine run. It is, therefore, stated that the fatigue fracture of stage IV compressor disc was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure...|$|E
40|$|Pronounced non-uniformities in {{combustor}} exit {{flow temperature}} (hot-streaks), which arise because of discrete {{injection of fuel}} and dilution air jets within the combustor and because of end-wall cooling flows, affect both component life and aerodynamics. Because {{it is very difficult}} to quantitatively predict the affects of these temperature non-uniformities on the heat transfer rates, designers are forced to budget for hot-streaks in the cooling system design process. Consequently, components are designed for higher working temperatures than the mass-mean gas temperature, and this imposes a significant overall performance penalty. An inadequate cooling budget can lead to reduced component life. An improved understanding of hot-streak migration physics, or robust correlations based on reliable experimental data, would help designers minimise the overhead on cooling flow that is currently a necessity. A number of recent research projects sponsored by a range of industrial gas turbine and aero-engine manufacturers attest to the growing interest in hot-streak physics. This paper presents measurements of surface and end-wall heat transfer rate for an <b>HP</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vane (NGV) operating as part of a full HP turbine stage in an annular transonic rotating turbine facility. Measurements were conducted with both uniform stage inlet temperature and with two non-uniform temperature profiles. The temperature profiles were non-dimensionally similar to profiles measured in an engine. A difference of one half of an NGV pitch in the circumferential (clocking) position of the hot-streak with respect to the NGV was used to investigate the affect of clocking on the vane surface and end-wall heat transfer rate. The vane surface pressure distributions, and the results of a flow-visualisation study, which are also given, are used to aid interpretation of the results. The results are compared to two-dimensional predictions conducted using two different boundary layer methods. Experiments were conducted in the Isentropic Light Piston Facility (ILPF) at QinetiQ Farnborough, a short duration engine-size turbine facility. Mach number, Reynolds number and gas-to-wall temperature ratios were correctly modelled. It is believed that the heat transfer measurements presented in this paper are the first of their kind.

40|$|Fouling is a {{major problem}} in gas {{turbines}} for aeropropulsion. The aerodynamics and heat load of the blades are severely affected by this phenomenon with local geometrical variations due to deposition and erosion. Currently two major models are available in literature for the evaluation of fouling effects in CFD: The first one is based on a critical threshold for the viscosity, whereas the second is characterized by the normal velocity to the surface. Both models aim to define a likelihood coefficient which estimates the probability a particle has to stick to a surface, known as sticking coefficient. However current models lack of generality being application specific. This work presents an innovative model for the estimation of the sticking probability. The fouling effect is defined as function of particle velocity, temperature and size through an energy based approach. Expressing the energy involved in the impact through an Arrhenius' type equation a general formulation for the sticking coefficient is obtained. The method, named EBFOG (Energy Based FOulinG), is the first "energy" based model presented in the open literature that can account any common deposition effect in gas turbines. The EBFOG model is implemented into a Lagrangian tracking procedure, coupled to a full three-dimensional CFD solver. Particles are tracked inside the domain and the velocity, size and temperature of each ones are calculated. The local geometry of the blade is modified accordingly to the deposition rate, the mesh is modified and the CFD solver updates the flow field. The application of this model to particle deposition in high pressure turbine vanes is investigated showing the flexibility of the proposed methodology. Such model is particular important in aircraft engines where the effect of fouling for the turbine, in particular the reduction of the <b>HP</b> <b>nozzle</b> throat area, influences heavily the performance: The energy based approach is thus used to quantify the area modification and estimate the variation of the compressor performance. The compressor map {{as a function of the}} operating hours in a severe environment can be in this way predicted to estimate, for example, the time that an engine can fly in a cloud of volcanic ashes. For this reason the impact of the fouling on the throat area of the nozzle is quantified for different conditions...|$|E

50|$|According {{to simple}} theory, {{if the ratio}} of turbine rotor inlet temperature/(HP) {{compressor}} delivery temperature is maintained, the HP turbine throat area can be retained. However, this assumes that cycle improvements are obtained, while retaining the datum (HP) compressor exit flow function (non-dimensional flow). In practice, changes to the non-dimensional speed of the (HP) compressor and cooling bleed extraction would probably make this assumption invalid, making some adjustment to HP turbine throat area unavoidable. This means the <b>HP</b> turbine <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes {{would have to be}} different from the original.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation of the}} beneficial effect of higher conductivity materials in <b>HP</b> turbine <b>nozzles.</b> Most of the literature studies focus on the maximum temperature that a nozzle can withstand, whereas the effect of thermal gradients is often neglected. However thermal gradients have higher influence {{on the life of}} the components {{and they have to be}} given careful consideration. In this work it is shown that thermal gradients are reduced by using high conductivity materials and, as a consequence, the nozzles life is appreciably increased. A representative film cooled leading edge with an internal impingement plate was studied experimentally at Texas AM University. Two materials were used, namely polycarbonate and stainless steel, in order to highlight the impact of conduction on coolant effectiveness. Numerically conjugate heat transfer simulations have been carried out with an in house solver to analyse in detail the impact of conduction and internal convection. Both experimental and numerical results show that by increasing the conductivity in the solid region, the thermal gradients are strongly reduced. Numerically it is shown that using inserts of nickel-aluminide alloys in nozzles may reduce the thermal gradients from 3 to 4 times if compared to nowadays design. Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|Fouling is a {{major problem}} in gas {{turbines}} for aeropropulsion because the formation of aggregates on the wet surfaces of the machine affects aerodynamic and heat loads. The representation of fouling in CFD is based on the evaluation of the sticking probability, i. e. the probability a particle touching a solid surface has to stick to that surface. Two main models are currently available in literature for the evaluation of the sticking coefficient: one is based on a critical threshold for the viscosity, the other is based on the normal velocity to the surface. However, both models are application specific and lack generality. This work presents an innovative model for the estimation of the sticking probability. This quantitiy is evaluated by comparing the kinetic energy of the particle with an activation energy which describes the state of the particle. The sticking criterion takes the form of an Arrhenius-type equation. A general formulation for the sticking coefficient is obtained. The method, named EBFOG (Energy Based FOulinG), is the first âenergyâ based model presented in the open literature able to account any common deposition effect in gas turbines. The EBFOG model is implemented into a Lagrangian tracking procedure, coupled to a fully three-dimensional CFD solver. Particles are tracked inside the domain and equations for the momentum and temperature of each particle are solved. The local geometry of the blade is modified accordingly to the deposition rate.

40|$|Coal and gangue {{underground}} {{pneumatic separation}} is of key importance for green mining. Two kinds of arrangement schemes for high-pressure value used in pneumatic separation system are proposed in this study. Pneumatic separation effects are examined under different arrangement of high-pressure value. Here, theoretical pneumatic separation distance formulas of mineral particles affected by different airflow directions are derived and validated {{by a series}} of numerical simulations and orthogonal experiments. In the following analysis, the effects of gangue diameter (d), conveyor velocity (v 0), and the height difference between conveyor belt and air <b>nozzle</b> (<b>hp)</b> are mainly considered. The numerical simulation and experimental results indicate that pneumatic separation effects under the condition of u and v 0 being in the opposite direction will be better than that of u and v 0 being in the same direction. The pneumatic separation distance ÎS shows a decreasing trend with the increasing of the three factors. The study also shows that gangue diameter has the most significant influence on separation distance, followed by conveyor velocity v 0 and height difference hp...|$|R
