5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity <b>increases,</b> <b>that</b> of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
5|$|The HDMI {{specification}} {{defines the}} protocols, signals, electrical interfaces and mechanical {{requirements of the}} standard. The maximum pixel clock rate for HDMI 1.0 is 165MHz, which is sufficient to allow 1080p and WUXGA (1920×1200) at 60Hz. HDMI 1.3 <b>increases</b> <b>that</b> to 340MHz, which allows for higher resolution (such as WQXGA, 2560×1600) across a single digital link. An HDMI connection can either be single-link (type A/C/D) or dual-link (type B) and can have a video pixel rate of 25MHz to 340MHz (for a single-link connection) or 25MHz to 680MHz (for a dual-link connection). Video formats with rates below 25MHz (e.g., 13.5MHz for 480i/NTSC) are transmitted using a pixel-repetition scheme.|$|E

25|$|On the air side of HVAC coils a {{significant}} difference exists between those used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to psychrometrics, air that is cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air flows. Heating some air <b>increases</b> <b>that</b> airflow's capacity to hold water. So heating coils need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but cooling coils must be adequately designed and selected to handle their particular latent (moisture) {{as well as the}} sensible (cooling) loads. The water that is removed is called condensate.|$|E
25|$|Yield curves {{are usually}} upward sloping asymptotically: {{the longer the}} maturity, the higher the yield, with {{diminishing}} marginal <b>increases</b> (<b>that</b> is, as one moves to the right, the curve flattens out). There are two common explanations for upward sloping yield curves. First, {{it may be that}} the market is anticipating a rise in the risk-free rate. If investors hold off investing now, they may receive a better rate in the future. Therefore, under the arbitrage pricing theory, investors who are willing to lock their money in now need to be compensated for the anticipated rise in rates—thus the higher interest rate on long-term investments.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} Reagan's 1981 tax cuts (reduced revenue {{relative}} to a baseline without the cuts) were at least partially offset by phased in Social Security payroll tax <b>increases</b> <b>that</b> had been enacted by President Jimmy Carter and the 95th Congress in 1977, and further increases by Reagan in 1983 An accounting indicated nominal tax receipts increased from $599 billion in 1981 to $1.032 trillion in 1990, an increase of 72% in current dollars. In 2005 dollars, the tax receipts in 1990 were $1.5 trillion, an increase of 20% above inflation. From 1991 to 2000, receipts increased by 90% in current dollars, or 60% in 2005 dollars. An analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculated that the average annual growth rate of real income-tax receipts per working-age person eventually rose over the two decades from 0.2% (1981–90) to 3.1% (1990–2001).|$|E

Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers.

25|$|The {{announcement}} of the Gateway Program in 2005 by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation meant a large expenditure in transportation infrastructure. Despite the oppositions by the Metro Vancouver and several mayoral councils, the project went ahead to create the South Fraser Perimeter Road and the Port Mann Bridge, both which pass through major portions of Surrey. It has been criticized to be contradictory to not only Metro Vancouver's Sustainable Region Initiative, but also Surrey's Sustainability Charter. Studies have shown that {{with an increase in}} road capacity, generated traffic <b>increases,</b> <b>that</b> is traffic that is diverted (shifted in time and route) and induced travel (increased total motor vehicle travel).

25|$|Water {{privatisation}} in Jakarta {{began when}} the British water company Thames Water entered into {{an agreement with the}} son of then-President Suharto in 1993 to obtain a water concession. Under the influence of the French water company Suez, however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. The contracts foresaw water charge <b>increases</b> <b>that</b> would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 percent rate of return. However, only two months after the contracts were signed, the Indonesian rupiah massively lost in value due to the East Asian financial crisis, and President Suharto was toppled. The concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. In 2006 Suez sold half and Thames Water all its shares to Indonesian investors.|$|E
25|$|Recently {{there has}} been a large {{increase}} in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas. One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, oil, coal, and natural gas continued to grow and had <b>increases</b> <b>that</b> were much higher than the increase in renewable energy.
