5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them. There is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Critics have derided {{the novel}} for being {{derivative}} of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Some have accused Brooks of lifting the entire plot {{and many of}} his characters directly from Lord of the Rings; others have praised its execution <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> originality.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when {{used as a}} vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E

5|$|Polyphenols {{of several}} classes are {{widespread}} in medicinal plants; these substances likely fight infection and reduce grazing by herbivorous insects. They include hormone-mimicking phytoestrogens, and astringent tannins. In Ayurveda, the astringent rind of the pomegranate {{is used as}} a medicine, while polyphenol extracts from plant materials such as grape seeds are sold for their potential health benefits <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> evidence.|$|E
5|$|With the Italian {{victory at}} Tug Argan, the {{position}} of British forces in Somaliland was compromised, and colonial authorities were forced to initiate a naval evacuation of the garrison form Berbera. As a result, Italy was able to quickly secure British Somaliland, which proved a propaganda coup for Italy <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> strategic value to the territory.|$|E

5|$|Braille {{had always}} been a sickly child, and his {{condition}} worsened in adulthood. A persistent respiratory illness, long believed to be tuberculosis, dogged him, and by the age of forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a {{graphical}} controller interface in {{the standard}} (non-server) Mac OS X distribution, {{it is possible to}} set up an Xgrid controller via the command line tools xgridctl and xgrid. Once the Xgrid controller daemon is running, administration of the grid with Apple's Xgrid Admin tool is possible. Some applications, such as VisualHub, provided Xgrid controller capability through their user interfaces.|$|E
5|$|Humberto {{continued}} to intensify {{on the morning}} of the 23rd as the central dense overcast became well defined, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a clear eye feature. However, the intensification was slowed somewhat by the proximity of Iris to the west, whose outflow interfered with that of Humberto. Early on August 24, Humberto strengthened into a Category2 hurricane, finally forming a well-defined eye, as it slowed down and entered a Fujiwhara interaction with Iris. That afternoon, while still moving west-northwest, Humberto reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to ascertain {{how much of the}} Prayer Book is actually Cranmer's personal composition. Generations of liturgical scholars have been able to track down the sources that he used, including the Sarum Rite, writings from Hermann von Wied, and several Lutheran sources including Osiander and Justus Jonas. More problematic is determining how Cranmer worked on the book and with whom he worked. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge of who might have helped him, however, he is given the credit for the editorship and the overall structure of the book.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Cartier {{first brought}} cabbage to the Americas in 1541–42, {{and it was}} {{probably}} planted by the early English colonists, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> written evidence of its existence there until the mid-17th century. By the 18th century, it was commonly planted by both colonists and native American Indians. Cabbage seeds traveled to Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet, and were planted the same year on Norfolk Island. It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the Sydney Markets.|$|E

5|$|Since 1996, {{the alpine}} pika has been rated {{a species of}} least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it is widespread, with no known {{population}} decline. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> data relating to its current population state, it {{is thought to have}} a stable trend, with some isolated populations exhibiting some variation. It has been regionally red-listed in China and Mongolia as a species of least concern, and about 12% of its population in Mongolia is found in protected areas.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} depictions of Jesus at the Dura-Europos church are firmly dated to before 256. Thereafter, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> biblical references or historical records, {{a wide range of}} depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. As in other Early Christian art, {{the earliest}} depictions date to the late 2nd or early 3rd century, and surviving images are found especially in the Catacombs of Rome.|$|E

He {{was sentenced to death}} by hanging on June 26 of that year. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution to write a justification for his actions. The stay was granted, and the execution was rescheduled for July 7, 1826. Though Anna Beauchamp was questioned, a charge against her for being an accessory to the crime was dismissed.|$|E

30|$|Given {{the limited}} data {{available}} for CRC survivors, especially LS patients, we examined predictors for <b>the</b> HRQoL metrics, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> <b>of</b> group differences at the bivariate level. Exploratory regression results show limited predictors of HRQoL measures. For LS patients, treatment at a CCC is positively associated with higher HRQoL and an elevated CES-D score (indicating depressive symptoms) is associated with lower HRQoL. For sporadic CRC patients being married is positively associated with higher HRQoL and depressive symptoms (CES-D) is negatively associated with HRQoL. This pattern holds for nearly all subscales with minor variations (Supplemental tables available upon request).|$|R

5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> aerial reconnaissance, Liman von Sanders had fairly {{accurate}} {{knowledge on}} 17 September 1918, regarding the forces deployed against his Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies. He understood {{there to be}} five infantry divisions and a French detachment facing the Eighth Army with another two divisions facing the Seventh Army and two mounted divisions facing the Fourth Army. Liman von Sanders was not surprised by the strength and location of the attack. He shifted all his available reserves and reinforcements to the west, not to the east. The strategically vital coastal plain was the most strongly defended sector of the front line. Here Liman von Sanders deployed his most experienced infantry divisions supported by heavy artillery.|$|E
