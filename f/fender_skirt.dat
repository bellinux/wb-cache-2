2500|$|Torino added {{several new}} options and {{features}} for 1974. Gran Torino 2-doors now were available with [...] "opera windows", a popular option during the mid-1970s, while Brougham models had these {{as a standard}} feature. All 2-door Torinos had fixed rear windows unlike the 1972–73 models. The Torino was becoming more luxury oriented and new luxury features were available. These included a leather-wrapped steering wheel, split bench seat, an electric sunroof, and speed control with steering wheel controls. Gran Torino hardtops and sedans had a new rear <b>fender</b> <b>skirt</b> option, to give the Torino a longer, lower look. The trim was revised on 1974 models; moldings now ran on the rocker panels instead of the lower doors. Brougham and Sport models had an extra chrome molding that ran on the lower fender edge between the front wheelwell and bumper; this gave the appearance of bumper-to-bumper chrome. Squires had no lower body moldings. All 1974 Torinos featured the seat belt-interlock system, as mandated by the U.S. government. This short-lived safety system would be removed after the 1974 model year. The competition suspension was no longer offered, and the only suspension option was a revised heavy-duty suspension package. This option was available on all Torinos except the Elite, and included a larger front sway bar and heavy-duty front and rear springs. Heavy-duty shocks and a rear sway bar were included in this package on 2-door and 4-door sedan models only; station wagons did not include these features.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fender</b> <b>skirts</b> {{were often}} paired with whitewall tires. The {{extent of the}} skirt also varied, before the 1950s it was common {{for all but the}} very bottom of the rear tire to be covered, while by the 1960s <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> only covered some of the top of the tire, and were largely absent on cars other than top line models. For example, up until 1976, the Chevrolet Caprice, Oldsmobile 98, Buick Electra, Pontiac Bonneville and the Cadillac Fleetwood, DeVille and Calais models used <b>fender</b> <b>skirts.</b> The Cadillac Eldorado models sported <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> from 1971 thru 1974. Starting in 1977 only the Pontiac Bonneville {{retained}} the use of <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> on General Motors downsized cars. In 1980 the Oldsmobile returned the <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> to the 98 model. By 1985 <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> would disappear from all standard General Motors cars. In 1989, <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> were used again on the Cadillac front wheel drive Fleetwood models until 1993. In 1993, Cadillac again incorporated <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> into the design of the re-styled rear drive Fleetwood, this design would last until 1996. The General Motors EV1 had <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> later.|$|R
5000|$|First {{described}} as [...] "pants", {{they were used}} for the streamlining effect by Frank Lockhart on a 1928 Stutz land speed record attempt car. Factory production of <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> began with the 1932 Graham-Paige. Aesthetically streamlined designs were copied to mass-produced models. The innovations introduced by Amos Northup, such as the V'd radiators, <b>fender</b> <b>skirts,</b> and sloping beaver-tails, became common after 1933. However, by the 1970s, <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> began to disappear from mass market automobiles. <b>Fender</b> <b>skirts</b> remained for some time longer on a few cars, particularly large American luxury cars.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fender</b> <b>skirts</b> are {{implemented}} for both aesthetic and aerodynamic reasons. Rather than air flowing into and being {{trapped in the}} rear wheel well, it flows smoothly over the bodywork. They are generally detachable to allow for tire changes and installation of snow chains. Automakers have also experimented with front wheel <b>fender</b> <b>skirts,</b> as on the 1950-1954 Nash Rambler, but with success limited {{by the fact that}} the front wheels must pivot for steering, extending out from the side of the vehicle slightly. In GM parts accessories books, <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> are known as fender shields.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with all}} GM {{full-size}} lines, the DeVille was redesigned for 1971. The new GM full-size bodies, at 64.3 inches front shoulder room (62.1 inches on Cadillac) and 63.4 inches rear shoulder room (64.0 inches on Cadillac) {{set a record}} for interior width {{that would not be}} matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel-drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed squarish headlamps were set wider apart. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A Cadillac crest decorated the nose and new indicator lamps appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again housed in fender skirts. Tail lamps were of the same type as before but were no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. DeVilles were set apart visually by thin bright metal rocker panel steps and signature script on the front fenders bearing the series name. The bottoms of the rear fenders were decorated with a bright metal beauty panel that was wider than the rocker panel strips and blended into the molding running along the bottom of the <b>fender</b> <b>skirt.</b> The standard engine remained the 472, still rated at 375 SAE gross horsepower and [...] of torque.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, {{the limited}} {{production}} Volkswagen XL1 reintroduced <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> on modern cars.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 the Aero 2000 was shown, {{a smaller}} two-door car, it had several unique features, such as {{front and rear}} <b>fender</b> <b>skirts,</b> a kammback design, and a {{smoothed}} underbelly. Almost all of these features have been incorporated into modern hybrid car designs at some point, {{with the exception of}} front <b>fender</b> <b>skirts.</b> The Aero 2000 had a drag coefficient of 0.23, but had no engine so could not be driven.|$|R
25|$|<b>Fender</b> <b>skirts</b> {{are often}} made as {{extensions}} of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire wheel wells. Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the wheel well and assists in streamlining {{the body of the}} vehicle. <b>Fender</b> <b>skirts</b> are more commonly found on the rear wheel wells of a vehicle because the tires do not turn and the design is much simpler. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the first generation Honda Insight. Front <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> have the same effect on reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire sticking out from the body of the vehicle as turns are made.|$|R
50|$|Some cities, such as Los Angeles, have <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> on {{municipal}} buses {{for safety}} purposes, {{as they can}} prevent items in the road from slipping under the tires.|$|R
50|$|For 1975, the Eldorado {{was given}} {{rectangular}} headlamps, full rear wheel openings sans <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> and crisper lines {{which resulted in}} a much sleeker appearance reminiscent of the 1967-70 models.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fender</b> <b>skirts,</b> {{known in}} Australia and the United Kingdom as spats, are pieces of {{bodywork}} on the fender {{that cover the}} upper portions of the rear tires of an automobile.|$|R
50|$|In European {{automobile}} design, Citroën notably used <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> {{on nearly}} all models produced between 1950 and 1990, most {{prominently in the}} DS, 2CV, Ami, GS, SM, BX and CX.|$|R
25|$|The Mayans MC also ride Harley Davidson {{motorcycles}} (Panheads, Shovelheads and Evolutions). The {{biggest difference}} between their bikes and the Sons' lies in ape hanger bars, <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> and bikes of all colors.|$|R
50|$|For 1960, the Park Lane saw a minor styling update {{distinguished}} by new taillamps, rear <b>fender</b> <b>skirts,</b> 5 chrome accent bars {{ahead of the}} rear wheel openings, wide rocker panel moldings, {{and the addition of}} a padded dashboard.|$|R
50|$|As of 2015, {{the last}} mass-produced car with <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> was the 1999-2006 Honda Insight, {{although}} they are available for some new cars as aftermarket accessories (the Chrysler PT Cruiser, Volkswagen Beetle and Volkswagen Karmann Ghia being some examples).|$|R
25|$|The final {{generation}} of the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight coincided with its 50th anniversary in 1991. The added length, rear <b>fender</b> <b>skirts,</b> wide tail, low nose, and split-grille with wraparound headlights gave this generation Ninety-Eight a more distinctive appearance than its predecessor.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{equipment}} on these limited production cars came standard. The {{short list of}} options included exterior cosmetic touches such as <b>fender</b> <b>skirts,</b> gold ornamentation, and choice of roof treatments. Inside, available options were rear writing tables, foot rests, and TV/DVD combo.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the design}} of the larger [...] "senior" [...] Nash models, the compact Rambler's styling was rounded in form and also had an {{envelope}} body with <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> that also enclosed the front wheels. This design feature did not impair the car's cornering ability significantly.|$|R
50|$|It {{included}} <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> and {{a removable}} fiberglass top as standard equipment, with a fabric convertible top as a commonly specified option. The engine was Ford's proven 292-cubic-inch OHV 292 Y-block V8, which got 18MPG. The exhaust pipes exited through twin bumper guards {{bolted to the}} rear bumper.|$|R
5000|$|... 1978 - The {{dashboard}} {{is changed}} completely, dispensing with the steel-framed 1970-1977 design and adopting the 1973-1978 Mercury design, {{which has a}} plastic substructure. The body and all-other general design elements remain unchanged but for the base wheelcover design. The rear <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> though are modified to become remnant-only—much more of the rear wheels is exposed. A limited edition ...|$|R
50|$|For 1978, in move {{intended}} to cut weight and cost {{and also to}} refresh the interior, the steel-frame dashboard used since 1970 is replaced with the plastic one sourced from the Mercury Marquis. The rear <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> were redesigned, showing more of the wheel opening. Alongside the optional sliding glass sunroof, Lincoln introduced a fixed glass moonroof with an interior sunshade, a feature not offered since the 1955 Skyliner.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to more luxurious interior trimmings, the Grand Ville had distinctive chrome {{up front and}} taillight trim at rear to set it apart. For 1974 only, the Grand Ville had its own parking lights, which wrapped {{around the corner of}} the front fender. The car was often seen with deluxe appearance options, such as sport wheels and vinyl tops. Rear <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> were featured on the 1973 to 1975 models.|$|R
5000|$|American Motors {{commissioned}} Richard Arbib, {{a leading}} industrial {{designer of the}} 1950s, to develop a futuristic concept car. Built in four months, the Astra-Gnome represented the work product stylists to create [...] "new and exciting shapes, textures and colors in a functional car." [...] Arbib had the wheels and tires hidden behind full <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> to achieve [...] "a floating special quality" [...] and to suggest a spacecraft or hovercraft.|$|R
50|$|For 1934, Studebaker trimmed its model lineup and {{streamlined}} its vehicles. The company {{designed a}} new body, the Land Cruiser, which was offered on the Dictator, Commander and President. The Land Cruiser models were easily identified by their extreme streamlining features, unusual 4-piece rear window, trunk {{and the full}} <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> on {{the rear of the}} vehicle. The new Presidents were smaller and less impressive than their predecessors, though still fine automobiles.|$|R
50|$|The Drifter’s design drew a {{positive}} response from reviewers who liked the Indian Chief’s deeply valanced classic <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> {{as opposed to the}} more traditional motorcycle fender style. Rear air shock absorbers, original swingarm arrangement, and progressive front suspension made it a comfortable cruiser capable of covering great distances comfortably. Tire tubes were stock, as Kawasaki followed Cobra’s lead and used chromed spoke wheels to complete the nostalgic look it was seeking to recreate.|$|R
50|$|The {{body style}} was shared between the President and Commander series for 1936. From 1937-1940, {{the car was}} {{classified}} as the Commander Cruiser and President Cruiser. The Land Cruiser name officially returned in 1941 and 1942. In addition to offering its Land Cruisers in the Commander and President lines, for 1941 Studebaker introduced the ultra-luxurious Skyway Land Cruiser which featured a slightly curved single pane windshield, rear <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> and premium details and fabrics.|$|R
50|$|The Airflow, {{which was}} heavily {{influenced}} by streamlining design movement, was sleek and low compared to other cars on American roads. The car's grille work cascaded forward and downward forming a waterfall look where other makes featured fairly upright radiators. Headlights were semi-flush to areas immediate to the grille. The front fenders enclosed the running surface of the tire tread. In the rear, Airflows encased the rear wheels {{through the use of}} <b>fender</b> <b>skirts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} version was the 102DL3, entering production in 1992 and entering service by early 1993. The 102DL3 has large, block <b>fender</b> <b>skirts,</b> a rear-mounted radiator fan side-by-side with the intercooler fan, and air intake {{covered by a}} large grille, two piece engine door, small headlight/taillights, and a black roof cap. The seating capacity was 54 or 55 passengers, or 57-61 with the high-density configuration. The 102DL3 was renamed D4500 in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The Eldorado was {{substantially}} redesigned for 1971, growing {{two inches}} in length, six in wheelbase and featuring standard <b>fender</b> <b>skirts.</b> Door glass remained frameless, and the hardtop rear quarter windows were deleted, {{replaced by a}} fixed [...] "opera window" [...] in the widened [...] "C" [...] pillar. A convertible model rejoined the line-up. This 126.3 in wheelbase version Eldorado would run through 1978, receiving facelifts in 1973 and 1975. Sales in 1971 set a new record at 27,368.|$|R
5000|$|... 1971 {{brought a}} major {{restyling}} for the full-size Mercurys. The body wore more rounded, flowing styling with wider C-pillars and wraparound tail-lamps (on sedans). Other changes included <b>fender</b> <b>skirts</b> and {{the elimination of}} vent windows; all models now wore frameless window glass. A new option for all models a sunroof (which also mandated the selection of a vinyl roof). While slow sales led to the cancellation of the Marauder fastback and the convertible, Mercury revived the Brougham name as part of the Marquis and Colony Park lineup.|$|R
5000|$|The Achieva {{was first}} {{seen as a}} concept car at the 1991 Chicago Auto Show and was said to replace Oldsmobile's compact Calais models. The Calais and Achieva both share the same basic front wheel drive GM N-body {{architecture}} including identical wheelbase length. The Achieva started regular production for the 1992 model year. It was offered in four different trims: S and SL that were both available in two and four-door model, and the sporty SC and SCX coupe. The S as the standard model has a 120-horsepower 2.3-liter Quad OHC 4-cylinder. The SL uses the DOHC [...] Quad 4 engine that was made optional on the S model. A 160-horsepower 3.3 L V6 engine was optional for the SL. The SC coupe had a standard [...] high-output Quad 4 with 5-speed manual transmission or a 3 speed automatic with the 3.3 L V6 being an option. An interesting design feature for the time, exclusive to the Achieva sedan, was the presence of rear <b>fender</b> <b>skirts.</b> While still used at the time, they were mostly found on traditional large size cars, not compacts. The similar Buick Skylark sedan and coupe built on the same GM N-body platform also had rear <b>fender</b> <b>skirts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a {{cost cutting}} move, however, Ford Motor Company forced the Mark IV to {{increase}} parts commonailty with the Ford Thunderbird; while the roofline, doors, and inner body panels were shared, the Mark IV and Thunderbird still were given different outer body panels below the roofline and different interiors. In a major break from American luxury car tradition, {{the rear wheel}} openings of the Mark IV were designed {{at the same height}} as the front wheels (similar to the 1966-1970 Oldsmobile Toronado); its large fender flares precluded the use of <b>fender</b> <b>skirts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1956 the XK140 {{became the}} first Jaguar sports car to be offered with {{automatic}} transmission. As with the XK120, wire wheels and dual exhausts were options, and most XK140s imported into the United States had wire wheels. Cars with the standard disc wheels had spats (<b>fender</b> <b>skirts)</b> over the rear wheel opening. When leaving the factory it originally fitted either 6.00 × 16 inch crossply tyres or you could specify 185VR16 Pirelli Cinturato CA67 as a radial option on either 16 × 5K½ solid wheels or 16 × 5K (special equipment) wire wheels.|$|R
