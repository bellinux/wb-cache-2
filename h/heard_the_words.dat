Flora tells of seeing her uncle at 9.45 and she and Parker recreate what happened for Poirot. Bourne is summoned and questioned if she was the woman who Blunt saw and she confirms that she was going out to post a letter in the box by the gate.

500|$|The third studio album {{also sees}} {{the return of}} {{composer}} and multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion — who had played an integral role as the co-executive producer on West's previous studio album Late Registration — for the track [...] "Drunk and Hot Girls." [...] Kanye claimed that one day, while listening to [...] "Sing Swan Song" [...] by the German experimental-rock band Can, he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "drunk and hot girls" [...] rather than the actual [...] "drunky hot bowls" [...] lyrics. Rather than rap, West instead slowly sings along to the sinister song's dreary original melody with warbled vocals. Kanye features vocal harmony during the chorus with guest artist Mos Def, who just after his voice experiences a four-second audio delay, also delivers the song's reverb-filled bridge.|$|E
500|$|The {{black swan}} is {{represented}} in the toponymy of eastern Australia. Several anglicised versions of local Aboriginal-language place names referring to black swans are known. Examples include Dunedoo (Wiradjuri language) on the Talbragar River, Berrima (Tharawal or Gundungurra language) in the Southern Highlands, and Mulgoa (Gundungurra language) on the Nepean River, all in New South Wales; and Maroochydore on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast (Yuggera language: Muru-kutchi — meaning [...] "red bill", {{the name of the}} black swan). Maroochydore is from Murukutchi-dha, the place of the black swan. This name was given by Andrew Petrie in 1842, who had two Brisbane River (Yuggera) Aboriginal men with him from whom he presumably <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> The local name for the swan is Kuluin. Barwon Heads, Victoria, is near Lake Connewarre, through which the Barwon River flows {{on its way to the}} sea. The name Connewarre is the local aboriginal name for the black swan, which was found in large numbers on the lake.|$|E

500|$|... "Iceland" [...] was improvised in {{a single}} take. Smith was taken by a country that he {{described}} in 2008 as still inaccessible and [...] "totally unlike what it is now. Beer was against the law. You could only drink shit like pints of peach schnapps". It consists of a two-note piano figure and a banjo part, over which Smith played a tape recording he had made of the wind howling outside his bedroom window. According to guitarist Marc Riley, [...] "He [...] just said he needed a tune, something Dylanish, and we knocked around on the piano {{in the studio and}} came up with that. But we hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> until he suddenly did them." [...] The line [...] "Fall down flat in the Cafe Iol without a glance from the clientele" [...] describes an incident that had happened to Smith that morning. He had tripped in a nearby cafe and fallen across several tables. He was surprised by the lack of response from the other customers, who seemed to have dismissed him as just another drunk.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Life" [...] {{utilizes}} multi-tracked, interlocking vocals that harmonize with guest singer T-Pain's Auto-Tuned voice. The song's melody {{is based}} on sampled keyboards from P.Y.T. by Michael Jackson, with the tempo slightly decreased and the pitch raised to the point its sound resembles squealing shrieks. [...] "Barry Bonds" [...] is built on a moaning bass line and Gothic organ, while punctuated by wailing sampled from [...] "Long Red" [...] by Mountain. [...] "Drunk and Hot Girls" [...] exhibits a sluggish waltz pitched with the rhythm of an Eastern European drinking song. It contains a mix of dark orchestration and detuned electronics with elements of [...] "Sing Swan Song" [...] by German progressive rock band Can. West claimed that while listening to their song, he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "drunk and hot girls" [...] rather than the actual [...] "drunky hot bowls" [...] lyrics. Rather than rap, West and guest artist Mos Def sing along to the song's melody. Opening with a gradual, rising crescendo of symphonic strings, [...] "Flashing Lights" [...] emits synth twinklings before transforming into a moderately-paced, synth-driven beat. After the introduction, in which Mitchell's processed vocals repeat the titular hook four times, West raps the two verses, each one followed by the chorus sung by Dwele coupled with the hook. Following a break, the song enters a passage where its heavily manipulated hook echoes in and out before the coda draws the composition to a close. [...] "Stronger" [...] is built around a sample of [...] "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" [...] by Daft Punk.|$|E

It was during one of Buttrick's sermons that Buechner <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> that inspired his ordination: Buttrick described the inward coronation of Christ as {{taking place in the}} hearts of those who believe in him [...] "among confession, and tears, and great laughter."

The unit parked its tanks and armored personnel carriers around the station and awaited further orders. Somewhere within that period of time, a Russian communications officer <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> [...] "Welcome to Hell," [...] on his headset. Shortly after, Chechen fighters, hiding in the depot buildings, the post office, and the five-story building surrounding the station, opened devastating automatic and anti-tank weapons fire. The surviving Russian soldiers took cover inside the station, which the Chechens soon set ablaze. Russian commanding officer, Colonel Ivan Savin, radioed for help and artillery fire, which never came.|$|E

[...] The letters of the word [...] "Torah" [...] (...) have a numerical value of 611 (as [...] equals 400, [...] equals 6, [...] equals 200, and [...] equals 5).

2500|$|... "Thus then Chosroes {{secured the}} power. But at Martyropolis, Sittas and Hermogenes were in fear {{concerning}} the city, {{since they were}} utterly unable to defend it in its peril, and they sent certain men to the enemy, who came before the generals and spoke as follows: [...] "It has escaped your own notice that you are becoming wrongfully an obstacle to {{the king of the}} Persians and to the blessings of peace and to each state. For ambassadors sent from the emperor are even now present in order that they may go to the king of the Persians and there settle the differences and establish a treaty with him; but do you as quickly as possible remove from the land of the Romans and permit the ambassadors to act in the manner which will be of advantage to both peoples. For we are ready also to give as hostages men of repute concerning these very things, to prove that they will be actually accomplished at no distant date." [...] Such were the words of the ambassadors of the Romans. It happened also that a messenger came to them from the palace, who brought them word that Cabades had died and that Chosroes, son of Cabades, had become king over the Persians, and that in this way the situation had become unsettled. And {{as a result of this}} the generals <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the Romans gladly, since they feared also the attack of the Huns. The Romans therefore straightway gave as hostages Martinus and one of the body-guards of Sittas, Senecius by name; so the Persians broke up the siege and made their departure promptly.|$|E

Who shall dwell in Your holy mountain? — He who (1) walks uprightly, and (2) works righteousness, and (3) speaks truth in his heart; who (4) has no slander upon his tongue, (5) nor does evil to his fellow, (6) nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor, (7) in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but (8) he honors them who fear the Lord, (9) he swears to his own hurt and changes not, (10) he puts not out his money on interest, (11) nor takes a bribe against the innocent."
