5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of Nirvana {{frontman}} Kurt Cobain in April 1994, drummer Dave Grohl entered a state of depression, and {{found it difficult to}} both listen to music and play instruments. He was uncertain of what to do next, even considering abandoning his musical career despite a few invitations by bands such as Danzig or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to become their drummer, because [...] "it would just remind me of being in Nirvana; every time I sat down at a drum set, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of that." ...|$|E

She has two siblings, Mónica, an actress, and Eduardo. She also has a paternal half-sister, Salma. She was raised as a Roman Catholic. Cruz grew up in Alcobendas, and spent long hours at her grandmother's apartment. She says she had a happy childhood. Cruz remembers [...] "playing with some friends and being aware that I was acting as I was playing with them. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of a character and pretend to be someone else." ...|$|E

500|$|At the university, {{he decided}} to take acting classes and took up theatre as his minor. After {{completing}} his studies and returning to Mumbai in 2007, Singh worked for a few years in advertising as a copywriter, with agencies like O and J. Walter Thompson. He then worked as an assistant director, but left it to pursue acting. He then decided to send his portfolio to directors. [...] He would go for all kinds of auditions, but did not get any good opportunities, while only getting calls for minor roles: [...] "Everything was so bleak. It was very frustrating. There were times <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> whether I was doing the right thing or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of several years, Grant's {{political}} opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market-based philosophies. Alan Grant commented on the philosophical pattern the character's transformation took for a 1997 interview: [...] "Although I haven’t read them in chronological order <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it would be quite easy to see the parallel between Anarky’s thought processes and my own thought processes." [...] By 1997 he had settled on the philosophy of Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace. At approximately the same time he was when given the opportunity to write an Anarky mini-series, and so decided to revamp the character accordingly. Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue's publication. [...] "I felt he was the perfect character" [...] to express Neo-Tech philosophy, Grant explained, [...] "because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness". This new characterization was later carried on in the 1999 Anarky ongoing series.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think,</b> [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is another}} matter," [...] he confessed. [...] "You {{come from a}} world of which I know nothing. All I {{can say is that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>think</b> of you--as {{something}} different." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carter often {{recruited}} young accompanists for {{performances and}} recordings, insisting that she [...] "learned {{a lot from}} these young players, because they're raw and {{they come up with}} things that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>think</b> about doing." ...|$|R

500|$|Bandslam {{was bought}} by a studio back in 2004, but in late January 2007, Walden Media and Summit Entertainment {{announced}} that they would co-finance Bandslam, co-written by Todd Graff and Josh A. Cagan and directed by Graff. Graff was hired to direct in early March 2007 and rewrote the screenplay. Before filming, they had two weeks of music rehearsals. The actors and actresses were designated to play their instruments. Donowho and Michalka had extensive experience with the drums and guitar, respectively, so {{they were used to}} their instruments, but Lisa Chung, Scott Porter and Vanessa Hudgens were not. Hudgens told MTV News she didn't expect there to be as much music, and [...] "they are like, 'We are going to have two weeks of music rehearsals,' and I was like, 'What?' But it was really cool. It's definitely not the kind of music I do normally." [...] Principal photography began on February 9, 2008 in Austin, Texas. Although the film is set in New Jersey, Graff felt strongly {{that it was important to}} shoot in a place with a wide array of great live music to choose from. [...] "I'm a big believer in local scenes," [...] he says. [...] "I think it's the lifeblood of music. Austin is renowned as a music town, and rightly so. They have a ton of really great bands just trying to get their music out there. So, it's great we had an opportunity to use several unsigned local Texas bands." [...] In an interview with Los Angeles Times, director Todd Graff admitted there were cultural incongruities underlying the film. [...] "I know, it's demented. Every once in a while on set <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> to myself, 'I can't believe we got away with this'. I always thought if it only sent one kid to listen to a Velvet Underground record, it would be worth it to me." [...] All of the vocals were filmed live by each of the singing cast members, as mentioned by director Graff. One of the requirements for the film was that all actors had to be able to provide their own vocals. Because Aly Michalka was on tour with her sister AJ Michalka and Miley Cyrus, she did not arrive in Austin until midway through rehearsals. Conveniently, the tour's last stop was in Austin, where rehearsal and filming for the movie took place. All of the instruments and singing in the movie were recorded by the actors, with the exception of the guitar parts of Vanessa Hudgens and Scott Porter, as well as Lisa Chung's piano parts. Although Hudgens and Porter learned how to play their songs, they were dubbed by guitarists Jason Mozersky and JW Wright.|$|E

They're marquee players and, apart from everything else that happens with them, they are extremely beneficial for all West Australians." ...|$|E
2500|$|People think I asked Ellar, [...] "What {{did you do}} {{in school}} the other day? Let's make a scene about that!" [...] That never happened. The time we spent {{together}} was me just gauging where he was at in his life—what his concerns were {{and what he was}} doing. Then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think,</b> maybe we could move the camping trip up, and we can do this or that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] exclaimed Edna. [...] "You can {{put that}} idea {{out of your}} head instantly. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> of going away and leaving you here. If the captain had wanted you to stay, he would have said so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is so much}} {{a matter}} of course," [...] rejoined Charlie, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> of {{referring}} to it while conversing with an intelligent man. By the way--which name {{would you like to be}} called, by Ralph or Buck?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care for}} that," [...] replied the girl. [...] "I told {{you when we}} were first engaged that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>think</b> of {{anything}} that had gone before that; and then when <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not listen to a word from you, that day, I broke my promise." ...|$|R
2500|$|Levy {{has said}} that his views on Israel's {{policies}} toward the Palestinians developed only after joining Haaretz. [...] "When I first started covering the West Bank for Haaretz, I was young and brainwashed," [...] {{he said in an}} interview. [...] "I would see settlers cutting down olive trees and soldiers mistreating Palestinian women at the checkpoints, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think,</b> 'These are exceptions, not part of government policy.' It {{took me a long time}} to see that these were not exceptions – they were the substance of government policy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Media personalities {{have weighed}} in on the confrontations. During the standoff, Bundy was interviewed (via remote link) by {{television}} host Sean Hannity. Hannity stated that some fear events could wind up mirroring the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge and said, [...] "This is public land, and it's not being used, in my mind, and I'm not a rancher, (but) <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> the federal government might be thankful because you're cutting the lawn for free, and they're charging huge amounts of money, right, to let your cattle graze there with these fees". In contrast, a comparison of BLM grazing fees with private land market prices demonstrated the Bundy's are getting a 93% discount by grazing on BLM land.|$|E
2500|$|In the May 11, 2016 Toronto Star {{article by}} Jacques Gallant cited above, public {{relations}} expert Martin Waxman {{spoke of a}} [...] "damning indictment" [...] of the CBC which included the following comment. [...] "Yes, they did their inquiry, but if I were the CBC, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> strongly about {{what is wrong with}} the culture and what they can do to repair it," [...] he said. [...] The Star also quoted employment lawyer Howard Levitt stating that [...] "harassment has not been fully addressed at the CBC" [...] in his estimation. Levitt called the Rubin report a [...] "whitewash" [...] and reiterated his suggestion that a federal commission should conduct a more detailed enquiry into workplace issues at the public broadcaster.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{influence}} on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke highly praise to Richard Pryor, [...] "What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude. The fact that someone was able to open themselves wide-open like that. It's so hard to talk {{in front of people}} or to open yourself up to your closest friends. But to open yourself up for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot my car. And nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand. And when I was going through this thing this year, that is the example <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> to myself that gave me the courage to just go back on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Martin Bashir {{interview}}ed Diana for the BBC {{current affairs}} show Panorama. [...] The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995. In reference to {{her relationship with}} Hewitt, the Princess said to Bashir, [...] "Yes, I adored him. Yes, I {{was in love with}} him. But I was very let down [...]" [...] Referring to her husband's affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, she said, [...] "Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded." [...] Of herself, she said, [...] "I'd like to be a queen of people's hearts." [...] On the Prince's suitability for kingship, she stated, [...] "Because I know the character <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that the top job, as I call it, would bring enormous limitations to him, and I don't know whether he could adapt to that." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{delegation}} of American nuns met {{for almost an}} hour with Francis. [...] "He met with them himself {{for almost an hour}}, and that's an extravagant amount of papal time," [...] said Eileen Burke-Sullivan, a theologian, consultant and vice provost for mission and ministry at Creighton University, a Jesuit institution. [...] "It's about as close to an apology, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think,</b> as the Catholic Church is officially going to render." [...] Laurie Goodstein of The New York Times said that Francis's handling of the matter appeared to reflect that [...] "he is less interested in having the church police doctrinal boundaries than in demonstrating mercy and love for the poor and vulnerable – the very work that most of the women's religious orders under investigation have long been engaged in." [...] Cardinal Franc Rode, who initiated the investigation, had been replaced by Cardinal Joao Braz de Aviz of Brazil.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{know of a}} few," [...] he said, [...] "who <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>would</b> come in, {{and there}} is one to whom <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have to pay a}} small salary." ...|$|R

I {{remained}} on the roof for eight weeks, always getting another two week extension when Willie Hammerstein would say to me after the Monday matinee, 'you're good for two weeks more'... Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175. [...] "'What's he carrying?', Scribner asked Shea. 'Himself, a horse, and a man', answered Shea." [...] Scribner replied, [...] "'Give him eight weeks at $250'".|$|E
2500|$|All My Children's {{wardrobe}} director, David R. Zyla, {{collaborated with}} Braun {{in creating the}} wardrobe for the Reese Williams character. The two had worked together before when Braun portrayed Carly Corinthos on General Hospital. While bringing their ideas together, they tried {{to make sure they}} did not make Reese into too much of a cliché. [...] "I like that she goes from really strong pants with a buttoned shirt and tie, which is so on trend but is also just great style, to wearing dresses," [...] Braun said. Reese's wardrobe goes {{back and forth between the}} two different types of style which allows Braun and Zyla to play with her fashion. [...] "She's an architect, so to me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> she has a real eye for lines," [...] said Braun. [...] "She appreciates form and beauty, and the look we came up with I would describe as 'streamlined with a flair'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sultan Hamid {{apparently}} {{considered the}} under evaluation presented to him of 900,000 as exaggeration. The German {{chief of staff}} of the Ottoman Third Army, Colonel Felix Guse, complained that [...] "The Turks knew only poorly their country, on top of that the possibility of getting reliable statistical figures was out of the question. Fa'iz El-Ghusein, the Kaimakam of Kharpout, wrote in his book, that according to the Ottoman official statistics there were about 1.9 million Armenian's in the Ottoman Empire. Another indication that other statistics might have existed is that Polybius in his book published in 1919, refer to a said “Ottoman Official Census of 1910.” The Turkish historian Dr. Secil Akgun, claimed: “The Ottomans do not have a definite number. That is, we have in our hands contradictory numbers regarding the Armenian population within the borders of the Ottoman Empire. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that Basmacıyan gives the most accurate number. This is to be between two and three million.” ...|$|E
