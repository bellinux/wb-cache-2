5|$|At {{a public}} meeting in Alresford on 14 May, Onslow {{reported}} that subscriptions to the defence fund were already pouring in, and that invitations {{to visit and}} speak had been received from many towns.

The campaign <b>drew</b> <b>in</b> some high-level supporters, among whom was George Hammond Whalley, a controversial anti-Catholic who was MP for Peterborough. He and Onslow were sometimes incautious in their speeches; after a meeting in St James's Hall, London, on 11 December 1872, each made specific charges against the Attorney General and the Government of trying to pervert the course of justice. They were both fined £100 for contempt of court.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the island {{became part of the}} front line for invasion and was heavily fortified. Along with other coastal resorts, the island <b>drew</b> <b>in</b> evacuees from London, though as the war progressed, these were moved to safer settlements further inland. 2000 troops were stationed on the island to guard against invasion. A battery of 4.7 inch guns was installed along the beach along with a Battery Observation post and a number of searchlights and pillboxes. Several of these installations survived and can still be seen along the south coast of the island, one of which has been converted into a cafe. After the war, the island suffered from severe winter weather in 1947 which destroyed much of the oyster fishery, and from the flooding of 1953, where numerous beach huts were swept out to sea.|$|E
