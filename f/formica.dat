5|$|Myrmecia {{was first}} {{established}} by Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius in his 1804 publication Systema Piezatorum, in which seven species from the genus <b>Formica</b> were placed into the genus {{along with the}} description of four new species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Formica</b> polyctena, {{among other}} ant species, {{constructs}} nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that {{aids in the}} development of larvae. The ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials.|$|E
5|$|The banded sugar ant {{was first}} {{described}} by German entomologist Wilhelm Ferdinand Erichson, who named it <b>Formica</b> consobrina in 1842. The holotype specimen is a queen collected from Tasmania, {{which is now}} housed in the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. <b>Formica</b> consobrina was later moved to the genus Camponotus as Camponotus consobrinus, by entomologist Julius Roger in 1863. In 1933, American entomologist William Morton Wheeler described some subspecies and variants of the banded sugar ant. These subspecies were C. consobrinus lividipes and C. consobrinus nigriceps, while the variants were C. consobrinus var. obniger and C. consobrinus var. perthianus. Some of these classifications were short-lived; C. consobrinus nigriceps was later revived as a full species in 1934 as C. nigriceps, while C. consobrinus lividipes was synonymised with C. consobrinus. C. consobrinus lividipes {{was treated as a}} subspecies for C. nigriceps in 1985, now known as C. nigriceps lividipes. In 1996 C. consobrinus perthianus was synonymised with C. nigriceps, and C. consobrinus var. obniger was synonymised with C. consobrinus.|$|E

Due to his short stature, dynamic abilities and pace, Giovinco acquired the nickname <b>formica</b> atomica ("atomic ant", after the eponymous Hanna-Barbera character) in his youth. In 2015, he was {{named one of the}} 100 best footballers in the world by The Guardian, FourFourTwo, and L'Équipe.|$|E
5|$|In volume 1 of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus (1758) {{described}} seventeen {{species of}} ants, {{all of which}} he placed in the single genus <b>Formica.</b> Within a few decades additional genera had been recognized, and this trend continued in the ensuing years, together {{with the development of}} a more complex hierarchical classification in which genera were apportioned among subfamilies and tribes. The ant species described by Linnaeus are now dispersed in eleven different genera, belonging to four subfamilies.|$|E
5|$|The genus Iridomyrmex {{was first}} {{described}} by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862, {{but it had}} no designated type species until 1903. By then, the type species was designated as <b>Formica</b> detecta, a synonym of Iridomyrmex purpureus. The genus {{was placed in the}} subfamily Dolichoderinae in 1878, the same year the subfamily was established. Since the establishment of the genus, it suffered taxonomic misunderstanding due to the gradual development of unrelated ants being designated into the genus by early researchers who failed to identify easily recognisable features that would make them distinct from the genus Iridomyrmex.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ant {{are known to}} capture {{termites}} {{to use as a}} fresh food source later on, rather than killing them. For example, <b>Formica</b> nigra captures termites, and those who try to escape are immediately seized and driven underground. Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs. Ants such as Megaponera analis attack the outside the mounds and Dorylinae ants attack underground. Despite this, some termites and ants can coexist peacefully. Some species of termite, including Nasutitermes corniger, form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species. The earliest known association between Azteca ants and Nasutitermes termites date back to the Oligocene to Miocene period.|$|E
5|$|The meat ant {{was first}} {{described}} in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of Hymenopterous Insects in the Collection of the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name <b>Formica</b> purpurea from a holotype worker ant he collected in Melbourne, Victoria. The type material is currently {{housed in the}} Natural History Museum, London. In 1862, Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr erected the genus Iridomyrmex, and reclassified the meat ant {{as a member of}} Iridomyrmex rather than the genus <b>Formica.</b> The ant was named Iridomyrmex purpurea in 1862; however, Mayr renamed the ant as Iridomyrmex purpureus one year after. I. purpureus was later classified as a synonym of Iridomyrmex detectus, and this taxon was designated as the type species of Iridomyrmex in 1903. In 1993, I. detectus was synonymised with I. purpureus and grouped into the I. purpureus species complex. I. detectus was described as a separate species by Smith the same year as I. purpureus from two syntype queens he collected from the Hunter River in New South Wales. Although the name I. purpureus was used by many authors, Karl Wilhelm von Dalla Torre reused I. detectus and this was adopted by several authors, replacing I. purpureus. By the 1960s, however, I. purpureus once again became preferred over I. detectus. While the two names were described in the same year and publication, the name I. purpureus is the valid name for the species in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Entomologist B.T. Lowne {{was the first person to}} revise I. purpureus and I. detectus, and he synonymised the two species.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the present}} classification, Myrmecia {{is the only}} extant genus in the tribe Myrmeciini, {{subfamily}} Myrmeciinae. It {{is a member of}} the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera. The type species for the genus is M. gulosa, discovered by Joseph Banks in 1770 during his expedition with James Cook on the HMS Endeavour. M. gulosa is among the earliest Australian insects to be described, and the specimen Banks collected is housed in the Joseph Banks Collection in the Natural History Museum in London. M. gulosa was described by Fabricius in 1775 under the name <b>Formica</b> gulosa and later designated as the type species of Myrmecia in 1840.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at <b>formica</b> countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E
5|$|Several {{synonyms}} {{have either}} been {{classified as a}} separate species from the meat ant or even a subspecies. Iridomyrmex purpureus sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus were classified as subspecies in 1974, previously being recognised as two species. I. detectus castrae was originally described as {{a variant of the}} meat ant in 1925 (as I. d. var. castrae), but the taxon was reclassified as a subspecies in 1985; subsequently, a 1993 revision reclassified I. p. sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus at species level while I. d. castrae was synonymised, based on morphological examinations of collected material. Camponotus horni, <b>Formica</b> smithii and Liometopum aeneum were described as three distinct species in three different ant genera, but these classifications were short-lived, as scientists discovered that these taxa were all identical, and subsequently synonymised them with the meat ant. Camponotus horni was described by English entomologist William Forsell Kirby in 1896 from worker and queen syntypes he collected at Palm Creek in the Northern Territory. In 1930, Australian entomologist John S. Clark reviewed these specimens and synonymised the taxon with the meat ant. However, the queen was later found to be distinct from the workers and C. horni was redescribed as a species. The information provided by Clark makes it sufficient to retain the validity of the name, making Clark the new author of C. horni. Due to the uncertain taxonomic status of Clark's C. horni, a proposal to rename the species cannot be carried through. Clark's C. horni is currently a junior homonym for Kirby's C. horni.|$|E

25|$|The {{invertebrate}} fauna {{is poorly}} studied. There are between 2475 and 2600 identified species, including 1703 insects, but their actual number {{is estimated to}} be 6500–7000. The main hotspots are Rila Monastery Forest Reserve, the area around the Fish Lakes to the east and the Kalin reservoir, as well as the areas around the river Radovichka and Bukovo bardo. There are 96 rare, 85 endemic and 146 relict species; 116 are included in worldwide or European lists of endangered animals. Some of the endangered species include beetles: Calosoma sycophanta, Carabus intricatus, Morimus funereus; net-winged insects: Libelloides macaronius; ants: <b>Formica</b> lugubris, <b>Formica</b> pratensis, <b>Formica</b> rufa; butterflies: Parnassius apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne, Euphydryas aurinia, Polyommatus eroides, Apatura iris, Carterocephalus palaemon, Colias caucasica, Erebia rhodopensis, Charissa obscurata, Limenitis populi, Melitaea trivia, Zerynthia polyxena, etc.|$|E

25|$|In nature, it {{is found}} in most ants. The wood ants from the genus <b>Formica</b> can spray formic acid on their preys or to defend the nest. It is also known from the trichomes of {{stinging}} nettle (Urtica dioica). Formic acid is a naturally occurring component of the atmosphere due primarily to forest emissions.|$|E
25|$|C. maxillosus has {{abdominal}} defensive glands used to secrete {{a mixture}} of substances that act as an irritant to predators. These glands are located beneath the abdominal tergites. When threatened or disturbed, the beetle revolves its abdomen and touches abdominal tip to offender to wipe the glands. Ants (<b>Formica</b> exsectoides) are a common offender and have portrayed that this defense takes place. The ants are shown to be repelled by the four major components of secretion (isoamyl acetate, iridodial, E-8-oxocitronellyl acetate, and dihydroneptalactone). Dihydroneptalactone is the main principal ingredient of chemical defense.|$|E
25|$|Phenolics or phenol {{formaldehyde}} (PF) – high modulus, relatively heat resistant, and excellent fire resistant polymer. Used for insulating parts in electrical fixtures, paper laminated products (e.g. <b>Formica),</b> thermally insulation foams. It is a thermosetting plastic, with the familiar trade name Bakelite, {{that can be}} molded by heat and pressure when mixed with a filler-like wood flour or can be cast in its unfilled liquid form or cast as foam (e.g. Oasis). Problems include the probability of moldings naturally being dark colors (red, green, brown), and as thermoset {{it is difficult to}} recycle.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{collective}} defences in some eusocial taxa {{also shows that}} social immunity may also not always be adaptive (due to life history costs or ineffectiveness against a particular parasite's infective strategy), and that living in a group does not necessitate the expression of any particular suite of social immunity mechanisms. For example, worker termites (Zootermopsiss angusticollis) do not discriminate between infected and uninfected conspecifics, pharaoh ant colonies (Monomorium pharaonis) choose to move into infected nests over uninfected ones and queen wood ants (<b>Formica</b> paralugubris) are not repelled but actually attracted to habitats contaminated with entamopathogenic fungi.|$|E
25|$|Megaponera is a genus of ponerine ant first {{defined by}} Gustav Mayr in 1862 for <b>Formica</b> analis (Latreille, 1802), the sole species {{belonging}} to the genus to date. In 1994 William L. Brown, Jr. synonymised the genus under Pachycondyla even though he lacked phylogenetic justification, thereby changing the name from Megaponera foetens to Pachycondyla analis. In 2014 Schmidt and Shattuck revived Megaponera back to full genus status due to both molecular and morphological evidence. Since foetens was just a specific epithet incorrectly used throughout the literature the new name for the species as of June 2014 is Megaponera analis.|$|E

25|$|As {{previously}} {{suggested by}} both chairman Zamparini {{and general manager}} Lo Monaco, who publicly announced their intention to sign at least one striker, a left back/left winger and a defender, Palermo decided to actively change the roster in the winter transfer window. The first signing, already announced in December, regarded Palermo-born experienced defender Salvatore Aronica, who joined from Napoli, in the same days the club completed the permanent sale of Nicolás Bertolo to Mexican club Cruz Azul. Another signing, Brazilian midfielder Anselmo, came then into effect as a co-ownership bid, in exchange for Eros Pisano, {{who moved to the}} other direction in another co-ownership deal. Days later, Palermo also announced the loan signing of Andrea Dossena from Napoli in an attempt to replace a vacancy created already in the summer by the departure of Federico Balzaretti to Roma. One more loan move was announced on 23 January, this being the signing of attacking midfielder Mauro <b>Formica</b> from English side Blackburn Rovers.

25|$|Lower {{down the}} dining rooms were fitted {{out with the}} {{intention}} that the rooms would be visual equivalents of the excellent food served within them. The Chambord dining room was decorated by Mrs. Darbois-Gaudin in gold anodized aluminium, with monochrome chairs in red, orange and cream. The dome, painted black, contained an array of recessed spot-lights, and sat within a circular band of translucent, fluorescent-lit panels, all on a truncated rotunda of gold aluminium. Around all four walls of the room Jean Mandaroux's continuous mural, painted on 17 lacquered aluminium sheets, was entitled Les plaisirs de la vie: The Pleasures of Life. Less sumptuous in design, the Versailles dining room was done by Marc Simon in tones of green, white and grey. The walls were produced from Polyrey and <b>Formica</b> with a decoupaged gold leaf abstract pattern. Only the forward wall held a mural done in 14 engraved glass panels by Max Ingrand, {{as well as two}} tapestries, Les amoureux du printemps by Marc Saint-Saëns, and Paysage provençal by Auvigné.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the other ant species, worker policing in the ant <b>Formica</b> fusca [...] appears to incorporate nestmate recognition {{in addition to the}} queen hydrocarbons. Workers displayed higher levels of aggression toward non-nest mates and also removed some queen-laid eggs. Thus, queen hydrocarbons were not the only contributor to discrimination of the eggs.|$|E
500|$|The black-headed sugar ant was {{described}} from a holotype worker by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his 1858 publication Catalogue of the hymenopterous insects {{in the collection}} of the British Museum. Part VI. Formicidae, and was originally placed in the genus <b>Formica.</b> Some years later, the species was assigned to the genus Camponotus by German entomologist Julius Roger. The specific name, nigriceps, is a combination of nigri, which derives from the Latin word nigra, meaning [...] "black", and ceps, which is derived from the Greek word cephalē, meaning [...] "head". This references the distinctive black head of the ant.|$|E
500|$|The word ant and its chiefly dialectal form emmet {{come from}} , [...] of Middle English, which come from [...] of Old English, {{and these are}} all related to the dialectal Dutch [...] and the Old High German , from which comes the modern German [...] All of these words come from West Germanic *, and the {{original}} {{meaning of the word}} was [...] "the biter" [...] (from Proto-Germanic *, [...] "off, away" [...] + * [...] "cut"). The family name Formicidae is derived from the Latin [...] ("ant") from which the words in other Romance languages, such as the Portuguese , Italian , Spanish , Romanian , and French [...] are derived. It has been hypothesised that a Proto-Indo-European word *morwi- was used, cf. Sanskrit vamrah, Latin <b>formīca,</b> Greek μύρμηξ mýrmēx, Old Church Slavonic mraviji, Old Irish moirb, Old Norse maurr, Dutch mier.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} epithet of {{the meat}} ant, purpureus, derives from Latin, in which it means [...] "purple", [...] "purple-coloured" [...] or [...] "dark-red", referencing the coloured appearance of the ant. In classical Latin, purpureus primarily translated to [...] "dyed purple", while the word purpura, used by Smith for the meat ant (<b>Formica</b> purpura), translates to [...] "purpled-dyed cloth". The generic name, Iridomyrmex, translates to [...] "rainbow ants" [...] from Ancient Greek, another reference which points to its appearance; this, in particular, is due to its blue-green iridescence colour. It is a compound of two Ancient Greek words–irido, meaning [...] "rainbow", and myrmex, that means [...] "ant". The ant {{is commonly known as}} the meat ant because of its habit of stripping the meat off dead vertebrates. Alternative names include the gravel ant, Greenslade's meat ant, meat-eater ant, mound ant, or southern meat ant. The name [...] "southern meat ant" [...] is due to its extreme abundance in the southern regions of Australia.|$|E

[...] Black Zag X from 1969, {{in the collection of}} the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist's all-black assemblages incorporating the plastic, <b>Formica.</b> [...] In the fall of 1969, she was commissioned by Princeton University to create her first outdoor sculpture. After completion of her first outdoor sculptures, Nevelson stated: [...] "Remember, I was in my early seventies when I came into monumental outdoor sculpture... I had been through the enclosures of wood. I had been through the shadows. I had been through the enclosures and come out into the open." [...] Nevelson also praised new materials like plexiglas and cor-ten steel, which she described as a [...] "blessing". She embraced the idea of her works being able to withstand climate change and the freedom in moving beyond limitations in size. These public artworks were created by the Lippincott Foundry. Nevelson's public art commissions were a monetary success, but art historian Brooke Kamin Rapaport states that these pieces were not Nevelson's strongest works, and that Nevelson's [...] "intuitive gesture" [...] is not evident in the large steel works.|$|E
500|$|The TVA {{campaign}} had put Carroll {{squarely in the}} public eye in McCracken County, and in 1962, {{he was elected to the}} first of five consecutive terms representing the county in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was chosen Speaker of the House from 1968 through 1970. In the 100-member House of Representatives, it was not uncommon for lobbyists to roam the floor freely, for members to bring their lunches to their desks, or for them to bring their friends and family members onto the floor during debate. Determined to bring a higher degree of decorum to the chamber's proceedings, Carroll opened the 1968 legislative session with a single, powerful whack of his gavel. The gavel shattered, stunning the legislators. Carroll subsequently barred outsiders from the floor during debate and forbade eating in the chamber. Carroll shattered three more gavels during the legislative session – he was finally given a sturdier one made of solid oak and <b>formica</b> – but he brought order to the chamber's proceedings. At the end of the session, a member of the opposing party declared from the floor [...] "The decorum of this House has improved 100 percent... I must compliment the present Speaker of this House for ... eliminating the abominable practices. Today every member has a right to speak ... without fear of interruption and catcalls or being shouted down." [...] The legislator's compliment was followed by a standing ovation for Carroll.|$|E
2500|$|Polyergus {{workers will}} emerge from their nest (a mixed nest where <b>Formica</b> workers are already enslaved) and forage for a {{suitable}} raid target. If one is found, the scouts {{will return to}} the nest, rally the other Polyergus, and head out in a raiding column. If it was a <b>Formica</b> nest, the Polyergus incite a [...] "panic-flee" [...] response from the <b>Formica</b> by releasing formic acid and take the <b>Formica</b> pupae back to their nest to be slaves. Occasionally, a new queen will embark on a raiding column with the other Polyergus. She will then, after mating, leave the column and forage for a suitable <b>Formica</b> nest. Howard Topoff did a considerable amount of work in evaluating how the queen then takes over the colony. After finding a <b>Formica</b> nest, she finds an entrance and is immediately attacked by <b>Formica</b> worker. The queen responds by biting with her sharp mandibles and releasing a pheromone from her enlarged Dufour's gland that, unlike many other parasitic ants, has a pacifying effect. The queen quickly searches for and locates the <b>Formica</b> queen and, with her adapted mandibles, proceeds to bite and lick various parts the <b>Formica</b> queen for an average of 25 minutes. [...] "Within seconds of the host queens death, the nest undergoes a most remarkable transformation". The <b>Formica</b> workers cease to be aggressive to the intruder and start to groom the Polyergus queen as if it were their own. The takeover now complete, the Polyergus queen gains not only a nest, but a worker caste as well. She then lays her eggs and the cycle continues.|$|E
2500|$|Polyergus breviceps is {{a species}} of ant which is endemic to the United States. It is a social {{parasite}} of other ants, namely of <b>Formica</b> gnava but also of <b>Formica</b> occulta and <b>Formica</b> argentea. Polyergus is an inquiline parasite, having lost its ability {{to take care of}} its young and themselves. [...] "The workers do not forage for food, feed the young or the queen, or even clean up their own nest". In order to survive, Polyergus workers raid <b>Formica</b> nests in order to steal the pupae which once hatched, become workers of the mixed nest. This sort of relationship is not unique, of the approximately 8,800 species of ants, at least 200 have evolved some form of symbiotic relationship with one another. What makes Polyergus special is the way a newly mated queen can, all by herself, take over a <b>Formica</b> nest and start a new colony.|$|E
2500|$|Topoff and Ellen Zimmerli {{also did}} {{experiments}} {{to prove that}} the Polyergus queen [...] "tricks" [...] the <b>Formica</b> colony by obtaining chemicals from the <b>Formica</b> queen in the process of killing her. In one test, the <b>Formica</b> queen was killed (by flash freezing then thawing) prior to Polyergus contact. Even though it was already dead, the Polyergus queen bit, stabbed, and licked the queen just as if it were alive: and the Polyergus was consequently accepted by the colony. Another test showed that if no <b>Formica</b> queen was present, then Polyergus had little chance of a successful takeover. Clearly, the <b>Formica</b> queen is providing some sort of chemical(s) to the Polyergus queen, however unintentionally. That takeover can occur even if the host queen is dead, but not if she is not present, proves that chemical absorption is important. The Polyergus queen needs only kill one host queen to be accepted. If the colony was polygynistic, the Polyergus queen can take her time finding the other queens. [...] "Hour by hour, day by day, she methodically locates and kills every <b>Formica</b> queen, sometimes taking several weeks to clear out all remnants of opposition".|$|E
2500|$|... "Any {{hypothesis}} {{explaining the}} evolution of slavery in Polyergus must account both for the origin of group raiding with brood capture, and for non-independent colony foundation by queens". Topoff gives an adequate hypothesis to {{the evolution of}} Polyergus by integrating three processes: queen takeover, olfactory imprinting, and territorial fighting. Here are his main points. A free-living ancestor of Polyergus, that is a scavenger, would band together with others for intraspecific contest. Occasionally a queen would invade colonies of <b>Formica.</b> Initially the queen would drive off the <b>Formica</b> queen and workers and appropriated the <b>Formica</b> pupae (he gives as example the queens of <b>Formica</b> wheeleri that do this now). The killing of the <b>Formica</b> queen and adoption by the workers would evolve from this. His previous work (which was presented earlier) shows what would have evolved for adaptation to occur: [...] "(1) sharp mandibles for killing the <b>Formica</b> queen, (2) a pheromone that reduces aggression from resident workers, (3) a tendency to hold onto the dead <b>Formica</b> queen long enough to absorb her odors...". The next step would be olfactory imprinting between the two species, a consequence of living one’s life from start to finish in the presence of both species. Polyergus’ ancestor then forages and encounters a colony of the same species. Again, they recruit nestmates to a territorial raid. In a brilliant insight, Topoff suggest this trait explains the raiding behavior. The Polyergus worker, raised by <b>Formica</b> as conspecifics, [...] "identifies individual of <b>Formica</b> as belonging to its own species, another territorial raid is incited. Thus from the standpoint of Polyergus... slave raids are equivalent to territorial raids". The captured brood is imprinted as well and they become workers in the original nest. As time went on [...] "Our ancestral Polyergus could easily slide in the direction of facultative parasitism". Eventually, Polyergus ancestors lost the ability {{to take care of themselves}} and become the inquiline Polyergus we see today.|$|E
