5|$|Several {{months after}} the Governor's attack, a deadly flu kills many of the {{population}} at the prison. The Governor finds his former right-hand men and kills them, taking over their group and destroys the prison. Rick's <b>group</b> <b>are</b> forced to separate and flee, but not before Hershel and the Governor are killed. The survivors divide, face their own trials and meet new faces before finding signs pointing to a safe haven called Terminus. One by one, they reunite at Terminus, but all the <b>group</b> <b>are</b> captured for some unknown purpose.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} {{interest}} recently concerning when a left ordered <b>group</b> <b>is</b> locally indicable. Chiswell and Kropholler proved that every left ordered solvable-by-finite <b>group</b> <b>is</b> locally indicable, while Bergman gave examples of left ordered <b>groups</b> which <b>are</b> not locally indicable. We shall prove that every left ordered elementary amenable <b>group</b> <b>is</b> locally indicable. Every solvable-by-finite <b>group</b> <b>is</b> elementary amenable, and every elementary amenable <b>group</b> <b>is</b> amenable.

5|$|All have paddle-like {{tails and}} many have {{laterally}} compressed bodies that give them an eel-like appearance. Unlike fish, {{they do not have}} gills and must surface regularly to breathe. Along with whales, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this <b>group</b> <b>are</b> species {{with some of the most}} potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E
5|$|Among pterodactyloids {{a greater}} {{variation}} in diet is present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as ornithocheirans, boreopterids, pteranodontids and nyctosaurids. Some amount of niche partitioning {{seems to have}} been present: ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurs were aerial dip-feeders like today's frigatebirds, while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to cormorants or Platanista river dolphins, and pteranodonts were pelagic plunge-divers akin to boobies and gannets. The biggest exception among this <b>group</b> <b>are</b> the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily scavengers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>group</b> <b>is</b> called linear {{if it has}} a {{faithful}} linear (com-plex) representation. Another way of expressing this property <b>is</b> that the <b>group</b> <b>is</b> isomorphic to a group of invertible complex ma-trices. Not all <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> linear. Examples of linear <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> finite <b>groups,</b> finitely generated free groups, and the braid <b>groups.</b> The assignment <b>is</b> to collect necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for <b>groups</b> to <b>be</b> linear. 1...|$|R
5|$|In a 1960 paper, American {{astronomer}} Olin J.

Members of the <b>group</b> <b>are</b> of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into red giants.|$|E
5|$|In a 1998 review, {{primatologist}} Marc Godinot recognized Sivaladapidae as {{a separate}} family within the Adapiformes, and this classification has been followed since then. Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae, which is known from the Eocene through the Miocene of China, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. Sivaladapids are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms; members of this <b>group</b> <b>are</b> otherwise known mostly from the Eocene, but several sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Mapracorat {{is one of}} {{a number}} of trifluoropropanolamines and -amides which are less {{obviously}} steroid-like in structure. Other typical examples of this <b>group</b> <b>are</b> ZK216348 and 55D1E1. The bulky, bicyclic aromatic substituents (R1 and R2) account for the structural similarity to corticoids. The R conformation of the asymmetric carbon atom seems to be essential for GR affinity.|$|E

5|$|Oganesson is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this <b>group</b> <b>are</b> usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.|$|E

5|$|Part of the Kingston Peak resembles {{glacial till}} by being poorly sorted {{and other parts}} have large boulder-sized dropstones resting in a {{fine-grained}} matrix of sandstone and siltstone. Similar deposits are found over North America during the same period, some 700 to 800 mya. Geologists therefore hypothesize that the world {{at that time was}} affected by a very severe glaciation, perhaps the most severe in geologic history (see Snowball Earth). The youngest rocks in the Pahrump <b>Group</b> <b>are</b> from basaltic lava flows.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, {{a locally}} profinite <b>group</b> <b>is</b> a hausdorff topological group {{in which every}} {{neighborhood}} of the identity element contains a compact open subgroup.
