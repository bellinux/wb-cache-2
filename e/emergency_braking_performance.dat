40|$|There are {{considerable}} gaps in our {{existing knowledge}} {{with regard to}} how the flexible nature and high texture levels of New Zealand chipseal surfaces influence interfacial forces that are developed in the tyre-road contact region. These interfacial forces influence almost every performance parameter ranging from noise generation through to skid resistance. This paper describes a programme of research concerned with systematic on-road experimental and finite-element based model studies formulated to obtain an improved understanding of how road design and construction practices influence tyre forces. Preliminary results related to noise generation, tyre rolling resistance and <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> are also presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises the {{measured}} <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> of a tri-axle {{heavy goods vehicle}} semitrailer fitted with a novel pneumatic slip control braking system developed by the Cambridge Vehicle Dynamics Consortium. Straight-line braking tests were carried out from 40 [*]km/h in order to compare a commercially electro-pneumatic available anti-lock braking system and the Cambridge Vehicle Dynamics Consortium system, which has bi-stable valves coupled with a sliding-mode slip controller. On average, the Cambridge Vehicle Dynamics Consortium system reduced the stopping distance and the air use by 15 % and 22 % respectively compared with those for the conventional anti-lock braking system. The most significant improvements were seen on a wet basalt-tile surface (with similar friction properties to ice) where the stopping distance and the air use were improved by 17 % and 30 % respectively. A third performance metric, namely the mean absolute slip error, is introduced to quantify the ability of each braking system to track a wheel slip demand. Using this metric, the bi-stable valve system is shown to improve the wheel slip demand tracking by 62 % {{compared with that of}} the conventional anti-lock braking system. This improvement potentially allows more accurate control of the wheel forces during extreme manoeuvres, providing scope for the future development of advanced stability control systems...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the hysteresis characteristics of a pneumatic braking system for multi-axle heavy vehicles (MHVs). Hysteresis affects <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> severely. The fact that MHVs have a large size and complex structure leads to more nonlinear coupling property of the pneumatic braking system compared to normal two-axle vehicles. Thus, theoretical analysis and simulation are not enough when studying hysteresis. In this article, the hysteresis of a pneumatic brake system for an eight-axle vehicle in an emergency braking situation is studied based on a novel test bench. A servo drive device is applied to simulate the driver’s braking intensions normally expressed by opening or moving speed of the brake pedal. With a reasonable arrangement of sensors and the NI LabVIEW platform, both the delay time of eight loops and the response time of each subassembly in a single loop are detected in real time. The outcomes of the experiment show that the delay time of each loop gets longer {{with the increase of}} pedal opening, and a quadratic relationship exists between them. Based on this, the pressure transient in the system is fitted to a first-order plus time delay model. Besides, the response time of treadle valve and controlling pipeline accounts for more than 80 % of the loop’s total delay time, indicating that these two subassemblies are the main contributors to the hysteresis effect...|$|E
5000|$|Brake {{system is}} air-assisted-hydraulic six wheel drum brakes with a {{driveline}} parking brake, although gladhands {{exist on the}} rear of the vehicle for connection to trailers with full air service and <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes.</b> <b>Braking</b> <b>performance</b> of the truck is similar to other power drum brake vehicles of this size. Each drum was designed with maximum efficiency in mind, and individual drums can dissipate up to [...] of braking heat. Due to this brake system and GVWR under 26001 lb, the big deuce can be driven without a commercial driver's license in most states. Even California does NOT require a CDL to operate an M35 on public roads because even though it has three axles and an air-assisted braking system, the maximum gross weight is still under 26000 lb, making it eligible for class C on-road driving; and because the primary braking system is hydraulic, not air.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) {{system based}} on {{an analysis of the}} movement of a motorcade in an emergency situation. This analysis seeks to answer the question: when and under what conditions Emergency Message (EM) sent by Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) system reaches the final target to help in preventing of serious accidents, such as multi-vehicle collisions. The model of calculation based on the key principles of vehicle braking enables finding the time to possible collision and the residual velocity of the vehicle. In the calculations, the average values of the driver’s reaction time are accepted; in addition, a sent emergency message is considered to be free of interference. Upon choosing different road and driving conditions, it is found what vehicle of the motorcade stops before the possible obstacle on <b>emergency</b> <b>braking.</b> The <b>performance</b> of vehicles with and without VANET system is compared. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether motorcycle handling capabilities – measured by means of the efficiency of emergency manoeuvres – were dependent on prior sleep deprivation and time of day. Twelve male participants voluntarily took part in four test sessions, starting at 6 a. m., 10 a. m., 2 p. m., and 6 p. m., following a night either with or without sleep. Each test session comprised temperature and sleepiness measurements, before three different types of motorcycling tests were initiated: (1) stability in straight ahead riding at low speed (in ‘‘slow motion’ ’ mode and in ‘‘brakes and clutch’ ’ mode), (2) emergency braking and (3) crash avoidance tasks performed at 20 kph and 40 kph. The results indicate that motorcycle control at low speed depends on time of day, with an improvement in performance throughout the day. <b>Emergency</b> <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> is affected at both speeds by time of day, with poorer performance (longer total stopping distance, reaction time and braking distance) in the morning, and also by sleep deprivation, from measurements obtained at 40 kph (incorrect initial speed). Except for a tendency observed after the sleepless night to deviate from the initial speed, it seems that crash avoidance capabilities are quite unaffected by the two disturbance factors. Consequently, some motorcycle handling capabilities (stability at low speed and emergency braking) change in the same way as the diurnal fluctuation observed in body temperature and sleepiness, whereas for others (crash avoidance) the participants were able to maintain their initial performance level despite the high levels of sleepiness recorded after a sleepless night. Motorcycle riders have t...|$|E
40|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> {{distance}} of the present Shinkansen is just under 4, 000 m (E 2 series at 275 km/h). If increasing initial braking speed to 360 km/h while leaving the <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> as-is, the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> distance will extend to as long as approx. 7, 000 m. But {{the analysis of the}} risk increase in case of earthquake due to Shinkansen speed increases indicates that {{the most effective way to}} control that risk is to keep the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> distance from becoming longer as much as possible. Accordingly, we decided to develop a brake system to deal with speed increase in the FASTECH project, aiming for an approx. 4, 000 m <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> distance at 360 km/h. To achieve that rapid deceleration that the present Shinkansen does not require, we developed basic brake equipment that has the braking force required for that and a brake control method that makes full use of the adhesion between wheels and rails.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} Kriging models applied to {{optimise}} <b>braking</b> <b>performances</b> for freight trains.

50|$|The 2WD models {{feature the}} new Electronic Braking Force Distribution (EBD) system that uses {{electronic}} control to optimally distribute braking {{force to the}} front and rear wheels according to changes in the payload (number of passengers) being carried. This system works in tandem with the Braking Assist system (a brake booster with a two-stage mechanical assist mechanism plus ABS) to achieve synergies between effective utilization of front and rear braking force (EBD) and reduced pedal pressure (Braking Assist). As a result, more powerful <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> is obtained with less pedal pressure in <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> situations even when carrying a large payload. The 4WD models also provide the nearly same high level of <b>braking</b> <b>performance</b> by adopting a load sensing valve (LSV) as a mechanical braking force distribution system in a set with the Braking Assist system.|$|R

30|$|The main {{contribution}} of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system delivers drivers a braking warning signal earlier by DSRC communication. Via vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning signal will be broadcast and the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time. Therefore, drivers behind can receive an immediate <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning while the front vehicle <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes.</b> Since the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time, the driver in car C can {{be aware of the}} <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> of car A before the driver in car B brakes and its braking light comes on, as shown in Figure  4. Consequently, the early warning mechanism is the concept of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system.

2500|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> do {{not stop}} very well, as the {{stopping}} force provided by the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> {{is less than half}} the force of normal braking and takes much longer to stop a vehicle.
