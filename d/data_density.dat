40|$|The 3 P 1 yields 3 P 0 line {{of neutral}} C I toward Z Oph was {{observed}} at 492 GHz to demonstrate that C I column densities and line velocity measurements {{can be made with}} both submillimeter and UV techniques. The data were collected with an InSb cyclotron-resonance heterodyne receiver on the NASA Kuiper Airborne Observatory at an altitude of 12. 5 km. The radio <b>data</b> <b>densities</b> were compared with densities calculated from Copernicus satellite UV data. It was found that the radio <b>data</b> <b>densities</b> improved that accuracy of column densities previously determined from UV measurements.

50|$|The main {{rationale}} behind {{the use of}} the 5.25-inch form factor was that the typical PC user already owns cases that supports 5.25-inch drives, and by using lower <b>data</b> <b>densities</b> and fewer moving parts, Quantum was able to deliver the products at lower prices, thus more competitively.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, a {{new concept}} was {{introduced}} to allow further increase of the <b>data</b> <b>density</b> in magnetic recording, using recording media consisting of coupled soft and hard magnetic layers. That so-called exchange spring media, also known as exchange coupled composite media, allows good writability due to the write-assist nature of the soft layer. However, the thermal stability is determined only by the hardest layer and not influenced by the soft layer.|$|E
25|$|The data {{obtained}} from the evaporative process is however not without artefacts that form the physical evaporation or ionisation process. A key feature of the evaporation or field ion images is that the <b>data</b> <b>density</b> is highly inhomogeneous, due to the corrugation of the specimen surface at the atomic scale. This corrugation gives rise to strong electric field gradients in the near-tip zone (on the order of an atomic radii or less from the tip), which during ionisation deflects ions away from the electric field normal.|$|E
25|$|They can {{potentially}} be fashioned into non-volatile solid-state memory, {{which would allow}} greater <b>data</b> <b>density</b> than hard drives with access times similar to DRAM, replacing both components. HP prototyped a crossbar latch memory that can fit 100 gigabits in a square centimeter, and proposed a scalable 3D design (consisting of up to 1000 layers or 1 petabit per cm3). In May 2008 HP reported that its device reaches currently about one-tenth the speed of DRAM. The devices' resistance would be read with alternating current so that the stored value would not be affected. In May 2012 {{it was reported that}} access time had been improved to 90 nanoseconds if not faster, approximately one hundred times faster than contemporaneous flash memory, while using one percent as much energy.|$|E

40|$|Non-volatile {{memories}} {{based on}} scanning probes offer very high <b>data</b> <b>densities,</b> but existing approaches require the probe to be heated, {{which increases the}} energy expenditure and complexity of fabrication. Here, we demonstrate the writing, reading and erasure of an ultrahigh-density array of nanoscopic indentations without heating either the scanning probe tip or the substrate. An atomic force microscope tip causes microphase transitions of the polystyrene-block-poly(n-pentyl methacrylate) of a block copolymer to occur at room temperature by application of pressure alone. We demonstrate a <b>data</b> storage <b>density</b> of 1 Tb in- 2, which is limited only {{by the size of}} the tip.

The TK50 was superseded in 1987 by the TK70 drive and the 48-track CompacTape II cartridge, capable of storing 294 MB. In 1989, the CompacTape III (later DLTtape III) format was introduced, {{increasing the number}} of tracks to 128 and capacity to 2.6 GB.
