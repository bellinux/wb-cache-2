5|$|Mireille was {{the strongest}} typhoon to hit Japan since Typhoon Nancy in 1961, causing heavy damage in 41 of 47 prefectures. It was the third storm to strike Japan in two weeks. Damage was {{heaviest}} on Kyushu where the storm made landfall. Because the storm moved northeastward through the Sea of Japan, the eastern quadrant of the storm crossed {{over much of the}} country, which is where the strongest winds in tropical cyclones are located. The high winds downed trees, damaged roofs, and left record power outages, affecting 7.36million people, or about 13% of total customers. In some areas, the power outages lasted as little as three minutes. The storm damaged over 670,000houses, of which 1,058were destroyed, and another 22,965were flooded. Power outages caused at least five factories to shut down production. Along the coast, the typhoon damaged 930ships, with dozens sunk or blown ashore. Most of the damage was related to agriculture or forests. Sea spray heavily damaged fruit trees and rice paddies. Crop damage amounted to $3billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. Most farms lost 80% of their crop, potentially taking 10years to regrow. Persistent cloudiness and rainfall following the storm diminished sunlight by 50%, furthering crop damage. There were 62deaths in Japan and 2,862injuries, including the deaths on the South Korean freighter, making it the deadliest typhoon there in 10years. About 80% of the deaths were male, and 70% were over 60years old. Most of the deaths were related to wind-blown debris, <b>falling</b> <b>due</b> to the wind, or being trapped or struck by fallen objects. The $6billion in insured losses and $10billion in overall damage made Mireille the costliest typhoon on record as of May 2014, according to Munich Re.|$|E
2500|$|The {{costs are}} <b>falling</b> <b>due</b> to newer and cheaper technologies, and the {{advantages}} are becoming more compelling as offshore work enters ever deeper water and the environment (coral) is given more respect. With container operations, crowded ports can be made more efficient by quicker and more accurate berthing techniques. Cruise ship operations benefit from faster berthing and non-anchored [...] "moorings" [...] off beaches or inaccessible ports.|$|E
2500|$|Rock {{climbing}} is {{an activity}} in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without <b>falling.</b> <b>Due</b> to the length and extended endurance required and because accidents {{are more likely to}} happen on the descent than the ascent, rock climbers do not usually climb back down the route. It is very rare for a climber to downclimb, especially on the larger multiple pitches (class III- IV and /or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs). Professional rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, is similar to rock climbing. However, rock climbing is generally [...] by its sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to provide balance.|$|E
50|$|Renewal {{fees are}} payable to the European Patent Office {{in respect of}} pending European patent {{applications}} in respect of the third year from the date of filing.

2500|$|For example, in Sumpter v Hedges {{a builder}} {{performed}} £333 worth of work, but then abandoned {{completion of the}} contract. The Court of Appeal held he could not recover any money for the building left on the land, even though the buyer subsequently used the foundations to complete the job. This rule provides a powerful remedy in home construction cases to a customer. So in Bolton v Mahadeva Mr Bolton installed a £560 heating system in Mahadeva's house. However, it leaked and would cost £174 to correct (i.e. 31% of the price). Mahadeva did not pay at all, and the Court of Appeal held this was lawful because the performance was so defective that there could {{not be said to}} be any substantial performance. However where an obligation in a contract is [...] "substantially performed", the full sum must be paid, only then deducting an amount to reflect the breach. So in Hoenig v Isaacs Denning LJ held a builder who installed a bookcase poorly, with a price of £750 but costing only £55 to correct (i.e. 7.3% of the price), had to be paid minus the cost of correction. If a contract's obligations are construed as consisting of an [...] "entire obligation", performance of it all will be a condition precedent (a requirement before) to performance from the other side <b>falling</b> <b>due,</b> and allowing a breach of contract claim.|$|E

40|$|In this {{practically}} oriented review, we will {{outline the}} clinical approach {{of patients with}} <b>falls</b> <b>due</b> to an impairment or loss of consciousness. Following a set of definitions, we describe the salient clinical features of disorders leading to such falls. Among falls caused by true loss of consciousness, we separate the clinical characteristics of syncopal <b>falls</b> (<b>due</b> to reflex syncope, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension or cardiac syncope) from <b>falls</b> <b>due</b> to other causes of transient unconsciousness, such as seizures. With respect to falls caused by an apparent loss of consciousness, we discuss the presentation of cataplexy, drop attacks, and psychogenic falls. Particular emphasis will be laid upon crucial features obtained by history taking for distinguishing between the various conditions that cause or mimic a transient loss of consciousness...|$|R
60|$|One {{thing we}} cannot mention without a due thrill of horror: namely, that, {{in the empty}} {{exchequer}} of Dominus Hugo, there was not found one penny to distribute to the Poor that they might pray for his soul!

Dominus Hugo's apartments were plundered by his servants, to the last portable stool, in a few minutes after the breath was out of his body. Forlorn old Hugo, fare thee well forever.|$|R

6000|$|It overcomes {{the poor}} woman; she {{leans forward and}} breaks into sobbing,-- a tempest of sorrow, long suppressed, that shakes her weak frame as she thinks that her husband is out of work, desperate, discouraged, and tempted of the devil, that the rent is <b>falling</b> <b>due,</b> and only the poor pay of her needle to meet it with. In one of those quick flashes which {{concentrate}} through the imagination the sorrows of years, she seems to see her little home broken up, {{her husband in the}} gutter, her children turned into the street. At this moment there goes up from her heart a despairing cry, such as a poor, hunted, tired-out creature gives when brought to the last gasp of endurance. It was like the shriek of the hare when the hounds are upon it. She clasps her hands and cries out, [...] "O my God, help me." ...|$|E
60|$|Secondly, it must {{be allowed}} that our {{payments}} <b>falling</b> <b>due</b> only {{on the death of}} husbands, this one in fifty must not be reckoned upon the two thousand, for it is to be supposed at least as many women shall die as men, and then there is nothing to pay; so that one in fifty upon one thousand is the most that I can suppose shall claim the contribution in a year, which is twenty claims a year at 5s. each, and is 5 pounds per annum. And if a woman pays this for twenty years, and claims at last, she is gainer enough, and no extraordinary loser if she never claims at all. And I verily believe any office might undertake to demand at all adventures not above 6 pounds per annum, and secure the subscriber 500 pounds in case she come to claim as a widow.|$|E
6000|$|... [124] [Sir Walter's private law-agent.] Mr. John Gibson, Junr., W.S., Mr. James Jollie, W.S., and Mr. Alexander Monypenny, W.S., {{were the}} three gentlemen who {{ultimately}} {{agreed to take}} charge, as trustees, of Sir Walter Scott's affairs; and certainly no gentlemen ever acquitted themselves of such an office in a manner more honourable to themselves, or more satisfactory to a client and his creditors.--J.G.L. Mr. Gibson wrote a little volume of Reminiscences of Scott, {{which was published in}} 1871. This old friend died in 1879. [...] "In the month of January 1826," [...] says Mr. Gibson, [...] "Sir Walter called upon me, and explained how matters stood with the two houses referred to, adding that he himself was a partner in one of them--that bills were <b>falling</b> <b>due</b> and dishonoured--and that some immediate arrangement was indispensably necessary. In such circumstances, only two modes of proceeding could be thought of--either that he should avail himself of the Bankrupt Act, and allow his estate to be sequestrated, or that he should execute a trust conveyance for behoof of his creditors. The latter course was preferred for various reasons, but chiefly out of regard for his own feeling." [...] Reminiscences, p. 12. See entry in Journal under Jan. 24.|$|E

60|$|Another dismal {{circumstance}} is, that Veneering, {{having the}} captivating Tippins {{on one side}} of him and the bride's aunt on the other, finds it immensely difficult to keep the peace. For, Medusa, besides unmistakingly glaring petrifaction at the fascinating Tippins, follows every lively remark made by that dear creature, with an audible snort: which may be referable to a chronic cold in the head, but may also be referable to indignation and contempt. And this snort being regular in its reproduction, at length comes to be expected by the company, who make embarrassing pauses when it is <b>falling</b> <b>due,</b> and by waiting for it, render it more emphatic when it comes. The stoney aunt has likewise an injurious way of rejecting all dishes whereof Lady Tippins partakes: saying aloud when they are proffered to her, 'No, no, no, not for me. Take it away!' As with a set purpose of implying a misgiving that if nourished upon similar meats, she might come to be like that charmer, which would be a fatal consummation. Aware of her enemy, Lady Tippins tries a youthful sally or two, and tries the eye-glass; but, from the impenetrable cap and snorting armour of the stoney aunt all weapons rebound powerless.|$|E
6000|$|More men entered, {{sat down}} by tables, stood in groups, or {{remained}} apart by themselves, thinking with knit brows.

Everybody knows everybody else at the Overseas Club, and everybody sympathises. A man passed stiffly and some one of a group turned to ask lightly, 'Hit, old man?'

Another man was telling, slowly and somewhat bitterly, how he had expected one of his children to join him out here, and how the passage had been paid with a draft on the O.B.C. But now ... There, ladies and gentlemen, is where it hurts, this little suspension out here. It destroys plans, pretty ones hoped for and prayed over, maybe for years; it knocks pleasant domestic arrangements galleywest over and above all the mere ruin that it causes. The curious thing in the talk was that there was no abuse of the bank. The men were in the Eastern trade themselves and they knew. It was the Yokohama manager and the clerks thrown out of employment (connection with a broken bank, by the way, goes far to ruin a young man's prospects) for whom they were sorry.
