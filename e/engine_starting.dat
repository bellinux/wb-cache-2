5|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>starting</b> was {{achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water contamination of the fuel. A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E
5|$|The last B.2 XM657 was {{delivered}} in 1965 {{and the type}} served till 1984. Whilst in service the B.2 was continuously updated with modifications including rapid <b>engine</b> <b>starting,</b> bomb-bay fuel tanks, wing strengthening to give the fatigue life to enable the aircraft to fly at low level (a tactic introduced in the mid-1960s), upgraded navigation equipment, terrain following radar (TFR), standardisation on a common nuclear weapon (WE.117) and improved ECM equipment. The B.1As were not strengthened, thus all were withdrawn by 1968. Nine B.2s were modified for a maritime radar reconnaissance (MRR) role and six for an airborne tanker role.|$|E
25|$|A {{natural use}} of the turbocharger— and its {{earliest}} known use for any internal combustion <b>engine,</b> <b>starting</b> with experimental installations in the 1920s— is with aircraft engines. As an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes {{the pressure of the}} surrounding air quickly falls off. At 5,486 m (18,000ft), the air is at half the pressure of sea level and the airframe experiences only half the aerodynamic drag. However, since the charge in the cylinders is pushed in by this air pressure, the engine normally produces only half-power at full throttle at this altitude. Pilots would like {{to take advantage of the}} low drag at high altitudes to go faster, but a naturally aspirated engine does not produce enough power at the same altitude to do so.|$|E

25|$|The G 31 was {{the first}} Luft Hansa {{airliner}} to feature a flight attendant (Wagner p.264), who served food and drinks (which were not complimentary). This earned the G 31 the nickname 'flying dining car' ('fliegender Speisewagen' in German). Because of its large fuselage it was also called the flying moving van ('fliegender Möbelwagen' in German). Behind the cockpit were compartments for a radio operator, baggage and an APU that provided compressed air for main <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> and drove a generator for electric power. The cabin was divided into three compartments that held eleven regular passenger seats, four jumpseats for passengers, a jumpseat for the steward, and an enclosed lavatory. Instead of the passenger seats, ten beds could be made up for night flying. There was a baggage and freight hold under the cabin. The wings had trailing edge flaps that reduced the landing speed by ten percent (Wagner p.267).|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that {{went out of business}} in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few more miles out of it. Many of the sound effects for the car’s clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> up noisily that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few weeks}} of familiarization {{training}} with the new aircraft, on 4 July 1942 six American crews from the 15th joined with six RAF crews of 226 Squadron for a low-level attack on four Luftwaffe airfields in the Netherlands, becoming the first United States Army Air Forces unit to bomb targets in Europe. Upon approaching one of the targets, De Kooy Airfield, the aircraft piloted by Capt. Charles Kegelman received a direct hit in its right <b>engine,</b> <b>starting</b> a fire and causing the propellor to separate from the plane. A momentary loss of control resulted in the rear fuselage and right wingtip of the plane striking the ground. Capt. Kegelman jettisoned his bomb load and turned to the coastline, en route he exchanged fire with a flak tower. The engine fire went out and the plane successfully landed at RAF Swanton Morley Two of the 15th's planes did not return from the mission, along with one RAF aircraft. Capt. Kegleman was promoted to Major and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his valor on the mission. He was the first Eighth Air Force airman to receive the nation's second highest combat decoration.|$|E

500|$|All flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} in Sweden use an E75 winter blend instead of E85 to avoid <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> problems during cold weather. This blend was introduced since the winter 2006-07 and E75 is used from November until March. For temperature below [...] E85 flex vehicles require an engine block heater. The {{use of this}} device is also recommended for gasoline vehicles when temperatures drop below [...] Another option when extreme cold weather is expected is to add more pure gasoline in the tank, thus reducing the ethanol content below the E75 winter blend, or simply not to use E85 during extreme low temperature spells.|$|E
500|$|For greater {{efficiency}} and higher reliability, the main {{system on the}} B.2 was changed to three-phase 200V AC at 400Hz supplied by four 40kVA engine-driven constant speed alternators. <b>Engine</b> <b>starting</b> was then by air-starters supplied from a Palouste compressor on the ground. Standby supplies {{in the event of}} a main AC failure were provided by a ram air turbine (RAT) driving a 17kVA alternator that could operate from high altitudes down to , and an airborne auxiliary power plant (AAPP), a Rover gas turbine driving a 40kVA alternator, which could be started once the aircraft was below an altitude of [...] Secondary electrical supplies were by transformer-rectifier units (TRUs) for 28 V DC and rotary frequency converters for the 115V 1600Hz single phase supplies.|$|E
500|$|In the {{subsequent}} investigation, metal fatigue was ultimately {{blamed for the}} failure of the number five compressor wheel in the number two Rolls-Royce 508 Conway turbofan <b>engine,</b> <b>starting</b> the rapid chain of failures. [...] The crew's omitting to shut off the fuel to the engine was blamed for the rapid growth of the fire and the loss of the aircraft. Check Captain Moss had accidentally cancelled the fire warning bell instead of the undercarriage warning bell. Moss had also issued orders to Captain Taylor, in breach of the normal protocol for his duties. However, the report on the accident also stated that Captain Taylor had briefed Moss to act as an extra set of eyes and ears inside and outside the cockpit. Moss's actions therefore could be seen as acting within that remit. Although Moss had alerted the crew to the fire, none of them were aware that the number 2 engine had fallen off until after the evacuation on the ground.|$|E

500|$|The {{time each}} car {{set on the}} first day {{determined}} the time they set off on the second day, hence Szisz's first-day time of 5hours and 45minutes meant he started at 5:45am. Following the same principle, Clément began at 6:11am and Nazzaro at 6:26am. This method ensured that positions on the road directly reflected the race standings. A horse, which had been trained before the race to be accustomed to the loud noise of an <b>engine</b> <b>starting,</b> towed each competitor out of parc fermé to the start line. As neither driver nor mechanic could work on their car until they had been given the signal to start the day's running, Szisz and Clément began by heading directly to the pit lane to change tyres and service their cars. Clément completed his stop more quickly than Szisz, and Nazzaro did not stop at all, and so Clément closed his time gap to Szisz and Nazzaro closed on Clément. Jenatzy and Lancia, who were both suffering eye problems from the first day, had intended to retire from the race and be relieved by their reserve drivers. As planned, [...] "Burton" [...] took over Jenatzy's car, but Lancia was forced to resume in his street clothes when his replacement driver could not be found when the car was due to start.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this same}} time, other investors had built an {{elevated}} railway in Greenwich St and Ninth Ave, which operated successfully {{with a small}} steam <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> in 1870. [...] The wealthy property owners did not object to this railway well away from Broadway, and by the mid-1870s it appeared that elevated railways were practical and underground railways were not, setting the pattern for rapid transit development in New York {{for the rest of}} the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|McGuinn also penned the album's closing track, [...] "2-4-2 Fox Trot (The Lear Jet Song)", {{which was}} an attempt to create an aural {{approximation}} of a flight in a Lear Jet. The song was inspired by the band's friendship with jet manufacturer John Lear and the title is a reference to the registration number of Lear's own personal jet, which was N242FT. The song makes extensive use of aviation sound effects, including an in-cockpit recitation of a pilot's pre-takeoff checklist and the sound of a jet <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> up. While the song can be regarded as another of The Byrds' quirky album closers, like [...] "Oh! Susannah" [...] and [...] "We'll Meet Again" [...] from their previous albums, Crosby and McGuinn actually took the song very seriously, arguing that it was an innovative attempt at incorporating mechanical sounds into a pop song format.|$|E

2500|$|The J402-CA-400 was a {{single-shaft}} engine, {{with one}} axial compressor stage and one centrifugal compressor stage. The compressed air was combusted in an annular combustor, and then {{passed through a}} single high-pressure turbine stage before being exhausted. Because the engine was designed for a one-time use missile, its service life was only one hour. The primary challenge of the [...] "wooden round" [...] requirement was to design the engine to be as reliable as possible. To that end, significant {{efforts were made to}} reduce the number of individual parts throughout the engine. For example, the rotor system of the J402 had 16 parts, while the J69 (the parent engine) had 149 parts for the same system. Another simplifying measure was to eliminate the standard gearbox. All the engine accessories, like the fuel pump and electrical alternator, ran directly off the rotor shaft. <b>Engine</b> <b>starting</b> was another reliability-critical function of the engine, and to accomplish that requirement, the J402 utilizes pyrotechnic cartridges to start the engine. Finally, the engine was among the first to feature a fully electronic analog fuel controller.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} the {{takeover}} of the Rover Group by BMW, who brought their own range of diesel engines, made the Storm engine largely redundant. Only the 5-cylinder version made it to production as the powerplant for the Defender and the new Discovery Series II as the 'Td5' in 1998. Offering more power and greater refinement than the 300Tdi the Td5 greatly improved {{the appeal of the}} Discovery but caused concern amongst many operators of the Defender due to its electronic engine management systems which were considered to be less reliable and more difficult to repair 'in the field' than the mechanical injection systems used on previous Land Rover diesel engines. In deference to these concerns (including those voiced by the British Army) Land Rover kept the 300Tdi in production for fitment to special-order vehicles (see above). It transpired that the Td5's electronics were highly reliable. Early engines suffered two isolated mechanical failures—sudden and complete failure of the oil pump drive and 'cylinder head shuffle' caused by weak retaining studs. Both these faults were fixed within 2 years of the <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> production and the Td5 is now considered highly reliable. In 2002 the engine was improved to reach Euro 3 antipollution stage, and an EGR valve system was introduced. Electronics were also updated to improve the low-speed throttle response which had been prone to producing [...] a jerky power delivery in off-road or towing situations.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{very lonely}} place--a colony of half-finished streets, and half-inhabited houses, which {{had grown up in}} the {{neighbourhood}} of a great railway station. I heard the fierce scream of the whistle, and the heaving, heavy throb of the <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> on its journey, as I advanced along the gloomy Square in which I now found myself. The cab I had been following stood at a turning which led into a long street, occupied towards the farther end, by shops closed for the night, and at the end nearest me, apparently by private houses only. Margaret and Mr. Mannion hastily left the cab, and without looking either to the right or the left, hurried down the street. They stopped at the ninth house. I followed just in time to hear the door closed on them, and to count the number of doors intervening between that door and the Square.|$|E
