5|$|Proteins are an {{essential}} component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within biological cells. They often act as enzymes, performing biochemical reactions including cell signaling, molecular transportation, and cellular regulation. As structural elements, some proteins act {{as a type of}} skeleton for cells, and as antibodies, while other proteins participate in the immune system. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of computational biology. Despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may misfold, that is, <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.|$|E

50|$|The waterbomb base {{consists}} of two perpendicular valley <b>folds</b> <b>down</b> the diagonals of the square and two perpendicular mountain <b>folds</b> <b>down</b> {{the center of the}} square. This crease pattern is then compressed to form the waterbomb base, which is an isosceles-right triangle with four isosceles-right triangular flaps. The waterbomb base is an inside-out preliminary fold.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} design——provided for {{the island}} to retract flush with the deck during flight operations, but that {{was found to be}} too complicated. Another solution was considered where the two masts were to <b>fold</b> <b>down,</b> in lieu of the retractable island, to allow the carrier to pass under the Brooklyn Bridge. The larger center mast was to fold to the side and rest on the flight deck, and the smaller mast was to fold toward the stern.|$|E
25|$|On hot days, hinged wooden panels <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> {{to expose}} large copper screens {{to provide a}} great deal of ventilation. These panels and {{numerous}} windows cover most of the outside perimeter of the cabins. From the 1960s through 1980s, they hardly seemed necessary, for the hemlock trees formed a thick canopy and kept the shaded grounds cool. However, in the early 1990s, the hemlock woolly adelgid began destroying the hemlock trees, so the surrounding forest is again scattered with dead and fallen trees as in Hoover's day.|$|E

25|$|Typically, for {{a smaller}} {{executive}} car, there is ample room up front for the driver and passenger to sit comfortably, with very comfortable seats. However, rear seat passengers may find the design restrictive in overall room. The 156 Sportwagon features the addition of <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> rear seats which increases the luggage area normally covered by a privacy screen. Ideally the 156 is a car for four people, rather than five, although later models did add a full centre seatbelt {{in place of the}} lap belt in earlier models.|$|E
500|$|The Ford Pinto {{went on sale}} on September 11, 1970 in one bodystyle, a {{fastback}} sedan with {{trunk and}} metal trunklid. [...] A hatchback became available on February 20, 1971, debuting at the Chicago Auto Show. In 1971, the Pinto brochure came with a paper cutout Pinto that one could fold to make a 3D model. Marketed as the Runabout, the hatchback went on sale five days later, priced at $2,062. The hatch itself featured exposed chrome hinges for the liftgate and five decorative chrome strips, pneumatic struts to assist in opening the hatch, a rear window approximately {{as large as the}} sedan's, and a <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> seat — a feature which became simultaneously an option on the sedan. The hatchback model matched the sedan in all other dimensions and offered [...] of cargo space with its seat folded. By 1972, Ford redesigned the hatch itself, with the glass portion of the hatch enlarged to almost the entire size of the hatch itself, ultimately to be replaced with a rear hatch that was entirely glass.|$|E

Both sides had sideboards with <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> troop seats and bows for a tarpaulin. Two spare tires were mounted inside the body, one along each side. Early models had all steel bodies, in 1942 they were replaced by largely wood types to conserve steel. All Corbitts (3,077) were prime movers, White also built 3,547.|$|E
2500|$|The Gran Torino Brougham {{featured}} the finest upholsteries in the Torino line-up, including nylon cloth fabrics and [...] "leather like" [...] vinyl. Standard equipment included a {{front bench seat}} with a <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> armrest, woodgrained trim on the instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, electric clock, bright pedal pad trim, and a dual note horn. The Squire wagon was trimmed similarly to the Brougham. [...] The comfortweave inserts were no longer offered in the Torino for 1973.|$|E
2500|$|The LeSabre {{was offered}} in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level.

Early models had all steel bodies, in 1942 they were replaced by largely wood types to conserve steel.|$|E
2500|$|The Hornet {{was offered}} as a two-door and four-door {{notchback}} sedan in its introductory year. The hardtop (no [...] "B" [...] pillar) coupe body style was not continued from the 1969 Rambler American. A four-door station wagon variant named the [...] "Sportabout" [...] {{was added to the}} 1971 lineup. Also for 1971, the SC/360 was added. This was a [...] V8 powered compact muscle car that was available only as a two-door sedan. (The tire pressure sticker on the first 1970 models hinted at the SC/360). For 1973, a semi-fastback hatchback coupe with <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> rear seats was added to the lineup.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, the Port Authority started {{planning}} {{on a project}} to allow larger container ships to use the Kill Van Kull. [...] The expansion of the Panama Canal, which allows the passage of larger ships coming from Asia to reach the East Coast, also made the bridge too low for these larger ships to pass under it {{on the way to}} and from Newark Bay. [...] Its clearance of between [...] above the Kill Van Kull depending on the tide meant that some contemporary ships, which could reach [...] above the waterline, had to <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> antenna masts, take on ballast, or wait for low tide to pass through.|$|E

Three interior variations exist, the FR-S and base 86 models have cloth seats with all black interior trim {{that features a}} black patterned dash trim, while the shift boot features red stitching. [...] The BRZ has two available interiors, one identical to the FR-S but with silver dash trim, a red stitched parking brake boot, black gauge faces (instead of the white tachometer of the 86 GTS models) and a touch-screen navigation head unit; the second option upgrades to leather and Alcantara heated seats, automatic HVAC controls, and a push-button start. The top-of-the-range 86 models are fitted like the BRZ except as noted above, and the Japanese interior can be had in black/red leather and Alcantara or full black leather and Alcantara (Australia being offered only the latter).|$|E
2500|$|During E3 2016, PDP and Harmonix {{unveiled}} new hardware {{that was}} released alongside the Rock Band Rivals expansion. A new guitar controller {{based on the}} Fender Jaguar features improvements to the strum bar and tilt sensor, while its neck can <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> for easier storage. An optional rechargeable battery pack and charging stand for the Jaguar controller was also unveiled. A new full band bundle featuring Rock Band 4 and the Rivals expansion, a Jaguar guitar and a drumkit shipped alongside the digital release of the Rivals expansion in late 2016. With the PDP-supplied instruments, Harmonix {{will be able to}} offer the instrument-and-game bundles at lower cost than on the game's initial release; for example, the game and guitar bundle on release initially had a MSRP of $120, but the new bundle will be priced at $90. While part of this reduction in cost is attributed to the age of the game, Sussman stated that several factors relating to PDP's manufacturing and business models allows them to offer the packages at a more competitive price point.|$|E
2500|$|Upon introduction, {{the model}} {{had only one}} trim level, which would later {{be known as the}} LX model trim; it was powered by the 2.0L straight-four B20B {{producing}} [...] at 5400rpm and [...] of torque at 4800rpm. Outer dimensions for this engine would be identical to the Integra's 1.8L engine, but internally the engine had a larger [...] bore to add the extra displacement needed to produce more torque. The engine utilized a one-piece cylinder sleeve construction unique from any other B-series engine. The chassis was a unibody design with a four-wheel double wishbone suspension. Inside, the rear seats were able to <b>fold</b> <b>down,</b> and a picnic table was stowed in the rear floor area. A common external trait that was visible with this generation was plastic cladding covering the front bumper, rear bumper, and fender wells. In most countries, CR-Vs had a chrome grille; however, in the United States, the grille was made out of the same black plastic as the bumpers. A major difference between the LX and EX trims was that the EX had anti-lock brakes and 15inch alloy wheels while the LX did not. Drivetrain options were front-wheel drive or Honda's Real Time AWD.|$|E
