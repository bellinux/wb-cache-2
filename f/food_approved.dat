40|$|THE astigmatid mite Psoroptes ovis is a {{globally}} distributed obli-gate ectoparasite of sheep, {{cattle and}} several other mammals. On sheep the mites live {{at the base of}} the fleece where they feed mainly on fluid exuded from the epidermis. Infestation with the mite leads to sheep scab which is characterised by intense pruritis, weight loss and hide damage. Untreated sheep scab is often life threatening. In the UK alone, around 50 million sheep are at risk from infestation and, until recently, the only efficient method of prevention and control was to submerge the sheep in a Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and <b>Food</b> <b>approved</b> pesticide. Misuse of organophosphate-based compounds (ops), the most effective agents against P ovis, and a range of other ectoparasites and fly-strike has been linked to ill health suffered by farm workers.

40|$|Astragalus extract mixture HT 042 is a {{standardized}} ingredient of health functional <b>food</b> <b>approved</b> by Korean FDA with {{a claim of}} “height growth of children. ” HT 042 stimulates bone growth rate and increases local IGF- 1 expression in growth plate of rats which {{can be considered as}} direct stimulation of GH and its paracrine/autocrine actions. However, it remains unclear whether HT 042 stimulates circulatory IGF- 1 which also plays a major role to stimulate bone growth. To determine the effects on circulatory IGF- 1, IGF- 1 and IGFBP- 3 expressions and phosphorylation of JAK 2 /STAT 5 were evaluated in the liver after 10 days of HT 042 administration. HT 042 upregulated liver IGF- 1 and IGFBP- 3 mRNA expression, IGF- 1 protein expression, and phosphorylation of JAK 2 /STAT 5. HT 042 also increased bone growth rate and proliferative zonal height in growth plate. In conclusion, HT 042 stimulates bone growth rate via increment of proliferative rate by upregulation of liver IGF- 1 and IGFBP- 3 mRNA followed by IGF- 1 protein expression through phosphorylation of JAK 2 /STAT 5, which can be regarded as normal functioning of GH-dependent endocrine pathway...|$|E
40|$|Food for {{specified}} health {{use is a}} type {{of functional}} <b>food</b> <b>approved</b> by the Japanese government, with more than 1250 products in 10 health-claim categories being approved as of April 2016. Polyphenols are currently used as functional ingredients in seven of the 10 categories. Although they have not yet been used for the food-for-specified-health-use category of “gut health promotion,” polyphenols are expected to contribute to the future development of gut-modulating food. Intestinal functions include digestion/absorption, acting as a barrier, recognition of external factors, and signal transduction. Owing to incessant exposure to external stress factors including food substances, bacteria, and environmental chemicals, intestines are always inflammatory to some extent, which may cause damage to and dysfunction of intestinal tissues depending on the situation. We identified food factors that could suppress immoderate inflammation in the intestines. In addition to certain amino acids and peptides, polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid and isoflavones were found to suppress inflammation in intestinal cells. Intestinal inflammation is caused by various factors in diverse mechanisms. Recent studies revealed that activation of pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins, in epithelial cells triggers intestinal inflammation. Intracellular receptors or signaling molecules controlling the intestinal detoxification system are also involved in the regulation of inflammation. Differentiation of regulatory T cells by activating a transcription factor Foxp- 3 is known to suppress intestinal inflammation. A variety of phytochemicals including polyphenols modulate these receptors and signaling molecules, and are thus anti-inflammatory. Polyphenols affect epigenetic changes occurring in intestinal tissues by interacting with the enzymes responsible for DNA methylation and histone acetylation. New types of anti-inflammatory food factors may be discovered by examining dietary substances that interact with the abovementioned target molecules...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is an {{autoimmune disease}} that attacks myelinated axons {{in the central}} nervous system. Induction of oral tolerance is a potent mechanism to prevent autoimmunity. The food yeast Candida utilis {{was used to test}} the therapeutic potential of oral tolerance induction in an animal model of human multiple sclerosis (MS). We constructed a C. utilis strain, which displays a fusion peptide composed of the encephalitogenic MOG 35 - 55 peptide and the C. utilis Gas 1 cell wall protein on its surface. By immunizing mice with MOG 35 - 55 peptide experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in a mouse model. Feeding of mice with C. utilis that expresses MOG 35 - 55 peptide on its surface was started seven days prior to immunization and was continued for ten days. Control animals were treated with wild-type fungus or left untreated. Untreated mice developed first clinical symptoms ten days post immunization (p. i.) with an ascending paralysis reaching maximal clinical disability at day 18 to 20 p. i [...] Treatment with the wild-type strain demonstrated comparable clinical symptoms. In contrast, oral gavage of MOG 35 - 55 -presenting fungus ameliorated the development of EAE. In addition, incidence as well as maximal clinical disease severity were significantly reduced. Interestingly, reduction of disease severity also occurred in animals treated with heat-inactivated C. utilis cells indicating that tolerance induction was independent of fungal viability. Better disease outcome correlated with reduced demyelination and cellular inflammation in the spinal cord, lower T cell proliferation against rechallenge with MOG 35 - 55 and more regulatory T cells in the lymph nodes. Our data demonstrate successful that using the <b>food</b> <b>approved</b> fungus C. utilis presenting the immunogenic MOG 35 - 55 peptide on its surface induced an oral tolerance against this epitope in EAE. Further studies will reveal {{the nature and extent of}} an anti-inflammatory environment established by the treatment that prevents the development of an autoimmune disorder affecting the CNS...|$|E
40|$|Fortification {{of instant}} Asian noodles with folic acid has the {{potential}} to enhance dietary folate intakes. Recent studies show folate deficiency is prevalent in many countries. Furthermore, this vitamin is unstable upon exposure to light, air, heat and extreme conditions of acidity and alkalinity. Internationally, folate in foods has traditionally been analysed by a microbiological assay, however, due to the extensive time required for sample preparation and analysis, alternative procedures for analysis require consideration. The aims of the current study have been to investigate the stability of added folic acid in fortified instant fried noodles by analytical methods of capillary electrophoresis and reversed-phase HPLC. Additionally, procedures for the microencapsulation of folic acid by spray drying have been evaluated along with their significance in increasing the stability of the vitamin during processing and boiling of instant noodles. Optimisation of capillary electrophoretic conditions showed that the maximum response of folic acid relative to an internal standard was achieved using various concentrations of phosphate and borate. Analytical parameters including the effects of pH, voltage and temperature were studied along with enzymatic treatments for liberation of folic acid from the noodle matrix based. Higher recoveries were obtained using the enzymes however these exceeded 100 % due to sample matrix interference. Standard addition or internal calibration were both effective in correcting for matrix interferences. Comparative investigations with reversed-phase HPLC confirmed the results obtained with the capillary electrophoresis. Using either a phosphate based buffer in conjunction with an ion-pairing agent at alkaline pH or an acidic mobile phase, the results attained were in good agreement as folic acid exhibited excellent stability under typical processing conditions. Various <b>food</b> <b>approved</b> hydrocolloids were evaluated for encapsulation of folic acid by spray drying. Incorporation of the microcapsules into formulations of instant fried noodles showed that after boiling the folic acid was chemically degraded to some extent and leaching also occurred. The microcapsules exhibited similar properties regardless of the binding agent used, with losses still occurring during the boiling stage. In order to enhance the structural integrity of the spray dried microcapsules, CaCl 2 was used as a cross-linking agent for capsules prepared using alginate or pectin binding agents. Considerable increases in retention of core material were observed as the network exhibited a reduction in swelling and hydration, and subsequently a decrease in the release of folic acid. In summary, capillary electrophoresis and reversed-phase HPLC provided excellent separation and good quantitatation of added folic acid in instant Asian noodles. Excellent resolution was obtained between the sample matrix interference of instant noodles and the analysed vitamin. Folic acid displayed high stability throughout the processing of instant noodles whereas there was consistent evidence that unencapsulated folic acid was degraded during boiling. Microencapsulation of folic acid with combinations of alginate and pectin as the binding agents, proved to be effective in maintaining folic acid stability when calcium treatment was performed after spray drying. These findings provide an effective way to retain folic acid used in fortifying Asian instant noodles...|$|E
