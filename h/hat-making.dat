Another important industry in the area was coal mining and shortly after 1887 the company began making machinery and equipment for this industry, which included miners' portable lamps. Up to this time, miners had always used the safety lamp devised in 1815 by Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829) but this new battery-powered Davy lamp eventually replaced the traditional safety lamp.|$|E

2500|$|In 1825, the Governor of the Danish Protectorate, Christiansborg (now the Accra suburb Osu), Major Johan Christopher von Richelieu, {{upon the}} {{observation}} of the degradation of moral values of European residents living within and without the Danish fort, Christiansborg Castle, requested the Danish Crown, through a certain Mr. Ronne who represented Basel Mission interests in Denmark, to arrange for missionaries from the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society in Switzerland to evangelize in the then Gold Coast. For a decade and half, the chaplain's station at the Christiansborg Castle had remained vacant. Richelieu acted as a chaplain and reinstated public Christian worship, set up a school were 150 pupils were baptized and educated. More hands were therefore needed for evangelism. [...] In March 1827, Four young men from rural Switzerland and southern Germany {{between the ages of}} 23 and 27 years were selected by the Basel Mission. They were: Karl F. Salbach (27 years), Gottlieb Holzwath (26 years), Johannes Henke (23 years) and the Swiss-born Johannes Gottlieb Schmidt (24 years).

50|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I brought substantial unemployment. Some {{of the worst}} hit industries were those that traditionally employed women during peacetime. For instance, fabrication and associated industries such as, “traditional ‘women’s trades’- cotton, linen, silk, lace, tailoring, dressmaking, millinery, <b>hat-making,</b> pottery, and fish-gutting” saw drastic employment decline. As the war dragged on and conscription was instituted women entered the workforce in significant numbers.|$|E

50|$|The {{significance}} of the property {{is not for the}} architecture of its farmhouse, but rather as a remarkably intact site where a number of small-scale industrial enterprises were conducted. The Parkers, and later the Hutchinsons, are documented to have engaged in a significant number of businesses in the 19th century, operating a cider mill, producing both raw and processed wool and flax, and operating a small cooperage and probably also a small woolen <b>hat-making</b> enterprise.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the second}} World War, the felt {{industry}} grew in Portugal, {{and during the}} 1940s the production of fur and felt production was centralized in the factories of the municipality, {{with the establishment of}} the Cortadoria Nacional do Pêlo, which was nationalized in 1945. In 1946, 1775 people worked in the <b>hat-making</b> industrial in Portugal, while 1212 were located in São João da Madeira. The activity of this industry was later immortalized by João da Silva Correia, in his romance [...] "Unhas Negras", a pejorative reference to the works who worked the open cauldrons that darken and destroyed their fingernails (unhas negrasliterally means darken/blacken fingernails). The term was later generally used to identify the citizenry of the municipality. The use of the word [...] "Labor", on the coat-of-arms of the municipality, was intended to signify the importance of these workers {{in the development of the}} region. Regardless, the <b>hat-making</b> industries slowly declined in the following decades, with the decline in the use of hats, and the shoe-making industry grew in importance, resulting in its reference as the [...] "Capital of Footwear" [...] in Portugal (Capital do Calçado).|$|E

5000|$|As is {{reflected}} in both the common and scientific names of the species, the leaves of Sabal causiarum {{are used in the}} manufacture of hats. In 1901 Orator F. Cook described a <b>hat-making</b> industry centred in the village of Joyuda in Cabo Rojo, which made [...] "large quantities" [...] of hats from the leaves of this species. [...] According to Andrew Henderson, this industry had declined considerably by the 1908s. [...] Leaves of the species are also used to make baskets, mats and hammocks, and older leaves for thatch.|$|E
50|$|With {{the linen}} {{and later the}} <b>hat-making</b> and brick {{manufacturing}} industries, Cookstown continued to prosper in the early 20th century and its population continued to expand. Little architecture of any note dates from this period as the Victorian structures of the previous generation continued to fulfil their purpose. World War I had a devastating effect on the local community {{at a cost of}} life commemorated in the prominent Cenotaph (loosely based on Lutyens' Whitehall Cenotaph) at the centre of the town unveiled in 1927. This is Cookstown's sole piece of public sculpture.|$|E
