Carbonates keep the medium alkaline, thus preventing growth of A. thiooxidans which grows best under acidic conditions, while bicarbonates have been shown to allow a healthy growth if kept in small concentrations. Bicarbonate, however, is unnecessary because the CO2 from the atmosphere appears to be sufficient to support growth of A. thiooxidans, and would actually have an injurious effect in that it would tend to make the medium less acidic.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>CO(2)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} priorities of the scientific community dedicated to reduce global warming. In this work, we propose new methods for the fixation of CO 2 using the guanidine bases tetramethylguanidine (TMG) and 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -hexahydro- 2 H-pyrimido[1, 2 -a]-pyrimidine (TBD). In order to understand the reactions occurring during the CO(2) fixation and release processes, we employed several experimental methods, including solution and solid-state NMR, FTIR, and coupled TGA-FTIR. Quantum mechanical NMR calculations were also carried out. Based on the results obtained, we concluded that CO(2) fixation with both TMG and TBD guanidines is a kinetically reversible process, and the corresponding fixation products have proved to be useful as transcarboxylating compounds. Afterward, CO(2) thermal releasing from this fixation product with TBD was found to be an interesting process for CO(2) capture and isolation purposes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Energy and the {{environment}} {{are two of the}} most important issues this century. More than 80 % of our energy comes from the combustion of fossil fuels, which will still remain the dominant energy source for years to come. It is agreed that carbon dioxide produced from the combustion process {{to be the most important}} anthropogenic greenhouse gas leading to global warming. Atmospheric CO(2) concentrations have indeed increased by almost 100 ppm since their pre-industrial level, reaching 384 ppm in 2007 with a total annual emission of over 35 Gt. Prompt global action to resolve the CO(2) crisis is therefore needed. To pursue such an action, we are urged to save energy without the unnecessary production of carbon emissions and to use energy in more efficient ways, but alternative methods to mitigate the greenhouse gas have to be considered. This Minireview highlights some recent promising research activities and their prospects in the areas of carbon capture and storage and chemical <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>CO(2)</b> in constructing a future low-carbon global economy with reference to energy source, thermodynamic considerations, net carbon emissions and availability of reagents...|$|E
40|$|The gas {{exchange}} characteristics of photosynthetic tissues {{of leaves and}} stems of Eriogonum inflatum are described. Inflated stems were found to contain extraordinarily high internal CO₂ concentrations (to 14000 μbar), but <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> this internal <b>CO₂</b> was 6 - 10 times slower than <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>CO₂</b> by these stems. Although the pool <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> is a trivial source <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> for stem photosynthesis, it may result in higher water-use efficiency of stem tissues. Leaf and stem photosynthetic activities were compared by means <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> <b>fixation</b> in CO₂ response curves, light and temperature response curves in IRGA systems, and by means of O₂ exchange at CO₂ saturation in a leaf disc O₂ electrode system. On an area basis leaves contain about twice the chlorophyll and nitrogen as stems, and are capable of up to 4 -times the absolute CO₂ and O₂ exchange rates. However, the stem shape is such that lighting of the shaded side leads to {{a substantial increase in}} overall stem photosynthesis on a projected area basis, to about half the leaf rate in air. Stem conductance is lower than leaf conductance under most conditions and is less sensitive to high temperature or high VPD. Under most conditions, the ratio Ci/Ca is lower in stems than in leaves and stems show greater water-use efficiency (higher ratio assimilation/transpiration) as a function of VPD. This potential advantage of stem photosynthesis in a water limited environment may be offset by the higher VPD conditions in the hotter, drier part of the year when stems are active after leaves have senesced. Stem and leaf photosynthesis were similarly affected by decreasing plant water potential...|$|R
40|$|Form I Rubisco (ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), {{a complex}} of eight large (RbcL) and eight small (RbcS) subunits, catalyses the <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> {{atmospheric}} <b>CO(2)</b> in photosynthesis. The limited catalytic efficiency of Rubisco has sparked extensive efforts to re-engineer the enzyme {{with the goal of}} enhancing agricultural productivity. To facilitate such efforts we analysed the formation of cyanobacterial form I Rubisco by in vitro reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy. We show that RbcL subunit folding by the GroEL/GroES chaperonin is tightly coupled with assembly mediated by the chaperone RbcX(2). RbcL monomers remain partially unstable and retain high affinity for GroEL until captured by RbcX(2). As revealed by the structure of a RbcL(8) -(RbcX(2)) (8) assembly intermediate, RbcX(2) acts as a molecular staple in stabilizing the RbcL subunits as dimers and facilitates RbcL(8) core assembly. Finally, addition of RbcS results in RbcX(2) release and holoenzyme formation. Specific assembly chaperones may be required more generally in the formation of complex oligomeric structures when folding is closely coupled to assembly...|$|R
40|$|International audienced-Ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} enzyme on Earth and {{is responsible for the}} <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>CO(2)</b> into biomass. The reaction consists <b>of</b> incorporation <b>of</b> <b>CO(2)</b> and solvent H(2) O into d-ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate (RuBP) to yield 3 -phospho-d-glycerate. The reaction involves several proton-dependent events: abstraction and protonation during enolization of RuBP and hydrolysis and reprotonation of the six-carbon reaction intermediate (carboxyketone). Although much is known about Rubisco structure and diversity, fundamental aspects of the reaction mechanism are poorly documented. How and when are protons exchanged among substrate, amino acid residues, and solvent water, and could alterations of proton exchange influence catalytic turnover? What is the energy profile of the reaction? To answer these questions, we measured catalytic rates and the (12) CO(2) /(13) CO(2) isotope effect in isotopic waters. We show that with increasing D(2) O content, the maximal carboxylation velocity (k(cat) (c)) decreased linearly and was 1. 7 times lower in pure D(2) O. By contrast, the isotope effect on the apparent Michaelis constant for CO(2) (K(c)) was unity, suggesting that H/D exchange might have occurred with the solvent in early steps thereby slowing the overall catalysis. Calculations of kinetic commitments from observed isotope effects further indicate that (1) enolization and processing of the carboxyketone are similarly rate-limiting and (2) the tendency of the carboxyketone to go backward (decarboxylation) is likely exacerbated upon deuteration. Our results thus suggest that Rubisco catalysis is achieved by a rather equal distribution of energy barriers along the reaction...|$|R
40|$|A major {{question}} for Kyoto signatory {{nations such as}} Canada is what role our forests might play in meeting our greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments. The most important greenhouse gas affected by human activity is carbon dioxide (CO₂). Forests contain high amounts of carbon, which reflect the net balance between photosynthetic <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> into tree products - primarily cellulose - {{and the return of}} this carbon back to the atmosphere through respiration and fire. In this paper I integrate two aspects of my sub-boreal forest carbon research program, both conducted at the Aleza Lake Research Forest (ALRF) 60 km east of Prince George, BC. Clearcuts are sources of carbon for two reasons. First, primary forests contain > 250 tonnes per hectare while new clearcuts contain 8 years after harvesting while belowground respiration exceeds photosynthesis. These carbon losses total 33 tonnes per hectare over 8 years, despite gains of 1 to 1. 2 tonnes per hectare per year by the regrowing forest. Partial cut harvesting conserves the greatest amount of carbon. In balance, and after taking into account different forest management types, the entire upland region of the ALRF (6, 035 hectares) has been essentially neutral with respect to carbon over the past 10 years. Thus, current forest practices and harvest levels at the ALRF appear to be sustainable with respect to carbon. "Not peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract From the {{measurement}} of chemical parameters in 2 small German streams there are no indications of direct hunman influence on the chemistry of the water. In the woodland stream Rohrwiesenbach the concentrations of dissolved organic compounds (COD) increase with increasing discharge (W). Equations of the form log COD = a * log W + b were calculated. The proportion of dissolved organic compounds which come from primary producers of the stream is very low, most substances being of allochthonous origin. In the open grassland stream Breitenbach the allochthonous influence is of less importance. In the Rohrwiesenbach the primary production of "Aufwuchs", measured with the ¹⁴C-method by use of exposed "Aufwuchs" carriers, was 22. 2 and 20. 1 g C/m²/year. In the Breitenbach the production was only 11. 2 g C/m²/year, but the production by macrophytes and by "Aufwuchs" on macrophytes was not measured. The quantity of primary production of the moving body of water was very low {{in comparison with the}} "Aufwuchs" production. The input of coarse particulate organic matter was 634 g C/m²/year in the woodland part of the Rohrwiesenbach; in the Breitenbach only 46. 8 g C/m²/year were found. The <b>fixation</b> <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> in the dark as a possible measure of bacterial activity was rather high in the moving body of water. Sometimes it exceeded primary production...|$|E
