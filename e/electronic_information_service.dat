40|$|The report {{outlines}} {{research with}} blind and partially sighted people using <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in real-life situations, and specifically how their experiences might inform {{the planning of}} these services in UK public libraries. Based upon a full literature review, a survey was conducted of blind and partially sighted people who have some experience of using <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> suitable for, but not restricted to use in, public libraries. The methodology outlines the creation of two electronic survey formats, designed to be accessible and usable for {{blind and visually impaired}} people, and the related issues of delivery for the study sample. The data collected is included, and a full analysis of the findings is presented. Correlation was found with other wider surveys in the specific fields of blind and visually impaired people, and <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> The report concludes that the visually impaired and especially blind people surveyed feel that libraries are out of touch with their needs relating to <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> that there is correlation between users’ personal preferences and the usability of services, and that diverse and varying services act as a barrier to use. Evidence was also found to support the idea that computer access technologies aimed at blind and visually impaired people may attract very little use in libraries, without significant investment in staff training. A case is made for greater investigation of remote access to electronic services that can be accessed by blind people with their own equipment. This is felt to have usability benefits such as users’ familiarity with their own systems, and the reduction of unnecessary travel. It was also concluded {{that there is a need}} for specific consultation with people who are blind, separate from those who are partially sighted, and early involvement of both groups in testing of new services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Library is an {{effective}} source of information to be shared by people of all kinds. A good library hosts everything under the sun {{in the form of}} words to enrich the knowledge of the users. Providing information about everything under the sun, under one roof in one geographical location is next to impossible. Hence there must be a way to share information that is spread over, and that can be achieved only through the effective use of electronic media. Complete computerization of all the libraries and a dedicated, centralized server to host information available at different libraries will help in effective sharing of information. A library is completely computerized only if the user irrespective of background or knowledge, is able to access information available in the library from anywhere just by typing few letters/words.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades many Hungarian {{libraries}} have developed considerably, beyond what was considered possible prior to 1989 and the beginning of events signaling the end of Communism in the country. Some of the modernization of library services has been realized through participation in cooperative agreements. Many smaller and larger consortia have been organized in Hungary since 1991. There are some consortia based around specific vendors, e. g. EBSCO and ProQuest, but the most important consortia were four state supported programs: FEFA (Orientation towards European Development Fund), OTKA (Hungarian Scientific Research Fund), EISZ (<b>Electronic</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service),</b> and TÁMOP (Social Renewal Operative Program). Through these programs, access to the most important scientific and multidisciplinary databases was provided for the Hungarian academic and research community. They assisted libraries to create a well-functioning Information Technology (IT) infrastructure in addition to a rich collection of electronic sources. What has been achieved so far has been beneficial; however, an extension to the number of accessible databases would be advantageous.

Certain issues {{need to be addressed}} to make the traditional LIS more viable and active today. One of these issues is the suitable education of potential employees of the LIS. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish, by means of empirical research, to what extent the IT education offered by Departments of Information Science (DIS) at South African universities are preparing graduates for an <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> (EIS). A literature survey was undertaken to establish the nature of an EIS. Three major categories of information technologies which make up an EIS were identified, viz network technologies, communications technologies and retrieval technologies. A second literatyre survey was then undertaken to ascertain the state of IT education in DIS both in developed and developing countries. The motivation for distinguishing between these two nation types was based on the fact that South Africa comprises both developed and developing nations. Based on the information gleaned from the two literature surveys, a questionnaire was compiled and posted to all heads of DIS at South African universities. The purpose of the questionnaire was to establish the extent to which those technologies that comprise an EIS have been incorporated into the curriculum of South African DIS, as well as the attitudes of DIS heads towards the role and significance of IT education in their curricula. The main finding was that although the importance of an IT component in the curriculum is recognised by all DIS, the majority are not placing sufficient emphasis on IT in their curricula. There is a general willingness and a positive attitude towards the incorporation of more IT into the curricula but various constraining factors inhibit this willingness. Problems faced by all DIS is finding the space in their curricula to allocate to IT training and maintaining a healthy balance between theory and practice. Some DIS have the added burden of a lack of facilities as well as catering for students from previously disadvantaged backgrounds...|$|E
