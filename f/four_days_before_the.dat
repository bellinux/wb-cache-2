5|$|Diego Salvá Lezaun (Pamplona, 1981) {{lived in}} Majorca {{and became a}} Givil Guard on August 25, 2008. He started working as an intern on January 31, 2009. A few months later, he {{suffered}} a motorbike accident which left him several weeks in coma. Once he recovered, {{he was assigned to}} the Palma Nova barracks, just <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> attack took place. He was buried in Palma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> accident, on 20 June, Dean Mellberg, {{an emotionally}} {{disturbed}} ex-USAF serviceman, entered Fairchild's hospital and {{shot and killed}} five people and wounded many more before being killed by an Air Force Security Policeman. The crime was a major distraction for personnel stationed at Fairchild for some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Shingles, {{also known}} as herpes zoster, {{is a viral disease}} {{characterized}} by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on the left or right of the body or face.

50|$|Only <b>four</b> <b>days</b> later, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the {{qualifying}} match against Italy in Genoa, Stojković was assaulted {{by a group of}} Red Star fans who broke into the Serbian team bus. More than a year after the incident he returned the national team setup, being called for two friendly games in November 2011.|$|R
5|$|Although the Giants {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} seasons in franchise history in 1990, the season had a difficult beginning as Taylor held out of training camp, demanding a new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks reached September with no progress. As the season approached Taylor received $2,500 dollars a day in fines for not reporting. Taylor signed a contract just <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite barely practicing since the previous season, he started and finished with three sacks and a forced fumble.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand was so great that some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> game, tickets were still readily available. In terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending money at New Orleans businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Before the murders, Kovář's family became {{worried about}} his mental state {{to the point that}} they {{contacted}} authorities in connection with his possession of gun license. Just <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> murders, Kovář had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. Before entering the Družba restaurant, Kovář visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and Kovář left them immediately after entering.|$|E
50|$|Ash vs Evil Dead {{has proven}} to be a {{critically}} well-received television show, earning a 98% from Rotten Tomatoes. <b>Four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> its premiere, <b>the</b> show was picked up for a second 10-episode season.|$|R

50|$|Iranian {{students}} {{invaded the}} United States embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979. During the riot, six Americans managed to escape. They hid for <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> reaching <b>the</b> Canadian embassy, where they met Taylor, who devised {{the plan to}} get them out of Iran safely. On January 20, 1981, the 52 American hostages were released by Iran into US custody, having spent 444 days in captivity.|$|R
5|$|Jackson, Moore and Smith did not {{recognize}} Simon Harwood, the officer who struck Tomlinson, {{and according to the}} newspaper assumed he was with the City of London police. This was <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>The</b> Guardian published the video. The inspector passed this information at 4:15 pm on 3 April to Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, the Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death. Hall said he passed it to the City of London police before the first autopsy was conducted that day by Freddy Patel, which according to The Guardian began at 5 pm.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E
5|$|<b>Four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> New York Film Critics Circle's vote in 2002, Lane {{was given}} a career tribute by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. A day before that, Lyne held a dinner for the actress at the Four Seasons Hotel. Critics and award voters were invited to both. She {{went on to win}} the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle awards and was {{nominated}} for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Actress. In 2003, she was named ShoWest's 2003 Female Star of the Year, and was also a co-recipient of the Women in Film Crystal Award honoring outstanding women in entertainment.|$|E

Modern versions of the test are less severe. Water deprivation is 18 hours or water is provided for 1 hour a <b>day</b> for <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> beginning <b>the</b> test. Electrical shock is only given for a 3-5 minute time period.|$|R
50|$|Matthew died on 8 April 2017. <b>Four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> his death, <b>the</b> BBC had {{reported}} that he had died, but later corrected this, saying he was critically ill. He {{is survived by his wife}} and their son.|$|R

In his final trade, his third in <b>four</b> <b>days,</b> just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> deadline on April 3, Armstrong traded defenseman Wade Redden to the Boston Bruins for a conditional seventh-round draft pick in 2014.|$|R
5|$|In total 575 medals {{were awarded}} in 187 events in 10 {{different}} sports. Of the 42 competing National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) 31 won {{at least one}} medal. The host nation won the most gold medals, with 28, and the United States won the most total medals with 74. Rhodesia competed at these Games, winning 12 medals, but did not take part at the 1972 Summer Olympics after their invitation was withdrawn by the International Olympic Committee, <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> opening ceremony, in response to African countries' protests against the Rhodesian regime. This medal table ranks the competing NPCs {{by the number of}} gold medals won by their athletes.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, a tipster, who {{was later}} {{revealed}} to be Taylor's sister Laurie Galli, contacted Washington Terrace Police officer Marcia Gathercole with information connected to the murder. Taylor's fingerprints were found on a telephone in the King residence and matched to records provided by authorities in Fort Lauderdale. He was arrested at about 9 p.m. on June 28 {{at the home of}} his half-sister/incestous lover Tresa Taylor in Ogden, Utah and charged with first-degree burglary, first-degree child rape, and first-degree murder the next morning. Taylor had arrived from Florida <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> murder and had been staying with another sister in the same apartment complex.|$|E
5|$|The first anarchist protest came on 8 December 1933, and {{was easily}} crushed by force {{in most of}} Spain; Zaragoza held out for <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Republican Army, {{employing}} tanks, stopped the uprising. The Socialists stepped up their rhetoric, hoping to force Zamora to call new elections. Carlists and Alfonsist monarchists continued to prepare, with Carlists undergoing military drills in Navarre; they received the backing of Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. Gil Robles struggled to control the RRP's youth wing, which copied Germany and Italy's youth movements. Monarchists turned to the Fascist Falange Española, {{under the leadership of}} José Antonio Primo de Rivera, as a way to achieve their aims. Open violence occurred in the streets of Spanish cities.|$|E
60|$|The seventh day, which chanced to be Sunday, {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>four</b> fine <b>days</b> <b>before</b> mentioned. <b>The</b> sky was blue, the sun {{intensely}} bright, and the inundated {{earth was}} steaming. The elastic spirits of the family recovered.|$|R

50|$|A week <b>before</b> <b>the</b> attack, Boko Haram members killed 60 {{people in}} the town of Bama in {{neighboring}} Borno State; <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> that attack, <b>the</b> militants killed 106 in a mostly Christian village, Izghe; and three weeks <b>before</b> that <b>the</b> Islamists killed 78 in two attacks in the region.|$|R
5|$|Approximately <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{theatrical}} {{release of}} the film, a workprint version of Halloween appeared online and was circulated around various BitTorrent sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike {{what was about to}} be released in theaters. The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director Eli Roth attributed the financial failure of his film, , to the leaking of a workprint version. Dark Horizons webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in June 2007. For example, one particular scene—the rape of one of the Smith's Grove female inmates—was replaced in the final version. Halloween was officially released on August 31, 2007, to 3,472 theaters in North America, giving it the widest release of any of the previous Halloween films.|$|E
5|$|By May 29, <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{opening of}} the convention, trainloads upon trainloads of delegates, lobbyists, reporters, and {{campaign}} followers {{had arrived at the}} Union and Dearborn railway stations in Chicago. Candidate supporters channeled through the Chicago streets with daily parades and rallies. Pre-convention possible outcomes of the voting were published by a number of sources. One, from the Albany Evening Journal, predicted Blaine with 277 votes, Grant with 317, Sherman with 106, and 49 for the other candidates. All of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 needed to win. Many in Chicago knew that a victor, most probably Grant, would only be determined if the unit rule, which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that state's delegation, was to be in effect. If that was not the case, then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other.|$|E
5|$|Many of the weekend's Premier League {{fixtures}} were {{rescheduled to}} avoid a clash with the final, with some kicking off at 12:45 on Saturday and others on Sunday. By coincidence, Manchester City and Stoke City were scheduled {{to meet in the}} league on cup final day. The league match was rearranged for the Wednesday after the final. This prompted criticism from Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp, whose team was challenging Manchester City for a place in the 2011–12 Champions League. Redknapp stated that if Manchester City won the final, it would then be in Stoke City's interest to lose against Manchester City in the league match, as it would make Europa League qualification for Stoke more likely. Stoke City refuted this accusation strongly, but ultimately this scenario was avoided. Champions League qualification was settled <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> final, when Manchester City beat Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 in a league match.|$|E
25|$|In the BBC Two The Conspiracy Files: Lockerbie {{shown on}} August 31, 2008, it was claimed that one {{significant}} reason for Megrahi's latest appeal was that Gauci, who had picked {{him out in}} a line-up, had seen a magazine photograph of him just <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> he made <b>the</b> identification.|$|R
50|$|Birstein, {{like other}} German regions, was greatly {{affected}} by the Thirty Years War, most markedly in 1634-36. It was occupied by Swedish soldiers in 1643.

5|$|Perry {{embarked}} on her second tour, the California Dreams Tour, {{in support of}} Teenage Dream from February 2011 to January 2012. The tour grossed $59.5 million globally and won her the award for Best Live Act at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. On September 23, 2011, she performed on {{the opening day of}} the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John and Rihanna. In September 2010, Perry was scheduled to appear on the 41st-season premiere of Sesame Street. After her scene was uploaded to YouTube, viewers criticized Perry's exposed cleavage. <b>Four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> scheduled airing, Sesame Workshop announced that the segment would not air on television, but would still be available to watch online. Perry subsequently mocked the controversy on Saturday Night Live, where she was a musical guest and wore an Elmo-themed shirt showing large amounts of cleavage during one skit.|$|E
5|$|Peter Law, {{the former}} Assembly Member (AM) for Blaenau Gwent, had {{been calling for}} {{passenger}} services between Ebbw Vale and Newport to resume on the line since the 1980s, {{while he was still}} a councillor. An initial feasibility study of the proposal was carried out for Blaenau Gwent council by infrastructure project management company Capita Symonds in 1998. Stations at Ebbw Vale, Cwm, Aberbeeg, Abercarn, Risca and Maesglas were suggested, and the plans included running some trains to Cardiff Central via a new station at Celtic Lakes on the South Wales Main Line. Law made fighting for the line's re-opening one of his major election promises during the National Assembly for Wales election campaign in 1999. A plaque at Ebbw Vale Parkway commemorates Law, who died in 2006, and his work to re-open the line. It was unveiled by Jocelyn Davies AM on 10 December 2007, <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Ebbw Valley Railway's planned official re-opening.|$|E
5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, just <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> expected date because this would {{coincide with the}} controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose {{the advantage of being}} the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E
50|$|The {{legislative}} elections {{together with}} presidential and provincial were originally planned for September 21. However, {{in the months}} leading to the elections the parliament extended Massoud Barzani’s term for another two years. Meanwhile, IHEC delayed the provincial elections until November 21. Under Iraqi Kurdistan Election law political parties were allowed to campaign from August 28 until September 17th, <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> voting. <b>The</b> Peshmerga and police voted on September 19, {{in order for them to}} be able to guard the voting polls on September 21.|$|R
