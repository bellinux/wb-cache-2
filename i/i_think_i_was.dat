25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (<b>I</b> <b>think),</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

40|$|What is a {{chameleon}} in {{the world}} of education? What defines her professionally, personally, and why? In this autoethnography, I explore the chameleon metaphor for meanings and implications in my personal and professional identity as a female educator by seeking answers to questions stemming from Mitchell and Weber (2005) : Just who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> Just who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> Just who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> Just who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> <b>I</b> analyzed my own autobiographical journals using the four-part Listening Guide (Gilligan, Spencer, Weinberg, 2 ̆ 6 Bertsch, 2003) coupled with theme-based family coding to examine changes by choice and changes by force particular to my personal and professional experiences. Notions of home, belonging, and change as a journey emerged as themes that served to frame my identity and highlighted the importance of self-inquiry for educators as an applied practice within the greater context of the profession...|$|R

He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun.

500|$|Game Show Network (GSN) {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} air Press Your Luck in September 2001, and high viewership ratings prompted the network to order {{a revival of the}} series. Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It was terribly hurtful and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doomed before I did [...] I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice. Be sure everybody likes you.' I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake."

It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Da Art of Storytellin' (Part 1)" [...] {{tells the}} story of a self-destructive {{childhood}} friend named Sasha Thumper who dies of a drug overdose. Commenting on the song's lyrical content, author Mickey Hess remarks that André 3000 [...] "manages to walk the fine line between emotionalism and masculinity by articulating this highly emotional narrative with an almost emotionless tone." [...] The next track, [...] "Da Art of Storytellin' (Part 2)", is an apocalyptic song that represents the group's vision of [...] "the last song recorded in the world", with André 3000 commenting, [...] "I do remember thinking, 'What if it was the end of the world and we had to get to the Dungeon on some X-Men superhero shit. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> vibing on some end-of-the-world, last-recorded-song shit'".

500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to know the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and it all started coming out, melodies and everything... It was a much easier process than I thought it would be".|$|E
500|$|PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with {{a budget}} of $15million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, [...] "we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's {{going to play the}} role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [...] and Steve , but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role." [...] In {{preparation}} for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually [...] "drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little more creative than the Dude." [...] The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the [...] "Gladiator" [...] or what they called the [...] "Chin Strap" [...] and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Eminem {{mentioned}} the singer twice on The Eminem Show, his fourth studio album, {{on the tracks}} [...] "Superman" [...] and [...] "When the Music Stops", {{both of which were}} revealed to have been inspired by their relationship in Eminem's 2008 autobiography, The Way I Am. The former track contained the lyrics [...] "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice," [...] while the latter suggested that he begged to be taken back by Carey. Later that year, Eminem confirmed that they had been in a relationship in an interview for Rolling Stone, but claimed to have not been fully committed to it and that he disliked her as a person, while Carey told Maxim that it was never a [...] "sexual relationship" [...] and interviewer Larry King [...] "I hung out with him, I spoke to him on the phone. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> probably with him a total of four times.

500|$|Buffy's {{numbers are}} the most complex, {{changing}} key and tempo when she begins to reveal the secrets she swore she never would. This appears specifically in [...] "Something to Sing About", which starts with uptempo platitudes: [...] "We'll sing a happy song / And you can sing along: / Where there's life, there's hope / Every day's a gift / Wishes can come true / Whistle while you work..." [...] While singing, she kills Sweet's minions with a pool cue. Whedon attempted to make the song tuneful yet chaotic to express the main point of the episode. It transitions suddenly into her desire to be like normal girls, then changes again, slowing the tempo as she challenges Sweet not {{to give her a}} song, but [...] "something to sing about". Musicologist Amy Bauer categorizes the tempo shifts as [...] "rock ballad to punk polka to hymn" [...] that indicates Buffy's turmoil. The key and tempo slow again, as Buffy finally reveals [...] "I live in hell / 'Cause I've been expelled from heaven / <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in heaven" [...] with the chord changing from B minor to B diminished, each time she repeats [...] "heaven". When replying to her, Spike has the same shift from minor to diminished each time he repeats the word [...] "living." ...|$|E

[...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed.

500|$|The album's first song, [...] "Tired of Sex", {{written before}} {{the release of}} the Blue Album, has Cuomo {{describing}} meaningless sex encounters with groupies, reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him. [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: [...] "When I got the letter, I fell in love with her. It was such a great letter. I was very lonely at the time, {{but at the same time}} I was very depressed that I would never meet her." [...] Second single [...] "The Good Life" [...] chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after [...] "becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way." [...] Lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song [...] "is more about me, because at that point I hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her." [...] The album's final single, [...] "Pink Triangle", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.|$|E
