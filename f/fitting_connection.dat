5000|$|The {{new owners}} of the line {{considered}} how a more <b>fitting</b> <b>connection</b> to Trinity and Granton could be formed, {{and the result was}} a new branch from a point nearly two miles east of Waverley station, to Trinity, formed as a conventional railway. The point of convergence with the original line was not far short of Trinity, so that a substantial part of the earlier route was by-passed. There was an east-facing junction and a west-facing junction with the North British Railway main line to Dunbar, at Piershill and Abbeyhill respectively. Where the new line crossed the earlier Leith line, a short spur was put in to connect the two routes, although the point of intersection of the routes themselves was a level crossing at first. Goods trains ran on the new line from 2 March 1868, and passenger trains ran from Waverley station to Leith and Granton from 22 March 1868. [...] Passenger trains to the Canal Street terminus ceased on the same day. There was one intermediate station on the new line at first, at Leith Walk; this was followed by an Abbeyhill station on 1 May 1869.|$|E

40|$|The façade {{significantly}} {{influences the}} energy {{efficiency of the}} building. However, in addition to high insulating properties, modern architecture demands a high transparency for natural illumination and the compliance with inner comfort criteria in the building. The increasing use of glass {{can be seen as}} the architectural intention to combine those well-being and energetic principles. The highest transparency can be achieved with point-fitted glass units. Though, insufficient knowledge is present to use point fittings for insulation glass units, which are required to comply with the demand for energy-efficiency. Therefore, research has been carried out to investigate in the load bearing mechanism of different point-fitted insulating glass units in order to find an innovative point <b>fitting</b> <b>connection</b> system for insulating glass units to the steel substructures. This paper presents results of this research campaign and provides information on how to design point-fitted insulating glass units...|$|E

40|$|Four fire {{protection}} systems have been attached to a small building model for testing their dynamic properties. Three of the systems used CPVC (fire rated) plastic pipes while the fourth was made from schedule- 40 steel pipe. The building model was securely attached to a three by three foot shake table {{in one of two}} orientations and was able to experience base accelerations along both its principle axis (longitudinal, transverse). Test procedures involved sending a sine sweep with a progressively increasing frequency at a constant acceleration value. Various recording locations provided data showing fundamental frequencies with pronounced amplification over the base input accelerations. First the buildings natural frequencies were obtained. Then each sprinkler system was tested for acceleration values at the sprinkler drops. Sprinkler drops were affixed with an accelerometer at the <b>fitting</b> <b>connection</b> and one at the sprinkler head. Comparisons are made between the fundamental frequencies of the building and the fire sprinkler system. An analytical model of the four sprinkler systems was designed on the SAP 2000 computer program. The test frequency range providing clean data was from 10 Hz – 25 Hz. In this range the computer analysis identified all of the first observed fundamental frequencies. The SAP 2000 Analysis also identified the distinct second fundamental frequencies obtained from testing. Large acceleration amplifications were observed at fundamental frequencies in the building and in the sprinkler systems. The largest amplification was sixty times that of the base input experienced by one of the CPVC drops. The steel sprinkler line also experienced large amplification values of up to 35 times the base level acceleration. The fire systems were filled with water to simulate a wet-system and to indicate potential failures. No failures occurred in any of the four test systems. After testing each sprinkler design multiple times it is concluded that sprinkler systems should remain functional following a seismic event. Sprinkler systems installed to NFPA- 13 code (National Fire Protection codebook) standards have been proven to perform in earthquakes as well as the structures they’re attached to. Improper connectors and lack of required pipe clearances are the main factors attributed to researched fire system failures...|$|E

40|$|The National Building Regulation (NBR) (L.

Although, this regulation has been enacted, its implementation is questionable. The aim {{of this research was}} to assess factors affecting the implementation of the NBR and measures to enhance smooth implementation of NBR in Ghana. Interview and questionnaire survey were the two principal methods used to elicit data from 180 respondents. Three (3) key groups of respondents were targeted for the study, namely local authority staff, building practitioners and building owners. The research findings indicated that the most important factors affecting the implementation of the NBR in Ghana are: corruption; bureaucratic procedures; lack of public education about the building regulations; inadequate resources for implementers; and political interference. The respondents suggest that to deal with the factors affecting implementation of the NBR, there is the need to allow easy access to information on NBR and the use of one-stop shops to improve coordination. Also professionals who compromise the NBR should be sanctioned and then the public should be educated and sensitized about the NBR...|$|R

40|$|This experiment, {{following}} Rartlett's Picture-writing, {{was designed}} to show : how much agreement there {{would be in the}} choice of a sign as the most <b>fitting</b> in <b>connection</b> with a word; whether the reasons given for a choice of sign mould vary greatly, and would be rationalizations rather than a primary ground for so choosing; and whether the chosen signs were more easily recalled than the not-chosen. Six cards were shown to the subject, 011 each of which was one word aiid two signs. The signs were not intended to represent any object, although none was arbitrary. The subject had to choose the more appropriate sign and give the reason for his choice. Afterwards he had to reproduce all the signs. Agrcement in choosing one of the signs of each pair was surprisingly high, although the reasons varied considerably. The chosen signs were reproduced more accurately and frequently, the reproductions showing the conventionalizing effect of the reasons given. Choice of a sign as most fitting seemed to depend upon certain formal structural qualities of a general character. The most fitting sign for a verbal setting seemed to combine a conventional structure with simplicity and regularity of design. Linking these results with those of an experiment of Harrower's, it is considered possible that a method may here be available for exploring forms of mental organization not so far tapped by standard intelligence tests...|$|R
40|$|It is {{very useful}} and {{increasingly}} popular to extract accurate road centerlines from very-high-resolution (VHR) re- mote sensing imagery for various applications, such as road map generation and updating etc. There are three shortcomings of current methods: (a) Due to {{the noise and}} occlusions (owing to vehicles and trees), most road extraction methods bring in heterogeneous classification results; (b) Morphological thinning algorithm is widely used to extract road centerlines, while it pro- duces small spurs around the centerlines; (c) Many methods are ineffective to extract centerlines around the road intersections. To address the above three issues, we propose a novel method to ex- tract smooth and complete road centerlines via three techniques: the multiscale joint collaborative representation (MJCR) & graph cuts (GC), tensor voting (TV) & non-maximum suppression (NMS) and <b>fitting</b> based <b>connection</b> algorithm. Specifically, a MJCR-GC based road area segmentation method is proposed by incorporating mutiscale features and spatial information. In this way, a homogenous road segmentation result is achieved. Then, to obtain a smooth and correct road centerline network, a TV-NMS based centerline extraction method is introduced. This method not only extracts smooth road centerlines, but also connects the discontinuous road centerlines. Finally, to overcome the ineffectiveness of current methods in the road intersection, a fitting based road centerline connection algorithm is proposed. As a result, {{we can get a}} complete road centerline network. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves higher quantitative results, as well as more satisfactory visual performances by comparing with state-of-the- art methods.
