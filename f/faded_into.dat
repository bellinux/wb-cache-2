With a resurgence of interest in the modern print, and especially the white-line woodcut, Lazzell's popularity has surged lately. On August 3, 2012, Lazzell's print 'Sail Boat' reached a staggering $106,200 at auction.|$|E
5|$|The earlier {{inhabitants}} of the Balkan Peninsula were an agricultural people who, using Animism, assigned a spirit to every aspect of nature. Eventually, these vague spirits assumed human forms and entered the local mythology as gods. When tribes from {{the north of the}} Balkan Peninsula invaded, they brought with them a new pantheon of gods, based on conquest, force, prowess in battle, and violent heroism. Other older gods of the agricultural world fused with those of the more powerful invaders or else <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> insignificance.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the regiment supported first the 6th, {{and then the}} 5th Brigades in their attacks on Orsogna, {{as part of the}} Moro River Campaign. The tanks struggled to break into Orsogna and although the infantry made some gains, the German defences were too strong and the attack soon <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> a stalemate, with a number of back and forth actions as winter set in. These movements saw many of the regiment's tanks become stuck in the sodden ground. Offensive operations around Orsogna ceased in late December and the New Zealanders withdrew from the area on 13 January 1944.|$|E
5|$|Musidora was {{extremely}} well received when first exhibited, and {{considered one of}} the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went out of fashion. At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> obscurity. Etty's Musidora is likely to have influenced The Knight Errant by John Everett Millais, but other than that has had little influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major exhibitions in 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.|$|E
5|$|The 20th Armoured Regiment disembarked at Taranto on 22 October 1943 and {{gradually}} travelled up Italy towards the Sangro River, which it duly crossed on 3 December. In the following weeks, the regiment {{was involved in}} a supporting role in the 5th and 6th Brigades' attack on Orsogna, as part of the Moro River Campaign. Although the infantry made some gains, the German defences were too strong and the attack soon <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> a stalemate, with a number of back and forth actions. The regiment lost a number of tanks during the fighting but generally acquitted itself well and was withdrawn from the line the following month. McKergow had been wounded at Orsogna, and Lieutenant Colonel H. A. Purcell took over command of the regiment.|$|E

5|$|Most of Rainilaiarivony's {{children}} {{failed to}} achieve their full potential. One son, Rafozehana, died young of delirium tremens, and sons Ratsimandresy and Ralaiarivony both met violent ends while still in their youth. Randravalahy, to whom Rainilaiarivony later ascribed the name Radilifera, was sent to France to study but returned before earning his diploma and <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> obscurity among the upper classes of Imerina. Ramangalahy studied medicine and {{was on his way}} to becoming a successful doctor, but died of illness in his twenties. Three brothers turned to crime: Rajoelina, who violated the laws of his country to enrich himself by selling contraband gold to an English company; Penoelina, who studied in England before health issues recalled him to Madagascar, where he and his friends engaged in sexual assault and theft; and Ramariavelo (Mariavelo), who organized a group of bandits to rob the houses of common citizens. One of Rainilaiarivony's daughters died in her twenties following a self-induced abortion, and the rest married and lived quiet lives out of public view.|$|E
5|$|Rufus Wilmot Griswold (February 13, 1815 – August 27, 1857) was an American anthologist, editor, poet, and critic. Born in Vermont, Griswold {{left home}} when he was 15 years old. He worked as a journalist, editor, and critic in Philadelphia, New York City, and elsewhere. He built up a strong {{literary}} reputation, {{in part due to}} his 1842 collection The Poets and Poetry of America. This anthology, the most comprehensive of its time, included what he deemed the best examples of American poetry. He produced revised versions and similar anthologies for the remainder of his life, although many of the poets he promoted have since <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> obscurity. Many writers hoped to have their work included in one of these editions, although they commented harshly on Griswold's abrasive character. Griswold was married three times: his first wife died young, his second marriage ended in a public and controversial divorce, and his third wife left him after the previous divorce was almost repealed.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the baronial castles in England were affected by the economic changes during the period. During the 13th and 14th centuries the average incomes of the English barons increased but wealth became concentrated {{in the hands of}} a smaller number of individuals, with a greater discrepancy in incomes. At the same time the costs of maintaining and staffing a modern castle were increasing. The result was that although there were around 400 castles in England in 1216, the number of castles continued to diminish over the coming years; even the wealthier barons were inclined to let some castles slide into disuse and to focus their resources on the remaining stock. The castle-guard system <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> abeyance in England, being replaced by financial rents, although it continued in the Welsh Marches well into the 13th century and saw some limited use during Edward I's occupation of Scotland in the early 14th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{image of}} a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth {{generated}} primarily by dime-novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900, and over 21,586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890. The most notable and well-known {{took place in the}} states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, very few and far between, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied. Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment, while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a cause. Some of these shootouts became famous, while others <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> history with only a few accounts surviving. To prevent gunfights from happening, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Patton {{was elected}} Governor over Republican Larry Forgy. The major {{achievement}} {{of his first}} term was overhauling higher education, including making the state's community colleges and technical schools independent of the University of Kentucky and organizing them into the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Shortly after Patton turned back a weak challenge to his re-election in 1999, two Democratic state senators defected to the Republican Party, giving Republicans a majority in that legislative house {{for the first time}} ever. The economic prosperity that fueled Patton's first term success <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> a recession in the early 2000s. Faced with a hostile legislature and a dire economic forecast, Patton was unable to enact much significant legislation in his second term, and his situation was exacerbated in 2002 when news of an extramarital affair and allegations of a sex-for-favors scandal broke. After initially denying the affair, Patton later admitted to it, but continued to deny using his office to benefit his mistress. Later in his term, Patton was attacked for pardoning four of his political advisers who were indicted for violating Kentucky's campaign finance laws and for allegedly abusing his patronage powers. These successive scandals derailed any further political aspirations.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks later, Sultan Bayezid {{arrived with}} a large army {{to the south of}} the town and took up a strong {{defensive}} position, challenging the crusaders to meet him. The crusader army moved to confront him on 24 September, but poor discipline and fractured leadership between the national factions resulted in a premature assault by the French force against the bluffs controlled by Ottoman troops. With the allied army strung out, Bayezid marshaled his reserves and defeated the crusaders in a furious engagement in which fell most of the allied army. Thousands more were captured and executed after the battle by the victorious Turkish troops. The exact fate of Sir Jean de Carrouges {{in the midst of this}} melee is unknown but it is probable that he fell close to his commander Jean de Vienne, whose forces were trapped in a gully and decimated by Turkish cavalry. Following his death, his estates passed to his ten-year-old son Robert and a mural of Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges was painted in the Abbey of St. Etienne in Caen to celebrate his memory. Since that time however, both the family and mural have <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> obscurity.|$|E

5|$|While {{the initial}} {{system in the}} Bay of Campeche {{continued}} to struggle in its organization, a new cluster of thunderstorms concentrated in a band developed to the depression's northwest late on June18. Over the next 24hours, this new area of precipitation began to wrap cyclonically around a new and dominant circulation center; the NHC assumed the tropical depression to have relocated to the northwest and classified the system as Tropical Storm Arlene at 1200UTC on June19. As Arlene would not strengthen after classification, peak intensity was attained concurrent with its upgrade to tropical storm strength with maximum sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg). Meandering {{off the coast of}} South Texas due to the presence of a shortwave trough to its north, Arlene eventually made landfall at 0900UTC on June20 at a virtually unchanged intensity at point on Padre Island roughly 45mi (70km) south of Corpus Christi, Texas. The tropical storm quickly deteriorated to tropical depression intensity after landfall, and was no longer considered a tropical cyclone after 0600UTC on June21. The remnants of Arlene continued to track across the Rio Grande Valley before they <b>faded</b> <b>into</b> the ambient environment.|$|E
