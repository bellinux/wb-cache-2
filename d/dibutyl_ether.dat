The proposed sensors use the ion-pair of thiamine with tetraphenylborate as an electro-active species and dibutyl phthalate (sensor I) or o-nitrophenyloctyl ether (sensor II) as solvent mediators. The effect of solvent mediator was studied using <b>dibutyl</b> phthalate, o-nitrophenyloctyl <b>ether,</b> ethylhexyl adipate, dioctyl phthalate, tricresyl phosphate and paraffin oil. The slopes of the calibration graphs are 29. 49  ±  0. 24 and 29. 60  ±  0. 15  mV/decade for sensors (I) and (II), respectively. The sensors are able to detect down to 5. 25  ×  10 − 6 and 3. 57  ×  10 − 6 for (I) and (II), respectively. Both sensors show reasonable thermal stability and fast response time. The selectivity coefficients obtained from the matched potential method indicate high selectivity of the proposed sensors toward thiamine over commonly interfering cations.

The logarithm of partition coefficient between, tradi­tionally used, n-octanol and water {{is a measure of}} lipophilicity as a predictor of solute membrane partitioning. The aim of this work was to determine partition coefficients of bile acids in a mixture of water and chloroform and <b>dibutyl</b> <b>ether</b> at different pH values and with addition of different concentrations of sodium ions, and to examine the influence of the structure of bile acid nucleus on measured partition coefficients. Partition coefficients of three bile acid salts were determined using shake-flask method and the concentration of bile acids was determined after twelve hours of shaking at the room temperature in aqueous and organic layer using reversed phase HPLC with DAD detector on 210 nm. For all three analysed bile acid salts values of logP are lower in <b>dibutyl</b> <b>ether</b> than in chloroform. At certain pH values, curves representing the dependence of partition coeffi­cient on pH value intersect, and these are the pH values for which partition coefficients are the same for both solvents. Increasing the solution ionic strength, this intersection is shifted toward lower pH values. It is found that, for both organic solvents, after the addition of hy­droxyl group in the steroid nucleus (i. e. if the bile acid is less hydrophobic) the value of logP falls, especially if more hydroxyl groups are present.

Physiochemical, surface and tribological properties of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber exposed to a lubricant in a sealed mechanical contact may gradually change, in particular, at elevated temperatures. In this study, industrial-grade acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber elastomers were aged in two model non-additivated base oils, namely non-polar hexadecane and polar diethylene glycol <b>dibutyl</b> <b>ether</b> at both ambient (298 [*]K) and elevated (398 [*]K) temperatures from 1 to 168 [*]h. Mass changes of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber before and after ageing indicated that acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber had distinct ageing dynamics in different model base oils and at different temperatures. For acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber aged in nonpolar hexadecane, the rate of weight loss of the rubber was larger at 398 [*]K compared to that at 298 [*]K. On the contrary, distinct weight-gaining (swelling) dynamics were observed for acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber aged in polar diethylene glycol <b>dibutyl</b> <b>ether</b> at 298 and 398 [*]K. Based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, liquid and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses, {{it was found that}} aldehydes and sulfur- and zinc-containing compounds were leached out from acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber aged in both hexadecane and diethylene glycol <b>dibutyl</b> <b>ether.</b> The results of tribological studies showed that the non-aged acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber has a good wear-resistance. Acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber samples had a very similar surface topography before and after tribo-tests. However, the worn surfaces of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber samples were characterized by fine scoring (abrasion) marks after ageing in both model base oils. This has been attributed to changes in the steel–rubber contact environment during the sliding process and degradation of mechanical properties of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber after ageing. For one acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber sample (after ageing in hexadecane at 398 [*]K), very stable friction in the steel–rubber contact was observed...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of zeolite {{topology}} in defining its catalytic performance is of prime importance {{for the development of}} catalytic processes. Herein, a first-principles-based microkinetic study of 1 -butanol dehydration is used to illustrate the effect of different zeolites (i. e., H-FAU, H-ZSM- 5, H-ZSM- 22, and H-FER) on the dehydration activity and product selectivity. Under identical reaction conditions, microkinetic simulations show significant variation in dehydration rates and butene/ether selectivity profiles within the different zeolites. H-ZSM- 5 has the highest catalytic activity, whereas H-FAU and H-FER exhibit a higher butene selectivity. In the large pore H-FAU, the weaker dispersive stabilization of the dimer makes the butene formation by monomolecular direct dehydration via a concerted anti elimination compete with di-n-butyl ether formation. In H-FER, steric constraints due to partial confinement of the protonated di-n-butyl ether in the 8 -MR channel decrease its stability, favoring its further decomposition to butene via a concerted syn elimination of butanol. On the other hand, the higher ether selectivity in H-ZSM- 5 and H-ZSM- 22 is rationalized {{on the basis of a}} higher stability for adsorbed ether and a higher activation barrier for ether decomposition. In addition to the effect of the zeolite framework, this study further highlights the pivotal role of the reaction conditions in determining the most abundant reaction intermediate, dominant reaction paths, and underlying reaction mechanisms. In general, for all four zeolites, an increase in reaction temperature and a decrease in butanol feed partial pressure favors direct dehydration of butanol to butene (via butanol monomer). However, a decrease in reaction temperature and increase in butanol feed partial pressure favors dimer-mediated <b>dibutyl</b> <b>ether</b> formation.
