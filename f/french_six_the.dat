5000|$|Although this {{historical}} incident of coercive diplomacy {{may have taken}} place long before the drafting of the UNCLOS, the dispute ended with the signing of an agreement on 10 December 1964, which granted to twenty <b>six</b> <b>French</b> ships <b>the</b> right of fishing for a period no longer than five years, {{on the grounds that}} they delivered to Brazilian fishermen a certain amount of profit over their fishing activities in the so-called [...] "designated areas".|$|R
25|$|After Guyot's discomfiture, Bernadotte's cavalry {{arrived in}} Waren to give <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>six</b> regiments in <b>the</b> area. General of Brigade Jacques Louis François Delaistre de Tilly led the I Corps cavalry, {{consisting}} of the 2nd and 4th Hussar Regiments and 5th Chasseur à Cheval Regiment. General of Brigade Pierre Margaron commanded the IV Corps cavalry, including the 8th Hussar Regiment, and 11th, 16th, and 22nd Chasseur à Cheval Regiments.

Meanwhile, the Prussian rear guard under Yorck took a defensive position between two lakes at the village of Jabel. The lakes near Jabel are the Jabelscher See to the south and the Loppiner See to the north.|$|R
5000|$|The Royalist {{ships which}} {{participated in the}} {{withdrawal}} were subsequently seized by the Allies. One frigate, Alceste, was gifted to the Sardinan Navy in appreciation of their contribution, but was recaptured by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>six</b> months later. <b>The</b> Spanish Navy took possession of the corvette Petite Aurore, and the rest were taken into the Royal Navy. Of the large prizes, only Pompée went on to see full service, fighting at the First Battle of Algeciras in 1801. Puissant spent {{the remainder of the}} war on harbour duties and the huge Commerce de Marseille, although described as [...] "the most beautiful ship that had hitherto been seen" [...] proved to be wildly unstable when employed in the Atlantic and she too spent the rest of her career in port. Of the captured frigates only Aréthuse, Perle and Topaze were considered to be valuable acquisitions, the others only deployed on local service in the Mediterranean.|$|R
50|$|On 4 April 1792, the French Legislative Assembly {{extended}} {{citizenship to}} all men of color.

However they refused to allow Rochambeau to disembark with his troops. In 1793 there was a small, unsuccessful slave rebellion in Saint Pierre. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> executed <b>six</b> of <b>the</b> ringleaders. On 4 February 1793, Louis-Francois Dubuc signed an accord in Whitehall, London, putting Martinique under British jurisdiction until the French Monarchy could be re-established. In doing so he forestalled {{the spread of the}} French Revolution to Martinique by giving the English an excuse to intervene. Notably, the accord guaranteed the continuation of slavery.|$|R

At age <b>six,</b> <b>French</b> attended <b>the</b> Crows Nest State Primary School, continuing his schooling there until 1928 when he gained a scholarship to further his education by successfully passing a scholarship examination.

[...] After the British failed to keep their word to withdraw from the Ohio and Allegheny valleys, a loose confederation of Native American tribes including the Delawares, the Shawnees, the Senecas, the Mingoes, the Mohicans, the Miamis, the Ottawas and the Wyandots, who were enraged with British post-war occupation of the region, banded together in an effort to drive the British out of their territory.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, the UN Special has {{developed}} {{to become a}} professional 50 page-magazine {{with an average of}} 32 articles, mainly in English and <b>French</b> (<b>the</b> <b>six</b> official UN languages are English, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese). Earlier, the content of the magazine tended to focus on UN staff issues, however, with its development and increase in outreach, the magazine covers a broad range of topics related to the work of international organizations and governance, such as peace-keeping, poverty reduction, human rights, climate change mitigation, environmental protection, natural disaster management and the status of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The recent global discussions on greening the economy and enhancing sustainable development are reflected in the magazine due to the engagement within these topics of those contributing to the UN Special. Cultural and environmental world heritage sites (listed by UNESCO), find their coverage in the magazine as well.|$|R

The group's alleged leaders, Mohammed Bensakhria, 37 (a.k.a.

Rabah Kadre, 37, who was in detention in the United Kingdom was given six years, and was banned from entering <b>French</b> territory. <b>The</b> <b>six</b> other suspects, who received lesser terms, were convicted for giving logistical support to the plot by providing false documents to other group members.|$|R

5000|$|The Sissiboo River is a river {{located in}} Digby County, Nova Scotia, Canada. The {{origins of the}} name [...] "Sissiboo" [...] are not known.

According to James Secord, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included Locke's educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. Locke's imprimatur would ensure the genre's success.|$|R
