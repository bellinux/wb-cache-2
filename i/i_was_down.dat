IGN's Eric Goldman praised actor Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond Hume) for giving [...] "a likable, sympathetic performance". Goldman {{went on to}} say that the episode [...] "was a much better finale than last season", and that it contained one of the [...] "more interesting flashbacks of the entire season". Entertainment Weekly writer Scott Brown described his viewing experience as [...] "I was up, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>down,</b> I was frustrated, I was thrilled, and finally I was...well, a bit numb." [...] Brown criticized the way Charlie reacted to the hatch explosion, stating that he felt the writers were trying to [...] "get us to hate Charlie".|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien {{was a major}} {{focal point}} of dissatisfaction with Turner, with many polls showing his popularity. His 1985 book, Straight from the Heart, recounted his early life in Shawinigan, his years spent in the Canadian House of Commons as both a member of {{parliament}} and Cabinet Minister, and his failed 1984 leadership bid. It was an instant best-seller. In a 1985 interview, Frank Moores told Peter C. Newman: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> fishing with Chrétien last week, and he really hates Turner with a passion. He {{might be interested in}} joining the Tories if Turner is re-elected Liberal leader, although it would take a lot of discussion. Ed Broadbent later recalled that Chrétien harboured a marked degree of animosity towards Turner and that [...] "I noticed that any negative comment Chrétien could make about John Turner in the lobbies, he would do it. I didn't like that".|$|E

What a perfect time for us to say we are going to save your entire country, we are going to lend you billions of dollars and shore up your economy, but you know what, since that meeting with President Clinton we now have on record over 3,000 murders and fugitives down there and we do not know how many kids".|$|E

2500|$|Khan's {{father was}} born in Patiala, British India (now in Punjab, India) and moved to Pakistan {{at a young age}} {{following}} the 1947 partition, while his mother's family originated from Lucknow, British India (now in Uttar Pradesh, India). Khan {{was born in}} Karachi on 29 November 1981. His family later moved to the city of Lahore in Punjab, Pakistan. When he was young, Khan's father was in pharmaceutical sales, which required the family to live abroad in Athens, Dubai, Riyadh, and then in Manchester during the Gulf War. The family moved back to Lahore when he was aged 13. Khan has two sisters, his elder sister Aliya is an architect by profession; his younger sister is a doctor. He is a non-Pashto speaking Pashtun and speaks Punjabi as his first language. By age 20, Khan could play the guitar, bass, and drums. He put his voice to use as the lead singer of the band Entity Paradigm. Khan obtained his A-levels from the Lahore Grammar School (LGS) and went on to complete his bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES) in Lahore. Speaking of his educational status at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne while receiving an award Khan said, [...] "I couldn't make money out of coding. I was a terrible computer engineer. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> and I became an actor to make money." [...] His first amateur performance was acting the title role in a play called Spartacus.|$|E
2500|$|... 2Pacalypse Now {{generated}} significant controversy {{for numerous}} reasons. The songs [...] "Trapped" [...] and [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby" [...] were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney {{claimed he was}} influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, [...] "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It {{has no place in}} our society." [...] Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, [...] "I started out saying <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>down</b> for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang," [...] Shakur said. [...] "I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I just figured since I lived that life I could do that, I could rap about that." [...] The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, 2Pacalypse Now was listed as one of Shakur's [...] "certified classic" [...] albums, along with Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me and [...] 2Pacalypse Now went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It featured three singles: [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby", [...] "Trapped", and [...] "If My Homie Calls".|$|E
