5|$|Humans {{began the}} {{physical}} <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> during the 20th century {{with the advent}} of high-altitude balloon flights, followed by manned rocket launches. Earth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon.|$|E
25|$|In particular, Clarke was a populariser of {{the concept}} of space travel. In 1950 he wrote Interplanetary Flight, a book {{outlining}} the basics of space flight for laymen. Later books about space travel included The <b>Exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Space</b> (1951), The Challenge of the Spaceship (1959), Voices from the Sky (1965), The Promise of Space (1968, rev. ed. 1970) and Report on Planet Three (1972) among others.|$|E

500|$|After Clarke's nonfiction science book The <b>Exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Space</b> (1951) was {{successfully}} received, {{he began to}} focus on his writing career. In February 1952, Clarke started working on the novelization of [...] "Guardian Angel"; he completed a first draft of the novel Childhood's End in December, and a final revision in January 1953. Clarke travelled to New York in April 1953 with the novel and several of his other works. Literary agent Bernard Shir-Cliff convinced Ballantine Books to buy everything Clarke had, including Childhood's End, [...] "Encounter in the Dawn" [...] (1953), (which Ballantine retitled Expedition to Earth), and Prelude to Space (1951). However, Clarke had composed two different endings for the novel, and the last chapter of Childhood's End was still not finished. Clarke proceeded to Tampa Bay, Florida, [...] to go scuba diving with George Grisinger, and on his way there visited his friend Frederick C. Durant - President of the International Astronautical Federation from 1953 to 1956 - and his family in the Washington Metropolitan Area, whilst he continued working on the last chapter. He then travelled to Atlanta, Georgia, where he visited Ian Macauley, a friend who was active in the anti-segregation movement. Clarke finished the final chapter in Atlanta while Clarke and Macauley discussed racial issues; these conversations may have influenced the development of the last chapter, particularly Clarke's choice to make the character of Jan Rodricks – the last surviving member of the human species – a black man.|$|E
500|$|Another media {{incident}} started {{during the}} New Hampshire primary September 27, 2003, when Clark {{was asked by}} space shuttle astronaut Jay C. Buckey what his vision for the space program was after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Clark responded {{he was a great}} believer in the <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. [...] "I would like to see mankind get off this planet. I'd like to know what's out there beyond the solar system." [...] Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then {{at the end of his}} remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said [...] "I still believe in [...] But I can't believe that in all of human history we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go. I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists about it. I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative." [...] These comments prompted a series of derisive headlines, such as [...] "Beam Us Up, General Clark" [...] in The New York Times, [...] "Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition" [...] in The Washington Post, [...] "General Relativity (Retired)" [...] on the U.S. News & World Report website, and [...] "Clark Campaigns at Light Speed" [...] in Wired magazine.|$|E

2500|$|For much of {{the later}} 20th century, Clarke, Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein were informally known as the [...] "Big Three" [...] of science fiction writers.

2500|$|However, not all {{scientific}} and technological advances {{in the second half}} of the 20th century required an initial military impetus. [...] That period also saw ground-breaking developments such as the discovery of the structure of DNA, the consequent sequencing of the human genome, the worldwide eradication of smallpox, the discovery of plate tectonics, manned and unmanned <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> and of previously inaccessible parts of mankind's home planet, and foundational discoveries in physics phenomena ranging from the smallest entities (particle physics) to the greatest entity (physical cosmology).|$|E
2500|$|During {{the local}} summer of 1966–67, von Braun {{participated in a}} field trip to Antarctica, {{organized}} for him and several other members of top NASA management. [...] The goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by U.S. scientific and technological community during the exploration of Antarctic wastelands would be useful for the manned <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> Von Braun was mainly interested in management of the scientific effort on Antarctic research stations, logistics, habitation, and life support, and in using the barren Antarctic terrain like the glacial dry valleys to test the equipment that one day would be used to look for signs of life on Mars and other worlds.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he was not}} the {{originator}} of {{the concept}} of geostationary satellites, one of his most important contributions in this field may be his idea that they would be ideal telecommunications relays. He advanced this idea in a paper privately circulated among the core technical members of the British Interplanetary Society in 1945. The concept was published in Wireless World in October of that year. Clarke also wrote a number of non-fiction books describing the technical details and societal implications of rocketry and space flight. The most notable of these may be Interplanetary Flight (1950), The <b>Exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Space</b> (1951) and The Promise of Space (1968). In recognition of these contributions, the geostationary orbit [...] above the equator is officially recognised by the International Astronomical Union as a Clarke Orbit.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, he {{attended}} the Technische Hochschule Berlin, where he joined the Spaceflight Society (Verein für Raumschiffahrt or [...] "VfR") and assisted Willy Ley in his liquid-fueled rocket motor tests in conjunction with Hermann Oberth. In spring 1932, {{he graduated from the}} Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technical University of Berlin), with a diploma in mechanical engineering. His early exposure to rocketry convinced him that the <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> would require far more than applications of the current engineering technology. Wanting to learn more about physics, chemistry, and astronomy, von Braun entered the Friedrich-Wilhelm University of Berlin for post-graduate studies and graduated with a doctorate in physics in 1934. He also studied at ETH Zürich for a term from June to October 1931. Although he worked mainly on military rockets in his later years there, space travel remained his primary interest.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{election}} of 1964, incumbent Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson won the largest popular vote landslide in U.S. Presidential election history over Republican Barry Goldwater. During the presidential term that followed, Johnson was able to achieve many political successes, including {{the passage of the}} Great Society domestic programs (including [...] "War on Poverty" [...] legislation), landmark civil rights legislation, and the continued <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> Despite making significant achievements, his popular support would be short-lived. At the same time, the country endured large-scale race riots in the streets of its larger cities, along with a generational revolt of young people and violent debates over foreign policy. The emergence of the hippie counterculture, the rise of New Left activism, and the emergence of the Black Power movement exacerbated social and cultural clashes between classes, generations, and races. Adding to the national crisis, on April 4, 1968, civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated, igniting further mass rioting and chaos, including Washington, D.C., where there was rioting within just a few blocks of the White House and machine guns were stationed on the Capitol steps to protect it.|$|E
