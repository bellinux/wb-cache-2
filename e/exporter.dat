40|$|A stylized {{fact from}} the {{emerging}} {{literature on the}} micro-econometrics {{of international trade and}} a central implication of the heterogeneous firm models from the new new trade theory is that <b>exporters</b> are more productive than non-exporters. However, many firms from {{the lower end of the}} productivity distribution are <b>exporters.</b> Germany is a case in point. A recent study reports that these low-productivity <b>exporters</b> are not marginal <b>exporters</b> defined according to the share of exports in total sales, or export participation over time, or the number of goods exported, or the number of countries exported to. This paper documents that low-productive <b>exporters</b> are competitive because they export high-quality goods. The quality of exports is much higher among <b>exporters</b> from the lower end of the productivity distribution than among highly productive <b>exporters...</b>|$|R
5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of {{food power}} as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This {{would have the}} same effects that an <b>exporter</b> refusing to export would have. An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the <b>exporter</b> has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E

40|$|How did small <b>exporters</b> fare {{relative}} to large <b>exporters</b> during the 2008 - 09 crisis? Examining {{the performance of}} Mexican <b>exporters</b> reveals that the crisis did not make smaller <b>exporters</b> more likely to exit, grow less, or expand less their product line {{relative to}} larger <b>exporters.</b> Workhorse models of trade would predict the opposite.

5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost <b>exporter</b> of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net <b>exporter</b> of silk.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} the linkages between exporting, labour demand, and wages in South Africa. We disentangle labour market differences between <b>exporters</b> and non-exporters and find that <b>exporters</b> employ more people and pay higher wages. Given these higher wages we investigate how this wage premium is distributed within the exporting firm. There appears to be a wide dispersion of wages within <b>exporters</b> (particularly international/non-African <b>exporters).</b> However, almost all of that dispersion (particularly amongst continuing <b>exporters)</b> is explained by the labour productivity and size of these firms. This suggests that there is thus a large degree of dispersion for these variables for these firm groups (relative to non-exporters). Wage inequality within <b>exporters</b> is not driven by exporting but rather by characteristics associated with the types of firms which participate in the export market...|$|R
50|$|Research on {{the scope}} for {{learning}} from successful <b>exporters,</b> recent evidence from Argentina points to gains for nonexporters that supply intermediate inputs to <b>exporters.</b> While there widespread evidence that FDI generates learning from multinational subsidiaries, {{there is limited}} evidence that <b>exporters,</b> which are exceptional performers, create similar opportunities for spillovers. It appears that subsidiaries of multinational corporations do not generate spillovers unless they are <b>exporters.</b> This suggests that exporting spillovers can {{be a source of}} productivity growth.|$|R
40|$|Using transactions-level customs {{data from}} Colombia, we study {{firm-specific}} export patterns {{over the period}} 1996 - 2005. Our data allow us to track firms' entry and exit {{into and out of}} individual destination markets, as well as their revenues from selling there. We find that, in a typical year, nearly half of all Colombian <b>exporters</b> were not <b>exporters</b> in the previous year. These new <b>exporters</b> tend to be extremely small in terms of their overall contribution to export revenues, and most do not continue exporting in the following year. Hence export sales are dominated by a small number of very large and stable <b>exporters.</b> Nonetheless, out of each cohort of new <b>exporters,</b> a fraction of firms go on to expand their foreign sales very rapidly, and over the period of less than a decade, these successful new <b>exporters</b> account for almost half of total export expansion. Finally, we find that new <b>exporters</b> begin in a single foreign market and, if they survive, gradually expand into additional destinations. The geographic expansion paths they follow, and their likelihood of survival as <b>exporters,</b> depend on their initial destination market. ...|$|R

40|$|China's main railway line linking {{east and}} west was speeded-up in Oct. 21, 2000, which {{improves}} freight efficiency between eastern China and Xinjiang (the hub of China and Central Asia). This paper tests the impact of exogenous domestic accessibility variation on export. By employing a transaction-level customs database, empirical results find benefited <b>exporters</b> (use rail freight) increase the export value to Central Asia by around 30 % compared with <b>exporters</b> use other freight modes, and <b>exporters</b> use rail freight but enjoy limited speeded-up mileage. The speed-up effect is due to mixed channels: net export creation, export diversion in freight modes and <b>exporters.</b> Increase in export value of related <b>exporters</b> is exerted by export expansion of existing <b>exporters</b> but not entry of new <b>exporters.</b> This paper also finds exports of medium value products benefit most from speed-up, which are more sensitive to shipping efficiency than low and high value products. Overall, speed-up effect on regional development of Xinjiang is two-fold. It weakens the function of Xinjiang as the hub, but promotes its export in other international markets by better accessibility to coast...|$|R

40|$|Export-transactions {{data for}} the period 1999 - 2011 in Zambia {{suggests}} {{that much of the}} growth in the value of exports has been driven by the contribution of new <b>exporters</b> than pre-existing <b>exporters.</b> The catastrophic growth among pre-existing <b>exporters</b> is explained by the high death rate that occurs within {{the first two years of}} exporting. Approximately between 50 %- 60 % of <b>exporters</b> will not survive beyond the year of export commencement.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{additional}} difficulties that smaller <b>exporters</b> could have faced {{during the recent}} financial crisis, specifically regarding their access to the exchange rate derivatives market.

This is true across <b>exporters</b> of different sizes. The evidence seems to be consistent with the fact that greater exchange rate volatility increases the utilization of these hedging instruments. Also, {{there is no evidence that}} smaller <b>exporters</b> haven been relatively more affected in terms of coverage, costs and terms of the contracts. ...|$|R
