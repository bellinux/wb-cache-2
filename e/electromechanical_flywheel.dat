40|$|The {{energy crisis}} in Uganda {{has caused a}} sharp decline in the growth of the {{industry}} sector from 10. 8 % to 4. 5 % between 2004 / 5 and 2005 / 6. This crisis has escalated the power disruptions, which have had adverse effects on various sectors. While business owners have resorted to importation of fossil fuel generators that have increased the cost of production, others have resorted to battery energy storage systems to cater for short outages, which are limited in life span, depth of discharge, among oth-ers. These interventions have, thus, further in-creased the cost of goods and services. In addition, the rural populations using solar home systems incur high battery maintenance and replacement costs. In this paper an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>flywheel</b> battery is proposed as a better alternative in miti-gating energy storage problems. It is found that by replacing the battery storage systems with the <b>electromechanical</b> <b>flywheel</b> battery, a saving of up to 35 % on cost of energy can be made in the solar home systems and for the industry sector, the power disruptions could be reduced...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs) {{offer an}} {{alternative}} to conventional ball bearings. Their main advantages stem {{from the lack of}} physical contact between the rotor and the stator, and their potential for active disturbance rejection. AMBs are indispensable for high-speed <b>electromechanical</b> <b>flywheel</b> batteries, which have been proposed recently as a replacement of chemical batteries on-board orbiting satellites. In order to be competitive with chemical batteries, these flywheel batteries must operate at very high speeds and have low dissipative losses. Low-losses imply AMB operation in low flux or current bias. In this paper we analyze the disturbance rejection properties of a recently proposed low-bias AMB controller subject to an imbalance force. We use describing functions to analyze and predict the magnitude of position oscillations of the AMB under the imbalance force. I...|$|E

40|$|Installing {{an energy}} {{recovery}} system (ERS) on a mining haul truck {{has the potential}} to save a significant amount of fuel by recovering energy while descending into the pit and reinjecting this energy to reduce fuel usage for acceleration and ascent out of the pit. This chapter presents an initial investigation into the technical and economic feasibility of such an ERS for diesel-electric drive mine haul trucks. A simulation model incorporating the haul route, the truck and drive system characteristics, and the ERS is employed to evaluate the changes to fuel used and impact on payload for an ERS of a specific technology and size on a given pit depth, from which cost savings and fuel savings per tonne of material moved are inferred. Lithium-ion batteries and electrolytic double-layer capacitors were found to be generally infeasible due to, respectively, poor charging rate and cycle life, and low energy density. Both lithium-ion capacitors and <b>electromechanical</b> <b>flywheels</b> promise fuel efficiency improvements of greater than 10 % for a large range of pit depths. <b>Electromechanical</b> <b>flywheels</b> are judged the most cost-effective option, with an expected payback period of less than 1. 2  years...|$|R
40|$|The {{power source}} of an {{underwater}} vehicle {{is the main}} component that determines its range of travel and the tasks that it can perform. Until recently, the choice of practical power sources for most applications has been limited to lead?acid and silver?zinc batteries are a well-established technology and are available at low cost. However, they have a low energy density (~ 25 Wh kg - 1). Although silver?zinc batteries have a high energy density (~ 120 Wh kg - 1), they are very expensive, costing 20 times the price of lead?acid. They also have a very short life of 40 ? 1 [...] cycles compared with 1000 cycles for lead?acid [1]. In recent years considerable research and development {{work has been done}} on advanced power sources for road electric and hybrid vehicles. This ongoing work is motivated by environmentally driven legislation aiming at reducing the harmful emissions of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (e. g. [2, 41]). The power source should ideally have a high energy density, high power density (higher charge and discharge rates), low cost, long life, low maintenance, high efficiency and wide operating-temperature range. It should also be safe and recyclable. In addition to these requirements, which are similar to those for a road vehicle, there are additional considerations imposed by working in the underwater environment. Ideally, the power source should be non-gassing and, in the case of batteries, the electrolyte should be spill-proof. the operation of the power source should be independent of depth. This paper presents a review of the features of different types of batteries (primary and secondary) and fuel cells that have been used in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), highlighting their merits and operational and engineering issues that need to be considered when using them. It also presents a survey of potentially promising alternative types of batteries and energy-storage systems including <b>flywheel</b> <b>electromechanical</b> batteries and supercapacitors...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the overall feasibility of deploying <b>electromechanical</b> <b>flywheel</b> systems in space used for excess energy storage. Results of previous Rocketdyne studies have shown that the flywheel concept has a number of advantages over the NiH 2 battery, including higher specific energy, longer life and high roundtrip efficiency. Based on this prior work, this current study was broken into four subtasks. The first subtask investigated the feasibility of replacing the NiH 2 battery orbital replacement unit (ORU) on the international space station (ISSA) with a flywheel ORU. In addition, a conceptual design of a generic flywheel demonstrator experiment implemented on the ISSA was completed. An assessment of the life cycle cost benefits of replacing the station battery energy storage ORU's with flywheel ORU's was performed. A fourth task generated a top-level development plan for critical flywheel technologies, the flywheel demonstrator experiments and its evolution into the production unit flywheel replacement ORU...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} the INSTAR system: a high-power, cost-effective energy storage system designed to improve HEV regenerative braking capabilities by combining chemical batteries with an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>flywheel.</b> This combination allows the regenerative braking system in hybrid vehicles to recapture more available braking energy at a lower battery pack charging current, increasing vehicle energy efficiency while also potentially increasing battery life. A prototype flywheel energy storage system and electric vehicle test platform were built to test the design. A novel open loop controller was developed to manage the power flow between the traction motors, battery pack, and flywheel energy storage system. The flywheel was designed to hold 30 Wh at 25, 000 RPM, but can easily scale to larger vehicles. Experiments were conducted for speeds up to 11, 000 RPM and power levels up to 2. 5 kW. Round trip efficiency of 70 % for the flywheel energy storage system alone were achieved and battery charging current was successfully limited during regenerative braking by absorbing energy with the flywheel energy system. The flywheel energy storage system successfully returned the stored energy, minus parasitic losses, back to the battery pack at controlled rates...|$|E
40|$|Control Designs for Low-Loss Active Magnetic Bearings: Theory and Implementation Brian C. D. Wilson 327 Pages Directed by Dr. Panagiotis Tsiotras and Dr. Bonnie Heck-Ferri Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB) {{have been}} {{proposed}} for use in <b>Electromechanical</b> <b>Flywheel</b> Batteries. In these devices, kinetic energy is stored in a magnetically levitated flywheel which spins in a vacuum. The AMB eliminates all mechanical losses, however, electrical loss, hich {{is proportional to the}} square of the magnetic flux, is still significant. For fficient operation, the flux bias, which is typically introduced into the electromagnets to improve the AMB stiffness, must be reduced, preferably to zero. This zero-bias (ZB) mode of operation cripples the classical control techniques which are customarily used and nonlinear control is required. As a compromise between AMB stiffness and efficiency, a new flux bias scheme is proposed called the generalized complementary flux condition(gcfc). A flux-bias dependent trade-off exists between AMB stiffness, power consumption, and power loss. This work theoretically develops and experimentally verifies new low-loss AMB control designs which employ the gcfc condition. Particular attention is paid to the removal of the singularity present in the standard nonlinear control techniques when operating in ZB. Experimental verification is conduced on a 6 -DOF AMB reaction wheel. Practical aspects of the gcfc implementation such as flux measurement and flux-bias implementation with voltage mode amplifiers using IR compensation are investigated. Comparisons are made between the gcfc bias technique and the standard constant-flux-sum (cfs) bias method. Under typical operating circumstances, theoretical analysis and experimental data show that the new gcfc bias scheme is more efficient in producing the control flux required for rotor stabilization than the ordinary cfs bias strategy.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{growth in the}} renewable energy sector to contribute to sustainable development, environmental conservation and most importantly to provide affordable energy to isolated rural communities of sub-Saharan Africa. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind require energy storage since the source of energy is intermittent. Electrochemical batteries especially from lead acid are commonly used to store energy in Solar Home Systems (SHS) for rural electrification in sub-Saharan Africa. Disadvantages such as low efficiencies, low life cycle costs, high maintenance, comparatively short life and serious environmental and human toxicity effects exist. Since recycling is not widespread, replacement costs are high, as are the resultant environmental damage and health hazards from lead and sulphuric acid. In this thesis, an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>flywheel</b> energy storage device is proposed {{as an alternative to}} a lead acid battery in order to increase efficiency, life expectancy, increased high depth of discharge, low life cycle cost and elimination of adverse environmental effects. Due to income and service skill constraints in rural areas, the proposed, high speed flywheel systems (for long time energy storage) will require the use of low cost configurations and topologies, special considerations on the flywheel rotor profile design, robust electrical machines, simple power electronics and a low cost bearing set. Low loss magnetic bearings are also possible but were limited by time while also making their maintenance complex especially in rural areas. Conventional high strength composite materials used in flywheel rotor manufacture for high speed operation are expensive. Therefore {{there is a need to}} develop techniques to profile the rotor shape so as to improve on material usage and exhibit lower mechanical stresses. A robust electrical machine topology for high speed operation and a simple drive system are investigated to ensure simple assembly, low cost and low maintenance. vii The various flywheel components were designed using analytical and numerical methods. Two techniques were used to develop two optimal profiles for the flywheel rotor structure. Partial differential equations and analytical solutions were employed to develop the profiles. Analytical equations were used to design the electrical machine, drive, bearing system and other accessories. The final electromechanical battery prototype consisted of a composite flywheel rotor made from E-glass fibre materials, double rotor Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) machine and a drive system using Brushless DC (BLDC) mode of operation. The system was designed for 300 Wh of energy storage for the delivery of 100 W and 500 W of power and an operating speed range of 8, 000 rpm- 25, 000 rpm. The design and development of the flywheel energy storage system and test rig using locally available materials was investigated. Experiments were conducted for speeds up to 6, 000 rpm. The electromechanical battery was able to store a maximum of 77 Wh of energy. The shortfall of the system to meet its design specifications was investigated and found to have been caused by vibrations resulting from prototyping issues. A thermal model was developed to predict the temperature rise in the system which showed a good correlation with the experimental results...|$|E
