5|$|<b>Extinction</b> is the {{disappearance}} of an entire species. <b>Extinction</b> is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through <b>extinction.</b> Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct, and <b>extinction</b> {{appears to be the}} ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of <b>extinction</b> spikes in occasional mass <b>extinction</b> events. The Cretaceous–Paleogene <b>extinction</b> event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier Permian–Triassic <b>extinction</b> event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to <b>extinction.</b> The Holocene <b>extinction</b> event is an ongoing mass <b>extinction</b> associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day <b>extinction</b> rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing <b>extinction</b> event; global warming may further accelerate it in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Permian saw a major {{turnover}} in fauna during the Permian–Triassic <b>extinction</b> event: probably the most severe mass <b>extinction</b> event of the phanerozoic. There was a protracted loss of species, due to multiple <b>extinction</b> pulses. Many of the once large and diverse groups died out or were greatly reduced.|$|E
5|$|The present era is {{classified}} {{as part of a}} mass <b>extinction</b> event, the Holocene <b>extinction</b> event, the fastest ever to have occurred. Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the <b>extinction</b> of one-half of all species in the next 100years. The extent of the current <b>extinction</b> event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.|$|E
25|$|Mass <b>extinctions</b> are {{relatively}} rare events; however, isolated <b>extinctions</b> are quite common. Only recently have <b>extinctions</b> been recorded and scientists have become alarmed {{at the current}} high rate of <b>extinctions.</b> Most species that become extinct are never scientifically documented. Some scientists estimate that {{up to half of}} presently existing plant and animal species may become extinct by 2100.|$|R
25|$|Flood basalt events: 11 occurrences, all {{associated}} with significant <b>extinctions</b> But Wignall (2001) concluded that {{only five of}} the major <b>extinctions</b> coincided with flood basalt eruptions and that the main phase of <b>extinctions</b> started before the eruptions.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to alter the distribution and abundance of many species. Predictions of climate-induced population <b>extinctions</b> are supported by geographic range shifts that correspond to climatic warming, but few <b>extinctions</b> have been linked mechanistically to climate change. Here we show that <b>extinctions</b> of two populations of a checkerspot butterfly were hastened by increasing variability in precipitation, a phenomenon predicted by global climate models. We model checkerspot populations to show that changes in precipitation amplified population fluctuations, leading to rapid <b>extinctions.</b> As populations of checkerspots and other species become further isolated by habitat loss, climate change is likely to cause more <b>extinctions,</b> threatening both species diversity and critical ecosystem services...|$|R
5|$|Though the extinctions {{occurred}} {{at the same time}} as the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of <b>extinction,</b> some scientists continue to dispute the role of the Chicxulub impact in driving the <b>extinction,</b> and suggest that other events may have contributed to the end-Cretaceous mass <b>extinction.</b> In particular, volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events have been suggested to play a role in driving the K–Pg <b>extinction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary <b>extinction</b> event. Its <b>extinction</b> has been linked to the decline and <b>extinction</b> of large herbivores, which were {{replaced}} by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene <b>extinction</b> event, rather than specifically to the <b>extinction</b> of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 35% of {{echinoderm}} genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, although taxa that {{thrived in}} low-latitude, shallow-water environments {{during the late}} Cretaceous had the highest <b>extinction</b> rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the K–Pg boundary. The pattern of <b>extinction</b> points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of carbonate platforms, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the <b>extinction</b> event.|$|E
30|$|Our {{model of}} cloud topologies {{is built on}} an analogy between species <b>extinctions</b> and {{software}} failures. Species <b>extinctions,</b> which might trigger other species <b>extinctions,</b> {{can be seen as}} failures of the software components, which might similarly propagate to other components. Indeed, our model relies on two main concepts: components and the relationships between them.|$|R

5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the <b>extinction</b> were usually {{linked to the}} view that the <b>extinction</b> was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted over a period of 800,000 years spanning the K–Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the <b>extinction</b> and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.|$|E

However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 66million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid <b>extinction,</b> possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{reptiles}} of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic period. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic <b>extinction</b> event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the Cretaceous–Paleogene <b>extinction</b> event led to the <b>extinction</b> of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that anoxic events caused or contributed to the Ordovician–Silurian, late Devonian, Permian–Triassic and Triassic–Jurassic <b>extinctions,</b> {{as well as a number}} of lesser <b>extinctions</b> (such as the Ireviken, Mulde, Lau, Toarcian and Cenomanian–Turonian events). On the other hand, there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-Cretaceous which indicate anoxic events but are not associated with mass <b>extinctions.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} {{inconsistencies}} between the current available {{data and the}} prehistoric overkill hypothesis. For instance, there are ambiguities around the timing of sudden <b>extinctions</b> of Australian megafauna. Biologists note that comparable <b>extinctions</b> have not occurred in Africa and South or Southeast Asia, where the fauna evolved with hominids. Post-glacial megafaunal <b>extinctions</b> in Africa have been spaced over a longer interval.|$|R
50|$|Continuing human {{hunting and}} {{environmental}} disturbance {{has led to}} additional megafaunal <b>extinctions</b> in the recent past, and has created a serious danger of further <b>extinctions</b> {{in the near future}} (see examples below).|$|R
5|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} {{amphibian}} populations, including population crashes and mass localized <b>extinction,</b> {{have been noted}} since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived {{to be one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity. In 2004, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported stating that currently birds, mammals, and amphibians <b>extinction</b> rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural <b>extinction</b> rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{damage to}} the fossilized leaves of {{flowering}} plants from fourteen sites in North America were used {{as a proxy for}} insect diversity across the K–Pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of <b>extinction.</b> Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the <b>extinction</b> event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity. During the early Paleocene, however, flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects, even 1.7million years after the <b>extinction</b> event.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>extinction</b> of Plesiorycteropus, but MacPhee assumed it may have {{happened}} around 1000 years ago, when the <b>extinction</b> {{of the rest of the}} subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded. Nothing like it was reported by 17th-century European explorers of the island, and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present (200 BCE). Its <b>extinction</b> is somewhat anomalous, as other recently extinct Madagascan animals—such as subfossil lemurs, Malagasy hippopotamuses, the giant fossa, and elephant birds—were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous; also, some species with likely more specialized diets, such as the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), did survive. Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused the <b>extinction</b> of Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances.|$|E

5|$|Since the Cambrian {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.

5|$|The Voluntary Human <b>Extinction</b> Movement (VHEMT) is an {{environmental}} movement {{that calls for}} all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary <b>extinction</b> of humankind.

5|$|The {{decline in}} {{amphibian}} populations {{is an ongoing}} mass <b>extinction</b> of amphibian species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are {{known as one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity, and several causes are believed to be involved, including disease, habitat destruction and modification, exploitation, pollution, pesticide use, introduced species, and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and the topic is currently a subject of much ongoing research. Calculations based on <b>extinction</b> rates suggest that the current <b>extinction</b> rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than the background <b>extinction</b> rate and the estimate goes up to 25,000–45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that birds are {{a type of}} dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not, in fact, extinct as is commonly stated. However, all non-avian dinosaurs {{as well as many}} groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the mass <b>extinction</b> event. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and many groups of mammals. Significantly, the insects suffered no discernible population loss, which left them available as food for other survivors. This mass <b>extinction</b> is known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene <b>extinction</b> event. The nature of the event that caused this mass <b>extinction</b> has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur <b>extinction,</b> some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The extinctions of Macroolithus {{and other}} eggs from Southern China {{have also had}} a history of {{different}} interpretations. In the 1990s, Chinese paleontologists, including the prominent egg specialist Zhao Zikui, observed a gradual reduction in dinosaur egg diversity during the final 200,000 to 300,000 years of the Cretaceous, with only Macroolithus ranging up to the boundary. They postulated, contrary to the impact hypothesis, that the <b>extinction</b> {{was the result of a}} prolonged drought that increased the concentration of trace heavy metals, which adversely affected eggshell and embryo development of the dinosaurs causing the population to gradually decline and collapse. Zhao et al. revised this hypothesis in 2002, postulating a gradual <b>extinction</b> of Macroolithus caused by the volcanism of the Deccan Traps. In 2004, Buck et al. disputed this interpretation, arguing that the apparent gradual <b>extinction</b> was an illusion caused by reworking of sediments. Zhao et al. (2009) maintained that the <b>extinction</b> event was gradual.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the cause}} of late Quaternary mammal <b>extinctions</b> {{is the subject of}} intense debate {{spanning}} the fields of archeology and paleontology. In the global context, the losses on continental Africa have received little attention and are poorly understood. This study aims to inspire new discussion of African <b>extinctions</b> through a review of the extinct species and the chronology and possible causes of those <b>extinctions.</b> There are at least 24 large mammal (>. 5. kg) species known to have disappeared from continental Africa during the late Pleistocene or Holocene, indicating a much greater taxonomic breadth than previously recognized. Among the better sampled taxa, these losses are restricted to the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, between 13, 000 and 6000. yrs ago. The African <b>extinctions</b> preferentially affected species that are grazers or prefer grasslands. Where good terrestrial paleoenvironmental records are present, <b>extinctions</b> are associated with changes in the availability, productivity, or structure of grassland habitats, suggesting that environmental changes played a decisive role in the losses. In the broader evolutionary context, these <b>extinctions</b> represent recent examples of selective taxonomic winnowing characterized by the loss of grassland specialists and the establishment of large mammal communities composed of more ecologically flexible taxa over the last million years. There is little reason to believe that humans {{played an important role in}} African <b>extinctions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of species loss on cascading <b>extinctions</b> in food webs {{have been the}} focus of several recent theoretical studies, with differing results. Changes in ecosystem properties consecutive to cascading <b>extinctions</b> have received far less attention even though such dramatic events might strongly alter ecosystem functioning. Here we use various food web models to investigate the effects of species loss and diversity on both secondary <b>extinctions</b> and their associated changes in ecosystem properties. Our analysis shows that diversity has contrasting effects depending on the presence of self-limiting terms at consumer levels and, to a lower extent, on connectance and interspecific competition. Ecosystems that lose a high proportion of species through cascading <b>extinctions</b> exhibit the most important changes in ecosystem properties. Linking studies on cascading <b>extinctions</b> in food webs with studies that investigate the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning appears crucial for {{a better understanding of the}} {{consequences of}} species <b>extinctions.</b> The current erosion of biodiversity has led an increasing number of scientists to investigate the consequences of changes in diversity on community properties and ecosystem functioning. An important part of this research is concerned with the long-term consequence...|$|R
40|$|Current {{climate change}} {{may be a}} major threat to global biodiversity, but the extent of species loss will depend on the details of how species respond to {{changing}} climates. For example, if most species can undergo rapid change in their climatic niches, then <b>extinctions</b> may be limited. Numerous studies have now documented shifts in the geographic ranges of species that were inferred to be related to climate change, especially shifts towards higher mean elevations and latitudes. Many of these studies contain valuable data on <b>extinctions</b> of local populations that have not yet been thoroughly explored. Specifically, overall range shifts can include range contractions at the "warm edges" of species' ranges (i. e., lower latitudes and elevations), contractions which occur through local <b>extinctions.</b> Here, data on climate-related range shifts were used to test the frequency of local <b>extinctions</b> related to recent climate change. The results show that climate-related local <b>extinctions</b> have already occurred in hundreds of species, including 47 % of the 976 species surveyed. This frequency of local <b>extinctions</b> was broadly similar across climatic zones, clades, and habitats but was significantly higher in tropical species than in temperate species (55 % versus 39 %), in animals than in plants (50 % versus 39 %), and in freshwater habitats relative to terrestrial and marine habitats (74 % versus 46 % versus 51 %). Overall, these results suggest that local <b>extinctions</b> related to climate change are already widespread, even though levels of climate change so far are modest relative to those predicted in the next 100 years. These <b>extinctions</b> will presumably become much more prevalent as global warming increases further by roughly 2 -fold to 5 -fold over the coming decades...|$|R
