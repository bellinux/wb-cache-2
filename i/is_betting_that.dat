[...] "They are developmentally entrenched. That is, these basic organisational features are connected in development to most aspects of the organism's phenotype, and that makes them hard to change." [...] (p. 172) And [...] "since variation in these frozen-in features is unlikely, selection {{is not likely to}} be important in explaining their persistence", (p. 173) and Gould thinks 'frozen accidents' are important in explanations of evolutionary patterns found in the fossil record. Conversely, Dawkins thinks that over time, selection can alter the range of a lineage's evolutionary possibilities. [...] "So he thinks both that selection has a larger range of variation with which to work, and that when patterns do exist over long periods ... selection will have played a stabilising role." [...] (p. 173) The integration of evolution and development [...] "is the hottest of hot topics in contemporary evolutionary theory, and this issue is still most certainly open". In discussing the effects of mutations, Sterelny's [...] "best current guess is that developmental biology probably does generate biases in the variation that is available to selection, and hence that evolutionary trajectories will often depend both on selection and these biases in supply" [...] (173), vindicating Gould's view that developmental biology is crucial to explaining evolutionary patterns.

Ecosystem services are the benefits people receive from nature like water quality, wildlife habitat, and carbon sequestration.

However, some consumers {{are willing to}} pay more for the assurance of production practices they value. Third-party certification is a way to acknowledge sustainable production practices beyond what is required by law.

The historical record indicates that the supply of fossil fuels has consistently increased over time and that their relative price advantage over low-carbon energy sources has not declined substantially over time.

40|$|With {{the launch}} last April of an {{affordable}} lithium-ion home battery – the Powerwall – Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk <b>is</b> <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> batteries {{are going to}} become a mass market.

Similar to solar panels, batteries have high upfront costs. The massive deployment of solar was driven by dedicated policy support, in many cases without any kind of cost or volume control. There is no such thing for batteries. In the absence of financing programmes, the author finds that high upfront costs provide an unfavourable starting point for a disruptive development. But he notes that the fact that self-consumption of stored solar energy will soon pay for consumers represents a paradigm shift in the power industry, which should be seen as an opportunity, at least for first-movers...|$|E
40|$|Written for the {{intermediate}} Java programmer and Web site designer, Ready-to-Run Java 3 D provides sample Java applets and code using Sun's new Java 3 D API. This book provides a worthy jump-start for Java 3 D that {{goes well beyond}} the documentation provided by Sun. Coverage includes downloading the Java 2 plug-in (needed by Java 3 D) and basic Java 3 D classes for storing shapes, matrices, and scenes. A listing of all Java 3 D classes shows off its considerable richness. Generally, this book tries to cover basic 3 D concepts {{and how they are}} implemented in Java 3 D. (It assumes a certain knowledge of math, particularly with matrices, which are a staple of 3 D graphics). Well-commented source code is printed throughout (though there is little additional commentary). An applet for orbiting planets provides an entertaining demonstration of transforming objects onscreen. You'll learn to add processing for fog effects and texture mapping and get material on 3 D sound effects and several public domain tools for working with 3 D artwork (including converting VRML [Virtual Reality Markup Language] files for use with Java 3 D). In all, this book largely succeeds at being accessible for HTML designers while being useful to Java programmers. With Java 3 D, Sun <b>is</b> <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> 3 D graphics shouldn't require a degree in computer science. This book reflects that philosophy, though advanced Java developers will probably want more detail on this exciting new graphics package.

50|$|To {{an option}} trader {{engaging}} in volatility arbitrage, an option contract {{is a way}} to speculate in the volatility of the underlying rather than a directional bet on the underlying's price. If a trader buys options as part of a delta-neutral portfolio, he is said to be long volatility. If he sells options, he is said to be short volatility. So long as the trading is done delta-neutral, buying an option <b>is</b> a <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> the underlying's future realized volatility will be high, while selling an option <b>is</b> a <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> future realized volatility will be low. Because of the put-call parity, it doesn't matter if the options traded are calls or puts. This is true because put-call parity posits a risk neutral equivalence relationship between a call, a put and some amount of the underlying. Therefore, being long a delta-hedged call results in the same returns as being long a delta-hedged put.|$|R
