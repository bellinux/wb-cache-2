General {{description}} The SA 639 is a low-voltage high performance monolithic FM IF system with high-speed RSSI incorporating a mixer/oscillator, two wideband limiting intermediate frequency amplifiers, quadrature detector, logarithmic Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), fast RSSI op amps, voltage regulator, wideband data output, post detection filter amplifier and <b>data</b> <b>switch.</b> The SA 639 {{is available in}} 24 -lead TSSOP (Thin Shrink Small Outline Package). The SA 639 was designed for high-bandwidth portable communication applications and functions down to 2. 7 V. The RF section {{is similar to the}} famous NE 605. The data output provides a minimum bandwidth of 1 MHz to demodulate wideband data. The RSSI output is amplified and has access to the feedback pin. This enables the designer to level adjust the outputs or add filtering. The post-detection amplifier may be used to realize a low-pass filter function. A programmable <b>data</b> <b>switch</b> routes a portion of the data signal to an external integration circuit that generates a data comparator reference voltage. SA 639 incorporates a Power-down mode which powers down the device when pin 8 (POWER_DOWN_CTRL) is HIGH. Power down logic levels are CMOS and TTL compatible with high input impedance. 2.

30|$|Other {{possible}} PHY optimizations are preamble and <b>data</b> <b>switching.</b> They are {{explained in}} detail in [22]. In short, preamble switching occurs when a new frame arrives {{at the time that}} the receiver node is still receiving the preamble and physical layer convergence procedure (PCLP) header of an earlier frame. The new frame can be picked and locked onto by the receiver node if it has sufficiently higher power to be heard above the earlier one. <b>Data</b> <b>switching</b> refers to the capture of a new incoming frame during the frame body reception process of another one. The result of applying these techniques on top of SDDV level 7 is depicted in part (c) of Figure 13. It can be observed that in the CAM PSR plot, a darker red area has appeared around the diagonal. This means that the CAM PSR for a node’s most direct neighbors has reached very high values. This is a desirable VANET communication characteristic. Therefore, we define the adoption of preamble and <b>data</b> <b>switching</b> as the last key characteristic of SDDV (level 8).|$|R

In particular, here we present simulations of BAO data from both the the radial and transverse directions. We also {{explore the influence of}} priors on Omega_m and Omega_b on the tension issue, by considering 1 -sigma deviations in either one or both of them. Our results indicate that for some priors there is no tension between a single dataset (either SNeIa or BAO) and their combination (SNeIa+BAO). Our criterion to discern the existence of tension (sigma-distance) is also useful to establish which is the dataset with most constraining power; in this respect SNeIa and BAO <b>data</b> <b>switch</b> roles when current and future data are considered, as forecasts predict and spectacular quality improvement on BAO data. We also find that the results on the tension are blind to the way the CPL model is addressed: there is a perfect match between the original formulation and that by the low correlation optimized, but the errors on the parameters are much narrower in all cases of our exhaustive exploration, thus serving the purpose of stressing the convenience of this reparametrization.

40|$|A digital {{subscriber}} line access multiplexer (DSLAM, often pronounced dee-slam) is a network device, often located in the telephone exchanges of the telecommunications operators. It connects multiple customer {{digital subscriber}} line (DSL) interfaces to a high-speed digital communications channel using multiplexing techniques. The DSLAM equipment collects the data from its many modem ports and aggregates their voice and data traffic into one complex composite "signal" via multiplexing. Depending on its device architecture and setup, a DSLAM aggregates the DSL lines over its Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), frame relay, and/or Internet Protocol network (i. e., an IP-DSLAM using PTM-TC [Packet Transfer Mode - Transmission Convergence]) protocol(s) stack. A DSLAM {{may or may not}} be located in the telephone exchange, and may also serve multiple data and voice customers within a neighborhood serving area interface, sometimes in conjunction with a digital loop carrier.
