It is now made with tamper-resistant hardware to prevent information from being acquired from unauthorized parties. The vehicle can be disabled automatically if any tampering is sensed; for example, the removal of an electronic plate will disable a vehicle making it difficult for identity theft. Tampering to avoid payments, violations or crime will alarm law enforcement in order to lower risk for both sides the consumer and third parties.|$|R
