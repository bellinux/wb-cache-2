Mutations in a homolo-gous region of another NLR member, NALP 3, cause autoinflammation, wherein IL- 1 plays a critical role. Here, we tested the hypothesis that IL- 1 is a downstream mediator of NOD 2 -de-pendent ocular inflammation. We used a mouse model of NOD 2 -dependent ocular inflammation induced by muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the mini-mal bacterial motif sensed by NOD 2. We report that MDP-induced ocular inflammation gener...|$|R

5000|$|A {{much smaller}} number of people are {{insensitive}} to pain due to an inborn abnormality of the nervous system, known as [...] "congenital insensitivity to pain". Children with this condition incur carelessly-repeated damage to their tongues, <b>eyes,</b> <b>joints,</b> skin, and muscles. Some die before adulthood, and others have a reduced life expectancy. Most people with congenital insensitivity to pain have one of five hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (which includes familial dysautonomia and congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis). These conditions feature decreased sensitivity to pain together with other neurological abnormalities, particularly of the autonomic nervous system. A very rare syndrome with isolated congenital insensitivity to pain has been linked with mutations in the SCN9A gene, which codes for a sodium channel (Nav1.7) necessary in conducting pain nerve stimuli.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Due {{to their}} {{high number of}} joints, {{humanoid}} robots typically have kinematic redundancies to achieve endeffector poses. Examples for such redundancies are the kinematic chains of pitch and yaw joints that allow the robot to turn towards a gaze target. Our humanoid communication robot currently uses its spine, its neck, and its <b>eye</b> <b>joints</b> to direct its cameras towards an object. In this paper, we propose a control strategy that considers three factors, namely tracking error, discomfort, defined at the joint level, and “effort ” to control the pitch and yaw joints. Our strategy is based on gradient descent on a cost function. During the optimization, we use different step sizes to reflect the different inertia of the moved parts. Our control scheme produces human-like motions, where smaller, light-weight parts such as {{the eyes of the}} robot move quickly towards the target and then move back while the larger joints turn towards the target. We present experiments to evaluate the proposed strategy qualitatively and quantitatively. I...|$|R

40|$|Behcet’s {{disease is}} a {{systemic}} vasculitis with unknown etiology. It is characterized by recurrent erosive and ulcer lesions of mucoustunic of mouth and genitalia, frequent lesions of <b>eyes,</b> <b>joints,</b> gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Behcet’s disease arises predominantly in young men in the age 20 – 40 years old; the clinical signs of this disease are forming in children up to the 7 – 13 years old. Approximately 2 – 3 % of patients with Behcet’s disease are children under 16 years old. The diagnostic criteria of disease, presented in 1990 with International Group of Behcet’s Disease are presented. The comparison of clinical signs of a disease showed bigger frequency of vascular pathology in adults; the rate of HLA-B 5 antigen is considerable in children and adults (58, 5 % and 62, 8 % accordingly) but an aggregation of disease in families of children with Behcet’s disease is higher (12 % vs. 1 % in adults).

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the effects ofa social interactive training program on early social-communicative skills (i. e., <b>eye</b> contact, <b>joint</b> attention, motor imitation) of three prever-bal preschool children with autism. Training was con-ducted in the children's classroom during naturally oc-curring daily activities. Findings indicated that imple-mentation of social interactive training components (i. e., contingent imitation, use of naturally occurring rein-forcement, expectant look, environmental arrangement) {{was associated with}} increases in target behaviors across participants. In addition, generalization of eye contact and motor imitation behavior were found across an ad-ditional setting and different interactive partners, al-though joint attention rarely generalized. Social valida-tion measures provided by 30 raters indicated that per-ceived positive changes in performance had occurred in child behaviors and that training procedures were con-sidered acceptable.

DESCRIPTORS: autism, preschool children, social-communicative skills, social interactive training Over the past two decades, numerous studies have emphasized the importance of early development in so-cial-communicative skills as a necessary foundation for subsequent development in social and communicative functioning (e. g., Guralnick, Connor, Hammond, Gott-man, & Kinnish, 1996). <b>Eye</b> contact, <b>joint</b> attention, and motor imitation are regarded as early social-commu-nicative skills that enable young children to engage i...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Behcet's disease (BD) is {{a chronic}} {{systemic}} inflammatory disease affecting multiple organs and {{systems such as}} mucosa, skin, <b>eye,</b> <b>joints</b> and cardiovascular, nervous and gastrointestinal systems. Various criteria are proposed {{for the assessment of}} BD. This study was designed to compare performance of two internationally collaborated criteria for diagnosis of BD, namely International Study Group (ISG) criteria and International Criteria for Behcet's Disease (ICBD) in the Azeri population of Iran. Methods: In a descriptive analytical study, 859 consecutive patients with one of the major clinical manifestations of BD were included. All patients were examined and evaluated by an expert rheumatologist and diagnosis was confirmed clinically. All patients were assessed by ISG and ICBD criteria. Finally, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of both criteria were calculated. Results: We included 859 patients in this study. BD was diagnosed in 211 patients. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of ISG criteria were 64. 9 %, 100 %, and 91. 4 %, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of ICBD criteria were 94. 7 %, 99. 6 % and 98. 5 %, respectively. Conclusion: Based on the finding of the present study, sensitivity and accuracy of ICBD criteria for diagnosis of BD in Azeri population are higher than ISG criteria. So we propose to use ICBD criteria for the evaluation of patients with suspected BD to decrease the rate of missed diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), which {{includes}} both Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) {{are common in}} patients with IBD, and occur in 6 - 47 % of patients with CD or UC. EIM can involve organs other than the gastrointestinal tract such as skin, <b>eyes,</b> <b>joints,</b> biliary tract and kidneis. Renal and urinary involvement particularly occurs in 4 - 23 % of patients with IBD. Among the renal complications of IBD, seconfary amyloidosis (AA-type, AAA) is a rare but serious complication. renal amyloidosis has been proven {{to be the most}} common lethal manifestation of IBD-associated amyloidosis, since renal involvement rapidly leads to end-stage renal failure. A few studies suggest that AAA is more prevalent in CD than in UC, mainly occurring in male patients with an extensive long-lasting and penetrating ddisease pattern. The therapeutic approaches of IBD-associated AAA are based both on control of the chronic inflammatory process that causes the production and storage of serum amyloid A (SAA), which is a precursor of the amyloid, as well as on destabilizing amyloid fibrils so that they can no longer maintain their pleated sheet configuration; however, in patients with end-stage renal disease, the only therapeutic options still available are hemodyalisis and renal transplantation. Whether effective treatment exists for AAA remain controversial...|$|R
