40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} design and {{implementation}} of a <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>module</b> {{as a part of}} a decision support system for handling large incomplete databases. Maybe algebra and attribute maybe algebra operations were introduced and implemented as extensions to the relational algebra operations. These operations give a user the opportunity to investigate the set of data containing null values (i. e. incomplete tuples) to draw his/her own conclusions. However, some of these operations may generate enormous and/or erroneous data. Moreover, under the maybe operations, some of the resultant data may not provide useful information for the user. A decision support system based on an artificial neural network is proposed to increase data quality in the presence of missing/incomplete information. Based on the learned knowledge, the neural network can filter out the undesirable data. In the proposed decision support system, a <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>module</b> plays a vital role in generating training data (training pairs). Data semantics of the underlying databases (e. g. data dependency conditions) is the main source from which such a knowledge can be acquired. It is demonstrated that the knowledge acquisition can be accomplished by using a two-level hierarchical structured model. Finally, some simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>module...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> {{mechanisms}} for a logical knowledge base including hypotheses Mitsuru Ishizuka and Tetsusi Matsuda* A hypothesis-based reasoning system handles a knowledge base including complete (fact) and incomplete (hypothesis) knowledge. The {{handling of the}} incomplete knowledge {{plays an important role}} in realizing advanced AI functions such as commonsense, flexible matching, learning, etc. From both theoretical and practical viewpoints, the hypothesis-based logical reasoning system can be considered to be an important start point towards a next-generation knowledge base architecture. This paper describes an enhanced knowledge representation of the hypothetical reasoning system designed particularly for interactive diagnosis problems. The mechanisms of two <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>modules</b> developed for this knowledge base including hypotheses are then described. The first module, which is based on an inductive inference mechanism for the knowledge including hypotheses, enables multiple-concept formation from given examples. The key technology of this mechanism is a minimum generalization extended to the knowledge including hypotheses. The second module provides knowledge assimilation and management functions for the frame knowledge base constructed on the hypothetical reasoning system. That is, this module enables the following functions: (1) the system can assimilate new knowledge while maintaining the consistency and nonredundancy of the knowledge base; (2) the system rearranges the knowledge base when existing knowlege is deleted; and (3) the system can control the inheritance link of the frame knowledge base in response to an input indicating that the property inheritance from an upper frame is denied as an exceptional case.

40|$|Abstract: The {{planning}} of an adequate nutritional support {{for meeting the}} metabolic requirements of sick neonates is a tedious time consuming calculation, needs practical expert knowledge and involves the risk of introducing possibly fatal errors. We therefore developed the interactive support system VIE–PNN for calcu-lating the composition of parenteral nutrition solutions (PNS) for neonates at intensive care units. The aims were to avoid errors within certain limits, to save time, and to keep data for further statistical analysis. We combined textbook rules of nutrition planning {{with the knowledge of}} experienced physicians. The dynamic and static knowledge is represented in frame structure and backward chaining rules. The daily requirements are determined in units per kilogram body weight and have to be adjusted according to the patient’s age, its body weight, and its clinical conditions (e. g. specific diseases, past and present–day blood analysis). The system uses default values and strategies of estimation in the absence of real values. The physician has the possibility to accept or to adjust proposed values on the screen. VIE–PNN offers the possibility to adjust compositions of the PNS to the total fluid intake, which is often difficult when total fluid allowance is restricted. This task is time consuming if done systematically by hand. Finally, the PNS may be reduced according to the proportion of oral feedings. The final output is a PNS schedule form, which can directly be used in the case history of neonates. A <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>module</b> supports th...|$|E

The <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Acquisition</b> <b>Module</b> (KAM) is a microcomputer-based expert system designed to assist knowledge engineers, analysts, and other specialists in extracting useful knowledge from large volumes of digitized text and text-based files.

This allows the user to cluster extracts based on specific topics. Because KAM formalizes diverse knowledge, {{it can be used}} by a variety of expert systems and automated reasoning applications.
