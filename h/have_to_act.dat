5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so he did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E
5|$|Every five years, two censors {{were elected}} for an eighteen-month term. Since the {{censorship}} {{was the most}} prestigious of all offices, usually only former consuls were elected to it. Censors were elected by the assembly of Roman Soldiers, the Centuriate Assembly, usually after the new consuls and praetors for the year began their term. After the censors had been elected, the Centuriate Assembly granted the new censors censorial power. Censors did not have imperium powers, {{and they were not}} accompanied by any lictors. In addition, they did not have the power to convene the Roman Senate or Roman assemblies. Technically they outranked all other ordinary magistrates (including consuls and praetors). This ranking, however, was solely a result of their prestige, rather than any real power they had. Since the office could be easily abused (as a result of its power over every ordinary citizen), only former consuls (usually patrician consuls) were elected to the office. This is what gave the office its prestige. Their actions could not be vetoed by any magistrate other than a plebeian tribune, or a fellow censor. No other ordinary magistrate could veto a censor because no ordinary magistrate technically outranked a censor. Tribunes, by virtue of their sacrosanctity as the representatives of the people, could veto anything or anyone. Censors usually did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in unison, but if a censor wanted to reduce the status of a citizen in a census, he had to act in unison with his colleague.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{hoped that}} private shipyards {{would be able}} to build the ships on a fixed-cost basis. This {{turned out not to be}} the case; the shipbuilding industry was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Moreover, none of the shipyards being considered for the work had the facilities to build the fast ferries. BC Ferries had no choice but to do the work itself on a cost-plus basis. It would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as project manager and assume the risk of the fast ferries. Catamaran Ferries International (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Ferries, was incorporated in March 1996 to carry out the work and construction started later that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in his {{argument}} is that when people engage in trade, run a business or work in a job, they adopt and personify (personally represent) a certain function, role or behaviour pattern which is required of them to serve their obligations; their consent to the applicable rules is assumed, as a necessity {{to succeed in the}} activities. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> this way, because of the co-operative relationships they necessarily have to work with in the division of labour. People have to conform to them, whether they like it or not. If they take on a role, they have to fulfill the packet of tasks {{which is part of the}} job.|$|E
25|$|The scrum-half is {{the link}} between the {{forwards}} and the backs. They receive the ball from the line-out and remove the ball {{from the back of the}} scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half. They also feed the scrum and sometimes <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as a fourth loose forward. Along with the fly-half, they make many of the tactical decisions on the field. During general play, the scrum-half is generally the player who receives the ball from the forwards and passes it to the backs. They are good communicators, especially at directing the forwards around, and their aim is to provide the backs with clean ball. Good scrum-halves have an excellent pass, a good tactical kick and are deceptive runners. At defensive scrums they put pressure on the opposition scrum-half or defend the blindside. On defence in open play they generally cover for deep kicks after the ball has been passed wide. Traditionally, scrum-halves have been the smallest players on the team, but many modern scrum-halves are a similar size to the other players in the team.|$|E

After completing workouts, which included weights and circuit training, she insisted on training for boxing. Later, boxing was made {{a part of her}} daily workout. She was trained by Kom's coaches to learn her distinct boxing style. Chopra explained that she did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> like a boxer, but had to become one and said [...] "To learn boxing was a religion. Today, I can play the sport as I know the rules, body posture, foot work, I can hit, I can defend. I know the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus {{wrote the}} song in a short span of time {{concerning}} a fictional breakup with a girlfriend. Hoppus described a scenario, detailed in the lyrics, where former lovers meet in public and one is with someone new. [...] "It really hurts when you aren't the person feeling the love, but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> like it's cool to save face," [...] he said in 1998. He felt the song's creation, which was spontaneous, worked to its favor: [...] "If you work on a song for weeks and weeks, you're forcing it." [...] The signature guitar line for [...] "Dammit" [...] was created on an acoustic guitar that was missing two strings. Guitarist Tom DeLonge considered the song a breakthrough in the band's songwriting.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Daenerys has to eat a horse's heart was filmed in The Paint Hall studio in Belfast. There, the {{production}} built the Dothraki temple in which the scene is set – a large semicircular structure of wood and woven reeds, inspired by Marsh Arab constructions. [...] The heart actress Emilia Clarke ate was, according to Weiss, [...] "basically a giant, three-pound gummi bear covered in fake sugar blood – which has the added attraction of drawing real flies." [...] Through repeated takes, Clarke did have to eat much of the sugary heart. She said that it tasted of bleach and was made tough and gristly {{by the addition of}} valves made from [...] "something like dried pasta." [...] Clarke did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in the shots {{at the end of the}} {{scene in which}} Daenerys almost throws up the last bit of heart, as she was indeed close to vomiting at that point.|$|E

500|$|On December 10, the Americans set {{up their}} largest battery of {{artillery}} [...] from the walls. [...] The frozen ground prevented the Americans from entrenching the artillery, so they fashioned a wall out of snow blocks. [...] This battery was used to fire on the city, but the damage it did was of little consequence. [...] Montgomery realized {{he was in a}} very difficult position, because the frozen ground prevented the digging of trenches, and his lack of heavy weapons made it impossible to breach the city's defenses. [...] The enlistments of Arnold's men were expiring {{at the end of the}} year, and no ammunition was on the way from the colonies. Furthermore, it was very likely that British reinforcements would arrive in the spring, meaning he would either <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> or withdraw. [...] Montgomery believed his only chance to take the city was during a snowstorm at night, when his men could scale the walls undetected.|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E
500|$|The American {{military}} establishment strongly backed Diệm. Colonel Edward Lansdale, a CIA agent who helped entrench Diệm {{in power in}} 1955, ridiculed Durbrow's comments and called on the Eisenhower administration to recall the ambassador. Lansdale said that [...] "It is most doubtful that Ambassador Durbrow has any personal stature remaining. Diệm must feel that Durbrow sided with the rebels emotionally. Perhaps he feels that Durbrow's remarks over the months helped incite the revolt." [...] Lansdale criticised Durbrow: [...] "At the most critical moment of the coup, the U.S. Ambassador urged Diệm {{to give in to}} rebel demands to avoid bloodshed." [...] Lieutenant General Lionel McGarr, the new commander of the Military Assistance Advisory Group, agreed with Lansdale. McGarr had been in contact with both the rebel and loyalist units during the standoff and credited the failure of the coup to the [...] "courageous action of Diệm coupled with loyalty and versatility of commanders bringing troops into Saigon". McGarr asserted that [...] "Diệm has emerged from this severe test in position of greater strength with visible proof of sincere support behind him both in armed forces and civilian population." [...] General Lyman Lemnitzer, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff said that [...] "When you have rebellious forces against you, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> forcibly and not restrain your friends. The main point is that sometimes bloodshed can't be avoided and that those in power must act decisively." [...] The State Department advised President Dwight David Eisenhower to send Diệm a congratulatory message, but Durbrow objected, arguing that Diệm would interpret the message as an unqualified endorsement of his rule and prevent him from [...] "grasping and heeding lessons of [...] coup".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Clark {{joined a}} panel of about 20 {{prominent}} Arab and one other non-Arab lawyers to defend Saddam Hussein in his trial before the Iraqi Special Tribunal. Clark appeared before the Iraqi Special Tribunal in late November 2005 arguing [...] "that it failed to respect basic human rights and was illegal because it was formed {{as a consequence of}} the United States' illegal war of aggression against the people of Iraq." [...] Clark said that unless the trial was seen as [...] "absolutely fair", it would [...] "divide rather than reconcile Iraq". Christopher Hitchens claimed that Clark was admitting Hussein's guilt when Clark reportedly stated in a 2005 BBC interview: [...] "He [...] had this huge war going on, and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> firmly when you have an assassination attempt".|$|E

This note influenced the Gough brothers in being willing {{to remain in the}} Army, albeit with a written guarantee that the Army would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> against Ulster. After Roberts's lobbying, the King insisted that Asquith make no further troop movements in Ulster without consulting him.|$|E
2500|$|After the British {{version of}} the show ended its run, Mochrie joined the American version of Whose Line hosted by Drew Carey on ABC. He was brought on {{alongside}} Ryan Stiles, {{who was also a}} regular member of the UK cast. Mochrie appeared on every episode from its debut in August 1998 to its finale in 2006. He noted his favourite games as [...] "Scenes From a Hat", where he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> out scenes based on suggestions by audience members, and [...] "Whose Line" [...] where he and Stiles would act out a scene and have to add in lines written on pieces of paper. He felt that his weak spots were the musical segments and the [...] "Hoedown" [...] game, which he said was the only time during the show when he felt total fear. Mochrie, who cannot sing, usually spoke his lines instead of singing them.|$|E
