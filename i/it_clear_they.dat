5|$|Despite being a {{continuous}} oval bowl, {{each side of}} the stadium is named {{in the manner of a}} traditional football ground. All sides were initially named by compass direction (North Stand and South Stand for the ends, East Stand and West Stand for the sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the Colin Bell Stand in honour of the former player. The vote was almost cancelled (and the stand instead named after Joe Mercer) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> still wished the stand named after their hero. The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club's Maine Road ground.|$|E
5|$|By 360, Gaul was {{sufficiently}} secure to permit Julian to despatch reinforcements of about 3,000 men under magister armorum Lupicinus to Britain, which {{had suffered a}} serious land and sea invasion by the Picts of Caledonia (Scotland) and the Scoti of Hibernia (Ireland). But at the same time, Julian received a demand from Constantius, who {{was unaware of the}} British expedition, that he send 4 auxilia palatina regiments plus select squadrons of cavalry (about 2,500 men) under Lupicinus to the East as reinforcements for the war against the Persians. This triggered a near-mutiny by Julian's soldiers, who again proclaimed him Augustus. He again refused, but this time, the troops insisted, making <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> would mutiny if he refused and march against Constantius with or without him. Alarmed, but also secretly pleased, Julian accepted the title and wrote an apologetic letter to Constantius explaining why he had felt it necessary to bow to his soldiers' wishes and requesting his ratification. But this was refused by Constantius, who replied demanding that Julian revert to Caesar status. Julian ignored the order, but to prove his good faith and also to keep his near-mutinous troops occupied, he crossed the Rhine and attacked the Attuarii tribe of the Frankish confederation.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Pawlenty {{wanted to}} run for governor, but party leaders made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> favored {{businessman}} Brian Sullivan. Pawlenty then decided on the U.S. Senate, but he abandoned those plans when Vice President Dick Cheney asked him to step aside and allow former St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman to challenge Senator Paul Wellstone without Republican primary opposition. Pawlenty returned to his original ambition and won a hard-fought and narrow victory over Sullivan in the Republican party primary election.|$|E
5000|$|The {{explosion}} damaged over 90 homes, {{blowing out}} windows and knocking some houses off their foundations. Officials believed {{that some of}} the more extensively damaged houses would have to be leveled and rebuilt. Some of the buildings damaged included a bakery, boats at a nearby marina, and the New England Home for the Deaf, an assisted-living facility for people who are deaf or deafblind and elderly residents requiring constant care. [...] "These people are extremely fragile," [...] said state Rep. Ted Speliotis, D-Danvers, whose district includes the affected area. [...] "Many of them have Alzheimer's and other illnesses. <b>It's</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> can't stay here long, but <b>it's</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> won't be able to return for quite a while." ...|$|R

25|$|Until 1972, {{containing}} the guerrillas {{was little more}} than a police action. Even as late as August 1975 when Rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at Victoria Falls for negotiations brokered by South Africa and Zambia, the talks never got beyond the procedural phase. Rhodesian representatives made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule. However, the situation changed dramatically after the end of Portuguese colonial rule in Mozambique in 1975. Rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even South Africa, its only real ally, pressed for a settlement.|$|E
25|$|In general, airport runways {{that are}} closed are not {{normally}} lighted, to make <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> {{are not in}} use. At Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport, a single switch controlled green lights on the common taxiway to both runways and on the centreline of runway 05R. Civil Aeronautics Administration Deputy Director Chang Kuo-cheng said runway 05L was fully lit on Tuesday night by white and yellow lights and only the green centreline lighting was illuminated on closed runway 05R. On the taxiway to the runways, four large signs point the way to runway 05L, he added, and he refused to state explicitly that pilot error was {{the primary cause of}} the mix-up.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there was}} a narrow {{majority}} in the Cabinet for drastic reductions in spending, the minority included senior ministers such as Arthur Henderson who made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> would resign rather than acquiesce in the cuts. With this unworkable split, on 24 August 1931 MacDonald submitted his resignation and then agreed, on the urging of King George V to form a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals. With Henderson taking the lead, MacDonald, Snowden, and Thomas were quickly expelled from the Labour Party. They responded by forming a new National Labour group, which provided a nominal party base for the expelled MPs but received little support in the country or the unions. Great anger in the labour movement greeted MacDonald's move. Riots took place in protest in Glasgow and Manchester. Many in the Labour Party viewed this as a cynical move by MacDonald to rescue his career, and accused him of 'betrayal'. MacDonald, however, argued that the sacrifice was for the common good.|$|E

Du Lhut and the censitaire raised their muskets, and the two crippled men lay still.|$|R
500|$|In 2007, the {{two teams}} agreed to {{schedule}} a rematch for September 6, 2010. Deborah Yow stated that, [...] "The citizens of Maryland have made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> want this game." [...] Alluding to the Navy athletic staff's perceived reticence, she added, [...] "We got past the Charlotte situation." [...] The delay in scheduling was attributed {{to the need for}} a three-way contract between Maryland, Navy, and the stadium tenants, the Baltimore Ravens. For this reason, a renewal as far off as 2014 was not seriously discussed. Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "I {{would like to see it}} as an annual game, but that's not for me to decide." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{began the}} 1997–98 season well, but {{struggled}} in November; though they beat Manchester United at Highbury without the suspended Dennis Bergkamp. This was their only league win throughout the month. Defeat {{at home to}} Blackburn Rovers left the club in sixth position before Christmas and seemingly out of contention for the title. Striker Ian Wright was booed off by supporters over his performance, which he responded to by criticising the crowd from the dressing room window. Wenger called for an urgent team meeting, where [...] "home truths were spoken, fingers pointed, players were geed up." [...] The squad dictated how the conversation went, which the senior defenders made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> wanted Vieira and Petit to provide cover.|$|E
500|$|Braham and Walsh {{were taken}} {{across the border}} by train to Germany {{and sent to the}} Luftwaffe {{interrogation}} centre at Oberursel, near Frankfurt. Along the journey the train stopped because of air raids throughout the day and night. The German guards made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> had disdain for the British airmen. When civilians saw them in the carriages and the stations insults and death threats were shouted at them. Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Propaganda Minister, had painted all British and Allied airmen as [...] "terror flyers" [...] and his message resonated with civilians. At one point, a group of drunk German soldiers threatened them with bayonets and tried forcing their way into the carriage of the over-crowded train. Braham feared for his life but the situation was restored when a young SS officer shouted an order and put a stop to it.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} {{phase of the}} {{uprising}} the rebels seized control of small towns and villages. Đurišić fought alongside communist insurgents and led a successful attack on Berane. During the heaviest fighting he distinguished himself and {{emerged as one of}} the main commanders of the uprising. After nearly two days of house-to-house fighting to capture Berane, he was involved in negotiating the surrender of the surviving Italian troops. Following the Italian surrender, he objected to the instructions he received from the communists regarding the handling of Italian prisoners. During the uprising, Đurišić also fought against Drljević's forces. Following the Italians' removal from the Lim valley, Đurišić urged rebels to march on Rožaje and Kosovska Mitrovica and attack the Muslims and Albanians there, whom he considered [...] "anational". The leaders of the uprising made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> considered such an action unacceptable.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wider}} countercultural {{context of the}} time, with disillusion {{increasingly}} rife with each post-Woodstock rock event, commentators viewed the concerts as, {{in the words of}} Rolling Stone, [...] "a brief incandescent revival of all that was best about the Sixties". Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden likened it to a [...] "rediscovery of faith", adding: [...] "Harrison had put rock music back on course." [...] Among Harrison's biographers, Alan Clayson describes the 1971–72 period covering the concerts and their associated releases as [...] "the George Harrison Moment", while Gary Tillery has written: [...] "The Concert for Bangladesh sealed Harrison's stature as something more than just a major celebrity... He changed the perception of recording artists, making <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> could be good world citizens too – willing to set aside their egos and paychecks in order to help people who were suffering." ...|$|E

José Antonio Camacho, the chosen coach of presidential {{candidate}} Juan Palacios, {{announced that the}} club would bring in José Antonio Reyes, Joaquín and Pablo to strengthen the team if he won the election, and that the deal for Pablo was already done. Palacios lost the election, so Pablo had to remain with Atlético. His agent spoke out in his defence, confirming that Pablo had not asked to leave Atlético, and the Palacios faction were {{taking advantage of a}} contractual clause allowing him to leave if an offer of €15m were received (the club claimed the figure was only a basis for negotiation). He also disingenuously suggested that joining the hated rival was no different from joining a big club abroad. Atlético coach Javier Aguirre made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> still wanted and needed [...] "the best centre-back in Spain", and the player apologised to the fans, insisting he wanted to stay at Atlético and admitting he had made a mistake in accepting Real's offer.|$|E

500|$|In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison {{describes}} the period following the two Concert for Bangladesh shows as [...] "very emotional". The concerts {{took place at}} Madison Square Garden, New York, on 1 August 1971, as {{the first part of}} his fundraising program for the 8–10 million refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War. The generosity of all the participants, together with the response from the general public, encouraged Harrison to feel [...] "very positive about certain things". At the same time, the fact that it had fallen to musicians such as himself and concert instigator Ravi Shankar to address the issue left Harrison [...] "slightly enraged", given the wealth of resources available to governments around the globe. Author Gary Tillery writes that, through his humanitarian gesture, Harrison had [...] "changed the perception" [...] of rock musicians, [...] "making <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>they</b> could be good world citizens too", while music critic Mikal Gilmore has noted of Harrison's [...] "cautious yet optimistic and tender" [...] worldview: [...] " [...] stood {{in stark contrast to the}} ugly dissolution of the Beatles and the defeated idealism that then characterised so much of rock & roll culture." [...] The day after the Madison Square Garden concerts, Harrison began writing the song [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round", having stayed in New York to work with producer Phil Spector on the proposed live album of the event.|$|E
