5|$|In {{her plan}} {{to kill her}} husband she found an ally in Helmichis, the king's foster brother and spatharius (arms bearer). According to Paul the queen then {{recruited}} the king's cubicularius (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on June 28, care was taken to leave the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.|$|E
5|$|Alex realizes Geiger is {{controlling}} the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw {{to cut the}} <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she {{climbs out of the}} elevator, and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{was for the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring. Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny Nitro. The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs {{off the top of the}} cage. Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over the cage, but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> Nitro fell onto the top of the door, paining him between his legs. As Nitro was on top of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E

In addition, Ruetten discovered that the BMW he had bought for Rasmussen as an engagement gift was missing. Because of her morning plans, he found it strange that Rasmussen would have later gone out without letting him know. The house's answering machine had not been activated, despite both of them usually activating it when leaving the house unoccupied.|$|E
25|$|By Knox's account, {{having spent}} the night with Sollecito, she arrived at Via della Pergola7 {{on the morning of}} 2November 2007, finding the front <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> drops of blood in the {{bathroom}} she shared with Kercher. Kercher's bedroom door was locked, which Knox took as indicating that Kercher was sleeping. After showering in the bathroom she and Kercher shared, Knox found feces in the toilet of the bathroom shared by Romanelli and Mezzetti. Knox went back to Sollecito's home and later returned with him to Via della Pergola7. Noticing a broken window in Romanelli's bedroom and alarmed that Kercher did not answer her door, Sollecito unsuccessfully tried to force the door open. Sollecito called his sister, a lieutenant in the carabinieri, for advice. She advised him to call the 112 emergency number, which he did.|$|E
25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to {{open the front door}} of the {{residence}} and the driver got out to open the door for Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded to the right of the second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers and went in and out of his chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E

500|$|During {{refueling}} Cooper outlined {{his flight}} {{plan to the}} cockpit crew: a southeast course toward Mexico City at the minimum airspeed possible without stalling the aircraftapproximately at a maximum [...] altitude. He further specified that the landing gear remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the wing flaps be lowered 15degrees, and the cabin remain unpressurized. Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately [...] under the specified flight configuration, which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering Mexico. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on Reno, Nevada, as the refueling stop. Finally, Cooper directed that the plane take off with the rear exit <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> its staircase extended. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, {{but he would not}} argue the point; he would lower it himself once they were airborne.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said she}} found the episode both [...] "dishearting" [...] and [...] "engaging", as well as later adding that it was [...] "sad" [...] and [...] "frightening" [...] when Jake O'Connor was accused of murdering his father. Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russellâ€™s house, {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "smack" [...] Megan for doing so, saying [...] "What was she thinking? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn't let her in. Yet, she went back to find the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> walked right in. Megan's intelligent enough to know that something wasn't right but she's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation. For some reason she seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police". Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they [...] "delve deeper" [...] into Megan's father's death, saying that it was [...] "certainly a turning point for the character and I'd love to know more". She said it was [...] "nice" [...] to see scenes between Peter and Megan and said of the carpooling storyline, [...] "Snacks for carpool didn't seem like a bad idea but they could have used a couple of healthier options to go with the chocolate". Of Curtis and Kate's examining Manny Santos, she said that their expressions were [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] when they decided whether Manny was a juvenile, adding that it gave [...] "a much needed moment of comic relief in an otherwise heavy episode". She finished in saying that the episode [...] "grabbed her attention", finishing, [...] "These engaging characters and this episode was a winner for Body of Proof". In the carpooling storyline it featured Tastykake's products, a line of snack foods based in Philadelphia. Such products which were mentioned were Krimpets and KandyKakes, with the ABC saying they were the [...] "best".|$|E
500|$|On the August 22 {{episode of}} Raw, Miz and R-Truth {{attacked}} Santino Marella before his match. They then cut a promo agreeing {{there was a}} conspiracy in the WWE keeping both of {{them out of the}} main event picture, and declared they would, together, seize any future opportunity. They began referring to themselves as [...] "The Awesome Truth". On the August 29 episode of Raw, Truth interfered in Miz's match and the duo attacked CM Punk. At Night of Champions, after the referee was distracted while The Miz attempted a pin, Miz assaulted him, causing Awesome Truth to lose a WWE Tag Team Championship match to Air Boom (Kofi Kingston and Evan Bourne) by disqualification. Seeking retribution, Miz and Truth later attacked both Triple H and CM Punk during their No Disqualification match in the main event. Because of their actions from the previous night, R-Truth and The Miz were fired by Triple H on the September 19 episode of Raw. At the conclusion of the main event match at Hell in a Cell, R-Truth and The Miz jumped the barricade wearing black hooded sweatshirts and entered the cell as it was being raised. They then used weapons to attack Alberto Del Rio, CM Punk, John Cena, the Referee and camera men while the cell was again lowered. After this, the entire WWE roster led by Triple H came out to find a way into the cell, before New Orleans Police Department officers were able to get the <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> arrest them. The two later posted a video on YouTube apologizing to the WWE Universe for their actions. The Miz and R-Truth were reinstated by John Laurinaitis on the October 10 episode of Raw. At Vengeance, Miz and R-Truth defeated CM Punk and Triple H in a tag team match, after interference from Triple H's long time friend Kevin Nash. Later that night they assaulted John Cena during his WWE Championship match with Alberto Del Rio. On the October 24 episode of Raw, Awesome Truth attacked John Cena and Zack Ryder. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Miz and R-Truth defeated Cena and Ryder. At Survivor Series, The Awesome Truth were defeated by John Cena and The Rock. On the November 21 episode of Raw, Cena instigated an argument between R-Truth and Miz, which resulted in Miz performed a Skull Crushing Finale on the stage on R-Truth. This was a pretext to explain R-Truth's absence during his suspension {{as a result of his}} violating of the Wellness Policy.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{passengers}} {{farther away}} in the train did not realize a shooting had occurred until after the train stopped. As a crowd of panicked passengers fled from the third car into neighboring cars, one man appeared annoyed by their unruliness and said, [...] "Be calm", before they forced a train <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> fled into the station. Two people were injured in the stampede of passengers. After the train's conductor was informed of the shooting, he decided against opening the train doors right away because two of the cars were not yet at the platform. An announcement ordering conductors not to open the doors was made; however, engineer Thomas Silhan climbed {{out the window of}} his cab and opened each door from the outside so panicked passengers could escape.|$|E
2500|$|... "On Tuesday evening, at 5pm, Messrs Grove, of Bond Street, {{sent word}} {{that they had}} a very fine {{sturgeon}} on their slab. Of course, I went down at once to see it... The fish measured 9 feet in length [...] I wanted to make a cast of the fellow... and they offered me the fish for the night: he must be back in the shop the next morning by 10 am... I was determined to get him into the kitchen somehow; so, tying a rope to his tail, I let him slide down the stone stairs by his own weight. He started all right, but 'getting way' on him, I could hold the rope no more, and away he went sliding headlong down the stairs, like an avalanche down Mont Blanc... he smashed the <b>door</b> <b>open...</b> <b>and</b> slid right into the kitchen... till at last he brought himself to an anchor under the kitchen table. This sudden and unexpected appearance of the armour-clad sea monster, bursting open the door... instantly created a sensation. The cook screamed, the house-maid fainted, the cat jumped on the dresser, the dog retreated behind the copper and barked, the monkeys went mad with fright, and the sedate parrot has never spoken a word since." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Zappa began regular {{occupation}} at Paul Buff's PAL Studio in Cucamonga he and Van Vliet began collaborating, tentatively as the Soots (pronounced [...] "soots" [...] ). By {{the time}} Zappa {{had turned the}} venue into [...] the duo had completed some songs. These were Cheryl's Canon, Metal Man Has Won His Wings and a Howlin' Wolf styled rendition of Little Richard's Slippin' and Slidin'. Further songs, on Zappa's Mystery Disc (1996), I Was a Teen-Age Malt Shop and The Birth of Captain Beefheart also provide an insight to Zappa's [...] "teenage movie" [...] script titled Captain Beefheart vs. the Grunt People, the first appearances of the Beefheart name. It has been suggested this name came from a term used by Vliet's Uncle Alan who {{had a habit of}} exposing himself to Don's girlfriend, Laurie Stone. He would urinate with the bathroom <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and,</b> if she was walking by, would mumble about his penis, saying [...] "Ahh, what a beauty! It looks just like a big, fine beef heart". [...] In a 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, Van Vliet requests [...] "don't ask me why or how" [...] he and Zappa came up with the name. Johnny Carson also asked him the same question to which Van Vliet replied that one day he was standing on the pier and saw fishermen cutting the bills off pelicans. He said it made him sad and put [...] "a beef in his heart". Carson appeared nervous and uncomfortable interviewing Van Vliet and after the next commercial break Van Vliet was gone. He would later claim in an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman that the name referred to [...] "a beef in my heart against this society". In the [...] "Grunt People" [...] draft script Beefheart and his mother play themselves, with his father played by Howlin' Wolf. Grace Slick is penned in as a [...] "celestial seductress" [...] and there are also roles for future Magic Band members Bill Harkleroad and Mark Boston.|$|E
2500|$|The relief force {{moved into}} the {{plantation}} in open formation, unaware of the location of D Company or the Viet Cong. With visibility limited by the low vegetation of the young rubber trees and the heavy rain, they suddenly encountered a company moving west in arrowhead dressed in greens, cloth hats and webbing. Uncertain of their identity, the Australians paused. Realising they were Viet Cong attempting to outflank D Company to attack it from the rear, Lieutenant Peter Dinhamâ€”commander 2 Platoon travelling in the right-hand APCâ€”ordered the crew commander to engage, and was soon joined {{by the rest of}} the troop. The rain had masked their approach and the Viet Congâ€”later identified as the D445 Battalion weapons companyâ€”were caught by surprise as the cavalry crashed into their flank. Recovering rapidly though, they returned a heavy volume of machine-gun fire, covering their casualties as they were dragged to the rear. The platoon sergeant, Sergeant Frank Alcorta, had been travelling on top of the overcrowded carrier and was forced to jump clear to avoid being hit. Dinham ordered the rear <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> the remainder of the men in the APCâ€”consisting of platoon headquarters and one sectionâ€”disembarked to protect him. Moving into extended line they advanced, engaging the Viet Cong and causing heavy casualties. The spontaneous assault caught them by surprise, adding to their growing disorder. However, as the fighting continued it further delayed the advance of the relief force, and with Roberts concerned the presence of the infantry forward of the carriers would prevent them employing their heavy weapons, he called to Mollison to order their return. After re-embarking the infantry 3 Troop resumed the advance, breaking into the Viet Cong force as it streamed west, firing their [...]50 calibre machine-guns, while the infantry engaged with small arms from the open hatches. D445 Battalion was routed and forced to withdraw east having lost an estimated 40 killed, while one Australian was wounded.|$|E
