40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis studies the inventory accuracy in nonmechanized warehouses under the NISTARS automated warehousing system. This thesis {{is designed to}} answer two questions. Is there {{a significant difference between}} the NISTARS non-mechanized warehouses and the other types of warehouses? What are the reasons for the difference if one exists? The data were extracted from the official <b>inventory</b> <b>reports</b> of the Naval Supply Center, San Diego, CA. To ensure the data were representative of the inventory position of all warehouses under the control of the supply center, they were taken from the NAVSUP required quarterly STATMAN random sampled inventories. The study indicates that there is a significant difference (13 % less) in the inventory accuracy in non-mechanized warehouses under NISTARS control.

Statistics Norway {{is responsible for the}} collection and development of activity data, and emission figures are derived from models operated by Statistics Norway. The Norwegian Environment Agency is responsible for the emission factors, for providing data from specific industries and sources and for considering the quality, and assuring necessary updating, of emission models like, e. g., the road traffic model and calculation of methane emissions from landfills. Emission data are used for a range of national applications and for international reporting. The Norwegian Environment Agency is responsible for the Norwegian reporting to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and to United Nations Economic Commission Europe (UN-ECE). The Norwegian Environment annually publishes reports prepared {{as a part of the}}se reportings: National <b>Inventory</b> <b>Report</b> (NIR) for UNFCCC and Informative <b>Inventory</b> <b>Report</b> (IIR) for UN-ECE (Norwegian Environment Agency 2016 b and 2016 a).

The documentation will also serve as a part of the National <b>Inventory</b> <b>Report</b> submitted by Norway to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and as documentation of the reported emissions to UNECE for the pollutants restricted by CLRTAP (Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution).
