40|$|An {{information}} model is defined to support sharing of composite-media scientific data. The model consists of data objects and links. Data objects {{are associated with}} descriptors which contain all the metadata related to the object. A novel aspect of the {{information model}} is that both the data and metadata associated with a data object can be in structured or semistructured form. The links in the model are typed, and contain several built-in types such as resolution and <b>derivation</b> <b>link</b> types, to adequately model object relationships in scientific data. The model is extensible {{in the sense that}} users are allowed to define new object types and new link types. At the San Diego Supercomputer Center, we are currently investigating issues in providing the necessary infrastructure to implement this model. 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|This mini-tutorial overviews a {{blend of}} {{complementary}} techniques for constructing multi-view models for RE. Requirements engineering techniques {{are faced with a}} recurring problem of focus and structure. Elicitation techniques raise the problem of focussing and structuring elicitation sessions and artefacts. Evaluation techniques raise the problem of identifying and comparing items at a common level of abstraction and granularity for risk analysis, conflict management, option selection, or prioritization. Specification techniques offer mechanisms for structuring specifications but do not tell us much on how a complex structure should be built through such mechanisms. For quality assurance, inspection techniques are more effective if inspections can be focussed on structured specifications. Validation and verification techniques require the availability of structured specifications as well.

In this paper we introduce a novel approach for enriching morphological lexica with derivational links between entries and with new entries derived from existing ones and attested in large-scale corpora, without relying on prior knowledge of possible derivational processes.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{definition}} of mechanical work for an ideal gas, we present a novel <b>derivation</b> <b>linking</b> global wind power to measurable atmospheric parameters. The resulting expression distinguishes three components: the kinetic power associated with horizontal motion, the kinetic power associated with vertical motion and the gravitational power of precipitation. We discuss the caveats associated with integration of material derivatives {{in the presence of}} phase transitions and how these affect published analyses of global atmospheric power. Using the MERRA database for the years 2009 – 2015 (three hourly data on the 1. 25 ° x 1. 25 ° grid at 42 pressure levels) we estimate total atmospheric power at 3. 1 W m − 2 and kinetic power at 2. 6 W m − 2. The difference between the two (0. 5 W m − 2) is about half the independently estimated gravitational power of precipitation (1 W m − 2). We explain how this discrepancy arises from the limited spatial and temporal resolution of the database. Our analysis suggests that the total atmospheric power calculated with a spatial resolution of the order of one kilometer (thus capturing the small moist convective eddies) should be around 5 W m − 2. We discuss the physical constraints on global atmospheric power and how considering the dynamic effects of water vapor condensation offers new opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Current derivations of single-step {{equations}} {{are based}} on modified relationships among animals replacing for genotyped animals and on an inverted scale, pedigree based relationships, by modified ones. These relationships are obtained as linear combination of strictly genomic and pedigree based relationships, therefore implicitly 'weighting' SNP and polygenic effects. Alternative equations were recently proposed de-absorbing the genomic relationships out of the equations. This derivation did not change basic assumptions, but was derived using a matrix of relationship differences. This presentation will show a new and alternative derivation of single-step type genomic prediction equations allowing joint estimation of GEBV and SNP effects based on the partitioning of genetic (co) variances. The method was derived from a random mixed inheritance model where SNP and residual polygenic effects are jointly modeled. The derived equations were modified to allow non-genotyped animals and to estimate directly and jointly GEBV and SNP effects. Equations resemble superficially recently proposed alternative single-step equations but were derived differently and {{are based on}} completely different assumptions. They also avoid certain issues in de-absorbing <b>derivation</b> <b>linked</b> to the matrix of relationship differences by using (co) variances. Several other advantages of the new equations are that weighting of SNP and polygenic effects becomes explicitly and that SNP effects are also estimated. This method makes better use of High-Density SNP panels and can be easily modified to accommodate other genetic effects as major gene effects or copy-number variant based effects. Finally these alternative equations combine advantages of single-step and of explicit SNP effect estimation based methods. Additional research is required to test and validate further the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Cyclicity {{effects are}} {{implemented}} in the Minimalist program, in part, by interleaving tree-building operations with other syntactic operations. The order of operations in the <b>derivation</b> is <b>linked</b> to the hierarchical structure of the tree, since this structure is created {{in the course of}} the derivation in a way which makes the hierarchical structure a good guide to the order in which material was introduced. Making this theoretical move raises an important question: in which direction is the tree constructed? The standard answer in Minimalism to this question (see, e. g., Chomsky 1995, 1998) is that the tree is created from the bottom up, with material lower in the tree being introduced before material higher in the tree. For instance, a VP with NPs as its specifier and complement 1 would be created as follows. First, the V would be merged with its complement, to create a constituent like that in (1 a). The resulting constituent would then be merged with the NP specifier, creating the new constituent (1 b) : (1) a. 4 b. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Berkeley FrameNet project aims at {{implementing}} Fillmore’s Frame Semantics {{program on}} a broad empirical basis. The syntactic environments of words in corpora are systematically aligned with the semantic frames evoked by the words. It is Fillmore’s vision that such a collection of valency data can {{pave the way for}} an empirically grounded theory of the syntax-semantics interface. In this arti-cle, we examine to what extent this goal can be achieved by the FrameNet approach in its present form.

Our investigation reveals a certain lack of systematicity in the definition of frames and frame relations, which may hinder the <b>derivation</b> of <b>linking</b> generalizations. This situation seems to be partly due to the expectation that a system of frames can be developed on a data-driven, purely bottom-up account. As a possible solution, we argue for a richer frame representation which systematically takes into account the inner structure of an event and thereby inherently captures structural relations between frames. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: String {{theory has}} long ago been {{initiated}} by {{the quest for a}} theoretical explanation of the observed high-energy “Reggeization ” of strong interaction amplitudes. In terms of quantum field theory, it is the so-called “soft ” regime, where the coupling constant is expected to be large and thus perturbative calculations inadequate. However, since then, no convincing <b>derivation</b> of the <b>link</b> between gauge field theory at strong coupling and string theory has come out. This 35 -years-old puzzle is thus still unsolved. We discuss how modern tools like the AdS/CFT correspondence give a new insight on the problem by applying it to two-body elastic and inelastic scattering amplitudes. We obtain a geometrical interpretation of Reggeization and its relation with confinement in gauge theory. 1...|$|R

The interaction between the Beaker groups on the Veluwe Plain and in Jutland must, at least initially, have been quite intensive.
