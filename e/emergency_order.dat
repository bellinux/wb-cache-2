5|$|Following its {{adoption}} as {{the court}} language of Philip II of Macedon's regime, authors of ancient Macedonia wrote their works in Koine Greek, the lingua franca of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece. Rare textual evidence indicates that the native Macedonian language was either a dialect of Greek similar to Thessalian Greek and Northwestern Greek, or a language closely related to Greek. The vast majority of surviving inscriptions from ancient Macedonia were written in Attic Greek and its successor Koine. Attic (and later Koine) Greek was the preferred language of the Ancient Macedonian army, although {{it is known that}} Alexander the Great once shouted an <b>emergency</b> <b>order</b> in Macedonian to his royal guards during the drinking party where he killed Cleitus the Black.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a single-echelon inventory {{system with a}} warehouse facing compound Poisson customer demand.

We consider standard holding and backorder costs as well as ordering costs. A heuristic decision rule for triggering <b>emergency</b> <b>orders</b> is suggested. The decision rule minimizes the expected costs under the assumption that there is only a single possibility for an emergency replenishment, but the rule is used repeatedly as a heuristic. Given a certain reorder point policy for normal replenishments, our decision rule will always reduce the expected costs. A simulation study illustrates that the suggested technique performs well under different conditions...|$|R
25|$|In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{issued an}} <b>emergency</b> <b>order</b> against Range Resources, {{stating that the}} company's {{drilling}} activities in Parker County, Texas had contaminated at least two residential drinking water wells.

However, after a January 2011 Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) hearing, TRRC staff concluded that, based on chemical composition, the gas in the water wells came from the shallow Strawn Formation, rather than the deeper Barnett Shale, in which the Range wells were completed.

2500|$|New Zealand Railways (NZR) {{was a major}} {{customer}} from 1879 when it imported six 2-8-0 {{based on}} the Denver and Rio Grande locomotives due to their similar rail gauge, these were given the road class of T. The next was a double <b>emergency</b> <b>order</b> of six 2-6-2 classed N and six 2-8-0 classed O after a British order for similar locomotives failed to meet ontime delivery and weight limitations specified in contract. Baldwins seized on the opportunity to impress the NZR with a prompt six-month delivery of all 12 locomotives. Thereafter NZR ordered Baldwin products to complement home built locomotives, including Tank versions 2-6-2 Wb and 2-6-4 Wd classes. Another four of the hard working N class were purchased in 1901. The popular 4-6-0 class of 22 Ub locomotives consisting of 10 1898 flat valve and 10 1901 piston valve (Baldwins supplying all but two) proved themselves well {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century with the last retiring as late as 1958. A requirement for a larger firebox version of the class ended up creating a whole new locomotive with the birth of the 4-6-2 wheel arrangement, the Pacific was born. They were classed as Q in NZR service and remained in use until 1957. Being a new type of locomotive, the Q class had their shortcomings but eventually performed well (Sadly, none have been preserved except one engine, originally sold to the Newfoundland Railway in September 1920. Engine #593, affectionately known as the [...] "Newfie Bullet", is being restored in Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Canada.) In 1914 a later larger improved version, and last Baldwin product to be purchased by NZR was classed as Aa. They lasted until 1959. Like all American locomotives produced at the time, the Baldwins had 'short' lifespans built into them but the NZR were happy to re-boiler almost their whole fleet to give them a longer life of hard work. NZR were generally happy with their Baldwin fleet.|$|E
40|$|Two {{principal}} {{objectives of}} the 1983 Mental Health Act were to decrease the use of <b>emergency</b> <b>orders</b> and to give patients on observation orders the right of appeal.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{inventory}} system of an online retailer with compound Poisson demand. The retailer normally replenishes its inventory {{according to a}} continuous review (nQ,Â R) policy with a constant lead time. Usually demands that cannot be satisfied immediately are backordered. We also assume that the customers will accept a reasonable waiting time after they have placed their orders because of the purchasing convenience of the online system. This means that a sufficiently short waiting time incurs no shortage costs. We call this allowed waiting time "committed service time". After this committed service time, if the retailer is still in shortage, the customer demand must either be satisfied with an emergency supply that takes no time (which is financially equivalent to a lost sale) or continue to be backordered with a time-dependent backorder cost. The committed service time gives an online retailer a buffer period to handle excess demands. Based on real-time information concerning the outstanding orders of an online retailer and the waiting times of its customers, we provide a decision rule for <b>emergency</b> <b>orders</b> that minimizes the expected costs {{under the assumption that}} no further <b>emergency</b> <b>orders</b> will occur. This decision rule is then used repeatedly as a heuristic. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the model, together with a discussion of the conditions under which the real-time decision rule provides considerable cost savings compared to traditional systems.

Dynamic {{production}} scheduling (DPS) is usually trigged by uncertain disturbances such as <b>emergency</b> <b>orders,</b> machine breakdown and rolling planning horizon etc. DPS is a challenging problem in real-life industry manufacturing field {{due to its}} bulky problem scalability, which is more significant in discrete manufacturing industry.

In order to card this research direction, this paper reviews it given different disturbances including <b>emergency</b> <b>orders,</b> machine breakdown, tardiness of job, and engineering changes. Moreover, currently common advantages and disadvantages of dynamic scheduling algorithm are laid stress on. Accordingly, characteristics and future research direction of it are presented.
