40|$|This paper aims at {{analyzing}} {{the status of}} epistemic discontinuity {{in the realm of}} Foucauldian archeology. The problem <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on is <b>that</b> of “fractured subjectivity” represented, in The Order of Things, by literary figures such as Don Quixote or Justine and Juliette. I move on to discuss the Foucauldian interpretation of Kantian anthropology in order to explore the epistemic function of what I previously called fractured subjectivity. These considerations lead us finally to a Fichtean radicalization of Kantian critical philosophy and its specific position in the Foucauldian archeology of human sciences...|$|R

We distinguish four compliance technique in social psychology - foot-in-the-door technique, face-in-the-door technique, low-ball technique and that's-not-all technique. The final part consists of a research proposal <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> on two of these techniques - foot-in-the-door and face-in-the-door technique...|$|R

So I had to be both selective and judgmental in compiling my list, else this paper {{would have been even}} longer than it is. “Policy” indicates <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have restricted myself to issues that are truly relevant to real-world policymakers, thus omitting many interesting but purely academic issues. “Today” means <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on current issues, thus passing over some illustrious past issues. All these omissions still leave a rather long list; so I will treat some issues quite briefly. ...|$|R
