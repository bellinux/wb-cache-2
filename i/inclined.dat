5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} secondary dust disk <b>inclined</b> at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less <b>inclined</b> than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough to distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an <b>inclined</b> orbit removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} semigroup of <b>incline</b> Hall matrices. An <b>incline</b> Hall matrix means an <b>incline</b> matrix which {{is greater than}} or equal to an <b>incline</b> {{invertible}} matrix. It is proved that any <b>incline</b> Hall matrix has index. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for an <b>incline</b> Hall matrix to be regular in the semigroup of <b>incline</b> Hall matrices are given and Green's relations on the such semigroup are described. Also the sandwich semigroup of <b>incline</b> Hall matrices is considered. The main results in the present paper generalize some previous results on Boolean matrices, fuzzy matrices and lattice matrices...|$|R

40|$|Transitivity of {{generalized}} fuzzy matrices over {{a special}} type of semiring is considered. The semiring is called <b>incline</b> algebra which generalizes Boolean algebra, fuzzy algebra, and distributive lattice. This paper studies the transitive <b>incline</b> matrices in detail. The transitive closure of an <b>incline</b> matrix is studied, and the convergence for powers of transitive <b>incline</b> matrices is considered. Some properties of compositions of <b>incline</b> matrices are also given, {{and a new}} transitive <b>incline</b> matrix is constructed from given <b>incline</b> matrices. Finally, {{the issue of the}} canonical form of a transitive <b>incline</b> matrix is discussed.

5|$|The idea {{of using}} <b>inclined</b> planes was an {{innovation}} that Green had pioneered elsewhere. He had been the engineer for the Bude Canal, which included six planes, five powered by water wheels and one by a descending bucket mechanism. He {{was at the time}} the engineer for the Grand Western Canal, which included seven vertical boat lifts and an <b>inclined</b> plane at Wellisford, again to be powered by a descending bucket mechanism. The rise on the final section of the canal to Cwmmawr was , and three <b>inclined</b> planes would be much quicker and use much less water than the alternative of 20 or more locks.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Neptune can {{be divided}} into two groups: regular and irregular.

5|$|A {{feature of}} the canal was the variety of methods used at Combe Hay to {{overcome}} height differences between {{the upper and lower}} reaches, initially by the use of caisson locks and when this failed an <b>inclined</b> plane trackway and then finally a flight of 22 conventionallocks.|$|E

50|$|The <b>inclines</b> all {{consist of}} two {{parallel}} rail tracks with a gauge of 3.27m. Boats are carried on carriages which run on these rails. The <b>inclines</b> {{rise from the}} lower level of the canal to a summit and then down a second shorter <b>incline</b> to the upper canal level. The {{first part of the}} main <b>incline</b> and the short upper <b>incline</b> were both built at a gradient of 1:24. A carriage is lowered down the <b>incline</b> to counterbalance an upward moving carriage. Once the downward moving carriage has reached the summit and started down the main <b>incline</b> its weight helps pull up the upward moving carriage. This allowed the slope of the <b>incline</b> for this section to be built at a higher gradient of 1:12.|$|R

5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

5|$|Traffic on the opened {{section was}} {{much lower than}} anticipated, and the {{prospects}} of building {{the rest of the}} canal dwindled, as profits were minimal. However, in 1829 James Green {{turned his attention to the}} link to Taunton. He had been the architect of the Bude Canal, which was built for tub-boats and used <b>inclined</b> planes to change levels, and proposed a similar solution here. The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal had opened in 1827, making navigation from Taunton to Bridgwater easier than on the River Tone. In a report of 1830, Green proposed using vertical lifts instead of <b>inclined</b> planes, and estimated the cost of the canal at £65,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{a catastrophic}} flood in 1889, the Johnstown <b>Inclined</b> Plane was {{completed}} in 1891 {{to serve as an}} escape route for future floods, as well as a convenient mode of transportation for the residents of the new communities situated above the valley. It was operated by Cambria Iron Company and its successor Bethlehem Steel until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown <b>Inclined</b> Plane fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floodsonce in 1936 and again in 1977. The incline was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1994. It had major renovations in 1962 and from 1983 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|After the Act of Union of 1707, growing {{prosperity}} in Scotland {{led to a}} spate of new building, both public and private.

This spate of military building culminated in the construction of Fort George near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting bastions and redoubts.|$|E
