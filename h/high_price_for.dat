5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E
5|$|The game is turn-based. Each turn {{represents}} one week, and travelling between cities takes {{a number of}} turns depending on {{the proximity of the}} destination city. Many cities have a chocolate shop, where the player can sell his or her stock, and a market where ingredients can be purchased. Some specialty cacao beans can only be purchased from plantations in certain cities. Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn, as long as the required ingredients are in stock. During story mode, quests are given by non-player characters; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non-player character, who is either traveling or can be found at a set location. Quest rewards {{take the form of a}} <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the chocolates or a new recipe. Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll. Market owners can be bartered with, though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} higher wages paid by foreign-owned manufacturing plants than by domestically owned plants, typical of most countries, represents a <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> labor. That is, does it reflect a <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> workers {{of a given}} quality, as represented by the level of education? We then ask whether foreign-owned plants pay a <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> labor given {{the characteristics of the}} plants. Foreign-owned firms are found to pay a <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> labor of a given educational level than domestically owned ones. Only a part of the difference is associated with plant characteristics, rather than ownership...|$|R
50|$|Oil-importing {{countries}} {{had an average}} current account deficit of 3.3% of the GDP in 2005, and oil-exporting {{countries had}} an average current account surplus of 12.2% of GDP. Out of 33 African nations for which information was available, 20 countries experienced a decline in their terms of trade between 2002 and 2005 and 13 experienced an improvement. Oil importers experienced the worst decline. However, Botswana’s terms of trade improved because <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> oil imports were more than offset by <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> diamond exports. Similar reasoning held for Mozambique because of <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> <b>for</b> aluminum; in Niger, for uranium; and in Zambia, for copper.|$|R

25|$|In late 1972, Garcia {{purchased}} the first guitar (Eagle) made by Alembic luthier Doug Irwin for $850 (~$4,948 in 2017). Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument. This guitar, nicknamed Wolf for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator {{on stage in}} September. It cost $1,500 (~$8,191 in 2017), an extremely <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the era.|$|E
25|$|High-low pricing {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of offering goods at a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> a period of time, followed by offering the same goods at a low price for a predetermined time. This practice is widely used by chain stores selling homewares. The main disadvantage of the high-low tactic is that consumers tend to become aware of the price cycles and time their purchases to coincide with a low-price cycle.|$|E

25|$|Corrie {{became a}} partner with wealthy {{businessman}} and cotton planter Charles Augustus Lafayette Lamar (son of Gazaway Bugg Lamar) from Savannah, Georgia. He was hired to transport slaves from Africa, although such importation had been prohibited since 1808 by federal law. Corrie achieved some elements of conversion, {{but much of the}} work was accomplished after the ship reached an Angolan port. Both men opposed the restrictions on importing slaves, as demand drove a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> domestic slaves. The Wanderer was returned to New York to undergo preparation for a long voyage.|$|E
25|$|Between Abrahams’ {{visit to}} Nyasaland and the {{publication}} of his report, Edmund Richards, the governor from 1942 to 1947, strongly advocated to the Colonial Office that the Nyasaland government should purchase the Magomero estare of A L Bruce Estates, a single block of approximately 162,000 acres surrounded by very congested areas of Native Trust Land. The Colonial Office was only prepared to allow the Nyasaland government to offer five shillings an acre, a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> land which had been over-used and deforested, but too low to be acceptable to the owner.|$|E

25|$|The Karaite Jewish {{community}} of Jerusalem purchased the codex {{about a hundred}} {{years after it was}} made. During the First Crusade, the synagogue was plundered and the codex was transferred to Egypt, whose Jews paid a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> its ransom. It was preserved at the Karaite then Rabbanite synagogue in Old Cairo, where it was consulted by Maimonides, who described it as a text trusted by all Jewish scholars. It is rumoured that in 1375 one of Maimonides' descendants brought it to Aleppo, Syria, leading to its present name.|$|E
25|$|The Mafia retaliated violently. In 1988, they murdered a Palermo {{judge and}} his son; three years later, a {{prosecutor}} and an anti-mafia businessman were also murdered. Salvatore Lima, a close political {{ally of the}} Mafia, was murdered for failing to reverse the convictions as promised. Falcone was killed on May 23rd 1992 with 1000kg of TNT positioned under the highway near Capaci, Sicily. Borsellino was also killed by a car bomb on July 19th 1992. This led to a public outcry and a massive government crackdown, resulting in the arrest of Salvatore Riina in January 1993. More and more defectors emerged. Many paid a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> their cooperation, usually through the murder of relatives. For example, Francesco Marino Mannoia's mother, aunt, and sister were murdered.|$|E
25|$|Keane progressed through Wolves' youth {{ranks and}} made his {{professional}} debut aged 17 on 9 August 1997, scoring twice against Norwich City. The following season he excelled at the club, earning praise from both the press and Wolves manager Colin Lee. He went on to be the club's leading scorer, with 16 goals in the 1998–99 season. Keane's performances and goalscoring record with both Wolves and his national team attracted much interest from larger clubs and a move for the young striker seemed imminent given Wolves' finances. However, with three years left on his contract, Wolves sought a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> their Irish star and managing director John Richards stated his reluctance to sell Keane unless their asking price was met.|$|E

25|$|Protracted {{action at}} Verdun {{throughout}} 1916, {{combined with the}} bloodletting at the Somme, brought the exhausted French army {{to the brink of}} collapse. Futile attempts using frontal assault came at a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> both the British and the French and led to the widespread French Army Mutinies, after the failure of the costly Nivelle Offensive of April–May 1917. The concurrent British Battle of Arras was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value. A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps, became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada.|$|E
25|$|Citizens of Zwolle are colloquially {{known as}} Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). This {{dates back to}} 1682, when the StMichael's church tower collapsed. The {{authorities}} were strapped for cash and saw {{no option but to}} sell the church bells to neighbouring city Kampen. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four duiten (the equivalent of two-and-a-half cents). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and wanted to be sure they truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the copper.|$|E
25|$|This {{campaign}} was ultimately unsuccessful, although the local Timorese paid a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the assistance they provided the Australians: {{it is estimated}} that between 40,000 and 60,000 Timorese perished during the Japanese occupation. In September, in an effort to maintain the pressure on the Japanese, the 2nd Independent Company was reinforced with the landing of the 2/4th Australian Independent Company. By late-November 1942, however, {{it was clear that the}} Australians could not sustain their campaign due to extreme ill-health amongst all the men, and the ever-increasing number of Japanese reinforcements as well as reduced food supplies. Furthermore, the Japanese used increasing numbers of Dutch Timorese to wreak havoc among the Portuguese Timorese, who then found it impossible to keep helping the Australians. As a result, both the 2/2 and 2/4 were withdrawn from Timor between mid-December 1942 and January 1943, along with Portuguese civilians, some Dutch troops and Timorese who would later serve with Z Special Unit.|$|E

25|$|The Elector of Bavaria {{consented to}} add {{his name to}} the Grand Alliance on 4 May 1690, while the Elector of Brandenburg joined the anti-French {{coalition}} on 6 September. However, few of the minor powers were as devoted to the common cause, and all protected their own interests; some never hesitated to exact a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> continuing their support. Charles XI of Sweden supplied the contingents due from his German possessions to the Allied cause (6,000 men and 12 warships), while in August 1689 Christian V of Denmark agreed to a treaty to supply William III with 7,000 troops {{in return for a}} subsidy. However, in March 1691 Sweden and Denmark put aside their mutual distrust and made a treaty of armed neutrality for the protection of their commerce and to prevent the war spreading north. To the annoyance of the Maritime Powers the Swedes now saw their rôle outside the great power-struggle of the Nine Years' War, exploiting opportunities to increase their own maritime trade. Nevertheless, Louis XIV at last faced a powerful coalition aimed at forcing France to recognise Europe's rights and interests.|$|E
