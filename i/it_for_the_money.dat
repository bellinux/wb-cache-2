5|$|Zappa uniquely {{contributed to}} the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, {{sampling}} radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also {{contributed to the}} radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.|$|E

The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family.

Claiming that Dante and Trish only {{escalated}} the situation by unwittingly providing the Devil Arms that were key to Sanctus’ plan, she gladly pays them next to nothing.

25|$|Uncle Meat is {{the fifth}} studio album by The Mothers of Invention, {{released}} as a double album in 1969.

25|$|As {{with the}} band's {{previous}} three albums, it {{is a concept}} album, influenced by 1950s doo wop and rock and roll. The album's concept deals with a fictitious Chicano doo wop band called Ruben & the Jets, represented by the cover illustration by Cal Schenkel, which depicts the Mothers of Invention as anthropomorphic dogs. It was conceived {{as part of a}} project called No Commercial Potential, which produced three other albums: Lumpy Gravy, We're Only in <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> and Uncle Meat.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the U.S. National Recording Preservation Board {{included}} We're Only in <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> in the National Recording Registry as [...] "Frank Zappa's inventive and iconoclastic album {{presents a}} unique political stance, both anti-conservative and anti-counterculture, and features a scathing satire on hippiedom and America's reactions to it". The same year, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him at No.71 on {{its list of}} the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.|$|E
500|$|The band {{released}} {{their first}} single [...] "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] on small independent record label, Backbeat records, {{on a limited}} run of 500. In October 1994 the single was re-released on the Parlophone label and reached number 43 in the UK Singles Chart, but failed to chart in the US. Supergrass released their debut full-length album I Should Coco in May 1995. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK Albums Chart. I Should Coco led the band to receive four newcomer awards in the year the album was released. [...] "Alright" [...] was released from the album, which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. This is the highest chart position the band have gained with a single except for [...] "Richard III" [...] from In <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money.</b> In <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> which was the first album to be produced entirely by Supergrass peaked at number two in the UK Albums Chart.

Their fourth album, Life On Other Planets was the first to include Rob Coombes as an official member of the band. The album peaked at number nine in the UK Albums Chart.|$|E

500|$|Cousy grew {{bored with}} college {{basketball}} {{and returned to}} the NBA as coach of the Cincinnati Royals, team of fellow Hall-of-Fame point guard Oscar Robertson.

[...] In 1970, the 41-year-old Cousy even made a late-season comeback as a player to boost ticket sales. Despite his meager output of 5 points in 34 minutes of playing time in seven games, ticket sales jumped by 77 percent. He continued as coach of the team after it moved from Cincinnati to Kansas City/Omaha, but stepped down as the Kings' coach early in the 1973–74 NBA season with a 141–209 record.|$|E

500|$|In a 1969 {{column for}} The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau said that, apart from The Mothers of Invention's We're Only in <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> Tommy {{is the first}} {{successful}} [...] "extended work" [...] in rock music, but Townshend's parodic side is more [...] "profound and equivocal" [...] than Frank Zappa. He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that {{he is determined to}} [...] "give his audience what it wants without burying his own peculiarity". Albert Goldman, writing in Life magazine, said that The Who play through [...] "all the kinky complications" [...] of the narrative in a hard rock style that is the antithesis of most contemporary [...] "serious" [...] rock. Goldman asserted that, based on innovation, performance, and [...] "sheer power", Tommy surpasses anything else in studio-recorded rock. Christgau named Tommy the best album of 1969 in his year-end list for Jazz & Pop magazine.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{embarked}} {{on the first}} leg of his HIStory World Tour on September 1996. One month into the tour and several months after his divorce from Presley, Jackson's personal life made headlines as it was revealed that Debbie Rowe was pregnant with his child. One tabloid newspaper, the News of the World, told the story under the headline [...] "I'm Having Michael's Baby". Rowe reacted furiously to the publication, labeling the editorial staff [...] "bastards" [...] and complaining that they reported the story as if she and Jackson were freaks. J. Randy Taraborrelli later noted that the article, which had been put together from a secret tape recording between Rowe and a friend, had been fairly accurate. It detailed that Jackson was the father of the baby and that he would be raising the child alone. It also stated that Jackson impregnated Rowe artificially with his own sperm cells, a [...] "foolproof" [...] method of insemination. Further reports alleged that the relationship was an [...] "economic" [...] one; she was in <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and he sought a baby.|$|E

The expensively printed magazine/book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and, by the 2004 edition, was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its [...] "artistic" [...] approach to nude photography, and its equal coverage of male and female athletes, although it did create a stir in the United States. She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Of posing nude, she said, [...] "if offered the opportunity, I think that it's a personal decision. Whether you do <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> or whatever, again, I think it's a personal decision. I don't know whether I would say yes or no.

2500|$|In 1984, Zappa {{prepared}} a remix of Cruising with Ruben & the Jets for its compact disc reissue and the vinyl box set The Old Masters I. The remix featured new rhythm tracks recorded by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman, {{much as the}} 1984 remix of We're Only in <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> had featured. Zappa stated [...] "The master tapes for Ruben and the Jets were in better shape, but since I liked the results on We're Only in <b>it</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> I {{decided to do it}} on Ruben too. But those are the only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself." ...|$|E
