40|$|Although the Metadata Editor is an {{important}} part of any digital library, it becomes fundamental in the presence of audiovisual content. This is because the metadata produced by automated support tools (such as speech recognizers and shot detection procedures) is error-prone and often needs correction. In addition, scenes are manually annotated. This paper describes Regia, a prototype application for manual <b>editing</b> <b>metadata</b> for audiovisual documents developed in the ECHO project. Regia allows the user to manually <b>edit</b> textual <b>metadata</b> and to hierarchically organize the segmentation of the audiovisual content. An important feature of this metadata editor is that it is not hard [...] wired with a particular metadata attributes set; for this purpose the XML schema of the metadata model is used by the editor as configuration file...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel metadata management mechanism on the metadata server (MDS) for parallel and distributed file systems. In this technique, the client file system backs up the sent <b>metadata</b> <b>requests,</b> {{which have been}} handled by the metadata server, so that the MDS {{does not need to}} log metadata changes to nonvolatile storage for achieving highly available metadata service, as well as better performance improvement in metadata processing. As the client file system backs up certain sent <b>metadata</b> <b>requests</b> in its memory, the overhead for handling these backup requests is much smaller than that brought by the metadata server, while it adopts logging or journaling to yield highly available metadata service. The experimental results show that this newly proposed mechanism can significantly improve the speed of metadata processing and render a better I/O data throughput, in contrast to conventional metadata management schemes, that is, logging or journaling on MDS. Besides, a complete metadata recovery can be achieved by replaying the backup logs cached by all involved clients, when the metadata server has crashed or gone into nonoperational state exceptionally...|$|R

A novel representation for <b>metadata</b> <b>editing</b> is proposed and an implementation framework for <b>editing</b> the <b>metadata</b> {{in accordance with the}} video editing operations is demonstrated.

The Annotation Profile Model is a platform and language independentinformation model that describes how to configure or automatically generate {{graphical user interfaces}} for form based editing of RDFmetadata. The Annotation Profile Model does not replace ontologies orschema information, instead it provides complimentary information that is necessary for annotation tools to behave consistently. The motivation for the specification is, first, to make the end user experience more flexible {{with regards to the}} set of <b>metadata</b> <b>edited</b> without compromising the usability or requiring further technical knowledge. Second, to allow a more a coherent end-user experience when <b>editing</b> <b>metadata</b> across tools. Third, to simplify for developers to include <b>metadata</b> <b>editing</b> in their tools by providing ready made reusable components/libraries based on this specification.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Editing</b> <b>metadata</b> for {{documents}} {{in a large}} collection is a long and menial task. Many metadata schemas exist, among which, of course, Dublin Core, and they are usually only partially compatible to each other. Adopting any of these schemas often requires adopting specific tools for the insertion and <b>editing</b> of <b>metadata</b> that are rigid, do not allow for customization and specialization for the organization needs. In this paper we present g. a. f. f. e. (Generator of Automatic Forms- Final Edition), a metadata editor that allows for any each metadata schema considered, to be specified and customized. The metadata input and for the actual interface can to be customized and modified parametrically through the aid of domain and interface ontologies expressed in OWL. g. a. f. f. e. behaves as an independent desktop application {{as well as an}} add-in to MS Office applications, allowing for metadata to be stored either as independent OWL files or as properties within the documents themselves...|$|R
