[...] Taraborrelli explained [...] "So, whether Madonna released Something to Remember, a collection of previously released love songs, because she had a point to prove or simply to keep a contractual obligation, the fourteen track recording did make a statement."

500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great and every day I see some Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. I can only hope that my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." [...] He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E

2500|$|On 29 January 2005 it was {{announced}} {{after a lot of}} speculation that Ryan, along with Kim Medcalf (Sam), would be leaving. A source for the show said, [...] "Michelle [...] has made no secret of her plans to leave the soap in recent months. Despite her character being at the centre of some of the show's biggest storylines, the actress is now considering a modelling career."

2500|$|Kennedy later {{claimed he}} {{understood}} that the rampant stock speculation of the late 1920s {{would lead to a}} market crash. Supposedly, he said that he <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> {{to get out of the}} market when he received stock tips from a shoe-shine boy. Kennedy survived the crash [...] "because he possessed a passion for facts, a complete lack of sentiment and a marvelous sense of timing".|$|E

60|$|Aaron sat {{watching}} in silence. Only the uneasy birds rustled. He watched {{the city and}} the winding river, the bridges, and the imminent Alps. He was on the south side. On {{the other side of the}} time barrier. His old, sleepy English nature was startled in its sleep. He felt like a man who <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to wake up, and who doesn't want to wake up, to face the responsibility of another sort of day.|$|R
2500|$|The last {{rendezvous}} {{was held}} in 1840. At that time, the fur trade began to drop off. Fashionable men in London, Paris, and New York wanted silk hats instead of beaver hats. In addition, beaver populations across North America were declining rapidly from over-exploitation. Carson <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to find other work. He wrote in his Memoirs that [...] "Beaver was getting scarce, it became necessary to try our hand at something else." ...|$|E

He logically <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to give up his attempts to enter piano competitions and instead accept a salaried position as a music teacher. Paul also needs to help his mother and his seriously ill father, but he decides to travel to San Francisco for an international piano competition. Doing so could cost him his job waiting for him in Chicago; nevertheless, he wants to try his luck for the last time before passing the age limit to compete.|$|R
2500|$|Stanley Donen, {{brought to}} Hollywood by Kelly {{to be his}} {{assistant}} choreographer, received co-director credit for On the Town. According to Kelly: [...] "...when you are involved in doing choreography for film you must have expert assistants. I needed one to watch my performance, and one {{to work with the}} cameraman on the timing..without such people as Stanley, Carol Haney and Jeanne Coyne I could never have done these things. When we came to do On the Town, I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss-assistant anymore but co-creators." [...] Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the [...] "Day in New York" [...] routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009 Alkaline Trio {{announced}} {{the formation of}} their own independent record label, created as {{a joint venture with}} Epitaph Records {{in a manner similar to}} ANTI- and Hellcat Records. Epitaph had previously released Patent Pending, the 2006 album by Skiba's side project Heavens. Named Heart & Skull after Alkaline Trio's logo, the new label would be inaugurated by the release of their new album. Skiba remarked that [...] "We made the decision to form Heart & Skull to put out our own records after having been through every kind of label deal in the industry, big indies, small indies, majors. We <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled about doing that in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time it really makes sense to release our own records, but we wanted to make sure we could partner up with good people who we would want to share in something very special to us. When Brett [...] called and said he wanted to be involved, that was it. Epitaph is a label I've admired and supported for more than half of my life." ...|$|E

Molly does not understand but attempts to prevent Mr. Magorium's departure by showing him the joys of life, but he <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> for his story to end. Utilizing the stage notes of Shakespeare's King Lear to make the point about the importance of death, Magorium states the last lines {{of one of the most}} important pieces of dramatic literature are simply [...] " [...] he dies" [...] before his death. Molly, Eric, all the children and their parents have a funeral for him.|$|R
60|$|Randy was willing, and {{off they}} started up Market Street to the City Hall, {{and then back}} and into Montgomery and Kearney streets, taking in all the sights as they went. Almost before they <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> {{to go to the}} wharf.|$|R

60|$|The {{upshot of}} my meditations was that I asked Stephen {{down to dinner}} with us from church one day. I had heard a rumour {{that he was going}} to see Lizzie Pye over at Avonlea, and I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to be stirring, if {{anything}} were to be done. If it had been Jane Miranda I don't know that I'd have bothered; but Lizzie Pye wouldn't have done for a stepmother for Althea's boys at all. She was too bad-tempered, and as mean as second skimmings besides.|$|E
50|$|As {{the years}} passed, Robbie gets older and Charlie does as well. Charlie also gets wilder. Robbie notices {{the change in}} Charlie and <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for him to go. Robbie was very sad, but <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> had to happen soon so he may as well do it now. After that heart {{breaking}} moment he built a farm beside the lake saw Charlie. A few years later Robbie got married and had a son named Alan. He saw Charlie a couple more times {{and the last time}} they saw each other was when Charlie had a family. After Miya and her grandfather read this story they decided to go to America and see where Robbie and Charlie lived.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{have given}} a good deal {{to know how the}} row ended; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> no use to argue with Mrs. Rabbit, so I put on my {{slippers}} and scurried around to help get dinner, for, goodness <b>knows,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> all three of us had something to eat. Nothing could have been better than those carrots, and I had eaten two, at the same time thinking what a fool I'd been for not bringing back more, when suddenly Sonny's mother threw up both paws as if she were dying, and before there <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to ask what had come over her, I heard the sound of some one scratching at our front door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you mention}} it," [...] I said slowly, [...] "I suppose {{there was a}} resemblance. I didn't look at him very much; I was {{studying}} the simulacrum of Yva. Also, you <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> some <b>time</b> since--I mean, there are no pier-glasses in Orofena." ...|$|R
60|$|I went to bed, {{but not to}} sleep. No man {{can sleep}} when {{he is about to}} {{undertake}} one of these Alpine exploits. I tossed feverishly all night long, and was glad enough when I heard the clock strike half past eleven and <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to get up for dinner. I rose, jaded and rusty, and went to the noon meal, where I found myself the center of interest and curiosity; for the news was already abroad. It is not easy to eat calmly when you are a lion; but it is very pleasant, nevertheless.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there was}} a crash and the mast went. I saw our side deck crumble and the other's stem cut through to the cabin top. Mast and boom were over the side, and when the round of her bow filled our cockpit I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to go. By good luck, we had towed the dinghy and the steamer held up Deva until we got on board. Then as we cut the painter the old boat broke away, and the steamer went on, {{over the top of}} her. I imagine she stopped, because we heard her whistle in the fog, but we'd had enough of her and pulled for the beach. We landed at Kingstown, and I think that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When Jack Frost {{came and}} we <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> {{to begin the}} long journey, Mr. Quack and myself and our twelve {{children}} joined with some other Duck families, and with Mr. Quack in the lead, we started for our winter home, which really isn't a home but just a place to stay. For a while we had nothing much to fear. We would fly by day and at night rest in some quiet lake or pond or on some river, with the Great Woods all about us or sometimes great marshes. Perhaps you don't know what marshes are. If the Green Meadows here had little streams of water running every which way through them, and the ground was all soft and muddy and full of water, and the grass grew tall, they would be marshes." ...|$|E

I knew I couldn't win it like in 2003 or 2007 (Monte Zoncolan stage), but I didn't expect to suffer so much and for so long during the three weeks. <b>It's</b> <b>been</b> a strange goodbye. I've ridden the Giro almost as an outsider, without the pressure to win and do well. It's hurt but I've been able to enjoy it. Before the finish today, the whole thing flashed before my eyes." ...|$|R
