5|$|Fillmore {{was active}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> of presidential {{candidates}} {{that preceded the}} Whig National Convention for the 1840 race. He initially supported General Winfield Scott, but really wanted to defeat Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, a slaveholder he felt could not carry New York state. Fillmore {{did not attend the}} convention, but was gratified when it nominated General William Henry Harrison for president, with former Virginia senator John Tyler his running mate. Fillmore organized Western New York for the Harrison campaign, and the national ticket was elected, while Fillmore easily gained a fourth term in the House.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Nebe lent a {{commissioner}} in his Criminal Police Office, Christian Wirth of Stuttgart, to the euthanasia organisation, {{which ran}} the programme of involuntary euthanasia of the disabled. Also in 1939, {{as head of}} Kripo, he was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> around the upcoming campaigns against the Sinti and Roma. Nebe wanted to include sending Berlin's Gypsies to the planned reservations for the Jews {{and others in the}} east. In October 1939, Nebe ordered Adolf Eichmann to put Gypsies with Jews on the transports to Nisko.|$|E

5|$|Nasser {{played a}} {{significant}} part in the strengthening of African solidarity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, although his continental leadership role had increasingly passed to Algeria since 1962. During this period, Nasser made Egypt a refuge for anti-colonial leaders from several African countries and allowed the broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from Cairo. Beginning in 1958, Nasser had a key role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> among African leaders {{that led to the}} establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take {{the sting out of}} his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich was one of his {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin {{in the eyes of the}} world. They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions.</b> German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E

Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, {{the first in}} May 2007 and the second in January 2008. While she did not participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions,</b> {{she sat in the}} front row and listened as the men vying to become the nation's 44th president claimed to be a rightful successor to her husband. Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid, nothing came of it. On March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the presumptive Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose the election to Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Wallingford, Stephen and Henry spoke together privately about a potential end to the war; Stephen's son Eustace, however, was furious about the peaceful outcome at Wallingford. He left his father and returned home to Cambridge to gather more funds for a fresh campaign, where he fell ill and died the next month. Eustace's death removed an obvious claimant to the throne and was politically convenient for those seeking a permanent peace in England. It is possible, however, that Stephen {{had already begun to}} consider passing over Eustace's claim; historian Edmund King observes that Eustace's claim to the throne was not mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> at Wallingford, for example, and this may have added to Stephen's son's anger.|$|E

The mutiny failed, but the patriots continued to plot, and in 1810 the May Revolution succeeded in deposing the new viceroy. Larrea did not take part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> at the open cabildo, but was appointed as member of the Primera Junta.|$|E

5|$|Many of McKinsey's alumni become CEOs {{of major}} {{corporations}} or hold important government positions. In doing so, they influence the other organization with McKinsey's values and culture. McKinsey's alumni {{have been appointed}} as CEOs or high-level executives at Google, American Express, Boeing, IBM, Westinghouse Electric, Sears, AT, PepsiCo, and Enron. McKinsey alumni have held positions with Tony Blair's office. Citicorp and Merrill Lynch have also hired many McKinsey alumni. As of 2008, McKinsey alumni held CEO positions with 16 corporations that have more than $2 billion in revenue. The firm was ranked by USA Today as the most likely company to work for and become a future CEO of a major corporation, with odds of 1 out of 690.

5|$|Walter Bellinger {{enjoyed the}} office of Ireland King of Arms from at least 1468. This is proven {{by the fact that}} on 3 June 1469, King Edward IV granted Bellinger a pension of £20 per annum for his service as Ireland. The same writ states that he had been {{appointed}} on 9 June the year before. Bellinger was a native of Dieppe, and had served as a herald for fifty-five years by 1477. He accompanied his King to France and acted as his ambassador to the French court <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> preceding the Treaty of Picquigny. The French King gave him the value of 100silver marks for his services in that affair. Bellinger held {{the office of}} Ireland King of Arms until the reign of Henry VII of England. After Bellinger, no one was appointed to fill the office.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{also found}} time to {{contribute}} to the administration of the wider university, serving on the Hebdomadal Council, as a Delegate of Oxford University Press, as one of the curators of the Bodleian, and as Pro-Vice-Chancellor 1974–5. It was during this period that he began to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable of a range of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic in the early Church (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981). The second of these in particular allowing him to draw on the full range of his interests.|$|E

5|$|It was Warelwast {{who told}} Anselm in 1103 {{that the king}} would not permit his return to England. This came after a failed joint mission by Warelwast and Anselm to Paschal {{attempting}} to resolve the dispute between Henry and the archbishop over the king's investiture of bishops, a dispute generally known as the Investiture Controversy. It is quite likely that the king had given instructions that if the mission failed, Warelwast was to inform Anselm that he should only to return to England if he agreed with the king's position in the dispute. In 1106 Warelwast was the king's negotiator <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> {{that led to the}} settlement of the Investiture Controversy in England. The king ultimately lost little, relinquishing the right to actually give the symbols of episcopal authority to a newly elected bishop in return for continuing to receive homage from the bishops. Early in 1106 Warelwast was sent to Bec Abbey, where Anselm was residing in exile, to inform him of the settlement and deliver to the archbishop the king's invitation to return to England. In May 1107 Warelwast acted as the king's envoy at Paschal's council at Troyes, where Paschal was attempting to secure support for Bohemond of Antioch's proposed campaign against Byzantium. Warelwast probably relayed to the pope the news that King Henry would make no contribution to Bohemond's efforts.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{remained}} {{imprisoned in}} Ravenna for three years, until released in June/July 539 {{by the new}} Gothic king, Witigis, in exchange for Gothic envoys sent to Persia who had been captured by the Byzantines. As a reward for his services, Emperor Justinian then appointed Peter to the post of magister officiorum ("Master of the Offices"), {{one of the highest}} positions in the state, heading the palace secretariat, the imperial guards (the Scholae Palatinae), and the Public Post with the dreaded agentes in rebus. He would hold this post for 26 consecutive years, longer by a wide margin than any other before or after. At about the same time or shortly thereafter, he was raised to the supreme title of patrician and the supreme senatorial rank of gloriosissimus ("most glorious one"). He was also awarded an honorary consulship. As magister, he took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> with Western bishops in 548 on the Three-Chapter Controversy, and was repeatedly sent as an envoy in 551–553 to Pope Vigilius, who opposed the emperor on the issue. Peter is also recorded as attending the Second Council of Constantinople in May 553.|$|E
