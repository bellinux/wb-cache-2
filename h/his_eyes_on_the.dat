5|$|The {{presence}} {{of death is}} felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, {{a symbol of the}} beloved, sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. That the speaker links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear. The moon nevertheless plays {{a significant role in the}} action of the poem: as the lover imagines the moon slowly sinking behind Lucy's cottage, he is entranced by its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trance—he sleeps while still keeping <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon (lines 17–20).|$|E
25|$|He was {{revealed}} to be an advance scout (a flunky, really) who was working for a conniving businessman named Count De Tour, who had <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Warbucks' fortune. Warbucks had De Tour's group blocked in South America over some businesses of his, that de Tour wanted.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Cromwell, Henry's Chief Minister, {{had long}} since had <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wealth of English monasteries; {{at the time they}} owned {{approximately}} a quarter of all the realm's landed wealth. Starting in 1534, Cromwell had each of the monasteries inspected, with the establishment's wealth and endowments recorded, along with frequent reports of impropriety, vice and excess. These reports were compiled into volumes known as the Valor Ecclesiasticus. Leicester abbey was inspected by Richard Layton, in 1535, who complimented Abbot Bourchier as an honest man, but who tried to bring charges of [...] "adultery and unnatural vice" [...] against the abbey's canons. Abbot Bourchier sought to gain Thomas Cromwell's favour to protect his canons and abbey; in 1536 sending him £100 and gifts of sheep and oxen. This was ultimately fruitless: Cromwell had convinced King Henry of the immoral behaviour within England's monasteries and thus between 1536 and 1541 they were all suppressed and dissolved: their land, property and wealth transferred to the king. The abbot's attempts at bribery could not save Leicester Abbey, and it was finally surrendered to the crown for dissolution in 1538.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the {{terminology}} {{appears to be}} fluid, relying primarily on rhyming with the intended meaning. One example provided by Daniel William Barrett, in his book, [...] "Life and Work Among The Navvies," [...] contains the following navvy slang; [...] "'now, Jack, I'm goin' to get a tiddley wink of pig's ear; keep your mince pies on the Billy Gorman.'" [...] This means the speaker's going for a beer, and asking the person being addressed, to keep <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foreman. Their exclusionary code usually left outsiders confused.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Daniel Mackinnon Hamilton, a Scotsman, had {{travelled}} to Kolkata to {{work for}} MacKinnon & McKenzie, a company with which he had family connections. The company sold tickets for the P shipping line, {{then one of the}} largest in the world. Hamilton became head of the company and master of an immense fortune, one of the richest men in British India. Another man may have taken his money and gone away but Hamilton set <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deltaic islands in south Bengal. In 1903, he bought [...] of the tide country from the government – it included such islands as Gosaba, Rangabelia, and Satjelia. His efforts at developing these places brought in other people into these islands. They were people who dared not only to struggle against nature but also the predators that lived there – tigers, crocodiles, sharks and lizards. They killed so many people that Hamilton gave rewards to people who killed them.|$|E
2500|$|Klusener scored {{consecutive}} fours in {{the first}} two balls of the over (bowled by Damien Fleming), levelling the scores and leaving South Africa with only 1 run to win in 4 balls with Klusener on strike. The third ball was a dot, and the fourth saw Klusener mis-hit his shot to mid-wicket fielder Mark Waugh. Klusener went for the run, although chances of a run-out were high and two balls were still remaining. However, Donald at the other end, keeping <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball, did not see Klusener sprinting down the pitch and did not hear the call to run, and Klusener was almost at the bowler's end by the time Donald (who had also dropped his bat) began running. By then, Waugh had thrown the ball to Fleming, who rolled it to Adam Gilchrist who took the bails off at the other end, meaning Donald was run-out by some distance, thus ending the match with the scores level. However, a tie meant that Australia progressed to the final since they had beaten South Africa in the group stages of the tournament. As commentator Bill Lawry put it during the final ball: ...|$|E
