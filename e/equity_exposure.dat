40|$|Abstract. The Basel Accords {{represent}} landmark financial agreements for {{the regulation}} of commercial banks. The main purpose of the accords was to strengthen the soundness and stability of the international banking system by providing a minimum standard for capital requirements. In 2004, the Basel Committee proposed new guidelines, which have become known as Basel II. We give a short overview of the Basel II framework and present the different approaches {{which can be used}} to determine the amount of regulatory capital needed for <b>equity</b> <b>exposures.</b> These methods vary from simple, rather rule of thumb methods, to more sophisticated and economic-oriented approaches. We compare the regulatory capital consumption of two equity portfolios using the different Basel II-compliant methods. We provide evidence that, as far as regulatory capital consumption for <b>equity</b> <b>exposures</b> is concerned, there is no real incentive for banks to use the more sophisticated and economic-oriented models such as VaR or EVT models...|$|R

25|$|A bank is {{required}} to compare the total expected losses with the total eligible provisions. If the expected loss amount {{is less than the}} provisions, the supervisor must consider if this is a true picture of reality, and then include the difference in Tier II capital. The expected losses for <b>equity</b> <b>exposures</b> under the PD/LGD approach is deducted 50% from Tier I and 50% from Tier II capital.|$|R
50|$|Asset {{allocation}} {{contributed significantly}} to these issues. Basic investment principles recommend that individuals reduce their equity investment exposure as they approach retirement. Studies show, however, that 43% of 401(k) participants had <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> in excess of 70% {{at the beginning of}} 2008.|$|E

5000|$|In 1996, Bernstein {{introduced}} Coward's Portfolio, {{a popular}} form of lazy portfolio. He explained [...] "a rational coward might split their <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> equally between S&P, EAFE, US small, and foreign small stocks."

40|$|A {{single factor}} that captures assets’ {{exposure}} to business-cycle variation in macroeconomic uncertainty {{can explain the}} level and cross-sectional differences of asset returns. Specifically, based on portfolio-level tests I demonstrate that fluctuations in uncertainty with persistence ranging from 32 to 128 months carry a negative price of risk of about − 2 % annually. The price of risk for fluctuations with persistence outside of this range and for the raw series of aggregate uncertainty is insignificant. Also, <b>equity</b> <b>exposures</b> are negative and hence the corresponding risk premia are positive. I quantify macroeconomic uncertainty using the model-free index of Jurado et al. (2015) derived from monthly, quarterly and annual forecasts...|$|R
40|$|The latest {{generation}} of variable annuity (VA) contracts contain equity put options plus longevity insurance. Much {{of the marketing}} material for these products, claim that these new riders should induce investors to take-on more financial risk. In this paper we examine whether this is indeed the case. Using a unique database we document that policyholders are in fact adopting higher <b>equity</b> <b>exposures</b> when these riders are selected. We also examine the theoretical merits of this advice by deriving the optimal asset allocation {{in the presence of}} these guarantees. Our main conclusion is that more aggressive equity allocations can indeed be justified in many, although not all product structures...|$|R

50|$|For {{many years}} with-profits {{policies}} {{were seen as}} a safe alternative to deposit accounts for many investors (especially elderly investors). Years of steady reliable returns in combination with unscrupulous sales tactics from insurers fostered the impression that a 'low-risk' investor should invest in with-profits. This perceived low risk belied {{the reality of the}} underlying investment strategies of many insurers who used high <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> and high-risk financial instruments to achieve the returns.|$|E

Although nominally single premium life policies, these offered only nominal life cover, and incidentally neatly avoided the liability to ad valorem stamp duty on life policies. <b>Equity</b> <b>exposure</b> was obtained by investing via a range of feeder funds into Allied Unit Trusts, whose manager was owned by Hambros; and property via Berkeley Hambro.|$|E
50|$|These are {{short-term}} coupon bearing notes, {{which are}} designed to provide an enhanced yield while maintaining certain equity-like risks. Their investment value {{is derived from the}} underlying <b>equity</b> <b>exposure,</b> paid in the form of fixed coupons. Owners receive full principal back at maturity if the Knock-in Level is not breached (which is typically 70-80% of the initial reference price). If the underlying stock falls in value, the investor will receive shares of stock which will be worth less than his original investment. The underlying stock, index or basket of equities is defined as Reference Shares. In most cases, Reverse convertibles are linked to a single stock.|$|E
40|$|American {{multinational}} firms {{respond to}} politically risky environments by adjusting their capital structures abroad and at home. Foreign subsidiaries located in politically risky countries have significantly more debt than do other foreign affiliates {{of the same}} parent companies. American firms further limit their <b>equity</b> <b>exposures</b> in politically risky countries by sharing ownership with local partners and by serving foreign markets with exports rather than local production. The residual political risk borne by parent companies leads them to use less domestic leverage, resulting in lower firm-wide leverage. Multinational firms with above-average exposures to politically risky countries have 8. 4 percent less domestic leverage than do other firms. These findings illustrate the impact of risk exposures on capital structure. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{compares the}} {{performance}} of bivariate error correction GARCH and FIGARCH models when estimating long term dynamic minimum variance hedge ratios (MVHRs) on the Australian All Ordinaries Index. The paper therefore introduces the bivariate error correction FIGARCH model into the hedging literature, which to date has only employed the GARCH class of processes. This is important {{for those interested in}} managing long term <b>equity</b> <b>exposures,</b> given that FIGARCH processes exhibit long memory, whilst the GARCH class of processes exhibit short memory. The naïve hedge ratio, the constant MVHR estimated via ordinary least squares (the OLS MVHR), the single period dynamic MVHR and the multi-period dynamic MVHR of Lee (1999) are considered. The results strongly support the estimation of dynamic MVHRs that allow for time varying correlations. Whilst long memory dependencies appear important, a multi-period dynamic MVHR that responds more rapidly to persistent changes in volatility dynamics requires development. Long memory, bivariate FIGARCH, time varying correlations, multi period minimum variance hedge ratios. ...|$|R
40|$|Under the Basel II banking {{regulatory}} capital regime the capital requirements for credit exposures are calculated using the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (ASRF) approach. The capital requirement {{is taken to}} be the contribution of an exposure to the unexpected loss on the bank's diversified portfolio. Here we extend this approach to calculate capital requirements for equity investments. We show {{that in the case}} when asset values have a normal distribution an analytical formula for the unexpected loss contribution may be developed. We show that the capital requirements for equity investments are quite different to those of credit <b>exposures,</b> since <b>equity</b> investments can suffer substantial loss of value even when the underlying company has not defaulted. Unexpected loss is commonly used as a measure of capital requirements, but it ignores the ability of earnings to absorb loss. We propose a definition of capital requirement that recognises the expected earnings on assets, and show how to combine the ASRF model and the Capital Asset Pricing Model to compute this quantity for credit and <b>equity</b> <b>exposures.</b> Capital allocation Economic capital Equity Basel II ASRF Factor model CAPM...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel idea for extracting {{information}} about future stock performance from {{the level of}} <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> of the CEO that is not conveyed by her purchases and sales. A high level of <b>equity</b> <b>exposure,</b> when it reflects the CEO’s own choice, is associated with 5 % to 9 % positive abnormal returns over the next year. This relation holds after controlling for purchases by the CEO and is stronger for firms where she has a greater information advantage. We rule out possible alternative explanations based on unobserved firm characteristics, missing risk factors, and incentive of the CEO to exert effort...|$|E
40|$|By buying {{convertibles}} and shorting {{the underlying}} stock, hedge funds distribute <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> to well-diversified shareholders. We find that firms with characteristics that make seasoned equity offerings expensive {{are more likely}} to issue convertibles to hedge funds. We conclude that hedge funds provide opportunities for firms to issue convertible securities at a lower cost than seasoned equity by serving as relatively low-cost distributors of <b>equity</b> <b>exposure.</b> A higher fraction of a convertible is privately placed with hedge funds when institutional ownership, stock liquidity, issue size, concurrent stock repurchases, and limitations on callability suggest that shorting costs will be lower.

40|$|Convertible {{arbitrage}} {{hedge funds}} combine long positions in convertible securities with short {{positions in the}} underlying stock. In effect, hedge funds use {{their knowledge of the}} borrowing and short-sale market to hedge themselves while distributing <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> to a large number of well-diversified investors through their short positions. The authors argue that many “would-be” equity issuers that would otherwise pay high costs in a secondary equity issue choose instead to issue convertible debt to hedge funds that in turn distribute <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> to institutional investors. This allows companies to receive “equity-like” financing today at lower cost than a secondary equity offering. The authors' findings also suggest that more convertibles will be privately placed with hedge funds when issuer and market conditions suggest that shorting costs will be lower. </p...|$|E
40|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{well-documented}} relation between political orientation and psychological traits, hedge funds' political orientations {{are related to}} their portfolio decisions. Relative to politically conservative hedge funds, politically liberal hedge funds exhibit a preference for smaller stocks, less mature companies, volatile stocks, unprofitable companies, non-dividend paying companies, and lottery-type securities. Politically liberal hedge funds {{are also more likely}} to enter new positions or fully exit existing positions, and make larger adjustments to their U. S. <b>equity</b> market <b>exposure.</b> Our results suggest that psychological characteristics can influence the portfolio decisions of even those at the very top of the financial sophistication ladder...|$|R

40|$|In {{this brief}} work we compute the market implied {{probability}} of default (PD) from market spreads and the theoretical CDS spreads from historical default frequencies. The loss given default (LGD) probability distribution has been constructed for a large pool portfolio of credit obligations exploiting a single-factor gaussian copula with a direct convolution algorithm computed at several default correlation parameters. Theoretical CDO tranche prices have been calculated. We finally design stochastic cash-flow stream model simulations to test fair pricing, compute credit value at risk (CV@R) and to evaluate the one year total future potential exposure (FPE) and derive the value at risk (V@R) for a CDO <b>equity</b> tranche <b>exposure.</b> ...|$|R

Using a sample of Italian listed banks over the period 2000 - 2009, we find evidence of increasing systematic and idiosyncratic risk for originating banks, in particular in the post-crisis period. We also find that securitization increases the probability of the originator banks to contribute to a market crisis...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine an aspect ofprofessional {{investment}} management {{which has not}} been adequately documented and studied; the extent to which equity mutualfund managers actively adjust their portfolio’s equity risk evosure over time. Estimates of a portfolio’s quarter-end beta are developed using the actual stock ho~~gs oft~~~ol ~ at the quarter-end. Changes in these beta estimates fivm one quarter to the next are shown to arise frtm both passive and active asset allocation. We find that active risk adjust~nt domi~~s~ssive rebalancing and that equity risk exposunz is quite variable over time. Thus, individual investors who estimate the equity risk inherent in a portfolio bused on a single time series return beta might seriously misestimate the portfolio’s current equity risk.
