40|$|XML (eXtensible Markup Language) {{language}} {{began to}} be developed in September 1996 {{under the auspices of}} the W 3 C with a clear proposal: design a tags language optimised for Internet. XML should continue with HTML simplicity but with the expressive capacity of its previous version, SGML. The edition of XML documents follows the following objectives: Distinguish the content and structure of the documents from their presentation in paper or on screen. Make its structure and informative contents explicit. Create documents that can be easily exchanged and processed in heterogeneous computing systems. To reach these objectives, XML proposes a format where the tags in the text of the documents are intercalated, in order to distinguish the various structural parts or elements of the same. The main characteristics are the following: The possibility of <b>descriptive</b> <b>marking.</b> In XML the tags. have the function of differentiating the informative contents of the documents against their use in HTML, where the tags are used to indicate how the content should be visualised. XML does not specify a valid group of tags, but provides rules that allow us create new vocabulary or group of tags applicable for the coding of various types of documents. The distinction between document structure and presentation. In XML a clear difference is established between the document structure and presentation. The XML document tags do not indicate how the document should be presented. To indicate how a document should be presented on screen or on paper, a separate style sheet should be created, and then associate it with the document...|$|E

40|$|Classifying a {{trademark}} as descriptive rather than suggestive fundamentally alters {{the scope of}} trademark protection. A <b>descriptive</b> <b>mark,</b> derived from {{a feature of the}} product or service sold, only qualifies for protection after the mark has acquired source significance, i. e., consumers see it as {{a trademark}}. A suggestive trademark, which indirectly invokes qualities of the product or service, is protected without evidence of source significance. Courts often struggle to distinguish between suggestive and <b>descriptive</b> <b>marks.</b> The effort would nevertheless be reasonable if the differences between suggestive and <b>descriptive</b> <b>marks</b> justified their disparate legal treatment. But in light of cognitive and historical research into language change, protecting a suggestive mark without evidence of source significance may not be warranted. In fact, trademark law erroneously inflates the difference between suggestive and <b>descriptive</b> <b>marks.</b> This mistake becomes apparent in light of theoretical, historical, and cognitive research into “semantic shift”: the process by which words gain and lose meaning over time. Linguistic analysis reveals an inconsistency between how trademark doctrine treats suggestive and descriptive trademarks and how consumers likely process them. Suggestive and <b>descriptive</b> <b>marks</b> are not so dissimilar as to justify different treatment. Instead, they likely influence consumers in similar ways. As a result, trademark law should reposition the line between descriptive and suggestive trademarks. A suggestive <b>mark,</b> like a <b>descriptive</b> <b>mark,</b> should be protected only upon a showing that the mark has developed source significance in the minds of consumers...|$|R
50|$|In {{trademark}} litigation, {{courts are}} most frequently asked to distinguish between suggestive and <b>descriptive</b> <b>marks</b> on the one hand, and between <b>descriptive</b> and generic <b>marks</b> on the other.

Lessons are taught {{in accordance with the}} learner's development and interests and their knowledge is assessed in a descriptive manner. A <b>descriptive</b> <b>mark</b> is based on how well a pupil meets knowledge standards in accordance with the English language syllabus. In order to assess pupils successfully, the process of teaching should motivate pupils for learning while the process of assessing should give relevant results of pupils' knowledge. Pupils should be motivated to participate in activities which involve assessment, they should also feel well throughout the process and the teachers should test what they teach. The description of the pupil's achievement and the <b>descriptive</b> <b>mark</b> itself are a complex problem for some of the teachers, especially for those who haven't gone through the process of descriptive assessment yet. The results of an evaluation research are described in the practical part of this master's thesis which was carried out among a group of second graders (28 pupils). On the basis of the theoretical knowledge and practical experience, various methods of assessment were introduced into practice, with the aim to provide a realistic picture of the pupils' knowledge. They were organized and carried out in a student-friendly way while they also followed all the principles of assessment: validity, reliability, objectivity, sensitivity and economy. Possible assessment techniques were described and tested young learners' listening and hearing comprehension and their speaking and communication skills.

5000|$|Trademark [...] "fair use" [...] differs {{significantly}} from fair use under copyright law. In trademark law {{there are two}} types of fair use: descriptive and nominative use. Descriptive fair use permits the use of a <b>descriptive</b> <b>mark</b> in a <b>descriptive</b> way; for example, an advertisement could say that a particular dress shoe [...] "feels like a sneaker" [...] even though the phrase [...] "Looks like a pump, feels like a sneaker" [...] is the trademark of another company. [...] Nominative fair use permits the use of a mark to identify the product that bears that mark, when (1) the product or service in question is not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2) no more of the mark is used than is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; and (3) the user does nothing beyond use of the mark that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. For example, a news story about the New Kids on the Block can use the mark [...] "New Kids on the Block" [...] to identify the band. [...] Nominative fair use is often particularly relevant to fanfiction, since a fanfiction writer’s use of trademarked names, settings, etc. to identify characters, story settings, etc. will generally meet the three requirements for nominative fair use. For this reason, fanfiction is harder to succeed on than an allegation of copyright infringement.|$|R

With increasing complexity of enterprise, enterprise architecture have become an important field. Creating an enterprise architecture can be complex task, so enterprise architecture framework were created to simplify the process and guide an architect through all areas of architecture development. This study concentrates on the comparative analysis of enterprise architecture frameworks. There are numbers of already established enterprise architecture frameworks in use today. Enterprise architecture frameworks are necessary to capture the entire complexity of enterprise. Some of these frameworks were developed for very specific areas, whereas others have broader functionality. None of the enterprise architecture frameworks is really complete. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. In this research, we provide a comparison of several classic frameworks {{that can be used}} for guidance in the selection of an enterprise architecture framework. Through the research we have found factors that have made a significant effect on the quality of chosen enterprise architecture frameworks. Multi-criteria model for qualitative assessment of appropriateness of the enterprise architecture frameworks has been developed applying DEX method and decision-making program DEXi. Development of the model was carried out successively and finally applied to the analysed the top three enterprise architecture frameworks. To validate the value of our research we prepare practical presentation of the chosen enterprise architecture frameworks. Enterprise architecture frameworks were given five different hierarchical <b>descriptive</b> <b>marks.</b> The worst mark "good" was given to Zachman framework, a little better mark "very good" got TOGAF and ArchiMate. Combination of TOGAF and ArchiMate was assessed with the best mark "excellent". But these ranks are not very important. More important are differences between frameworks. This study should provide a good starting point for understanding the value of each of these frameworks. Niche problems may require niche solutions. When selecting an enterprise architecture framework, organizations should consider a range of criteria, and should weight these according to their current and future needs. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Case {{management}} {{studies from}} Europe and the United States continue to yield conflicting results. At a symposium at the World Psychiatric Conference in Hamburg in 1999, researchers from four European countries explored the possible reasons {{for differences in}} outcome. They also examined reasons for the differing foci of case management studies across the different cultures. The authors summarize the symposium's findings. METHODS: Individual case presentations were given of studies and services from the United Kingdom (three studies), Sweden (two studies), Germany, and Italy (one each). Outcomes, methodologies, and national service context were examined. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A significant influence of national culture is evident both in the acceptability of case management and in approaches to researching it. Case management is perceived as an "Anglophone import" in Italy but is now national policy for persons with severe mental illness in the other three countries. Studies from the United Kingdom emphasized methodological rigor, with little attention to treatment content, whereas those from Sweden accepted a less disruptive research approach but with a more prescriptive stipulation of treatment content. Studies from Italy and Germany {{emphasized the importance of}} differing <b>descriptive</b> methodologies. <b>Marked</b> differences in the range of social care provision were noted across Europe.

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 99 : 40 in lengthThe recital program opens {{with one of}} Beethoven's middle period compositions which he entitled, Das Lebewohl Sonata, opus 81 a. The three <b>descriptive</b> movements, <b>marked</b> Das Lebewohl, Die Abwesenheit, and Das Wiedersehen, refer to the departure, absence, and return o Beethoven's student and friend, Archduke Rudolph of Austria. This is a very personal work describing Beethoven's deep sorrow and loneliness which ultimately finds relief in the joyous outburst of the last movement. Following Das Lebewohl Sonata are the Valses Nobles et Sentimentales by Ravel. This chain of valses contributes to the simpler and more economical style of writing used by some French composers who disliked compositions based strictly on virtuosity. In 1912, Ravel orchestrated the valses, creating the ballet, Adelaide. For the pianist these valses display a wonderful balance between rich chordal sonorities intertwined with simple lines of innermost expression. The {{second half of the}} recital opens with Aaron Copland's Piano Sonata. In ways similar to Beethoven's compositional style, Copland utilizes various short musical motifs to form this large intricate piano composition. The sonata makes considerable use of a three tone motif as did the first movement of Beethoven's Das Lebewohl Sonata. Structurally, this sonata embodies two slow and intensely serious outer movements separated by a scherzo which requires a swift, delicate touch and a sensitive approach to jazz-like rhythms. Concluding the program is Chopin's Ballade in F minor. This fourth Ballade, composed in 1842, shows Chopin's mastery of the art of expressive pianistic writing. Formally, the Ballade combines the variations of two main themes. While this Ballade is very lyrical and relaxed at the start, each variation becomes more technically and emotionally involved. Finally, the code unexpectedly bursts forth with a display of virtuosic writing which tests the performer's physical endurance and technical skill...|$|R

It {{is indeed}} {{one of the}} most serious, as {{one of the most}} absurd, weaknesses, of modern naturalists to imagine that any {{presently}} invented nomenclature can stand, even were it adopted by the consent of nations, instead of the conceit of individuals.

In the meantime, the simplest and most descriptive nomenclature is the best. Every one of these birds, for instance, might be called falco in Latin, hawk in English, some word being added to distinguish the genus, which should describe its principal aspect or habit. Falco montium, Mountain Hawk; Falco silvarum, Wood Hawk; Falco procellarum, Sea Hawk; and the like. Then, one <b>descriptive</b> epithet would <b>mark</b> species. Falco montium, aureus, Golden Eagle; Falco silvarum, apivorus, Honey Buzzard; and so on; and the naturalists of Vienna, Paris, and London should confirm the names of known creatures, in conclave, once every half-century, and let them so stand for the next fifty years.|$|R
