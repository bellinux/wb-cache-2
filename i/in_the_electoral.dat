5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, {{but even if the}} anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> College.|$|E

5|$|Although the SDP's {{number of}} seats was lower than ever with the {{exception}} of the 1962 election, party leader Jutta Urpilainen was proud of her party finishing second in the election after placing third in the previous election.

5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1902 <b>electoral</b> redistribution, Waihi {{was lost}} to <b>the</b> [...] electorate. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1907 <b>electoral</b> redistribution, Waihi {{came back to the}} Ohinemuri electorate, but Te Aroha {{was lost to}} the [...] electorate.

5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1875 <b>electoral</b> redistribution, <b>the</b> electorate's {{area was}} unaltered, but {{boundary}} changes {{were introduced in}} subsequent <b>electoral</b> redistributions. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1890 <b>electoral</b> redistribution, <b>the</b> electorate moved further inland and the settlements of Tapanui and Roxburgh were gained. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1892 <b>electoral</b> redistribution, <b>the</b> electorate moved further inland again and Tapanui was lost again, but Alexandra was gained. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1907 <b>electoral</b> redistribution, <b>the</b> shape of the electorate changed significantly, and Lawrence was lost to the Bruce electorate, but large areas were gained from the [...] electorate, including Ranfurly.|$|R
5|$|In 1632, Sigismund III Vasa, {{the king}} of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, died. Although the Commonwealth nobility quickly elected Sigismund's son Władysław IV Vasa as their new ruler, Poland's neighbours, expecting delays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> process, tested the Commonwealth's {{perceived}} weakness. Swedish king Gustav II Adolph sent envoys to Russia and the Ottoman Empire to propose an alliance and war against the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> college, {{the vote}} was more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|MacDowall's {{appeal for}} {{representation}} {{translated into a}} landslide victory on election day. On June 5, 1883 he defeated Andrew Porter capturing nearly 70% of the popular vote.

The ethnicity of the community was given as 98% white, 0.7% mixed race, 0.8% Asian, 0.2% black and 0.3% Chinese or other.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Taylor/Fillmore ticket won narrowly, with New York's {{electoral votes}} again {{key to the}} election. The Whig ticket won the popular vote by 1,361,393 (47.3 percent) to 1,223,460 (42.5 percent), and triumphed 163 to 127 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> College. Minor party {{candidates}} took no electoral votes, but {{the strength of the}} burgeoning anti-slavery movement was shown by the vote for Van Buren, who though he won no states earned 291,501 votes (10.1 percent) and finished second in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether the {{remaining}} five adherents of Pierleoni, who {{are believed to have}} been present at Rome, participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>electoral</b> proceedings. There is no doubt, however, that the lesser clergy of Rome was represented in the election. The electoral decree of Anacletus II bears the subscriptions of some of them, including Subdeacon Gregorio, primicerius scholae cantorum, who was appointed Cardinal-Deacon of S. Maria in Aquiro the following February 21, and Rainiero, Archpriest of the Patriarchal Liberian Basilica.|$|E

5|$|One {{third of}} the council is elected each year, {{followed}} by one year without elections. At the 2008 election, for example, there were 70 candidates contesting 20 seats. In 2007, turnout at the polling stations ranged from 26% in Orton Longueville to 55% in Central ward. At the previous election, voters were required to provide a signature before being issued with a ballot paper. This pilot scheme trialled new procedures which are now included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> Administration Act 2006.|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} were held within {{three weeks after}} the departure of Musharraf. Zardari vowed to pursue an unpopular campaign against tribal militancy in Pakistan and had the support of the United States. He claimed he had a London business school degree to satisfy a prerequisite for the presidency, but his party did not produce a certificate. He was endorsed by the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) for the presidency. The PML-N nominated former justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui, while the PML-Q put forth Mushahid Hussain Sayed. Zardari won a majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electoral</b> College with 481 of 702 votes. He was elected President on 6 September 2008.|$|E
