5|$|Andy Hawkins lost a <b>game</b> <b>on</b> July 1, 1990 to the Chicago White Sox {{while on}} the road by the score of 4–0 without {{allowing}} a hit. Because the White Sox were winning entering the ninth inning at home, they did not bat, and thus Hawkins pitched only 8 innings, but the game was considered a no-hitter at the time. However, following rules changes in 1991, the game is no longer counted as a no-hitter. Additionally, Tom L. Hughes held the Cleveland Indians without a hit through the first nine innings of a <b>game</b> <b>on</b> August 6, 1910 but the game went into extra innings and he lost the no-hitter in the tenth inning and ultimately lost the game 5–0.|$|E
