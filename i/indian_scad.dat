50|$|Decapterus russelli, the <b>Indian</b> <b>Scad,</b> Northern {{mackerel}} scad, round scad, Russell's mackerel scad, slender scad or {{the three}} lined grunter, is {{a species of}} ray-finned fish of the genus Decapterus {{which is part of}} the family Carangidae and which occurs in the Indian Ocean. It has colonised the eastern Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. It is an important species in coastal fisheries throughput its range.|$|E
5000|$|Decapterus russelli is fished for {{wherever}} it occurs, normally using seine nets and trawls. In 1999 the total catch was {{just short of}} 160,000 tonnes, with the tow major fishing nations being Thailand and Malaysia, which landed 82,000 tonnes and 70,160 tonnes respectively.Since the 1950s The weight of <b>Indian</b> <b>scad</b> landed fluctuates {{and there is no}} increasing or decreasing trend apparent in the population, however in south-east Asia there has been a marked increase in effort which has not seen an increase n landings suggesting the fishery is over-exploited. [...] It is generally marketed fresh, may be dried or salted, as well as being sold frozen and canned.|$|E
40|$|Indonesian waters have {{abundance}} of natural resources; {{the potential of}} small pelagic fish in Natuna Sea and South China Sea have not been optimized yet explores. Unfortunately, it was caused by lacking in the data of environmental conditions that have been changed and the information of appropriate fishing ground. Hence, dynamical oceanographic information and weather condition is necessary to optimize small pelagic fish exploitation. Research location in Natuna Sea and its surrounding with geographical position is 08 °N– 03 °S; 103 °– 111 °E. The oceanographic condition representative by monthly SST, Chl-a, SSH that derived from satellite data and Dipole Mode Index for 2002 - 2007 from FRCGC website. Monthly wind data is variable for weather condition. Small pelagic fish abundance representative by annual fish production (2002 - 2005) and monthly Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) of Goldstripe sardinella, Bigeye scad and <b>Indian</b> <b>scad</b> (2006). It was data collected from Directorate General of Capture Fisheries (Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries) and daily fishing operation (2007) used to calculate match-up ratio that was collected from Pemangkat fishing port in West Kalimantan. Research process consists of image processing, descriptive correlation analysis and GIS analysis to predict fishing ground map and match-up ratio calculation. Result {{of this research is}} the annual fish catch production of Bigeye scad and <b>Indian</b> <b>scad</b> (2002 - 2005) is tend to increase and the monthly CPUE of both species is high during SE Monsoon (May-Sep) that is condition contrarily in NW Monsoon (Nov-Apr). Meanwhile, the annual fish catch production of Goldstripe sardinella production is tend to decrease from 2002 - 2005, it has CPUE is high in early SE Monsoon (May). During the SE Monsoon (May-Sep) when DM Index is positive (+) the <b>Indian</b> <b>scad</b> and Bigeye scad production is high, for Goldstripe sardinella the fish production is high when DM Index is positive (+) in May. The accuracy of prediction map of small pelagic fishing ground in Natuna Sea is about 0. 61, 0. 76 and 0. 81 for Goldstripe sardinella, <b>Indian</b> <b>scad</b> and Bigeye scad, respectively...|$|E
50|$|The {{mackerel}} scad's range covers {{most of the}} world's oceans. In {{the western}} Atlantic, they have been found off Nova Scotia and Bermuda, south to Rio de Janeiro, although they do not seem common in the Gulf of Mexico. In the eastern Atlantic, mackerel scad have been found off St. Helena, Ascension Island, and Cape Verde. They have also been recorded in the Gulf of Guinea, The Azores, and Madeira. In the <b>Indian</b> Ocean, mackerel <b>scad</b> {{have been found in}} the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden they are also known from South Africa, the Mascarenes, the Seychelles, and Sri Lanka. In the eastern Pacific, they are known from Revillagigedo Island, the Gulf of California, and the coast of Ecuador.|$|R
40|$|Background: Understanding {{different}} patterns of fish consumption {{is an important}} component for risk assessment of contaminants in fish. A few studies on food consumption had been conducted in Malaysia, but none of them focused specifically on fish consumption. The objectives of this study were to document the meal pattern among three major ethnics in Malaysia with respect to fish/seafood consumption, identify most frequently consumed fish and cooking method, and examine the influence of demographic factors on pattern of fish consumption among study subjects. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between February 2008 and May 2009 to investigate patterns of fish consumption among Malaysian adults in Peninsular Malaysia. Adults aged 18 years and above were randomly selected and fish consumption data were collected using a 3 -day prospective food diary. Results: A total of 2, 675 subjects, comprising male (44. 2 %) and female (55. 7 %) participants from major ethnics (Malays, 76. 9 %; Chinese, 14. 7 %; Indians, 8. 3 %) {{with a mean age of}} 43. 4 ± 16. 2 years, were involved in this study. The results revealed 10 most frequently consumed marine fish in descending order: Indian mackerel, anchovy, yellowtail and yellow-stripe scads, tuna, sardines, torpedo <b>scad,</b> <b>Indian</b> and short-fin <b>scads,</b> pomfret, red snapper, and king mackerel. Prawn and squid were also among the most preferred seafood by study subjects. The most frequently consumed freshwater fish were freshwater catfish and snakehead. The most preferred cooking style by Malaysians was deep-fried fish, followed by fish cooked in thick and/or thin chili gravy, fish curry, and fish cooked with coconut milk mixed with other spices and flavorings. Overall, Malaysians consumed 168 g/day fish, with Malay ethnics’ (175 ± 143 g/day) consumption of fish significantly (p< 0. 001) higher compared with the other two ethnic groups (Chinese= 152 ± 133 g/day, Indians= 136 ± 141 g/day). Conclusion: Fish consumption was significantly associated with ethnicity, age, marital status, residential area, and years of education of adults in Peninsular Malaysia, and the data collected are beneficial for the purpose of health risk assessment on the intake of contaminants through fish/seafood consumption...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRound scad {{mackerel}} sampled in 1995 - 1998 were {{analysed for}} genetic variation using mitochondrial and nuclear-DNA markers. Sequence variation for {{a fragment of}} the cytochrome b gene (mitochondrial), amplified by polymerase chain reaction, was screened across individuals using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Sequence analysis of all SSCP haplotypes indicated two mitochondrial clades separated by 2. 3 % nucleotide divergence on the average. The geographic distribution of haplotypes was homogeneous (Weir and Cockerham's ^θ=- 0. 002). Also, no geographical heterogeneity was detected for length polymorphism of Intron 1 of the gene encoding aldolase B (^θ= 0. 005). While homogeneity in allele frequencies throughout the Indo-Malay archipelago conformed to the expectations for a widely distributed pelagic fish in a highly connected habitat, this was at variance with the sharp geographic structure previously uncovered in <b>Indian</b> <b>scad</b> mackerel, D. russelli, a fish with life-history characteristics similar to D. macrosoma. A remarkable similarity however was the occurrence of two similarly distinct clades within each species, suggesting a common history of geographic isolation. Low sea levels in the Pleistocene might have caused the separation and vicariance of populations within both D. macrosoma and D. russelli. Subsequent genetic exchange between populations would then have erased allele-frequency differences at the cytochrome b and aldolase B loci in D. macrosoma while some barrier to gene flow was maintained in D. russelli...|$|E
40|$|Decapterus russelli (<b>Indian</b> <b>Scad)</b> is an {{important}} pelagic carangid distributed on both east and west coast of India. Despite its wide distribution, the stock structure of the species is not well known. The present {{study was conducted to}} investigate stock structure of D. russelli, based on body shape morphometrics using truss network system. A total number of 360 samples of the species were collected from two centres, Digha and Visakhapatnam in Bay of Bengal from east coast and on the west coast from Mumbai and Cochin in Arabian Sea. A truss network was constructed by interconnecting 11 landmarks to form a total of 23 distance variables extracted from digital images of samples using tps Dig 2 and PAST software platforms. The transformed truss measurements were subjected to factor analysis and classification by cross-validation of discriminant analysis. Factor analysis showed meaningful loading of the middle portion, the portion below the second dorsal fin, above anal fin, and the caudal portion on first and second factor, respectively. The factor analysis revealed the existence of two morphologically different stocks of D. russelli between east and west coast of India. The discriminant analysis was conducted by the combination of the truss distances that loaded on Factor- 1 and Factor- 2. The measurements that belonged to the middle portion and caudal portion of the body produced minimum misclassification rate of 5...|$|E
40|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} {{play a very}} {{important}} role in human nutrition and health. Lipids of these fish differ remarkably from plant and other animal lipids. The aim {{of the study was to}} describe the proximate composition of thirty-three small pelagic fish species commonly available in Sri Lanka. Fish species were collected from Negombo and Chillaw fish landing sites and subjected to analysis for moisture, ash, protein and total lipid content. Tiger tooth croaker (Otolithus ruber) was found to have the highest moisture percentage (80. 0 %) followed by Clarias sp. (78. 9 %), Indian anchovy (Steloporus indicus) and Comerson's anchovy (Stelophorus commersonii), (78 %). The lowest percentage of moisture, 69. 4 %, was recorded in white sardinella (Sardinella albella). Indian ilisha (Ilisha melastoma) was found to have the highest amount of ash (10. 1 %) followed by Otolithus sp. (8 %) and big-eye barracuda contained the least amount (2. 5 %). Carassius Carassius, pick handle barracuda (Sphyraena jello) and Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) contained higher amounts of protein, 24. 3, 20. 6 and 19. 2 % respectively. The lowest protein content (10. 1 %) was found in <b>Indian</b> <b>scad</b> (Decapterus russelli). The protein content of the fish was in the range of 13 - 15 %. The results revealed that the small fish are moderate protein sources. The total lipid content varied between 0. 6 - 8 %.
