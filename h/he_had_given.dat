5|$|Carl Jaenisch {{had arrived}} {{too late for}} the tournament; Staunton convincingly won a match with him soon after (seven wins, one draw, and two losses). Later in 1851 Staunton played a match against Elijah Williams, who had won their {{play-off}} for third place in the London International tournament. Staunton won more games (six wins, three draws, and four losses) but lost the match because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> Williams a three-game start.|$|E
5|$|In 82 Agricola crossed an {{unidentified}} {{body of water}} and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few auxiliaries. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe that the crossing referred to {{was in fact a}} small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, Meher Baba began {{a period}} of {{extensive}} world travel, with several trips to Europe and the United States. It was during this period that he established contact with his first close group of Western disciples. He traveled on a Persian passport because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up writing as well as speaking and would not sign the forms required by the British government of India.|$|E
5|$|King Coenwulf of Mercia {{may have}} {{supported}} the unfortunate Ealhmund, and Symeon of Durham wrote that in 801:Eardwulf, king of the Northumbrians, led an army against Coenwulf, king of Mercians, because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> asylum to his enemies. He also, collecting an army, obtained very many auxiliaries from other provinces, having made a long expedition among them.

Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> to Laura. He turns to look as the door opens, and he smiles.|$|E

5|$|Nash {{strongly}} opposed {{the relocation of}} South Melbourne Football Club to Sydney (renamed the Sydney Swans) in 1981, considering it a repudiation of the proud South Melbourne he had helped create. Nash stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> fifty years to South Melbourne but due to the relocation they had now lost him forever and refused to attend Swans matches for many years, relenting only {{shortly before his death}} to attend a match between Sydney and Footscray.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} Lord Kenmare (who {{had not been}} in Dublin at the time) denied that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> the least {{authority}} to any person to make any such statement in his name. However, his disavowal came too late: the anti-Catholic party in the convention had found time to organize themselves, and when the intended Reform Bill took shape it was known that the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise was not to form part of the scheme.|$|E
5|$|When Il trittico premiered at New York's Metropolitan Opera in December 1918, Gianni Schicchi {{became an}} {{immediate}} hit, {{whereas the other}} two operas were received with less enthusiasm. This pattern was broadly repeated at the Rome and London premieres and led to commercial pressures to abandon the less successful elements. Although on artistic grounds Puccini opposed performing the three operas except as the original triptych, by 1920 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> his reluctant consent to separate performances. Gianni Schicchi has subsequently become the most-performed part of Il trittico and has been widely recorded.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 900 people {{attended}} Turning Point. Canadian Online Explorer writer Bob Kapur rated the entire event a 7 out of 10, {{which was the}} same rating <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> to the 2004 installment. It was higher than the 6.5 out of ten the 2006 event was given by Chris Sokol. The Turning Point ranking was lower than Genesis' rating, which received an 8 out of 10 from Corey David Lacroix. TNA's next PPV event, Final Resolution, was ranked lower than Turning Point; it received a rating of 6.5 out of 10 from Kapur. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) Armageddon PPV event, Turning Point was ranked higher as Armageddon was given a 6.5 out of 10 by Chris Sokol.|$|E
5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E
5|$|After Corzine's breakup with Katz, {{their lawyers}} {{negotiated}} a financial payout in November 2004. According to press accounts, the settlement for Katz exceeded $6million, including cash (in part {{used to buy}} her $1.1million condominium in Hoboken), a college trust fund to educate her children, a 2005 Volvo sport utility vehicle, and Corzine forgave a $470,000 loan he had made to Katz in 2002 to buy out her ex-husband's share of their home in Alexandria Township. Katz enrolled in Seton Hall University School of Law on a full scholarship in 2004. Corzine later acknowledged <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> $15,000 to Katz's brother-in-law, Rocco Riccio, a former state employee who {{was forced to resign}} after being accused of examining income tax returns for political purposes. At the time, Katz was president of the CWA Local 1034, which bargains on behalf of many state employees.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> {{sanctuary}} to Tostig Godwinson {{when the}} Northumbrians drove him out, Malcolm was not {{directly involved in}} the ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death at the battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew Edward the Exile, and her children: Edgar Ætheling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a dux named Wada, {{who was one of}} those who had killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near Whalley, Lancashire. Wada was put to flight and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The {{evidence}} for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald is known to have become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up his ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Blamey became {{involved}} in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> his key ring, which included his badge, to {{a friend who had}} served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E
