Since ethanol is a powerful inducer of respiration-deficient mutants, this alcohol has been proposed {{to be the source}} of the high diversity found in the mitochondrial genomes of <b>flor</b> <b>yeasts</b> and other wine yeasts. Southern blot analysis suggests that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphic changes are due to minor lesions in the mitochondrial genome. As determined in this work by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, restriction analysis, and Southern blot analysis, ethanol-induced petite mutants completely lack mtDNA (rho zero). Ethanol-induced changes in the mitochondrial genome that could explain the observed mtDNA polymorphism in <b>flor</b> <b>yeasts</b> were not found.

Wine fermentation and biological aging are performed by strains of S. cerevisiae with, respectively, pelagic fermentative growth on glucose, and biofilm aerobic growth utilizing ethanol. Here, we use environmental samples of wine and <b>flor</b> <b>yeasts</b> to investigate the genomic basis of yeast adaptation to contrasted anthropogenic environments. Phylogenetic inference and population structure analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed a group of <b>flor</b> <b>yeasts</b> separated from wine yeasts. A combination of methods revealed several highly differentiated regions between wine and <b>flor</b> <b>yeasts,</b> and analyses using codon-substitution models for detecting molecular adaptation identified sites under positive selection in the high affinity transporter gene ZRT 1. The Cross Population Composite Likelihood Ratio (XP-CLR) revealed selective sweeps at three regions, including in the hexose transporter gene HXT 7, the yapsin gene YPS 6 and the membrane protein coding gene MTS 27. Our analyses also revealed that the biological aging environment {{has led to the}} accumulation of numerous mutations in proteins from several networks, including Flo 11 regulation and divalent metal transport. Together, our findings suggest that the tuning of FLO 11 expression and zinc transport networks are a distinctive feature of the genetic changes underlying the domestication of <b>flor</b> <b>yeasts.</b> Our study highlights the multiplicity of genomic changes underlying yeast adaptation to man-made habitats, and reveals that flor/wine yeast lineage can serve as a useful model for studying the genomics of adaptive divergence...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flor</b> <b>yeasts</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have {{an innate}} {{diversity}} of Flo 11 p which codes for a highly hydrophobic and anionic cell-wall glycoprotein with {{a fundamental role in}} biofilm formation. In this study, 380 nitrogen compounds {{were administered to}} three S. cerevisiae flor strains handling Flo 11 p alleles with different expression levels. S. cerevisiae strain S 288 c was used as the reference strain as it cannot produce Flo 11 p. The flor strains generally metabolized amino acids and dipeptides as the sole nitrogen source, although with some exceptions regarding L-histidine and histidine containing dipeptides. L-histidine completely inhibited growth and its effect on viability was inversely related to Flo 11 p expression. Accordingly, L-histidine did not affect the viability of the Δflo 11 and S 288 c strains. Also, L-histidine dramatically decreased air-liquid biofilm formation and adhesion to polystyrene of the <b>flor</b> <b>yeasts</b> with no effect on the transcription level of the Flo 11 p gene.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of gross chromosomal rearrangements to adaptive evolution has not been precisely defined. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>flor</b> <b>yeast</b> strains offer significant advantages {{for the study of}} molecular evolution since they have recently evolved to a high degree of specialization in a very restrictive environment. Using DNA microarray technology, we have compared the genomes of two prominent variants of S. cerevisiae <b>flor</b> <b>yeast</b> strains. The strains differ from one another in the DNA copy number of 116 genomic regions that comprise 38 % of the genome. In most cases, these regions are amplicons flanked by repeated sequences or other recombination hotspots previously described as regions where double-strand breaks occur. The presence of genes that confer specific characteristics to the <b>flor</b> <b>yeast</b> within the amplicons supports the role of chromosomal rearrangements as a major mechanism of adaptive evolution in S. cerevisiae. We propose that nonallelic interactions are enhanced by ethanol- and acetaldehyde-induced double-strand breaks in the chromosomal DNA, which are repaired by pathways that yield gross chromosomal rearrangements. This mechanism of chromosomal evolution could also account for the sexual isolation shown among the <b>flor</b> <b>yeast...</b>|$|R

A database search to enrich flor yeast “biological process” and “cellular component” according to Gene Ontology Terminology (GO Terms) and, “pathways” was carried out. The most abundant proteins detected were largely involved in respiration, translation, stress damage prevention and repair, amino acid metabolism (glycine, isoleucine, leucine and arginine), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and biosynthesis of vitamin B 9 (folate).

40|$|<b>Flor</b> <b>yeasts</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are {{the main}} actors in the {{biological}} ageing of Sherry wines by developing an air-liquid biofilm, called velum at the surface of wine {{at the end of}} fermentation. The air-liquid biofilm occurs due to a complex mechanism which is similar to many microbial biofilms. The velum phenotype is mainly regulated by the expression of a highly O-glycosylated cell wall protein Flo 11 which by turn contributes to the hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge of the cell wall which are crucial for unspecific interactions and adhesion capacity of yeasts. In this study we characterized the interactions of <b>flor</b> <b>yeasts</b> with a series of nitrogen compounds known for their hydrophobicity and/or charge. We find that, different flor yeast strains characterized by different degree of functional FLO 11 are diversely affected in terms of biofilm formation and adhesion capacity when interact with different nitrogen sources. The positive role of the synthetic hexapeptide PAF 26 in enhancing the biofilm formation was first discovered. On the contrary, cationic amino acids were able to inhibit biofilm formation and adhesion ability. Results together highlight on the involvement of the Flo 11 p in hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and open to new investigations, addressed to the control of microbial adhesion and biofilm formation...|$|E

In contrast, the aging of Sherry and Sherry-like wines is an aerobic process that depends on the oxidative activity of flor strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In this thesis we have studied the genome of <b>flor</b> <b>yeast</b> in comparison to wine yeast in order to unravel their specificities.

From the genome sequence of 16 strains (8 wine and 8 flor) from France, Hungary, Italy and Spain we have drawn a phylogeny that showed that <b>flor</b> <b>yeast</b> represent a specific group of yeast different from wine and identified divergent regions. These regions contain genes involved in key functions and several associated with velum growth. Remarkably, many genes involved in FLO 11 regulation such as MAP kinase, or Ras/PKA pathways were mutated among flor strains and many variations were encountered in genes involved with metal homeostasis such as zinc and divalent metal transporters.

40|$|Wine {{biological}} {{aging is}} a wine making process {{used to produce}} specific beverages in several countries in Europe, including Spain, Italy, France, and Hungary.

We inferred the population structure of these European flor strains from their microsatellite genotype diversity and analyzed their ploidy. We show that almost all of these flor strains belong to the same cluster and are diploid, except for a few Spanish strains. Comparison of the array hybridization profile of six flor strains originating from these four countries, with that of three wine strains did not reveal any large segmental amplification.

40|$|<b>Flor</b> <b>yeasts</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied for biofilm formation, however {{the lack of}} specific haploid model strains has limited the application of genetic approaches such as gene knockout, allelic replacement and Quantitative Trait Locus mapping for the deciphering of the molecular basis of velum formation under biological ageing. The aim of this work was to construct a set of flor isogenic haploid strains easy to manipulate genetically. The analysis of the allelic variations at 12 minisatellite loci of 174 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains allowed identifying three flor parental strains with different phylogenic positions. These strains were characterized for sporulation efficiency, growth on galactose, adherence to polystyrene, agar invasion, growth on wine and ability to develop a biofilm. Interestingly, the inability to grow on galactose was found associated with a frameshift in GAL 4 gene that seems peculiar of flor strains. From these wild flor strains, isogenic haploid strains were constructed by deleting HO gene with a loxP-KanMX-loxP cassette followed by {{the removal of the}} kanamycin cassette.

Apart from forming a barrier between the wine and the air, the flor also cause certain chemical phenomena in the wine which affect the taste: they consume glycerine (thus conferring a typically dry character to the wine), they significantly reduce the volatile acidity level of the wine, and they produce great quantities of paraldehydes and acetaldehydes which are responsible for the almond notes of the wines.|$|R
50|$|Jura is a {{wine-growing}} region.

2500|$|As a few {{orders of}} Sherry would trickle in, the Sherry merchants would bottle a small {{quantity}} and then top {{up the rest}} of the barrel with wine from some of their newer inventory.

This system was not unique to Sherry or even to Spain: it had been practiced for centuries in the Rhineland. However nowhere else in the world had such a system had such a dramatic effect on the wine. Through this process of aging, the wine developed distinct characters at various age points. The introduction of new wine into the barrel also stimulated the <b>flor</b> <b>yeast</b> in the wine which then imparted new flavors and fragrances. Through the use of fractional blending, the merchants realized they could also maintain a more consistent profile in their wines across the years.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{fermentation}} {{phase of}} sherry production the <b>flor</b> <b>yeast</b> work anaerobically, converting sugar into ethanol.

This process drastically lowers the acidity of the wine and makes Sherries one of the most aldehydic wines in the world. Studies have shown that for the flor to survive and thrive the wine must stay between the narrow alcohol range of 14.5 to 16% ABV. Below 14.5%, the yeast do not form their protective waxy cap and the wine oxidizes to the point of becoming vinegar. Above 16% and the flor can not survive, the wine essentially becoming an oloroso.|$|R

An amontillado sherry begins as a fino, fortified to approximately 13.5% alcohol with a cap of <b>flor</b> <b>yeast</b> limiting its exposure to the air. A cask of fino {{is considered to be}} amontillado if the layer of flor fails to develop adequately, is intentionally killed by additional fortification or is allowed to die off through non-replenishment. Without the layer of flor, amontillado must be fortified to approximately 17.5% alcohol so that it does not oxidise too quickly. After the additional fortification, amontillado oxidises slowly, exposed to oxygen through the slightly porous American or Canadian oak casks, and gains a darker colour and richer flavour than fino.|$|R

There are other appellations within Jura that are permitted to produce AOC vin jaune, most notably the Côtes du Jura AOC, but Château-Chalon has specific regulations that are unique to this AOC. To begin with, the grapes must be harvested at brix levels that allow for a potential alcohol content of at least 12% in the finished wine; other regions will allow a minimum of 11.5%. While the grapes are harvested late, they are never botrytized, unlike other well known late harvest French wines such as Sauternes. After fermentation the wine must be stored for at least six years and three months prior to bottling. The majority of time is spent in wood casks that are only partially filled, allowing for a film of yeast, known as the voile or [...] "veil", to develop across the surface.

5000|$|Flor (Spanish and Portuguese for flower) is a {{winemaking}} term {{referring to}} a film of yeast {{on the surface of}} wine and which is important in the manufacture of some styles of sherry. The flor is formed naturally under certain winemaking conditions, from indigenous yeasts found in the region of Andalucía in southern Spain. Normally in winemaking, it is essential to keep young wines away from exposure to air by sealing them in airtight barrels, to avoid contamination by bacteria and yeasts that tend to spoil it. However, in the manufacture of sherries, the slightly porous oak barrels are deliberately filled only about five-sixths full with the young wine, leaving [...] "the space of two fists" [...] empty to allow the <b>flor</b> <b>yeast</b> to take form and the bung is not completely sealed. The flor favors cooler climates and higher humidity, so the sherries produced in the coastal Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa María have a thicker cap of flor than those produced inland in Jerez.

It has been detected {{in a wide}} range of commodities, including cereals, coffee, grapes, raisins, must and wine. Within grape derivative products, the raisins, red wine and sweet wines have reported to contain the highest OTA levels. Aspergillus section Nigri (A. niger and A. carbonarius) are considered the OTA source in these commodities and they are commonly isolated among other fungi from grapes and raisins. Starting from this basis the objectives of this thesis were focused into three main aspects: (1) Evaluation of the food products: vine dried fruits and special wines, concerning the mycobiota and OTA occurrence and incidence; (2) Ecophysiological studies of the ochratoxigenic fungi and accompanying mycobiota as affected by environmental conditions; (3) Control and preventive methods such as the evaluation of residual activity of pre-harvest fungicides during grape dehydration and the use of modified atmospheres. Wine origin and winemaking procedure showed to be determinant for the final OTA content. All special wines analysed from northern European regions were negative for OTA while more than 50 % of wines from warmer regions were positive for OTA contamination. The wines with higher OTA levels were fortified musts followed by those made from dried grapes. Acoholic and malo-lactic fermentations, biological 'crianza' (<b>Flor</b> <b>yeast)</b> and the action of Botrytis cinerea in noble rot of grapes may diminish the OTA levels in wine. In grapes, the presence of Aspergillus section Nigri became predominant at harvest and mainly during sun-drying.

When fermentation had slowed {{to a point where}} no yeast were emerging, the gose was ready to bottle. The barrel was emptied into a tank, whence it was filled into traditional long-necked bottles. These were not closed with a cap or cork, but with a plug of <b>yeast</b> (<b>flor)</b> which naturally rose up the neck as the secondary fermentation continued.|$|R
