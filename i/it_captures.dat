5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and {{is powered by a}} USB connection. <b>It</b> <b>captures</b> video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that it could also be used to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. <b>It</b> <b>captures</b> the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. <b>It</b> <b>captures</b> a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, {{we decided}} to score MVS for two factors that we defined as (1) Happiness {{dimension}} since <b>it</b> <b>captured</b> all original happiness items and one success item, and (2) Centrality/Success dimension as <b>it</b> <b>captured</b> all centrality items and two success items. Internal consistency analysis yielded Cronbach alpha for Happiness dimension 0.72, and Centrality/Success dimension 0.72.|$|R

25|$|The Steerage is a {{photograph}} taken by Alfred Stieglitz in 1907. It has been hailed {{as one of the}} greatest photographs of all time because <b>it</b> <b>captures</b> in a single image both a formative document of its time and one of the first works of artistic modernism.|$|E

25|$|The {{lion and}} lion hawk may take {{multiple}} (2) steps {{in a single}} turn. These {{do not have to}} be in a line, so these pieces can potentially reach every square within two or three steps of the starting square, not just squares along one of the diagonals or orthogonals. Such moves are also useful to get around obstructions. An area mover must stop where <b>it</b> <b>captures.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{division}} {{then transferred}} to the 18th Guards Rifle Corps {{in the area of}} Kursk. They took positions in the second defensive line of the 13th Army, part of the Central Front.

25|$|The Archival Cytometry Standard (ACS) {{is being}} {{developed}} to bundle data with different components describing cytometry experiments. <b>It</b> <b>captures</b> relations among data, metadata, analysis files and other components, and includes support for audit trails, versioning and digital signatures.

The XML Signature W3C Recommendation has been adopted to allow for digital signatures of components within the ACS container.|$|E
25|$|The range {{covered by}} a hook move is the {{equivalent}} of two moves by a rook, or two moves by a bishop, depending on the piece. However, a hook move is functionally a single move: The piece cannot capture twice in one move, nor may it capture and then move on. It must stop before an intervening piece (unless it first changes direction to avoid it), and must stop when <b>it</b> <b>captures,</b> just like any other ranging piece. It can only change direction once per move.|$|E

2500|$|A {{promoted}} king also gains {{the power}} to [...] "kill by illumination": <b>It</b> may <b>capture,</b> without moving, any pieces that <b>it</b> could <b>capture</b> if <b>it</b> were to move. That is, <b>it</b> may <b>capture</b> more than one piece, but only one piece in any direction and {{only if they are}} unprotected by either opposing player. (It is not clear if <b>it</b> must <b>capture</b> all such pieces, or if it may be selective.) It cannot combine this power with a physical move.|$|R
25|$|Many pieces {{can move}} {{any number of}} empty squares along a {{straight}} line, limited only by {{the edge of the}} board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where <b>it</b> <b>captures,</b> and cannot bypass a piece that is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot move in that direction at all.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{industries}} (small-scale services, for example) tend to {{have more}} VAT avoidance, particularly where cash transactions predominate, and VAT may be criticized for encouraging this. From the perspective of government, however, VAT may be preferable because <b>it</b> <b>captures</b> {{at least some of the}} value added. For example, a building contractor may offer to provide services for cash (i.e. without a receipt, and without VAT) to a homeowner, who usually cannot claim input VAT back. The homeowner will thus bear lower costs and the building contractor may be able to avoid other taxes (profit or payroll taxes).|$|E
25|$|Anti-Semitism, {{like all}} forms of racism, distorts the truth {{in order to put}} a whole race of people in a bad light. This film does nothing of the sort. It draws out from the {{historical}} objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. <b>It</b> <b>captures</b> the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any more violence against any other human being.|$|E
