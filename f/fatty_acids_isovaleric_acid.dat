National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The overall goal of the project was to establish odor and chemical emission factors for animal feeding operations. The study was conducted over a 17 -month period at two freestall dairies, one swine sow farm, and one swine finisher facility. Samples from a representative exhaust airstream at each barn were collected in 10 L Tedlar bags and analyzed by trained human panelists using dynamic triangular forced-choice olfactometry. Samples were simultaneously analyzed for 20 odorous compounds (acetic acid, propanoic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric <b>acid,</b> valeric <b>acid,</b> <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid,</b> hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, guaiacol, phenol, 4 -methylphenol, 4 -ethylphenol, 2 -aminoacetophenone, indole, skatole, dimethyl disulfide, diethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia). In this article, which is part 6 of a six-part series summarizing results of the project, we investigate the correlations between odor concentrations and odor activity value (OAV), defined as the concentration of a single compound divided by the odor threshold for that compound. The specific objectives were to determine which compounds contributed most to the overall odor emanating from swine and dairy buildings, and develop equations for predicting odor concentration based on compound OAVs. Single-compound odor thresholds (SCOT) were statistically summarized and analyzed, and OAVs were calculated for all compounds. Odor concentrations were regressed against OAV values using multivariate regression techniques. Both swine sites had four common compounds with the highest OAVs (ranked high to low: hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, butyric <b>acid,</b> <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid).</b> The dairy sites had these same four compounds in common in the top five, and in addition diethyl disulfide was ranked second at one dairy site, while ammonia was ranked third at the other dairy site. Summed OAVs were not a good predictor of odor concentration (R 2 = 0. 16 to 0. 52), underestimating actual odor concentrations by 2 to 3 times. Based on the OAV and regression analyses, we conclude that hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid,</b> ammonia, and diethyl disulfide are the most likely contributors to swine odor, while hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methyl phenol, butyric <b>acid,</b> and <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> are the most likely contributors to dairy odors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} lipid chain packing and {{permeant}} {{size and shape}} on permeability across lipid bilayers have been investigated in gel and liquid crystalline dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers by a combined NMR line-broadening/dynamic light scattering method using seven short-chain monocarboxylic acids (formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric <b>acid,</b> valeric <b>acid,</b> <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid,</b> and trimethylacetic acid) as permeants. The experimental permeability coefficients are compared with the predictions of a bulk solubility diffusion model in which the bilayer membrane is represented as a slab of bulk hexadecane. Deviations of the observed permeability coefficients (Pm) from the values predicted from solubility diffusion theory (Po) lead to the determination of a correction factor, the permeability decrement f (=Pm/Po), {{to account for the}} effects of chain ordering. The natural logarithm of f has been found to correlate linearly with the inverse of the bilayer free surface area with slopes of 25 ± 2, 36 ± 3, 45 ± 8, 32 ± 12, 33 ± 4, 49 ± 12, and 75 ± 6 Å 2 for formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric <b>acid,</b> valeric <b>acid,</b> <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid,</b> and trimethylacetic acid, respectively. The slope, which measures the sensitivity of the permeability coefficient of a given permeant to bilayer chain packing, exhibits an excellent linear correlation (r= 0. 94) with the minimum cross-sectional area of the permeant and a poor correlation (r= 0. 59) with molecular volume, suggesting that in the bilayer interior the permeants prefer to move with their long principal axis along the bilayer normal. Based on these studies, a permeability model combining the effects of bilayer chain packing and permeant size and shape on permeability across lipid membranes is developed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Epigenetic {{modifications}} {{have been}} linked to age related decline. These modifications are changes in the DNA that does not alter the sequence itself, but still affect gene expression. Epigenetic modifications include histone modification, DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. Bioactive food compounds and different nutrients have been found to affect these mechanisms in various model organisms. By inducing epigenetic modifications when ingested, some of these compounds have shown to extend lifespan. The honey bee’s short lifespan, and that it possesses an epigenetic machinery homologous to that found in humans, can make it a suitable model organism for studying these mechanisms. The main goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of sodium butyrate, and two compounds of the valerian plant extracts (valproic <b>acid</b> and <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid),</b> on the lifespan in the honey bee. By conducting ELISAs and Western blots, I aimed to test if levels of DNA methylation and histone acetylation are affected by these nutrients. Here I show that low doses of <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> extend the lifespan of honey bees. To my best knowledge, this represents the first evidence of <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> exerting life-extending effects in any animal or human. I also show that increasing concentrations of this compound reduce the bees’ food intake. High concentrations of valproic acid showed life shortening effects, and sodium butyrate showed minor effects only. The ELISAs did not reveal any modifications in global DNA methylation, and the differences in histone acetylation could not be tested, as Western blotting was not feasible. This study provides good prospects for future studies on how <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid,</b> valproic acid and sodium butyrate can affect lifespan and aging. In particular the results from testing <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> may inspire future work to test if potential health promoting effects can be found in other organisms as well, and to address the mechanisms through which lifespan extension is achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine chemical composition and insecticidal activities of the essential oil of Valeriana jatamansi Jones roots against booklice, Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel, and to isolate insecticidal constituents from the oil. Essential oil of V. jatamansi was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS. A total of 27 components in the essential oil were identified. The major compounds were patchoulol (24. 3 %), α-bulnesene (13. 8 %), <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> (12. 9 %), α-guaiene (8. 7 %), and 3 -methylvaleric acid (8. 4 %). Based on bioactivity-guided fractionation, <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid,</b> 3 -methylvaleric acid, and patchoulol were isolated and identified as the active constituents. The essential oil exhibited contact toxicity against L. bostrychophila with an LC 50 value of 236. 4 [*]μg/cm 2. Patchoulol (LC 50 = 61. 35 [*]μg/cm 2) exhibited stronger acute toxicity than 3 -methylvaleric acid (LC 50 = 210. 69 [*]μg/cm 2) against the booklice.

40|$|Short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (SCFA) are a {{sub-group}} of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> including formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric <b>acid,</b> butyric <b>acid,</b> <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> and valeric acid. Acetate, propionate and butyrate {{are three}} major shortchain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> which are mainly {{formed in the}} gastrointestinal tract via colonic bacteria fermentation of carbohydrates, especially resistant starches and dietary fibre. There has been increasing interest in {{the idea that the}} short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> play crucial roles in a range of physiological functions. Recently, increasing evidence suggested there is a strong link between short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and energy homeostasis. Several studies highlighted the protective effects of the short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> on high-fat diet induced obesity and other harmful metabolic disorders in mice. However, the coherent understanding of the multi-level network in which short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> exert their effects still needs to be elucidated. Up to date, it has been demonstrated that short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> can mediate energy balance via affecting appetite control in brain, increasing adipogenesis in white adipocyte, and regulating insulin sensitivities in white adipose tissue and muscle, etc. However, the effects of short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> on brown adipocytes have not been fully investigated. In this study, we examined the roles of short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> acetate and its receptor(s) in the regulation of brown adipocyte differentiation and metabolism. Firstly, we identified the expression of short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> sensing GPR 43 in brown adipose tissue and immortalized brown adipocytes by real-time PCR, Western blots and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, GPR 43 expression was found to increase during the adipogenesis of cultured brown adipocytes. Pro-adipogenic reagent PPARγ agonist stimulation led to a further augment of GPR 43 expression while antiadipogenic reagents such as PPARγ antagonist, RXR antagonist and STAT 5 inhibitor played the opposite role on GPR 43 expression. Transcription factors such as XBP 1 and STAT 5 were identified to be involved in GPR 43 expression regulation in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, we also examined the role of acetate in the regulation of brown adipogenesis. Our results showed that acetate treatment during adipogenesis up-regulated AP 2, PGC- 1 α and UCP 1 expression and affected the morphological changes of brown adipocytes. Moreover, an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis was observed after acetate treatment. Acetate also elicited the activation of ERK and CREB, and these responses were sensitive to G(i/o) -type G-protein inactivator, Gβγ-subunit inhibitor, PLC inhibitor and MEK inhibitor, indicating a role for the G(i/o) βγ/PLC/PKC/MEK signalling pathway in these responses. These effects of acetate were mimicked by treatment with 4 -CMTB, a synthetic GPR 43 agonist, and were impaired in GPR 43 knock-down cells, further supported the hypothesis that GPR 43 mediates the pro-adipogenic effects of acetate in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, the effects of acetate treatment on brown adipose tissue were also measured in vivo. Mice fed with acetate demonstrated increased PGC- 1 α in brown adipose tissue, which was in agreement with the results obtained from immortalized brown adipocytes. In addition, we also measured the effects of acetate on lipid metabolism in differentiated brown adipocytes. The results showed effects of acetate treatment on lipolysis were different in white adipocytes and brown adipocytes. Acetate treatment significantly decreased the lipolysis in white adipocytes while had little effects on lipolysis in brown adipocytes. Besides, acetate treatment was also found to decrease TF 2 -C 12 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> uptake in differentiated IM-BAT cells, suggesting acetate may affect many aspects of lipid metabolism in brown adipocytes. Collectively, our results indicated that acetate might have important physiological roles in brown adipocytes. Short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> may serve to regulate brown adipose tissue functions and therefore improve metabolic health...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{assessed}} {{whether a}} wheat bran extract (WBE) containing arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) elicited a prebiotic effect and modulated gastrointestinal parameters in healthy preadolescent children upon consumption in a beverage. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial evaluated {{the effects of}} consuming WBE at 0 (control) or 5. 0  g/day for 3 weeks in 29 healthy children (8 - 12 years). Faecal levels of microbiota, short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> branched chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> ammonia, moisture and faecal pH were assessed {{at the end of}} each treatment and at the end of a one-week run-in period. In addition, the subjects completed questionnaires scoring distress severity of 3 gastrointestinal symptoms. Finally, subjects recorded defecation frequency as well as stool consistency. RESULTS: Nominal faecal bifidobacteria levels tended to increase after 5  g/day WBE consumption (P =  0. 069), whereas bifidobacteria expressed as percentage of total faecal microbiota was significantly higher upon 5  g/day WBE intake (P =  0. 002). Additionally, 5  g/day WBE intake induced a significant decrease in faecal content of isobutyric <b>acid</b> and <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> (P    0. 1). CONCLUSIONS: WBE is well tolerated at doses up 5  g/day in healthy children. In addition, intake of 5  g/day exerts beneficial effects on gut parameters, in particular increase of faecal bifidobacteria levels relative to total faecal microbiota, and reduction of colonic protein fermentation. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{research}} investigating preference {{responses to}} odours is qualitative, based on subjective reports. The research {{to be reported}} investigated an objective and quantitative technique to monitor physiological preference responses. This research indicated the potential for investigating the relationship of conscious awareness of odour presence {{to the production of}} topographical change, and the relationship between subjective ratings (the hedonic response) and the topographical brain response to various odours. In a study using eight subjects, continuous recordings of brain electrical activity were measured using a 64 -channel recording system during the delivery of air or odour. Recording trials were repeated with four odours (acetaldehyde, butyric <b>acid,</b> <b>isovaleric</b> <b>acid</b> and vanillin) at near threshold concentrations. Stimulus delivery was synchronised with inspiration using a continuous respiration olfactometer, and presented at a ratio of 3 air to each odour in a pseudo-random order for a period of 5 min. Subjective responses to the odour stimuli were also assessed during the recording, with subjects indicating if they perceived an odour, following which they completed preference response ratings of the odour. Parallel testing of the same odours was conducted using traditional sensory testing techniques. The neurophysiological responses to odours were then examined and correlated with the preference responses. The evoked responses of all the odours differed in comparison to air and to each other. These responses were analysed using both traditional EEG topographic techniques and neural networks to determine the relationship of the responses to the reported preferences. This analysis demonstrated the utilisation of different techniques to better quantify the neurophysiological effects of odours, reducing the problem of the subjectivity of responses which is found in much of the research into hedonic responses to odours...|$|R
