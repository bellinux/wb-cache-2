During his forty years at Fermilab, Raja's important contributions to the lab's scientific work included playing {{a key role in}} the design of the hermetic <b>DZero</b> <b>detector.</b> He served as head of the top quark analysis group, and the multivariate algorithm he developed was a crucial tool in the discovery of this particle at Fermilab in 1995. During his last years at Fermilab, he served as spokesperson for the Main Injector Particle Production experiment. He also became an advocate of accelerator-driven thorium reactors, which he believed could help solve the world's energy crisis. He contributed more than 300 publications to scientific journals.|$|E
40|$|The <b>DZERO</b> <b>detector</b> is used {{to study}} proton-antiproton {{collisions}} at the 1800 GeV and 630 GeV center-of-mass energies available at the Fermilab Tevatron.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 This thesis {{presents}} the results of an analysis of the 3. 7 fb^- 1 of Tevatron proton-antiproton data collected with the <b>DZero</b> (D 0) <b>Detector</b> at Fermilab during the "RunIIb 34 " period, with the goal of extracting an improved measurement of the W boson mass, which is currently measured to a precision of ≈ 20 MeV. The measurement is performed on events with one W boson which decays to an electron and a neutrino. Using a template technique, the mass is measured from three distributions that are correlated with the W boson mass: the transverse electron momentum, p_T^e, the transverse W mass, m_T, and the neutrino momentum, which appears as missing transverse energy, E_T. A test measurement using this technique is successfully performed on a mock dataset generated with a Monte Carlo simulation. In the data, we find unexpected azimuthally dependent inconsistencies between the early and late parts of the data taking period. Implications for the completion of the data measurement are discussed...|$|R

This note describes the specifications and configuration of the physical Input/Output devices and instrumentation of the 2 Tesla Superconducting Solenoid.

We have analyzed 230 pb^{- 1 } of data collected with the <b>Dzero</b> <b>detector</b> at the Fermilab Tevatron collider at a center-of-mass energy of 1. 96 TeV. No significant excess of events above the standard model expectation is found in any region of the final state invariant mass distribution.

We exclude masses between 200 GeV and 610 GeV for a W' boson with standard-model-like couplings, between 200 GeV and 630 GeV for a W' boson with right-handed couplings that is allowed to decay to both leptons and quarks, and between 200 GeV and 670 GeV for a W' boson with right-handed couplings that is only allowed to decay to quarks.

The differential cross sections, d^ 2 sigma/(dEt deta), are presented {{as a function of}} jet transverse energy (Et) in five pseudorapidity (eta) intervals, up to |eta|= 3, significantly extending previous CDF and DZero measurements beyond |eta|= 0. 7. The extended range of the measurement should provide greater discrimination among different parton distribution functions. We also discuss previous measurements of the inclusive jet cross sections made by the two collider experiments at central pseudorapidities up to |eta|= 0. 7. Finally, we present recent measurements from the CDF and DZero experiments of the ratio of central inclusive cross sections from two center-of-mass energies, 0. 63 TeV and 1. 8 TeV, as a function of jet Xt.

40|$|There {{are nine}} {{separate}} zones of high sensitivity smoke detection (HSSD) at Dzero. These zones, their coverage, their condition thresholds, and {{their response to}} conditions are described in {{the table in the}} 'Zones & Responses' section of this document. This is an 'air-sampling' smoke detection system. Each zone is formed of a network of pipes which contain strategically sized and located air sampling holes. Each zone has a fanbox/detector head that continuously draws air into the holes and through the pipes to the detector head where it is evaluated for combustion products. The fanbox/detector heads are located on the <b>Dzero</b> <b>detector</b> platform and in the trusses. Each fanbox/detector head has a remotely located display control card (DCC) for monitoring the level of obscuration of the air sample. This remote equipment is located {{on the roof of the}} moving counting house. The DCC for each zone is networked to a single intelligent interface module (11 M), also on the roof of the MCH, that collects the information from all nine zones and delivers it to the Dzero control room via an isolated RS- 485 link to an operators console. This console is replicated via a 'remote video, keyboard, mouse system' in the DAB 4 th floor entry lobby for use by fire response personnel. Internal thresholds that have been set in the DCC via the operators console provides alarm level I (lowest), alarm level 2, and alarm level 3 (highest) for each zone. These alarms are then used as inputs to the Fermilab FIRUS system, and as interlocks to equipment. This system is nearly 2000 times more sensitive than conventional smoke detectors. It is sensitive enough to detect invisible products of combustion such as the outgassing of electrical components, overheating PVC wire insulation, or small changes in the ambient level of obscuration caused in the incipient stage of a fire...|$|E
