40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{economic}} factors and social relationships determine dietary behaviours, but the inter-relations between determinants is unknown. Whether {{women and men}} differ in the vulnerability to, and impact of, combined disadvantages is also unclear. We examined associations between diverse combinations of economic resources and social relationships, and healthy eating in British older women and men. Methods Our sample comprised 9, 580 over- 50 s (47  % of over- 50 respondents) in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort study. We examined six {{economic factors}} (education, social class, home-ownership, money for needs, frequency of insufficient money for food/clothing, paying bills) and three social relationships (marital status, living arrangement and friend contact), independently and in combination, in relation to <b>fruit</b> <b>variety</b> and vegetable variety. We analysed gender-specific associations using multivariable linear regression with interaction terms. Results Lower social class, lower education, and difficulty paying bills were associated with lower fruit and vegetable variety in both genders, independent of social relationships. All social relationships were independently associated with <b>fruit</b> <b>variety</b> in men and with vegetable variety in both genders. Substantially lower variety was found for all combinations of low economic resources and lack of social relationship than for either measure alone, with men faring worse {{in the majority of}} combined disadvantages. For example, the difference in vegetable variety for men reporting low social class and non-married was much greater (β - 4. 1, [- 4. 8, - 3. 4]), than the independent association of low social class (β - 1. 5, [- 1. 8,– 1. 2]), or non-married (β - 1. 8, [- 2. 3,– 1. 3]). Variety was also lower among men with high economic resources but non-married or lone-living. Conclusion A double burden of low economic resources and lack of social relationships suggested they are unique joint determinants, particularly in older men, and that public health efforts to improve healthy eating would offer most benefit to older adults with intersecting economic and social disadvantages...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Eugenia brasiliensis Lam. is a {{variable}} species concerning fruit colour, with three recognized varieties. However, {{the definition of}} varieties is not easy for Myrtaceae species and not widely accepted. Two fruit colour varieties (purple and yellow) of E. brasiliensis had their essential oil composition analysed {{in order to give}} support to the existence of varieties for this species. Although, the major components in the leaf oil are the same monoterpenes for both varieties, α-pinene, β-pinene and 1, 8 -cineol, the purple <b>fruit</b> <b>variety</b> accumulates more oxygenated sesquiterpenes (33. 9 %) than the one with yellow fruits (3. 8 %). The major differences occurred in purple fruits that present as major components caryophyllene oxide (22. 2 %) and α-cadinol (10. 4 %), not found in the leaf oil, and the yellow fruit oil presented a similar composition as observed for the leaves. These fruit colour varieties of E. brasilensis can be considered as two distinct chemotypes, since the sesquiterpene pathway is more operant in the purple variety than in the yellow one, in which monoterpenes are mainly accumulated...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} related to the {{problems}} of translating horticultural terms and names. We deal with the translation issues of botanical names in general, then we focus on some old apple varietal names (Pónyik, Batul, Tányéralma, etc.) and the way these names are treated in English/Romanian texts. We also present some aspects related to the historical background of name giving and pomology. Our aim is to identify the main tendencies of such names in scientific writings and other types of texts. Prior to the publication of the Cultivated Code in the 1950 s, the situation of varietal names was rather ambiguous, and sometimes several varietal names were circulating for the very same <b>fruit</b> <b>variety</b> or cultivar. That is why today we still talk about synonymy and translation in the field of variety names {{despite the fact that the}} Code stipulates a preference for non-translation. We also attempt to analyse the etymological implications of the above mentioned apple variety names, as especially Pónyik and Batul are equally claimed by Hungarian and Romanian pomologists...|$|E

The newly founded modern planting in the growing spindle-shaped when in use slow- growing rootstock up to several hundred more trees per hectare of orchards and fertility beginning to enter the third year, which is significantly earlier than in past years. In earlier planting was used, lusher rootstocks, but also used other forms of cultivation. Weakly vigorous rootstocks were represented in my attempt rootstock P-HL-A and Gisela 5. The theoretical part focuses on the general demands of growing cherries, cherry growing importance and its botanical description, pests and diseases cherry rootstock influence on the variety and rootstock description. The experimental part of the work specializes in the characterization of habitat and experimental material, describes methods of assessment and method of the experiment itself, the experiment results and the conclusions drawn. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the effect of different rootstocks on growth and fertility, selected varieties of cherries grown in the shape of the spindle in the third and sixth year after planting. In the course of short-term plantings of cherries grown in the shape of the spindle it showed that rootstock P-HL-A variety 'Burlat' had a 19 % increase compared with lusher 'Karešova' variety was planted on the same rootstock. Although the variety 'Karešova' had a smaller volume of crowns and reached compared to the variety 'Burlat' higher overall revenue (10. 4 %) and higher specific revenues, but the variety 'Burlat' reached about 10 % higher compared to the average weight of the <b>fruit</b> <b>variety</b> 'Karešova'.

Stratified random sampling technique was adopted in selecting 80 respondents comprising 40 dessert banana traders (panelists) and 40 dessert banana consumers. Monthly trade data was collected from the respondents using pretested semi-structured questionnaire during dry season (November-April) and rain season (May-October) for the year 2012. Data collected were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis; with transaction costs estimated as ex ante and ex post components. Hedonic pricing regression model was used in determining buyer socioeconomic/banana attributes that influenced willingness to pay price. Fruit characteristics that significantly enhanced trade of sweet banana in descending order were taste (3. 83), <b>fruit</b> <b>variety</b> (3. 57), and fruit skin colour (3. 50). Other significant factors were level of ripeness (3. 49), availability in off-season (3. 46), fruit size (3. 20) and cleanliness (3. 20). Mean ex-ante transaction costs for sweet banana was N 77, 800. 00 /trader and its mean ex-post transaction cost was N 25, 080. 00 /trader.
