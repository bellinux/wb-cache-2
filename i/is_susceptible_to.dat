5|$|Cowpea <b>is</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> nematode, fungal, {{bacterial}} and virus diseases, {{which can}} result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant <b>is</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|Homarus gammarus <b>is</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> {{the disease}} gaffkaemia, {{caused by the}} {{bacterium}} Aerococcus viridans. Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, the disease has only been seen in captive H.gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H.americanus could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It <b>is</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> {{incidental}} capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the antimicrobial susceptibility of 87 pathogens isolated from 37 patients with odontogenic abscesses. The most prevalent bacteria were viridans group streptococci and Prevotella species.

40|$|The susceptibilities of 374 {{selected}} beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative anaerobes (including 22 cefoxitin-resistant strains and 36 strains refractory to the enhancing {{effect of}} beta-lactamase inhibitors) and 20 beta-lactamase-negative strains were tested by agar dilution against selected new agents. The organisms included 217 Bacteroides fragilis group strains, 137 non-B. fragilis group Bacteroides spp., and 40 fusobacteria. All strains <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem. For the B. fragilis group, 96 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ampicillin-sulbactam, 95 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefoperazone-sulbactam, 94 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> tosufloxacin, 91 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefoxitin, 88 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> trospectomycin, and 73 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefotetan. For the beta-lactamase-positive non-B. fragilis group Bacteroides spp., {{greater than or}} equal <b>to</b> 94 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefoxitin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, and trospectomycin, 90 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefotetan, and 85 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> tosufloxacin (the most resistant strains were B. bivius and B. disiens). For the beta-lactamase-positive fusobacteria, {{greater than or equal}} <b>to</b> 97 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, trospectomycin, and cefoxitin, 90 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefotetan, and 89 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> tosufloxacin. All agents showed excellent activity against beta-lactamase-negative strains (for trospectomycin, 95 % were susceptible; for all other drugs, 100 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible).</b> Overall, both carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam were most active. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and cefoperazone-sulbactam lacked activity against some cefoxitin-resistant B. fragilis group strains but had excellent activity against other organisms. Tosufloxacin, a new quinolone, had very good activity against B. fragilis group strains (94 % susceptible), good activity against other beta-lactamase-positive strains (less than or equal 85 % susceptible), and excellent activity against beta-lactamase-negative strains (100 % susceptible; MIC for 90 % of strains, 0. 5 microgram/ml). Trospectomycin was active against > 90 % of all strains except for B. fragilis group strains (88 % susceptible; MIC for 90 % of strains, 32 microgram/ml). Clinical studies are required to delineate the role of newer agents in the therapy of anaerobic infections...|$|R

40|$|The susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 476 strains) and untypeable Haemophilus influenzae (1, 676 strains) {{to various}} oral β-lactam, macrolide-azalide, and {{fluoroquinolone}} antimicrobial agents {{were determined by}} broth microdilution. Organisms were isolated from specimens obtained from outpatients in six geographic regions of the United States. MIC data were interpreted according to pharmacodynamically derived breakpoints applicable to the oral agents tested. Among H. influenzae strains, 41. 6 % were β-lactamase positive. Virtually all H. influenzae strains <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin-clavulanate (98 %), cefixime (100 %), and ciprofloxacin (100 %), while 78 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefuroxime, 57 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin, 14 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefprozil, 9 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> loracarbef, 2 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefaclor, and 0 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> azithromycin and clarithromycin. Among S. pneumoniae isolates, 49. 6 % <b>were</b> penicillin <b>susceptible,</b> 17. 9 % were intermediate, and 32. 5 % were penicillin resistant, with penicillin MICs for 50 and 90 % of the isolates tested of 0. 12 and 4 μg/ml, respectively. Overall, 94 % of S. pneumoniae isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, 69 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> azithromycin and clarithromycin, 63 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefprozil and cefuroxime, 52 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefixime, 22 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefaclor, and 11 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> loracarbef. Although ciprofloxacin has marginal activity against S. pneumoniae, no high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were found. Significant cross-resistance was found between penicillin and macrolides-azalides among S. pneumoniae isolates, with 5 % of the penicillin-susceptible strains being macrolide-azalide resistant, compared with 37 % of the intermediate isolates and 66 % of the resistant isolates. Resistance was highest in S. pneumoniae isolates from patients younger than 10 years of age, middle ear and paranasal sinus specimens, and the southern half of the United States. With the continuing rise in resistance, judicious use of oral antimicrobial agents is necessary in all age groups...|$|R
40|$|Tests with 2, 713 {{bacterial}} isolates (members of {{the family}} Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive cocci) from 14 laboratories compared cefoxitin MICs with cefotetan MICs.

40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} {{the activity of}} ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam against 120 bacterial strains, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated from patients admitted to Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Methods: In vitro susceptibility was tested using the Etest strip minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, and PCR was used to characterize the carbapenemase enzymes produced by CRE strains. Results: All 29 ESBL isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam (MIC 50 0. 125  μg/ml), whereas all but one <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftolozane–tazobactam (MIC 50 0. 38  μg/ml). Twenty-seven (45 %) CRE isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam (MIC 50 ≥ 256  μg/ml), whereas only six (10 %) isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftolozane–tazobactam (MIC 50 ≥ 256  μg/ml). Very few NDM- 1 isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam, whereas the majority of OXA- 48 isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible.</b> Twenty-nine (94 %) P. aeruginosa isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam (MIC 50 1. 5  μg/ml), whereas 30 (97 %) isolates <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ceftolozane–tazobactam (MIC 50 0. 75  μg/ml). Conclusions: Ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam showed comparable activity against ESBL and P. aeruginosa, with ceftazidime–avibactam having lower MICs against ESBL isolates and ceftolozane–tazobactam having lower MICs against P. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime–avibactam showed better activity against all CRE isolates except for those carrying the NDM- 1 enzyme...|$|R

40|$|One-hundred {{clinical}} isolates of Serratia marcescens {{were tested}} for susceptibility to cephalothin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, and cefoxitin. The {{majority of the}} 100 isolates (≥ 70 %) <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefoxitin; less than one-half <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ampicillin; none <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cephalothin. Ten isolates from the 100 organisms tested were selectively assayed for their β-lactamase activity. Enzyme activity was measured using either iodometric or spectrophotometric methods, and the microbiological assay technique. It was concluded that β-lactamase production was not the sole determinant in β-lactam antibiotic resistance. Resistance without demonstrable β-lactamase was evident in strains for cephalothin, ampicillin, and cefoxitin.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of 100 or more {{strains of}} Bacteroides fragilis to six antibiotics {{was determined by}} standardized agar dilution and disc diffusion tests. Good correlation of results of the two methods was obtained with chloramphenicol, clindamycin, lincomycin, penicillin, and vancomycin. Correlation of results with erythromycin was not as good. A great deal of overlapping of zone diameters among strains classed as susceptible, intermediate, and resistant occurred with both erythromycin and lincomycin, making interpretation of disc diffusion tests difficult. All strains tested <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> chloramphenicol; 94 % <b>were</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> clindamycin at concentrations readily achieved with ordinary dosage, and all strains were inhibited by 6. 2 μg/ml, a level which is achieved with somewhat more intensive therapy.

5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear <b>is</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been limited to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which <b>is</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> damage from summer grazing. The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E
5|$|Shy and {{difficult}} to approach, the nervous shark is harmless to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species <b>is</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in prawn trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by fishing activities, and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern. No data on the impact of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E

5|$|The finetooth shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, when caught, this shark thrashes and snaps at {{anything}} within range, and people have been bitten attempting to handle it. Finetooth sharks are used for human consumption fresh or dried and salted. Other than off the southeastern United States, this species is of little commercial importance: it is small and occurs in water too shallow for most commercial and recreational fisheries, and is generally too fast-swimming to be caught by shrimp trawlers. Small numbers are taken incidentally by floating longlines and on hook-and-line. This species <b>is</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> overfishing due to its low reproductive rate, and to habitat degradation due to its inshore habits.|$|E
5|$|The finless sleeper ray <b>is</b> <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> {{bottom trawls}} and perhaps other {{demersal}} fishing gear. It {{is a potential}} bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
