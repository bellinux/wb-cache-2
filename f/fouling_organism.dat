At the Abu Qir harbour, it was found that water temperature and salinity are the most important environmental factors controlling the temporal distribution of total fouling density, whereas water temperature and chlorophyll a are the most significant environmental factors controlling the total biomass.

It was first detected in Hawaii in 1972 when it appeared in Pearl Harbor. Since then it has spread to the other islands in the archipelago. It has also been detected on other Pacific islands, and on the coasts of Australia and Asia. It is a shade-loving species and grows on hard surfaces away from direct sunlight.

Zoobotryon verticillatum is a <b>fouling</b> <b>organism</b> and its typical habitat is growing on the blades of seagrasses, the thallus of large seaweeds, the roots of mangroves, rocky reefs, the shells of bivalve molluscs, piers, breakwaters and other man-made structures, the hulls of boats, floating masses of seaweed and other floating debris.|$|E
50|$|A {{study was}} made in Hawaii into the species {{involved}} in fouling man made structures immersed in the sea at depths of fifty and one hundred feet. The dominant species involved {{were found to be}} the little striped barnacle, Balanus amphitrite, the crested oyster, Ostrea equestris and Hydroides norvegica and a stable community was produced after two to four months at fifty feet and slightly longer at one hundred feet. In four months, H. norvegica reached a length of three centimetres, and with the other fouling organisms covered the panels that were used. A late arriving <b>fouling</b> <b>organism</b> was the brown alga, Padina Japonica.

50|$|W. subtorquata has {{a global}} {{distribution}} in warm seas. It {{is not clear}} where it originated and whether it is just one species or several. It had become established in southern Australia by 1972 and New Zealand ten years later.

It is a <b>fouling</b> <b>organism</b> and is invasive on the Pacific coast of North America, where it can frequently be found in harbours and estuaries on the coasts of California and Oregon. W. subtorquata can grow on rocks, shells, buoys, pilings, docks, kelp and the hulls of vessels.

50|$|Perophora japonica is {{native to}} Japan, Korea and Peter the Great Gulf in Russia. but has spread {{to other parts of}} the world.

It appeared in waters off the Netherlands and France at much the same date and here it was growing on Sargassum muticum, species of Fucus and Laminaria, sponges, solitary tunicates, shellfish and directly on the underside of pontoons.

40|$|Following the ban in 2003 {{on the use}} of tributyl-tin {{compounds}} in antifouling coatings, the search for an environmentally-friendly alternative has accelerated. Biocidal TBT alternatives, such as diuron and Irgarol 1051 ®, have proved to be environmentally damaging to marine organisms. The issue regarding the use of biocides is that concerning the half-life of the compounds which allow a perpetuation of the toxic effects into the marine food chain, and initiate changes {{in the early stages of}} the organisms' life-cycle. In addition, the break-down of biocides can result in metabolites with greater toxicity and longevity than the parent compound. Functionalized coatings have been designed to repel the settlement and permanent attachment of <b>fouling</b> <b>organisms</b> via modification of either or both surface topography and surface chemistry, or by interfering with the natural mechanisms via which <b>fouling</b> <b>organisms</b> settle upon and adhere to surfaces. A large number of technologies are being developed towards producing new coatings that will be able to resist biofouling over a period of years and thus truly replace biocides as antifouling systems. In addition urgent research is directed towards the exploitation of mechanisms used by living organisms designed to repel the settlement of <b>fouling</b> <b>organisms.</b> These biomimetic strategies include the production of antifouling enzymes and novel surface topography that are incompatible with permanent attachment, for example, by mimicking the microstructure of shark skin. Other research seeks to exploit chemical signals and antimicrobial agents produced by diverse living organisms in the environment to prevent settlement and growth of <b>fouling</b> <b>organisms</b> on vulnerable surfaces. Novel polymer-based technologies may prevent fouling by means of unfavourable surface chemical and physical properties or by concentrating antifouling compounds around surfaces...|$|R

Methods We sampled the fouling communities of two ships in dry dock: the S/R Baytown (in San Francisco Bay), which had not been cleaned in dry dock for approximately 2 years; and the S/R Benicia (in Portland), which had been cleaned in dry dock within about 6 months. The S/R Baytown had remained within San Francisco Bay for several months without making an ocean voyage prior to haul out, providing time for further accumulation of <b>fouling</b> <b>organisms.</b> Representative patches of fouling communities were scraped from the bottoms of the ships within 6 hours of haul out and before any cleaning had commenced.

50|$|Maeotias marginata is {{native to}} the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. It has spread {{to other parts of}} the world and was first {{detected}} in North America in 1968 in the estuaries of rivers entering Chesapeake Bay.

The polyp stage possibly arrived as a <b>fouling</b> <b>organism</b> on the hull of a ship but it is unlikely that a brackish water species would have survived such a long voyage through saline ocean water.

In 1999, it was observed in the northern Baltic Sea, and specimens have also been found in the Netherlands (1962), France (1971) and the Pacific coast of North America, where it was found in the estuaries of the Petaluma and Napa Rivers flowing into San Francisco Bay in 1992 and 1993, and has since become established.|$|E

40|$|Biofouling is a {{significant}} operational cost for pearl aquaculture. Understanding the factors that affect the settlement and development of <b>fouling</b> <b>organisms</b> contributes to improved management practices to control biofouling. Field experiments were carried out to document the accumulation of <b>fouling</b> <b>organisms,</b> measured as percentage cover, with respect to age (2 -year-old and 3 -year-old, independent of shell size) and shell size (45 - 55 mm and 65 - 75 mm dorso-ventral measurement, DVM, independent of age) of the Akoya pearl oyster Pinctada fucata. After 16 weeks, 3 -year-old P. fucata were significantly more fouled than 2 -year-old oysters. In contrast, {{there was no significant}} difference in fouling cover between 3 -year-old P. fucata with DVM of 45 - 55 mm and 65 - 75 mm. Fouling communities were dominated by the hydroid Obelia sp., the bryozoan Parasmittina sp. 1, the bivalve Saccostrea sp. 1 and the ascidian Didemnum sp. To determine a potential relationship between the accumulation of <b>fouling</b> <b>organisms</b> and periostracum cover, differences in periostracum cover with age (2 -year-old and 3 -year-old) and shell size (45 - 55 mm and 65 - 75 mm DVM) of P. fucata were examined. Periostracum, measured as both area covered and area without periostracum, decreased significantly with age, but not with shell size. The high percentage cover of fouling on all oysters and the large area where periostracum was undefined makes any conclusion as to the role of the periostracum in preventing fouling unclear. These findings, however, support age as a key factor for the development of husbandry protocols, with older P. fucata shells being cleaned more frequently than younger shells to counteract the increased settlement of <b>fouling</b> <b>organisms.</b> © 2005 Elsevier B.
