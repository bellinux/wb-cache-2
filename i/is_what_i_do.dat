In an interview, Willis said, [...] "I have a warm spot in my heart for Die Hard..... it's just the sheer novelty {{of being able to}} play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun.

2500|$|Riegel found {{humor in}} the {{situation}} and said, [...] "Unfortunately, we only got the script like three days ahead of time! But hey! We're old pros."
