5|$|The Iron Trade of the United Kingdom Compared {{with that}} of the Other Chief <b>Ironmaking</b> Nations, Literary and Philosophical Society, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1875.|$|E
5|$|The {{firm was}} founded at Newcastle-upon-Tyne with an {{ironworks}} and an alkali works nearby at Walker. The alkali works {{was the first}} in England to make Soda using the Leblanc process; the ironworks was the first to use Cleveland Ironstone, presaging the 1850s boom in <b>ironmaking</b> on Teesside.|$|E
5|$|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co., Ltd was an English <b>ironmaking</b> {{and mining}} company founded in 1864, {{based on the}} {{partnership}} since 1840 of its two founders, Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan. The firm drove the dramatic growth of Middlesbrough {{and the production of}} coal and iron in the north-east of England in the 19th century. The two founding partners had an exceptionally close working relationship which lasted until Vaughan's death.|$|E
5|$|Wes Gephart, {{though his}} {{personal}} brilliance {{and ability to}} attract investment, was able to cover the decline to some extent. By his death in 1905, he had assembled a seemingly puissant empire of two iron furnaces, extensive ore mines, and two railroads. But even during his lifetime, Bellefonte had seen {{the end of its}} glory: after 1890, its population, heretofore steadily growing, would decline for the next thirty years. Nor did Gephart's empire long survive him; little more than a decade after his death, the furnaces were demolished, the mines shut down, and one railroad scrapped. Only the Central Railroad remained, staggering to a pauper's grave in 1918, sold for the wartime price its scrap could bring. The era of Nittany Furnace was the twilight of <b>ironmaking</b> in Bellefonte. Though not fully apparent at the time, neither the rising lime industry nor any other would replace <b>ironmaking</b> as the guarantor of the town's prosperity. The fall of the furnaces marked the beginning of a long decline which would see Bellefonte supplanted by State College as the nexus of activity in Centre County.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its <b>ironmaking</b> component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed <b>ironmaking</b> and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|Once again, Gephart {{appeared}} on the scene to save the furnace. With the backing of Philadelphia and New York investors, he formed the Nittany Iron Company, which bought and rehabilitated the furnace, returning it to blast on June 5, 1902, under Frank H. Clemson (former chief of mining at Gephart's Bellefonte Furnace Company). Other organizers included Lorenzo Terbal Munson, Gephart's brother-in-law (who was associated with Bellefonte Glass and the Bellefonte Iron and Nail Works), Archer Brown, and William Sampson. However, prosperity did not return to the <b>ironmaking</b> business. The furnace was idle for two months in 1904. As steel production in open hearth furnaces became increasingly commonplace (a method better suited for iron made from Lake Superior ore, while Bessemer converters functioned best with Centre County ore), Nittany Furnace found it increasingly difficult to operate at a profit. The death of Gephart on February 14, 1905 also dealt a blow to the company, which thereafter shared management with the Bellefonte Furnace Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminaries}} to the furnace's construction {{began in}} 1885, when Valentine and Thomas, an old <b>ironmaking</b> firm of Bellefonte, {{decided to sell}} off its properties. These then consisted of Bellefonte Forge, on Logan Branch just south of Bellefonte, and Bellefonte Furnace, a cold blast charcoal iron furnace lying about a mile south of the town, also on Logan Branch, as well as holdings in local iron ore mines. Both plants were served by the Bellefonte, Nittany and Lemont Railroad, {{a subsidiary of the}} PRR. The ironworks and ore lands were bought on August 2, 1886, for $400,000, by the Valentine Ore Land Association, whose principals organized the Centre Iron Company to erect a new iron furnace on the site of Bellefonte Furnace, which was to be torn down. A $600,000 mortgage was immediately raised on the properties, to supply the purchase money and funds for rebuilding the furnace. The leaders of the company included Edmund Blanchard, W. M. Stewart, and B. K. Jamison, a Philadelphia banker. The plant was built in 1887, and the Nittany Valley Railroad was built to supply it with ore. It became necessary to raise additional funds, and in 1887, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased $75,000 worth of bonds in exchange for exclusive rights to rail traffic to and from the furnace. The first load of ore was delivered by the Nittany Valley on February 28, 1888, and the furnace went into blast on March 4, 1888. The company was originally headed by Jamison, but by 1890, James B. Coryell was president and Jamison vice-president. At this time, the furnace had one 70-foot (21-meter) stack and three hot-blast stoves, with a capacity of 30,000tons (27,200tonnes) of iron per year. Ore was supplied from local hematite deposits, and the furnace was fuelled by Connellsville coke. In the same year, however, the failure of Jamison's bank precipitated the closure of the furnace by the sheriff on November 15, 1890. It was subsequently sold under foreclosure.|$|E
25|$|Crawley {{developed}} {{slowly as}} a Wealden market town and <b>ironmaking</b> centre, focused on its northâ€“south High Street, from the 13th century onwards. This street formed {{part of the}} main road from the capital city, London, to the increasingly fashionable seaside resort of Brighton. After the road was turnpiked in stages between the late 17th century and the mid-18th century, Crawley's position almost exactly halfway between the two allowed it to develop a prominent new role as a convenient stop for stagecoach passengers and drivers. By the late 18th century, it had become Sussex's main staging-post for journeys to and from London, as the neighbouring towns of Horsham and East Grinstead fell out of favour.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Iron Works brought <b>ironmaking</b> to Zug Island in 1901 {{with the}} {{commissioning}} of a blast furnace built in 1902. In 1904 the works {{was purchased by}} the M.A. Hanna Company of Cleveland, Ohio which built a second blast furnace in 1909. At this time the island's two furnaces were reportedly the largest of their kind in the world, producing pig iron for foundry companies. The plant expanded and {{became part of the}} Great Lakes Steel Corporation in late 1931, becoming a key component of a fully integrated steel mill and a division of the larger National Steel Corporation. A third blast furnace was added in early 1938 while the existing furnaces were rebuilt and enlarged.|$|E
25|$|The Thomas Iron Company {{was a major}} {{iron-making}} firm in the Lehigh Valley {{from its}} organization in 1854 until its decline and eventual dismantling in the early 20th century. The firm was {{named in honor of}} its founder, David Thomas, who had emigrated to the United States in 1839 to introduce hot blast iron making in the Lehigh Valley, and now embarked on an independent <b>ironmaking</b> venture. The company's main and original plant was in Hokendauqua, Pennsylvania, which grew up around it; it also came to own blast furnaces and railroads elsewhere in the Lehigh Valley and mines in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Changes in the iron industry in the early Twentieth Century left Thomas Iron struggling to compete, and after a failed attempt at modernization and revival from 1913 to 1916, the company's assets were sold and largely dismantled during the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{shutdown}} of Bellefonte Furnace, President Frazer {{had been trying}} to reach a rate agreement with John Reilly of the furnace company. They came to terms in July 1892, and Reilly began making arrangements to restart ore mining and put the furnace back in blast. It resumed <b>ironmaking</b> in March 1893, and the Bellefonte Central acquired additional ore cars to serve the traffic. At the end of April, Tom Shoemaker resigned as superintendent to tend to his expanding duties supervising Bellefonte Furnace and ore mining at Graysdale. He was replaced by Francis H. Thomas, a long-time Reading employee. Unfortunately, the new furnace traffic would prove ephemeral. The Panic of 1893 forced Bellefonte Furnace to shut down again in July, after only four months of operation. While the railroad was still shipping ore to the McCoy and Linn Iron Works, Shoemaker could find few other customers for Graysdale ore and its importance to the railroad again declined.|$|E

500|$|The Valentine Iron Company was {{organized}} by the bondholders of the Centre Iron Company {{to take over the}} furnace, and was incorporated on January 28, 1891. The president was J.

A report just prior to the charter records the permanent board of directors as James H. Campbell, of Wayne, Oliver Hazard Reighard, of Williamsport, Charles W. Wilhelm, of Reading, Daniel Rhoades, Valentine, and Gephart. (Reighard was connected with another Valentine Iron Company, later the Williamsport Iron and Nail Works.) ...|$|E
500|$|These discoveries {{confirmed}} for {{the first}} time the existence of Iron Age, pre-Roman <b>ironmaking</b> and industrial development in the area of northern Sussex now occupied by Crawley. [...] Despite this, investigation and analysis were initially discouraged. [...] The Commission for the New Towns, responsible for the town's development at that stage, did not want building work to be delayed, and tried to prevent archaeologists, other professionals, enthusiasts and the general public alike visiting the Hogs Hill Farm site and searching for remains. [...] Workers on the site were expressly forbidden from doing so, although the first discovery had in fact been made by one. [...] By the time the second site was developed in 1970, attitudes had changed, and professional groups were involved from the beginning.|$|E
500|$|In {{the century}} before the Romans arrived in Britain, the area now covered by West Sussex was {{ruled by the}} Atrebates, a Belgic tribe led by Commius. [...] They {{were found to have}} been present in the area now covered by Southgate when {{building}} work took place in 1969. [...] The Southgate West development was underway on land covered by Hogs Hill Farm, which occupied a ridge of land between the Horsham and Brighton Roads. [...] Land clearance revealed two ditches filled with debris such as bones and pieces of pottery. [...] The next year, a large house on Horsham Road was demolished {{to make way for a}} new road of houses; the builders discovered similar pits, and the remains were identified as pre-Roman using carbon dating techniques. [...] The remains of crucibles, slag and other ironworking materials were also discovered; these were confirmed as being from the same era, the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. [...] It was later confirmed that the Hogs Hill Farm remains dated from the Roman era, meaning that the <b>ironmaking</b> and pottery-producing activities of the Atrebates were continued by their conquerors. [...] By the time the excavations and investigation finished, evidence of three iron bloomeries, a small flint mine, roof tiles (possibly from a building on the site) and many pieces of pottery had been found and catalogued.|$|E
2500|$|Described as [...] "natural capitalists" [...] by the BBC, dynasties of Quakers were {{successful}} in business matters. This included <b>ironmaking</b> by Abraham Darby I (which {{played an important role}} in the Industrial Revolution that commenced in Britain), and his family; banking, including Lloyds Banking Group (founded by Sampson Lloyd), Barclays PLC, Backhouse's Bank and Gurney's Bank; life assurance (Friends Provident); pharmaceuticals (Allen & Hanburys); chocolate (Cadbury, Terry's, Fry's); confectionery (Rowntree); biscuit manufacturing (Huntley & Palmers); match manufacture (Bryant & May, Francis May and William Bryant) and shoe manufacturing (Clarks).|$|E
2500|$|The Lehigh Crane Iron Company (later {{simply the}} Crane Iron Company) {{was a major}} <b>ironmaking</b> firm in the Lehigh Valley from its {{founding}} in 1839 until its sale in 1899. [...] It was founded under the patronage of Josiah White and Erskine Hazard, and financed by their [...] Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, which hoped to promote the then-novel technique of smelting iron ore with anthracite coal. [...] This was an important cost and energy savings technique, since either an expensive charcoaling nor coke (as needed for Bituminous coals from anywhere) producing process and transport costs was totally eliminated so produced a great acceleration in the underpinnings of the American industrial revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Gephart, undaunted by the Valentine Iron fiasco, {{returned}} to the <b>ironmaking</b> scene in May 1899. Backed by [...] "eastern capitalists", the Bellefonte Furnace Company was organized to put the Bellefonte Furnace at Coleville back into operation, supplied by iron mines at Mattern, Red Bank, and the former Carnegie ore pits at Scotia. The furnace lay a short distance {{to the west of}} Bellefonte, and was served by the Bellefonte Central Railroad. However, Gephart soon built an extension of the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania, which crossed Spring Creek on a trestle to reach the furnace and an interchange with the BFC, and began supplying the furnace with limestone from a quarry at Salona.|$|E
2500|$|By late winter, LC {{was seeking}} {{suitable}} real estate, with water power {{and access to}} iron ores. [...] Suitable acres were available a few miles below the Lehigh Gap in Northampton County. [...] The company put its first furnace into blast in 1840, and quickly gained a reputation for efficiency and <b>ironmaking</b> prowess among the many furnaces that now sprang up in the Lehigh Valley. Over the next several decades, Crane Iron developed an extensive portfolio of assets, buying mines in the Lehigh Valley and in northern New Jersey, and taking over many of the smaller iron furnaces in the region. Crane Iron also financed the building of railroads {{in the area to}} haul limestone and iron ore to its furnaces.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} of {{charcoal}} iron production in England, most woods in <b>ironmaking</b> regions were managed as coppices, usually being cut on a cycle of about 16 years. In this way, fuel could be provided for that industry, in principle indefinitely, {{as long as the}} nutrient mineral content of the soil was appropriately maintained. This was regulated by a statute of 1544 [...] of Henry VIII, which required woods to be enclosed after cutting (to prevent browsing by animals) and 12 standels (standards or mature uncut trees) to be left in each acre, to be grown into timber. Coppice with standards (scattered individual stems allowed to grow on through several coppice cycles) has been commonly used throughout most of Europe as a means of giving greater flexibility in the resulting forest product from any one area. The woodland provides not only the small material from the coppice but also a range of larger timber for jobs like house building, bridge repair, cart-making and so on.|$|E
2500|$|The parish {{has many}} medieval houses and farms. [...] The oldest is Tickeridge, near Selsfield Common and the {{preserved}} Kingscote railway station. [...] Its modernised exterior hides a 14th-century timber-framed Wealden hall house of [...] "high antiquarian interest". [...] The gabled solar wing {{dates from the}} 16th century. [...] Gravetye Manor, built in 1598, has an Elizabethan faÃ§ade and was built for a local ironmaster: northern Sussex was an important <b>ironmaking</b> area for several centuries. [...] Later abandoned to smugglers, the building and its grounds were rejuvenated in 1884 when [...] "the greatest English gardener" [...] William Robinson bought it. [...] He also designed the [...] gardens. [...] Upon his death in 1935 the manor, set in a large area of woodland, passed to the Forestry Commission {{for use as a}} base for their work. [...] It was converted into a high-class restaurant (now with a Michelin star) in 1958. [...] Chiddinglye, which may have been a separate manor at one time, is a Gothic house of 1866.
