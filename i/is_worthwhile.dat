25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some salts are so useful that isotope {{separation}} of the halide <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile.</b> Chlorides permit fast breeder reactors to be constructed using molten salts. Much less {{research has been done}} on reactor designs using chloride salts. Chlorine, unlike fluorine, must be purified to isolate the heavier stable isotope, chlorine-37, thus reducing production of sulfur tetrafluoride that occurs when chlorine-35 absorbs a neutron to become chlorine-36, then degrades by beta decay to sulfur-36.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{photoelectric}} effect {{is associated with}} Albert Einstein, who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics in 1905, an accomplishment for which Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize. It <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to note that Heinrich Hertz, working 18 years earlier, had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons {{is proportional to the}} frequency but independent of the optical intensity. This fact implied a discrete nature of light, i.e. the existence of quanta, for the first time.|$|E

Genetic screening is now available within a useful time frame for some of the specific conditions.It <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to identify the minority of severe cases with focal forms of hyperinsulinism because these can be completely cured by partial pancreatectomy. A variety of pre-operative diagnostic procedures have been investigated but none has been established as infallibly reliable.

25|$|IT security: Sometimes {{referred}} to as computer security, information technology security (IT security) is information security applied to technology (most often some form of computer system). It <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to note that a computer {{does not necessarily mean}} a home desktop. A computer is any device with a processor and some memory. Such devices can range from non-networked standalone devices as simple as calculators, to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the technology within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to breach into critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.|$|E
25|$|Decay {{times of}} the excitation, {{typically}} measured in seconds, depend {{on the effectiveness of}} relaxation, which is faster for lighter nuclei and in solids, and slower for heavier nuclei and in solutions, and they can be very long in gases. If the second excitation pulse is sent prematurely before the relaxation is complete, the average magnetization vector has not decayed to ground state, which affects the strenght of the signal in an unpredictable manner. In practice, the peak areas are then not proportional to the stoichiometry; only the presence, but not the amount of functional groups is possible to discern. An inversion recovery experiment can be done to determine the relaxation time and thus the required delay between pulses. A 180° pulse, an adjustable delay, and a 90° pulse is transmitted. When the 90° pulse exactly cancels out the signal, the delay corresponds to the time needed for 90° of relaxation. Inversion recovery <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> for quantitive 13C, 2D and other time-consuming experiments.|$|E
25|$|Dorothy Robinson {{reviewed}} {{data from}} jurisdictions where helmet use increased following legislation, {{and concluded that}} helmet laws did not demonstrably reduce cyclists' head injuries. Mayer Hillman, a transport and road safety analyst from the UK, {{does not support the}} use of helmets, reasoning that they are of very limited value {{in the event of a}} collision with a car, that risk compensation negates their protective effect and because he feels their promotion implicitly shifts responsibility of care to the cyclist. He also cautions against placing the recommendations of surgeons above other expert opinion in the debate, comparing it to drawing conclusions on whether it <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to buy lottery tickets by sampling only a group of prizewinners. The prominent UK-based cycling activist John Franklin is skeptical of the merits of helmets, regarding proactive measures including bike maintenance and riding skills as being more important. Cyclists' representative groups complain that focus on helmets diverts attention from other issues which are much more important for improving bicycle safety, such as road danger reduction, training, roadcraft, and bicycle maintenance.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead thus sees God and {{the world}} as {{fulfilling}} one another. [...] He sees entities {{in the world as}} fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time. [...] On the other hand, he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change: alone, God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities, and requires the world to actualize them. [...] God gives creatures permanence, while the creatures give God actuality and change. [...] Here it <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to quote Whitehead at length: ...|$|E
500|$|One {{can define}} other number systems using {{different}} rules or new objects; in some such number systems, the above proofs {{would need to}} be reinterpreted and one might find that, in a given number system, 0.999... and 1 might not be identical. However, many number systems are extensions of —rather than independent alternatives to— the real number system, so 0.999... = 1 continues to hold. Even in such number systems, though, it <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile</b> to examine alternative number systems, not only for how 0.999... behaves (if, indeed, a number expressed as [...] "0.999..." [...] is both meaningful and unambiguous), but also for the behavior of related phenomena. If such phenomena differ from those in the real number system, then {{at least one of the}} assumptions built into the system must break down.|$|E
500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile.</b> The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E

500|$|To the Griffins' (mainly Lois') surprise, {{many people}} turn {{up for the}} first worship service, much to the {{annoyance}} of Brian, who dislikes the idea that Peter is a religious leader (likely due to Brian being an atheist). In order to stop Peter from continuing his new religion, Brian joins forces with Francis {{to find a way to}} deter people from worshiping the Fonz. Three representatives from other religions show up to the services of the Church of the Fonz. The first informs people that he has formed the Church of George Jefferson (from All in the Family) and a good portion of the congregation leaves with him. The second claims to have created the Church of Captain Stubing (from The Love Boat) and another chunk of the congregation leaves with him. The third person is Kirk Cameron and Peter assumes that Cameron is there to announce the formation of the Church of Mike Seaver (Cameron's character on Growing Pains), but Cameron lets him know that he's only here to convert people back to Christianity and the remainder of the congregation leaves with him. Back at home, Lois comforts Peter, who is upset at the failure of his Church, by telling him that if his church embraced the Fonz's values of friendship, it <b>is</b> <b>worthwhile,</b> but Peter highly doubts it and Peter converts back to Christianity, however the scene shifts and Francis is shown looking at a picture of the Fonz, puts it down on a table, gets on his knees as if to pray, and claps to the beat of [...] "Rock Around the Clock" [...] as the episode ends.|$|E
