Two different families of devices, from two leading manufacturers, have been submitted to thermal stress: during treatment, the optical and electrical characteristics of the devices have been analyzed. Degradation modes detected after stress have been (i) operating voltage increase, (ii) output power decrease, (iii) modifications of the spectral properties. The degradation of the electrical and optical characteristics of the devices were found to have different kinetics: this fact indicates that optical power (OP) loss is not strongly related to the degradation of the electrical parameters of the LEDs. On the other hand, spectral analysis indicated that OP loss is strongly related to the decrease of the phosphors-related yellow emission band. Microscopic analysis showed that this effect can be ascribed to the carbonization of the package and phosphorous material.
