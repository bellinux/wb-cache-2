5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided following a mix-up on the first ball, and Cyril Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. The Australians themselves started with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and had to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass. At the other end, Washbrook also played watchfully and avoided any horizontal bat shots, apart from a missed cut against Johnston's bowling. Overall however, the English openers appeared comfortable in the first <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> play.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the night}} to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. The RNC worked to raise the $75,000 needed to buy the <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say.|$|E

25|$|Needing 364 to make England bat again, several Australian batsmen again made starts {{before getting}} out. Watson made a brisk 38 before a mix-up left both him and Hughes {{at the same}} end for an easy run-out, the third run-out of the series that he was {{involved}} in. Clarke scored 41 in his second innings as captain and Haddin made 30, but Tremlett then tempted Haddin into playing a bouncer behind to Prior before clean-bowling Johnson with his next delivery, prompting an extra <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> play on Day 4. In an eighth-wicket partnership worth 80 runs, Smith made an unbeaten half-century and Siddle made 43; however, after Siddle was removed, Hilfenhaus soon departed for just 7 before Tremlett took the final wicket: Beer bowled, playing on, for 2. Australia's total was 281 and England won by an innings and 83 runs. This was the third time they had won by an innings in the series – the first time a touring side had ever won three Tests by an innings during a single series.|$|E
25|$|The 1891 {{championship}} saw {{the novelty}} of Kerry contesting the All-Ireland final with Wexford. The game itself was the second game of a triple-header played at Clonturk Park on 28 February 1892. The first game that day was the All-Ireland football semi-final between Dublin and Cavan. This {{was followed by the}} All-Ireland furling final and the programme of games finished with the All-Ireland football final between Cork and the winners of the first game. The hurling decider was an exciting affair with the Kerry team playing in their bare feet in grey jumpers with a gold band. Paddy 'Carr' Carroll scored Kerry’s first point after five minutes with the team’s second score coming after another twenty minutes. At half-time Kerry led by 0-2 to 0-1. The game, however, was not without controversy. At full-time the referee said that the score was 1-1 apiece and that extra-time was necessary. The Kerry team were reluctant to play the extra thirty minutes with captain John Mahony one of the most vocal opponents. It was only after being persuaded by the chairman of the Kerry County Board that the team decided to line out for a third <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> hurling. Both sides upped their games considerably for the only occasion that extra time was played in an All-Ireland final. Kerry {{went on to win the}} game by 2-3 to 1-5 to capture their first and only All-Ireland hurling title.|$|E

500|$|Sum 41's first EP, <b>Half</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Power, was {{released}} on June 27, 2000. The first single released by the band was [...] "Makes No Difference", which had two different music videos. The first video was put together using the video clips sent to the record label and the second showed the band performing at a house party. The album was certified gold in Canada.

500|$|Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste {{magazine}} wrote {{highly of}} the episode and called it [...] "a <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> heartwarming comedy". She was particularly pleased with how Michael was able to overcome Oscar with pathos, and she enjoyed the episode's subplots. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic praised the episode and awarded it five stars out of five. He wrote that [...] "If my favorite thing for Jim to do is prank Dwight, my second favorite is when he backs Michael." [...] Furthermore, he wrote that [...] "While this A story was filled with plenty of laughs, [...] Dwight's B story was absolutely murderous [...] all gold". He also felt that the C plot was enjoyable, because [...] "Andy is great in small doses".|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{later said}} that without Williams's score the film {{would have been}} only half as successful, and {{according}} to Williams it jumpstarted his career. He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, The Sugarland Express, {{and went on to}} collaborate with the director on almost all of his films. The original soundtrack for Jaws was released by MCA Records on LP in 1975, [...] and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> music that Williams redid for the album. In 2000, two versions of the score were released: Decca/Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score, and Varèse Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the release}} of <b>Half</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Power and up until the {{departure}} of Dave Baksh, Sum 41 occasionally played as an alter-ego 1980s heavy metal band called Pain for Pleasure during shows. The band appeared in Sum 41's music videos for [...] "Fat Lip" [...] and [...] "We're All to Blame" [...] and {{had at least one}} song on each of the band's first three releases. The group's best known song under the Pain for Pleasure moniker is the song of the same name from All Killer No Filler, a track that remains the band's staple during live shows and features drummer Steve Jocz on lead vocals. During the Don't Call It a Sum-Back Tour in 2017, Pain for Pleasure appeared performing the song {{at the end of their}} show with guitarist Tom Thacker replacing Jocz as the vocalist.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to {{the episode}} by news media {{organizations}} was extremely negative and caused controversy, criticizing the episode for its portrayal of domestic violence. A. J. Hammer of Showbiz Tonight {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Like so many other people, I was just shocked by what I saw on Family Guy last night," [...] and continued, [...] "It was really just a depressing <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> television." [...] In the same interview, Hammer asked television host Wendy Walsh of The Doctors about the storyline, to which she responded, [...] "The main theme of the show was about this poor 'stupid' woman who was too dumb to leave her relationship. And domestic violence is far more complicated than that. We're watching someone rationalize a domestic violence relationship {{and this is the}} kind of thought process that actually goes on in real life. It’s not satire anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{style has}} been disputed by fans {{because of the}} complex {{combination}} of different musical styles and the more mature, serious, and heavy sound in later albums. The band's EP <b>Half</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Power is described as punk rock, skate punk and pop punk. All Killer No Filler was described as pop punk and skate punk (except for [...] "Pain for Pleasure", which is purely heavy metal). Does This Look Infected? {{has been described as}} punk rock, pop punk and melodic hardcore. Chuck was getting heavier opting out the original pop punk sound with strong metal influences and an alternative rock sound, but the band kept in touch with its punk rock and melodic hardcore roots, which created an even more mature side than the group's previous effort. Critics have described Underclass Hero as a revival of the band's pop punk style. Screaming Bloody Murder and 13 Voices saw the band return some alternative metal influences. Some of the band's songs contain political-social commentary; [...] "The Jester" [...] is an [...] "anti-Bush screed", [...] "Underclass Hero" [...] is a song about class struggle, and [...] "Dear Father" [...] is about Deryck's absent father.|$|E

500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs {{and even a few}} sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Sum 41 {{signed an}} {{international}} record deal with Island Records and released its first EP, <b>Half</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Power, in 2000. The band released its debut album, All Killer No Filler in 2001. The album achieved mainstream success with its first single, [...] "Fat Lip", which reached {{number one on}} the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and remains the band's most successful single to date. The album's following singles [...] "In Too Deep" [...] and [...] "Motivation" [...] also achieved commercial success. All Killer No Filler was certified Platinum in the United States, in Canada and in the United Kingdom. In 2002, the band released Does This Look Infected?, which was also a commercial and critical success. The singles [...] "The Hell Song" [...] and [...] "Still Waiting" [...] both charted highly on the modern rock charts. The band released its next album, Chuck, in 2004, led by singles [...] "We're All to Blame" [...] and [...] "Pieces". The album proved successful, peaking at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and sold five million copies worldwide. In 2007, the band released Underclass Hero, which was met with a mixed reception, but gained some commercial success, becoming the band's highest charting album to date. It was also the band's last album on Aquarius Records. The band released the album Screaming Bloody Murder, on Island Records in 2011 to a generally positive reception, though it fell short of its predecessors' commercial success. The band's sixth studio album, 13 Voices was released in 2016. Up to 2015, the band has sold 30 million albums worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, {{as well as}} how {{the writers}} have [...] "smartly underplayed" [...] the {{relationship}} between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the [...] "weakest plotline of the season", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] were a rehash of the previous episode. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two": [...] "The laughs weren't as loud on [...] "Media Blitz," [...] as {{it was more of a}} squirm-inducing <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> television." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was [...] "dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said [...] "was so damn sweet that I just couldn't resist it". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, [...] "Did anyone else's heart melt just a little bit at the proud smile that crept across Leslie’s face when Ben found his voice?" [...] Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it harder and harder to like her character. Busis criticized the Ann and Chris subplot, of which she said, [...] "Wake me up when something actually happens." ...|$|E

AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four and a half}} out of five stars, saying that [...] "it sounds as if they enjoy being in a band, intoxicated by the noise they make." [...] Ann Powers of The Los Angeles Times gave the album four out of four stars, describing it as [...] "11 breakneck rockers and candidly emotional ballads, adding up to barely more than a <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> optimally toned catharsis" [...] and praising the [...] "lightness and dexterity of the playing" [...] and [...] "Vedder's hard-driving, often playful vocals", and called its music [...] "Accessible without sacrificing sophistication, aggressive without flailing". Rolling Stone staff writer Rob Sheffield gave Backspacer four out of five stars, saying that it contains [...] "the shortest, tightest, punkiest tunes they've ever banged out," [...] and that [...] "Eddie Vedder's heart-on-fire vocals are the main attraction, as always." [...] He added, [...] "After toughing out the Bush years, Pearl Jam aren't in the mood for brooding; at long last, surf's up." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian also gave the album four out of five stars. In the review he stated that [...] "the Seattle quartet have rarely sounded this energised." [...] Simpson observed that [...] "this is a record made by mature men with perspective: full of reflection and eclecticism, finding space for both U2 guitar motifs and Buzzcocks solos." [...] He added that [...] "the ninth Pearl Jam album may even be the best of the lot." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters gave the album a rating of 7/10 and wrote that Pearl Jam [...] "have finally re-discovered who they are, and sound stronger than ever because of it".|$|E
