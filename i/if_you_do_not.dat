25|$|Other body systems {{affected}} by Lyme-like Disease. More common than EM are symptoms due to invasion by the spirochaete {{of the nervous}} system, heart, muscles and joints. These may start weeks or months after the tickbite. Initially, they may include flu-like illness, fever, headache, sore throat, fatigue, aching muscles and joints. More serious are meningitis, Bell's palsy (weakness of the face muscles), swelling of joints, and heart problems with palpitations and breathlessness. Lyme disease is difficult to distinguish from many other illnesses like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) because the symptoms may be similar. If you have symptoms that could be Lyme disease, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> remember a tickbite, see your doctor. Diagnosis is helped by a blood test called a Western Blot test, but your doctor will consider whether any other illness could be causing your symptoms and may do some other tests.|$|E
500|$|Film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper {{gave the}} film [...] "two thumbs up". Ebert said, [...] "In 39 years, I have never written these {{words in a}} movie review, but here they are: You owe it to {{yourself}} to see this film. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not,</b> and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to," [...] calling the film [...] "horrifying, enthralling and [...] the potential, I believe, to actually change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth." ...|$|E

500|$|Most protesters {{ran after}} hearing gunshots and a {{helicopter}} chased them. After shooting stopped, protesters regrouped. One youth picked {{a rock and}} headed toward the army, only to be stopped by four other protesters. A witness interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights said that he and other protesters moved closer to army forces following the initial shooting. According to him he asked [...] "Why do you shoot us? We had our hands up. We are peaceful. What do you want from us?", one soldier replied [...] "I want you to leave. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> turn back, I have orders to shoot". Arriving ambulances started evacuating the injured when army opened fire again.|$|E
500|$|Gerard George Lowe {{came from}} Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a {{chemical}} engineer with South African Breweries. He went to Singapore {{to shop for}} electrical and electronic goods. Before he left Johannesburg on 7 March 1995, he told his wife Vanessa, a local airlines employee, his exact schedule, saying: [...] "I will call you the moment I check into the hotel {{to give you the}} contact number. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> hear from me on 10 March, it would mean that I would have a seat on the plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March. But if I do call you on 10 March, that would mean that I have not managed to get a seat and would return on 12 March." ...|$|E
500|$|Carroll {{considered}} requesting de Barth's {{appointment as}} bishop, but {{decided against it}} because of de Barth's lack of theological study and reputation for having a quick temper. Carroll died in 1815, and his successor, Leonard Neale, offered de Barth the position of bishop, but de Barth declined it. In a letter to Neale, de Barth wrote that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> forward my objections [...] to the Holy See ... I will not accept, but will kneel down and devoutly put the bulls in the fire ... and then farewell, Monseigneur. Neither you nor anyone else shall ever know {{the corner of the}} globe where I shall vegetate the few years still left to me to live. Neale accepted de Barth's refusal, and the see remained vacant. In 1817, after Neale died, de Barth traveled to Baltimore to participate in the episcopal consecration of Neale's successor, Ambrose Maréchal.|$|E

500|$|Disraeli {{spoke in}} favour of the measure, arguing that Christianity was [...] "completed Judaism", and asking the House of Commons [...] "Where is your Christianity <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe in their Judaism?" [...] Russell and Disraeli's future rival Gladstone thought it brave of him to speak as he did; [...] the speech was badly {{received}} by his own party. The Tories and the Anglican establishment were hostile to the bill. Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, spoke strongly against the measure and implied that Russell was paying off the Jews for helping elect him. With the exception of Disraeli, {{every member of the}} future protectionist cabinet then in Parliament voted against the measure. One who was not yet an MP, Lord John Manners, stood against Rothschild when the latter re-submitted himself for election in 1849. [...] Disraeli, who had attended the Protectionists dinner at the Merchant Taylors Hall, joined Bentinck in speaking and voting for the bill, although his own speech was a standard one of toleration. The measure was voted down.|$|E
500|$|Paul Gray {{wrote in}} a review in Time that the {{documents}} that make up Shikasta allow Lessing to stretch the novel out over vast periods of time and shift perspective [...] "dramatically from the near infinite to the minute". He said that the book's cohesiveness is its variety, and noted how Lessing interspaces her [...] "grand designs" [...] and [...] "configurations of enormous powers" [...] with [...] "passages of aching poignancy". Gray said that Shikasta is closer to Gulliver's Travels and the Old Testament {{than it is to}} Buck Rogers, and may disappoint readers interpreting her [...] "space fiction" [...] as [...] "science fiction". He found Lessing's bleak vision of Earth's history in which she suggests that humans [...] "could not... help making the messes they have, that their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos", a little [...] "unsatisfying", but added that even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, [...] "even furiously engaging on every page". Gray called Shikasta [...] "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".|$|E
500|$|Ballo's father {{subsequently}} wrote a {{book about}} his daughter's suicide. He decided not to give interviews to the press about his ordeal until the book was published. He {{wanted to be able to}} tell the story and impact of his daughter's death, on his own terms. Titled, Kaja: 1988–2008, the book explores the sequence of events that led to his daughter's death, from her time studying French in Nice. Her early history of psychiatric treatment is discussed in the book. He recounts the difficulties in getting information about his daughter's death from government authorities. According to the author, there was a slow response in receiving help from the Foreign Ministry of Norway. In an interview with Politiken, he explained the motivation for writing the book: [...] "After the funeral I felt I had to do something relating to grief. This was my way to process the grief. The second issue was that I needed to transcribe the account to later tell my little daughter Oda." [...] He also said, [...] "I wanted to contribute to greater openness about suicide." [...] He acknowledged, [...] "Losing a child means that life is turned upside down. I believe that grief becomes heavier <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> share it with anyone." [...] The book was written with input from other family members.|$|E

500|$|The title OK Computer {{is taken}} from the 1978 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series, in which the {{character}} Zaphod Beeblebrox speaks the phrase [...] "Okay, computer, I want full manual control now." [...] The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during their 1996 tour and Yorke made a note of the phrase. [...] "OK Computer" [...] was a working title for the song [...] "Palo Alto", which had been considered for inclusion on the album. The title stuck with the band; according to Jonny Greenwood, [...] " [...] started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with {{what we were trying}} to do." [...] Yorke said it [...] "refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, of our future, of everyone else's. It's to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on... and the sound it makes." [...] Yorke described the title as [...] "a really resigned, terrified phrase", to him similar to the Coca-Cola advertisement [...] "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing". Wired writer Leander Kahney suggests that it is an homage to Macintosh computers, as the Mac's speech recognition software responds to the command [...] "OK computer" [...] as an alternative to clicking the [...] "OK" [...] button. Other titles considered were Ones and Zeroes—a reference to the binary numeral system—and Your Home May Be at Risk <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> Keep Up Payments.|$|E
