5000|$|Electric current {{assisted}} sintering (ECAS) technologies rely on electric currents {{to densify}} powders, with {{the advantage of}} reducing production time dramatically (from 15 minutes of the slowest ECAS to a few microseconds of the fastest), not requiring a long furnace heat and allowing near theoretical densities but with the drawback of simple shapes. Powders employed in ECAS can avoid binders thanks {{to the possibility of}} <b>direct</b> <b>sintering,</b> without the need of pre-pressing and a green compact. Molds are designed for the final part shape since the powders densify while filling the cavity under an applied pressure thus avoiding the problem of shape variations caused by non isotropic sintering and distortions caused by gravity at high temperatures. The most common of these technologies is hot pressing, which has been under use for the production of the diamond tools employed in the construction industry. Spark plasma sintering and electro sinter forging are two modern, industrial commercial ECAS technologies.|$|E

The fabrication techniques differed mainly on the deposition of silicon dioxide particles, which included organic, inorganic, and physical methods. Each technique was used to coat three samples of varying particle load. The surface of each sample was evaluated with contact angle goniometer and optical spectrometer.

In the <b>direct</b> <b>sintering</b> of TiH 2 powder compaction, the interstitial hydrogen atoms was released before sintering through the grain boundaries and meet the titanium oxide phase existing in the grain boundaries as the film forms. We found thermodynamically there that the hydrogen atoms could effectively reduce the titanium oxide existing on the powder surfaces or grain boundaries with a considerable driving force of about - 250 kJ/mole. Such a self-reduction process by hydrogen atoms makes the grain boundaries very clean with oxide-free condition and helpful for sintering. Moreover, the de-hydrogenated titanium regions near grain boundaries could become unstable due to the formation of many vacancy defects by the release of hydrogen and also evoke the sintering ability...|$|E
