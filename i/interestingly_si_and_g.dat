40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{overview}} of experimental studies {{of the structure of}} adsorbed atomic and molecular species on quasicrystal surfaces with a particular focus on those systems where quasiperiodic ordering of the adsorbate structure occurs. Atomic adsorption is illustrated with examples from studies of Fe, <b>Si</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gd</b> adsorption on the five-fold surface of $i$-Al-Pd-Mn. Overlayer structure is correlated with several physical parameters to identify trends. It is concluded that the chemical properties of the adsorbate (metallic radius, electronegativity, melting temperature) are important indicators of quasiperiodic structuring of the adsorbate system. These correlations allow predictions of those elements likely to yield pseudomorphic overlayers. Structural effects upon molecular adsorption on clean quasicrystal surfaces have been less successful.

Both remnants exhibit line-rich thermal spectra that require highly non-solar elemental abundance ratios. In each case, <b>Si</b> <b>and</b> S are unequivocally overabundant compared to solar based purely on the measured equivalent width of the Kα line complex. Detailed nonequilibrium ionization spectral analysis of these remnants, using a single temperature, single ionization age model, confirm the overabundances, yielding <b>Si,</b> S <b>and</b> Ar abundances many times their solar values: 3 to 5 times solar for G 337. 2 - 0. 7 and greater than 3 to 10 times solar for G 309. 2 - 0. 6. We also find that for both remnants, Ne and Mg are underabundant relative to <b>Si,</b> <b>and</b> for <b>G</b> 309. 2 - 0. 6, Ca and Fe as well are relatively underabundant. This is the first detection of metal-rich, non-solar abundance material in these remnants, identifying them as young ejecta-dominated SNRs. Further support for their youth comes from the distances that we estimate from the fitted column densities (less than 15 kpc for G 337. 2 - 0. 7, and 4 ± 2 kpc for G 309. 2 - 0. 6). From the implied sizes of the remnants at these distances we infer relatively young ages (2000 to 4500 years for G 337. 2 - 0. 7, and 700 to 4000 years for G 309. 2 - 0. 6).

Besides {{the advantage of}} presenting the characteristic dendritic globular shape at low generation, these three-dimensional molecules, easily modified by organic or inorganic reactions, quickly exhibit multiple end groups at their periphery, thus featuring attractive properties in catalysis and photoluminescence applications. Various dendritic POSS containing diphenylphosphine moieties at their periphery {{have been used in}} the methoxycarbonylation of ethene. Those with a -CH₂CH₂- spacer between the silicon and the phosphorus atoms (G 0 - 8 ethylPPh₂ <b>and</b> <b>G</b> 1 - 16 ethylPPh₂) only produce methyl propanoate whilst a similar dendrimer with a -CH₂- spacer between <b>Si</b> <b>and</b> P (<b>G</b> 1 - 16 methylPPh₂) gives only copolymer. The effect of the molecular architecture is discussed in comparison with the selectivities observed when using small molecule analogues. A wide range of non dendritic monodentate phosphines has also been studied in this reaction showing that low steric bulk and high electron density favours polyketone formation. The poorly active, monodentate SemiEsphos phosphine has been turned into an active ligand for rhodium catalysed vinyl acetate hydroformylation by attachment to the periphery of a Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane. Whilst some of these dendritic ligands have shown activity, others precipitated upon mixing with the rhodium precursor. Modelling studies correlating the experimental facts have shown that the former are more compact and rigid in comparison to the latter, which are more flexible and hence more prone to monodentate binding to rhodium and cross-linking. Grubbs cross metathesis has been used to functionalize octavinylsilsesquioxane with fluorescent vinylbiphenyl modified chromophores to design new hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterials. Those macromolecules have been characterized by NMR, microanalyses, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and photoluminescence.

40|$|Results of spin density {{functional}} theory (SDFT) calculations {{were used}} to construct and check features of a generally applicable semi-quantitative approach to understanding magnetic coupling in gadolinium-containing molecules, clusters, and solids. Using fragments based on structures of metal-rich lanthanide compounds, we have investigated molecular and low-dimensional extended structures, and have shown that open-d-shell clusters facilitate strong ferromagnetic coupling whereas closed-d-shell systems prefer antiferromagnetic coupling. The qualitative features can be interpreted using a perturbative molecular orbital (PMO) model that focuses {{the influence of the}} 4 f 7 - d exchange interaction on the d-based molecular orbitals. The f-d exchange interaction, mediated by spin polarization of both filled and partially-filled metal-metal bonding orbitals, is described for the model system Gd 3 I 6 (OPH 3) 12 n+ using basic perturbation methods. This approach is successful for predicting the magnetic ground state for Gd 2 Cl 3, a semiconducting system for which calculations predict antiferromagnetic ordering of the 4 f 7 moments in a pattern consistent with published neutron diffraction data. An attempt to account for the calculated magnetic energies of spin patterns using an Ising model was unsuccessful, indicating that the Ising model is inappropriate. Instead, the d-electron mediated f-f exchange interaction was interpreted using our basic perturbation theory approach. Computed density of states and spin polarization information was used to support the perturbation-theoretic analysis. This method has also been successful evaluating the ground state for Gd[Gd 6 FeI 12]. Using the model [Gd 6 CoI 12](OPH 3) 6, which has three unpaired electrons in the HOMO, the 4 f moments prefer spin alignment with the unpaired electrons in the system and the ferromagnetic 4 f 7 spin arrangement is the ground state.

How <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GSP affect the financial performance of the fashion enterprises under the global financial crisis is hence an important issue. Motivated by the above relationship and based on publicly available data, this study aims to explore empirically (i) the impact of <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GSP adoption on the financial performance of fashion enterprises, (ii) the ability of <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GSP adoption to alleviate adversity owing to financial crisis, and (iii) the moderating effect brought by fashion content on the above relationships. The findings reveal that (i) both <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GSP adoption can significantly improve the financial performance of the fashion enterprises, (ii) both <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GSP adoption help to mitigate the adverse effect of financial tsunami on the fashion enterprise's financial performance; and (iii) fashion content has a moderating effect for fashion enterprises which sell fashionable items (i. e., "fashionable group") to increase profits through {{a higher level of}} SI or executing GSP to act against financial tsunami. Managerial implications and insights are discussed. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{relationship}} between symptom improvement (<b>SI)</b> <b>and</b> acceleration of gastric emptying (GE) for different drugs {{used in the}} treatment of idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis is uncertain. In this paper we examined the study-specific correlations between <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GE, and we performed a meta-regression analysis of the association across multiple studies. METHODS: The MEDLINE database (1, 946 to present) was searched, and only controlled trials or trials with an established effective comparator that compared both <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GE were included. RESULTS: Studies were identified for metoclopramide (n= 6), domperidone (n= 6), cisapride (n= 14), erythromycin (n= 3), botulinum toxin (n= 2), and levosulpiride (n= 3). Even though most drugs concomitantly improved symptoms and accelerated GE, no study reported a significant correlation between <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GE. Moreover, a correlation analysis over all studies using meta-regression did not show a significant {{relationship between}} <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GE. Our findings need to be qualified by inconsistencies in study methods, which is a limitation but also suggests that our findings are robust to methodological factors. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, no evidence of a relationship between <b>SI</b> <b>and</b> GE was identified for different drugs used for the treatment of gastroparesis. This finding questions the use of GE measurement to direct drug development for gastroparesis. 10 page(s...|$|R
