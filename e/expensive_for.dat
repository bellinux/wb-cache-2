5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891, Berkman {{learned that}} Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, whom he admired, had {{canceled}} an American speaking tour {{on the basis that}} it was too <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> the struggling anarchist movement. While Berkman was disappointed, the frugality of the action further elevated Kropotkin's stature in his eyes.|$|E
5|$|Henry Tufton died in 1849, and castle {{ownership}} fell to Hothfields. Maintenance was too <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> the family, and by 1859 cattle {{were being}} kept in its gatehouse, and visitors complained that {{parts of the}} romantic ruin had become inaccessible. Without sufficient funds, the castle quickly fell into marked decay.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Richard Garfield {{approached}} Wizards of the Coast {{with the}} idea for a new board game called RoboRally, but was turned down because the game would have been too <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> Wizards of the Coast to produce.

5|$|The plan {{itself is}} not without controversy, as it has made the local club Kingstonian F.C.'s future very uncertain, with them unable {{to play in a}} ground that is now too big and <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> a non-league side and one which they no longer have any {{decision}} over.|$|E

5|$|Titanium metal {{is used in}} {{automotive}} applications, {{particularly in}} automobile and motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical. The metal is generally too <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> the general consumer market, though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with titanium exhausts, and a Corvette Z06's LT4 supercharged engine uses lightweight, solid titanium intake valves for greater strength and resistance to heat.|$|E
5|$|Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an {{effective}} method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> the protection of civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private.

It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may {{also be used for}} high-altitude parachute jumps.|$|E
5|$|Although the Poitevin was not {{the only}} breed of horse used for the {{production}} of mules, the Poitou mule was known worldwide. They were in high demand in the United States from the late 19th century until the beginning of World War I. During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline. In the Deux-Sèvres region, especially in the district of Melle, near Luçon and Saint-Maixent, mule breeding began to be concentrated in ateliers (workshops), which were relatively <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> breeders.|$|E

5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an {{expensive}} and painstaking process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction.

5|$|Eastwood then {{branched}} out {{to star in}} the only musical of his career, Paint Your Wagon (1969). Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife (Jean Seberg) at an auction. Bad weather and delays plagued the production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20million, which was extremely <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> the time. The film was not a critical or commercial success, although it {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture– Musical or Comedy.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, the Eugene Guard {{became a}} daily newspaper. Charles H. Fisher {{took over the}} paper in 1907 and {{published}} it until 1912 when E. J. Finneran purchased the paper.

The University of Oregon's journalism school briefly ran the paper during the receivership under the guidance of Eric W. Allen.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, VAT {{had started}} to seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> VAT. This may have led the major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT. The chairman of VAT held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, VAT. Valmet is also rumoured to {{have been interested in}} VAT but {{there is no evidence of}} concrete negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Hamburg scene {{revolved}} around the Kaiserkeller, Top Ten, Star-Club, Beer-Shop, Mambo, Holle, Wagabond (pronounced vagabond in German) and the Pacific Hotel, {{as well as the}} less popular clubs like Grannies, the Ice Cream Shop, Chugs, and Sacha's. The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights, with posters advertising the performers in the clubs. Each club had a doorman whose job was to entice customers inside, as the drinks were <b>expensive</b> (<b>for</b> Babycham and watered-down beer). Customers who would not, or could not afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out.|$|E

5|$|Méliès, {{working in}} {{collaboration}} with the stage director Victor de Cottens, designed An Adventurous Automobile Trip as an innovative Folies Bergère act combining stage performance and film, with a live prologue and epilogue used to frame the filmed sequence. After this version premiered on 31 December 1904, Méliès adapted the film to be a standalone release for general distribution in 1905. The lavish film, available in both black-and-white and hand-colored versions, was a popular and critical success both in France and in America. However, the film's high production values made it too <b>expensive</b> <b>for</b> many exhibitors, one of several factors that sent Méliès's career into decline.|$|E
5|$|Similar alloys {{with the}} {{addition}} of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too <b>expensive.</b> <b>For</b> building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget for}} the film's costumes was US$1,600, {{far more than the}} stage {{production}} budget, but having to double up on costumes for filming was <b>expensive.</b> <b>For</b> filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while the other was worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming, such as Columbia's gold sequined swallow-tail coat and top hat and Magenta's maid's uniform.|$|E
