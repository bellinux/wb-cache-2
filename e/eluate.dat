25|$|The {{interface}} between a liquid phase technique (HPLC) with a continuously flowing <b>eluate,</b> and a gas phase technique {{carried out in}} a vacuum was difficult for a long time. The advent of electrospray ionization changed this. Currently, the most common LC-MS interfaces are electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI). These are newer MS ion sources that facilitate {{the transition from a}} high pressure environment (HPLC) to high vacuum conditions needed at the MS analyzer. Although these interfaces are described individually, they can also be commercially available as dual ESI/APCI, ESI/APPI, or APCI/APPI ion sources. Various deposition and drying techniques were used in the past (e.g., moving belts) but the most common of these was the off-line MALDI deposition. A new approach still under development called direct-EI LC-MS interface, couples a nano HPLC system and an electron ionization equipped mass spectrometer.|$|E

Cytomegalovirus-specific antibody was found in 15 % <b>eluates</b> from normal colon and in 18 % carcinomas. Out of the 28 matched specimens, cytomegalovirus-specific IgG was detected in one normal and four tumour <b>eluates,</b> specific IgA in two normal and four tumour <b>eluates,</b> and specific IgM in two normal and two tumour <b>eluates.</b> In two instances cytomegalovirus-specific antibody was present in the <b>eluates</b> prepared from the normal and tumour tissue of the same patient. Of those <b>eluates</b> which contained cytomegalovirus-specific antibodies by ELISA, two were positive by anti-complement immunofluorescence of human embryo fibroblasts infected with cytomegalovirus strain AD- 169.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry devices, an LC-MS system contains an interface that efficiently transfers the separated components from the LC column into the MS ion source. The interface is necessary because the LC and MS devices are fundamentally incompatible. While the mobile phase in a LC system is a pressurized liquid, the MS analyzers commonly operate under vacuum (around 10−6 torr). Thus, {{it is not possible}} to directly pump the <b>eluate</b> from the LC column into the MS source. Overall, the interface is a mechanically simple part of the LC-MS system that [...] transfers the maximum amount of analyte, removes a significant portion of the mobile phase used in LC and preserves the chemical identity of the chromatography products (chemically inert). As a requirement, the interface should not interfere with the ionizing efficiency and vacuum conditions of the MS system. Nowadays, most extensively applied LC-MS interfaces are based on atmospheric pressure ionization (API) strategies like electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI).These interfaces became available in the 1990s after a two decade long research and development process.|$|E
2500|$|ESI {{interface}} for LC-MS systems {{was developed}} by Fenn and collaborators in 1988. This ion source/ interface [...] {{can be used for}} the analysis of moderately polar molecules (e.g., metabolites, xenobiotics, and peptides). The liquid <b>eluate</b> coming out of the LC column is pumped through a metal capillary kept at 3 to 5 kV. The liquid is nebulized {{at the tip of the}} capillary and a fine spray of charged droplets is formed. To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages. Positively and negatively charged ions can be detected and it is possible to switch between the negative and positive modes of operation. Most ions produced in the ESI interface are multiply charged. The use of 1–3nbsp&mm ID microbore columns is recommended for LC-MS systems using electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces because optimal operation [...] is achieved with flow rates in the 50-200 μl/min range.|$|E
2500|$|The thermospray (TSP) {{interface}} {{was developed}} in 1983 by Vestal laboratories at the University of Houston. The interface resulted from a long term research project intended to find a LC-MS interface capable of handling high flow rates (1 ml/min) and avoiding the flow split in DLI interfaces.The TSP interface was composed by a heated probe, a desolvation chamber, and an ion exchange skimmer. The LC effluent passed through the heated probe and emerged as a jet of vapor and small droplets flowing into the desolvation chamber at low pressure. The ionization of solutes occurred by direct evaporation or ion-molecule reactions induced by the solvent. This interface was able to handle up to 2 ml/min of <b>eluate</b> from the LC column and would efficiently introduce it into the MS vacuum system. TSP was also more suitable for LC-MS applications involving reversed phase liquid chromatography (RT-LC). The TSP system had a dual function acting as an interface and a solvent-mediated chemical ionization source. With time, the mechanical complexity of TSP was simplified, and this interface became popular as the first ideal LC-MS interface for pharmaceutical applications comprising the [...] analysis of drugs, metabolites, conjugates, nucleosides, peptides, natural products, and pesticides. The introduction of TSP marked a significant improvement for LC-MS systems and was the most widely applied interface {{until the beginning of}} the 1990s, when it began to be replaced by interfaces involving atmospheric pressure ionization (API).|$|E

40|$|The {{performances}} of ELISA assays with different antigen preparations, such as Leishmania amazonensis or L. chagasi lysates and the recombinant antigens rK- 39 and rK- 26, were compared using sera or <b>eluates</b> from dried blood collected on filter paper to detect anti-Leishmania antibodies in dogs from a visceral leishmaniasis-endemic area in Brazil. Of 115 IFAT-reactive dogs at 1 : 40 titre, 106 (92. 2 %) were positive in parasitological exams (skin and/or spleen). These animals {{were compared to}} healthy animals (n = 25), negative for IFAT at a titre of 1 : 40 and parasitological exams. The sensitivities of crude and recombinant antigens were similar and remarkably high for both sera and <b>eluates</b> (97 - 100 %). Specificity was higher than 96 % for sera and <b>eluates</b> for different antigens, except for L. chagasi antigen using <b>eluates</b> (88 %). Concordance values among the tests were higher either for sera or <b>eluates</b> (J = 0. 95 - 1. 00). High concordances were observed between sera and <b>eluates</b> tested with different antigens (kappa = 0. 93 - 0. 97). Crude and recombinant antigens identified different clinical phases of canine leishmaniasis. These results show that <b>eluates</b> {{could be used in}} canine surveys to identify L. chagasi infection. Recombinant antigens added little when compared to crude antigen in identifying positive dogs. Cross-reactivity with other diseases whose distribution often overlaps VL-endemic areas is a limitation of crude antigen use however...|$|R

Their study examined aquatic test methods {{that had already been}} proposed to evaluate waste [66, 67] and ecotoxicity tests that are applied to assess construction products in Germany [68, 69] for their suitability to investigate <b>eluates</b> from construction products. Leaching experiments were performed on twenty construction products of different origin and composition. Monolithic and plate-like products were eluted in accordance with CEN/TS 16637 - 2 [20], whereas granular products were eluted in a one-stage batch test in accordance with EN 12457 - 1 [70]. The <b>eluates</b> were examined in four aquatic toxicity tests (algae, daphnia, luminescent bacteria, fish eggs), a genotoxicity test (umu test), and the respirometer test for biodegradability (OECD 301 F). In this test, the lowest ineffective dilution (LID) was determined. For the determination of the LID, the sample is diluted until the observed ecotoxicity dropped below a level at which no inhibitions, or only effects not exceeding the test-specific variability, are observed (e.g., growth inhibition green algae <[*] 5 %). The observed ecotoxicity of these <b>eluates</b> differed considerably. Many of the twenty products tested showed no effects in ecotoxicity tests. However, there were also <b>eluates</b> from products such as ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM), sealing masses, and synthetic flooring that had to be diluted up to a dilution factor above 1000 to derive LID values. For six out of eight investigated <b>eluates</b> that contained more than 10  mg/L TOC (total organic carbon), biodegradability was above 75 % [29]. A round robin test including seventeen laboratories from five EU member states was performed using <b>eluates</b> from leaching tests on a monolithic and a granular construction material that were both based on EPDM. The selected ecotoxicity tests with algae, daphnia, and luminescent bacteria were able to demonstrate toxic effects, as well as the level of toxicity of the <b>eluates.</b> The <b>eluates</b> were not toxic to fish eggs. The reproducibility of the tests was evaluated based on effective concentration 50 (EC 50) and lowest ineffective dilution (LID) values.

Considering the complex overall process, the reproducibility of bioassays with <b>eluates</b> from construction products was regarded as acceptable [29].
