40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of free-form machining, CAM {{software}} offers various modes of tool-path gen- eration, depending on the geometry of the surface to be machined. Manufactured surface quality results from the choice of machining strategy and machining parameters.

The 3 D surface roughness parameter is therefore defined according to both an influential machining strat- egy parameter and the surface description.
