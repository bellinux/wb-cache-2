25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his eyes as he dies.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between both managers was evidently hostile to begin with. Ferguson noted that Wenger {{was the only}} manager he came across in the league not to share a drink with after matches – an English football [...] "tradition". In a joint interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, Wenger said his discourtesy was mistaken for mistrust and managers [...] "cannot be completely friendly and open up." [...] When asked {{if this was the}} reason he avoided the post-match drink, he replied: [...] "Most of the time, yes. What can you say if you have won? And if you have lost all {{you want to do is}} <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> prepare for the next game." ...|$|E
500|$|Darren and Hannah (Emma Rigby) go on {{a weekend}} away to Denmark with a rock 'n' roll band where they drunkenly marry in a [...] "shotgun" [...] fashion. What's on TV {{announced}} the storyline in June 2009. About {{the beginning of the}} storyline, [...] "Hannah has gone off the rails of late, but even she manages to outdo herself when she and Darren tie the knot after a particularly boozy night in Denmark". Holy Soap said the wedding will leave fans [...] "stunned" [...] and described the pair as [...] "odd". Dawson said, regarding the sudden marriage, that [...] "Darren doesn’t suddenly fall in love with Hannah or vice-versa. It's just one of those mad, crazy things you do when you’ve had far too many drinks and your life is {{in a bit of a}} mess. They both regret it. They <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> their friends and families are horrified – especially Hannah's family".|$|E
50|$|Colton <b>gets</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> {{tells his}} wife Olivia about the giant spiders and tells her {{they need to}} leave. He takes the shotgun from his house and drives off in his car to find his son Wyatt.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose I shall, because it's such a lot {{of trouble}} to go {{anywhere}} else. I'm engaged somewhere, I know; but I'm not up to <b>getting</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> dressing. By George! I don't know how fellows do that kind of thing. I can't.' ...|$|R
25|$|Mom <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> Candace thinks that, at last, Mom {{will see}} what the boys have been up to and believe her. But just as Mom is about {{to step into the}} back yard, all {{evidence}} vanishes, usually as a side effect of Doofenshmirtz's device.|$|R
500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, Donegan created guitar riffs. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote {{the rest of the}} music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, [...] "The writing process is... pretty much the same since the beginning... of this band. It's always been riffs; {{something}} musically that I'll come up with [...]" [...] Wengren commented, [...] "We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life." [...] Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, [...] "When the basic guitar, bass, [...] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Glenn Danzig {{has served}} as the sole {{songwriter}} for every band he has fronted, and described his writing process: [...] "Sometimes I get the guitar lines, sometimes I write on the piano, sometimes I’ll write the lyrics first and then figure out the chord patterns on guitar, and sometimes I write the drum pattern first. It's all different". Danzig also records basic song ideas when away from his home: [...] "I usually hum it into a microcassette recorder and then I transpose it when I <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> work it out on guitar or piano".|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{modes of}} {{transportation}} allow more people and products to {{travel around the}} world at a faster pace; they also open the airways to the transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors. One example is the West Nile Virus. [...] It is believed that this disease reached the United States via “mosquitoes that crossed the ocean by riding in airplane wheel wells and arrived in New York City in 1999.” With the use of air travel, {{people are able to}} go to foreign lands, contract a disease and not have any symptoms of illness until after they <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> having exposed others to the disease along the way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose you're {{taking the}} proper line, and you'd be rather noble, only you're not sincere. You don't like Cartwright and know he doesn't like you. All the same, it's not important. We {{were talking about}} <b>getting</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> since the boys have not come for us we had better start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you can ask}} him," [...] she said, abruptly; [...] "and if he doesn't object, {{you can go to}} see my mother, {{when she}} <b>gets</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> ask her. And here comes Mr. Matlack. I think he has been calling you. Now don't say another word, unless it is about fish." ...|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, Under Suspicion was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required cuts, in Reel 2, of the stealing from a safe, examining the loot after the valet <b>gets</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and,</b> in Reel 5, the stealing of a necklace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Major, you see she {{anxious to}} <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> make path clear. But," [...] he added gloomily, [...] "how she behave when she reach there, can't say." ...|$|E

6000|$|Peter hopped {{a couple}} of steps nearer. [...] "Say, Johnny," [...] he whispered, [...] "how is she going to know whether you stay in the yard all the time or not, so long as you are here when she <b>gets</b> <b>home?</b> I know where there's the dandiest sweet-clover patch. We can go over there and back easy before old Mrs. Chuck <b>gets</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> she won't know {{anything}} about it. Come on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{mother and}} {{daughter}} drove for five minutes in silence. Then Gwendolen said, [...] "I intend to join the Langens at Dover, mamma.

One day Amber <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> finds the {{neighbors in the}} house, stealing a few things. They beat her up <b>and</b> leave. Duke <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> finds her, and is so angered he goes out and purchases a gun.

6000|$|... "I've {{never heard}} of it; but I suppose the Greeks have, if it's there," [...] he replied. [...] "But why not wait till we <b>get</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> then go to Kieth's or Hammerstein's?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, really," [...] I said, [...] "it {{is already}} six o'clock and I doubt {{if we could}} <b>get</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> dress. I see nothing {{extraordinary}} {{in the fact that}} we are not going." ...|$|E
