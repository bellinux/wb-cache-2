He kept himself occupied with his vast library of over 11,000 books at Balbi's pavilion, reading for several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.|$|E
25|$|Public {{views are}} crucial {{to the success of}} opt-out or presumed consent {{donation}} systems. In a study done to determine if health policy change to a presumed consent or opt-out system would help to increase donors, an increase of 20 to 30 percent was seen among countries who changed their policies from some type of opt-in system to an opt-out system. Of course, this increase must have a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the health policy change, but also may be influenced by other factors that could have impacted donor increases.|$|E
500|$|The {{wide range}} of {{descriptions}} for the odour of durian may have a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the variability of durian odour itself. Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas; for example, red durian (D. dulcis) has a deep caramel flavour with a turpentine odour while red-fleshed durian (D. graveolens) emits a fragrance of roasted almonds. [...] Among the varieties of D. zibethinus, Thai varieties are sweeter in flavour and less odorous than Malay ones. The degree of ripeness {{has an effect on}} the flavour as well.|$|E

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{reviewing}} the episode for TrekNation was undecided {{about whether the}} main point of the episode where Captain Archer is expected to lead the Vulcans back to their main path of logic was a [...] "wonderfully progressive concept or just regressive Trek in which humans have all the answers". She thought that the change in Soval's opinions in this episode was difficult to accept and that {{the other members of}} the main cast didn't get a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the episode. However, whilst she thought that [...] "Awakening" [...] was a visual improvement over [...] "The Forge", she was reserving judgement until she had seen the third part of the trilogy. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] thought that certain elements of the plot didn't follow logical paths, such as how Archer found the Kir'shara in a few minutes when apparently the Syrrannites had been looking for it for two years even though [...] "it sits in a chamber behind a door that practically announces, 'IMPORTANT RELIC INSIDE'?" [...] However, he called the episode entertaining and gave it a score of three out of four.|$|E
2500|$|... "Hot Afternoons" [...] was controversial; the author's {{innovative}} {{technique in}} this long, free-verse poem tended to polarize commentators, {{with much of}} the criticism taking the form of parody. [...] "In Hot Afternoons," [...] Siegel later explained, [...] "I tried to take many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and to show, in a beautiful way, that they aren’t so separate and that they do have a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with one another." ...|$|E

2500|$|We {{were at the}} end of our {{recording}} {{contract with}} Century Media, and basically they didn't know if we were going to re-sign with them, so they gave us a very small budget for our last album to work with. That was about $20,000 which is a nothing <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a record. What we needed to do at the time was to find a producer that was immediately available to make a record with such a small budget, and that guy was Kelly Gray (laughs). Unfortunately, he was just not the right guy to do this album." ...|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was nine}} years old, a {{neighborhood}} predator sexually abused Louise.

When Brooks at last told her mother of the incident, many years later, her mother suggested that it must have been Louise's fault for [...] "leading him on".|$|E

[...] He tore through the heavy Penn forwards for substantial gains, while his squirming, turning end runs added many yards to Michigan's total. [...] He was equally effective on the defense, and his ability to solve Penn's offense and direct his team mates to the point of attack had a good <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the checking of the local's best ground gaining plays. [...] "Maggie" [...] was in every play, and carried the ball a greater number of times than any other man of either eleven.|$|E

2500|$|During the Japanese Occupation (February 1942 - September 1945), {{the school}} {{ceased to exist}} as it was shut down by the Japanese {{military}} administration. After the Japanese surrender, the British Military Administration took charge of Singapore and {{attempts were made to}} revive the school again. The school had lost most of its administrative documents, records, its former students and teachers at the aftermath of the war. The school was finally re-opened on the premises of Outram School by headmaster, Percival Frank Aroozoo on 13 May 1946. Aroozoo, a Eurasian of Portuguese descent was the grandson of Simon Aroozoo, who happened to be a close friend and colleague of Gan Eng Seng when both men worked together at Guthrie and Company for fifty years. A year later, the school was moved to the former Japanese National School building (now the Stamford Arts Centre) at No. 155 Waterloo Street and remained there until 1951. During this period, GESS was still a primary school. The teething problems were soon over and on December 1949, Aroozoo launched the school's periodical, Onward to chronicalise the legacy and milestones of the school. On 29 May 1950, GESS became the first school in Singapore to form the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). Its formation was an initiative by Aroozoo: [...] "Parents as much as the teacher has a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the training and development of a child as a useful member of the community." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several historians {{counter the}} {{argument}} that reparations caused the inflation and collapse of the mark. Gerhard Weinberg writes that Germany refused to pay by, and that doing so destroyed their own currency. Anthony Lentin agrees and writes that inflation was [...] "a consequence of the war rather than of the peace" [...] and that hyperinflation {{was a result of}} the [...] "German government's reckless issue of paper money" [...] during the Allied occupation of the Ruhr. British and French experts believed that the Mark was being sabotaged to avoid budgetary and currency reform and to evade reparations. Sally Marks writes that the Germans claimed that reparations destroyed the Mark. Marks writes that historians who say reparations caused hyperinflation have overlooked [...] "that the inflation long predated reparations" [...] and the way [...] "inflation mushroomed" [...] between mid-1921 and the end of 1922 [...] "when Germany was actually paying very little in reparations" [...] and have failed to explain why [...] "the period of least inflation coincided with the period of largest reparation payments...or why Germans claimed after 1930 that reparations were causing deflation". She writes [...] "there is no doubt that British and French suspicions late in 1922 were sound". Marks also writes that the [...] "astronomic inflation which ensued was a result of German policy", whereby the government paid for passive resistance in the Ruhr [...] "from an empty exchequer" [...] and paid off its domestic and war debts with worthless marks. Bell agrees and writes that [...] "inflation had little direct connection with reparation payments themselves, but a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the way the German government chose to subsidize industry and to pay the costs of passive resistance to the occupation [...] by extravagant use of the printing press". Bell also writes that hyperinflation was not an inevitable consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, but was among the actual results.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have a great <b>deal</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine {{going on in the world}} and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
