Note that this definition (from the Kentucky statute) covers only compounds where the adamantyl group is attached by the 1-position, and would not include compounds where it is attached by the 2-position. Some other jurisdictions have consequently omitted the numbering from their corresponding definition (cf. Arizona for example), so as to cover a broader range of compounds.One example is AB-001. Notice the 5-membered alkyl group on the nitrogen atom of the indole ring.Indole-3-carboxylate esters: Any compound containing a 1H-indole-3-carboxylate ester structure with the ester oxygen bearing a napthyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, or adamantyl group and substitution at the one (1) position of the indole ring by an alkyl, <b>haloalkyl,</b> alkenyl, cycloalkylmethyl, cycloalkylethyl, benzyl, N-methyl-2-piperidinylmethyl, or 2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl group, whether or not further substituted on the indole ring to any extent and whether or not further substituted on the naphthyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, adamantyl, or benzyl groups to any extent.

5000|$|For example, in many jurisdictions {{there is}} a general control on Naphthoylindoles: [...] "Any {{compound}} containing a 3-(1-naphthoyl)indole structure with substitution at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring by an alkyl, <b>haloalkyl,</b> alkenyl, cycloalkylmethyl, cycloalkylethyl, 1-(N-methyl-2-piperidinyl)methyl, or 2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl group, whether or not further substituted in the indole ring to any extent and whether or not substituted in the naphthyl ring to any extent." [...] (example definition from Kentucky, which is substantially derived from the 2009 ACMD advice on synthetic cannabinoids in the UK) This causes a substance such as MAM-2201 to be controlled as a Schedule 1 illegal drug, even though [...] "MAM-2201" [...] or its corresponding chemical name are not specifically listed in the statute. Notice the five carbon chain with the fluorine atom attached to the nitrogen atom. A fluoropentyl chain falls within the scope of [...] "haloalkyl" [...] substitutions, and so with a methyl group attached to the carbon atom at the 4-position of the naphthyl ring (i.e. [...] "substituted in the naphthyl ring to any extent"), and a fluoropentyl group attached to the nitrogen atom ("with substitution at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring by a...haloalkyl...group"), this compound falls within the scope of the general definition. It is in this way MAM-2201 can be controlled without being specifically named in the statute. On the other hand, THJ-2201 with an indazole core, falls outside this general definition, as it is a naphthoylindazole rather than a naphthoylindole. Note however that THJ-2201 is now specifically listed under US federal law.|$|E
50|$|The first {{breakthroughs}} in ProTide research {{was made in}} 1992, when the McGuigan's group noted the efficacy of aryloxy phosphates and phosphoramidates. In particular, diaryl phosphates were prepared from zidovudine (AZT) using simple phosphorochloridate chemistry. For the first time, the anti-HIV activity of these phosphate derivatives of AZT exceeded that of the parent nucleoside in some cases. Moreover, while AZT was almost inactive (EC50 100µM) in the JM cell line, the substituted diaryl phosphate was 10-times more active (EC50 10µM). At the time, it was considered that JM was AZT-insensitive due to poor phosphorylation. It later emerged that an AZT-efflux pump {{was the source of}} this poor AZT sensitivity. However, the conclusion remains valid that the diaryl phosphate was more able to retain activity in the JM cell line, and that this may imply a (small) degree of intracellular phosphate delivery. The electron-withdrawing power of the p-nitro groups and putative enhancements in aryl leaving group ability were suggested as the major driving force of this SAR.Subsequently, a series of aryloxy phosphoramidates of AZT was prepared with various p-aryl substituents and several aminoacids. Compounds were only studied in the AZT-resistant JM cell line to probe potential (implied) AZT-monophosphate release, and the alanine phosphoramidate emerged as strikingly effective. In HIV-1 infected JM all cultures, AZT was inhibitory at 100µM, while the phenyl methoxy alaninyl phosphoramidate was active at 0.8µM. This was taken as the first evidence of a successful nucleotide delivery. It was also noted that in other series there was a marked preference for alanine over leucine (10-fold) and glycine (>100-fold). Moreover, while electron-withdrawing aryl substitution had been noted to be very effective in the diaryl systems, it was detrimental here. Para fluoro substitution had a slight adventitious effect, but not significantly so, while para-nitro substitution led to a 100-fold loss of activity. In a subsequent studies the range of aryl substituents was extended and compounds studied in true TK+ (thymidine kinase competent) and TK- (thymidine kinase deficient) cell lines. None of the phosphoramidates retained the high (2-4 nM) potency of AZT in TK competent cell lines (CEM and MT-4) against either HIV-1 or HIV-2. However, while AZT lost all of its activity in the TK- deficient cell line CEM/TK-, most of the phosphoramidates retained antiviral activity, thus being ca >10-35-fold more active than AZT in this assay. Again, alanine emerged as an important component, with the glycine analogue being inactive in HIV-infected CEM/TK- all cultures. In this assay, leucine and phenylalanine were as effective as alanine, although they were less so in CEM/TK+ assays. Thus, the parent phenyl methoxy alanyl phosphoramidate emerged as an important lead compound.Stavudine (d4T) was an early application of the ProTide approach. This was a rational choice based on the known kinetics of phosphorylation of d4T. Thus, while the second phosphorylation (AZT-monophosphate to AZT-diphosphate) but not the first phosphorylation (AZT to AZT-monophosphate) is regarded as rate limiting for AZT activation to the triphosphate, the first step (d4T to d4T monophosphate) is thought in general to be the slow step for d4T. Thus, an intracellular (mono)nucleotide delivery should have maximal impact for d4T and similar nucleosides. In the first instance (halo)alkyloxy phosphoramidates of d4T were prepared and found to retain activity in d4T-resistant JM cells. The activity was dependent on the <b>haloalkyl</b> group; the parent propyl system being poorly active. Subsequent studies in HIV-infected CEM/TK- cell cultures revealed the aryloxy phosphoramidates of d4T to be highly effective and, notably, to retain their full activity in CEM/TK- cells. In this study the benzyl ester emerged as slightly more potent than the parent methyl compound, being almost 10-times more active than d4T in CEM/TK+ assays and thus ca 300-500 fold more active than d4T, in CEM/TK- assays.|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} of recent research on isopolyhalomethanes is presented that examines their formation, structure, properties and cyclopropanation reactions with olefins.

The carbenoid behavior of the CH 2 I-I isomer toward C=C bonds can be largely attributed to the CH 2 I +I - radical ion pair character that activates the CH 2 I moiety and the sp 2 bonding character of the C atom in the isopolyhalomethane species.

40|$|International audienceElectrochem. redn. of 4 -(ω-haloalkyl) pyridines (Py-(CH 2) n-X, X = I, Br, and Cl) in org. polar {{solvents}} {{leads to}} the efficient immobilization of pyridine at various solid electrodes (in particular at gold and different carbons). It is expected that the primarily immobilized pyridine layer (first stratum) is reactive towards the <b>haloalkyl</b> substrate in soln. to afford - esp. with iodides - multi-pyridinium layers readily electroactive {{in the course of}} electrolyzes. Similar behavior, though much slower, was obsd. for Py-(CH 2) n-Br. These exptl. evidences were applied to build different combined layers (e. g., reacting primary pyridine deposits - by simple dipping in the corresponding soln. - with different electrophilic reagents like 1 -iodoalkanes eventually labeled with ferrocene). This new modification process, supposedly extendable to many N-arom. systems, appears as a new mode of making functional multilayer or redox-active onium-type electrodes by cathodic activation of carbon-halogen bond scission.

40|$|When the {{selective}} anti-herpes agent [2 - 14 C]- 5 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 2 ’-deoxyundine ([14 C]CEDU) was administered {{as a single}} oral dose to mice, 87. 9 % of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine and 11. 2 % in the feces within 72 hr. Compounds accounting for 84 % of the 14 C radioactivity in the 0 - to 24 -hr urine were isolated by various chro-matographic techniques and identified by MS NMR, IR, and CD analysis. Approximately 25 % of the radioactivity found in the urine was the parent compound (CEDU). According to the 14 C-metabolites detected in the urine, one may infer that [14 C]CEDU is metabolized, first, by cleavage of its N-glycosidic bond, resulting {{in the formation of}} 5 -(2 -chloroethyl) uracil (38. 7 %) and, second, by stereoselective hydroxylation of the a carbon atom of the <b>haloalkyl</b> side chain of 5 -(2 -chloroethyl) uracil, resulting in the formation of 5 -(1 -hydroxy- 2 -chloroethyl) uracil (29. 6 %).

Reaction with <b>haloalkyl</b> functionalized polymers [Merrifield's resin (chloromethylated polystyrene), chloropropyl silica, chloropropyl controlled pore glass, and bromopropyl polysiloxane] gives complexes immobilized through alkylation {{of one of}} the sulfide ligands, forming a μ-thiolate ligand acting as an anchor to the polymer support, akin to well-established reactions of [Pt 2 (μ-S) 2 (PPh 3) 4] with molecular alkylating agents. The model complex [Pt 2 (μ-S) (μ-SCH 2 SiMe 3) (PPh 3) 4]PF 6 was prepared as the first molecular silicon-containing derivative of [Pt 2 (μ-S) 2 (PPh 3) 4] and was fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
