50|$|Ontario's {{electricity}} grid {{is made up}} of a 29 000 km <b>high-voltage</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>network</b> that delivers electricity to large industrial customers and municipal utilities and 123 000 km low-voltage distribution system that serves about 1.3 million end use customers mainly in rural service areas and smaller municipal communities in the province. More than 75 percent of the applications to connect small generators are in Hydro One's rural service territory along the company's distribution system. While Hydro One has connected thousands of small projects to the grid it is approaching their technical limits of the wires and equipment in some rural locations. In these areas there are two issues that limit the number of projects that Hydro One can safely connect without putting the grid in jeopardy. The first issue is the physical limits of the power lines and the second is a phenomenon called 'islanding'. In larger areas that are densely populated, Hydro One's wires are thicker and designed to deliver larger amounts of electricity. In rural areas, Hydro One's distribution wires are smaller, thinner and deliver a smaller amount of electricity because they were designed to serve a much smaller number of customers than in large urban centers. These thinner lines deliver electricity safely and reliably to rural customers and are able to support the connection of small generation projects spread across the line, but these lines become over loaded when more electricity is fed back to the grid than the line was built to deliver. In some areas where the program is extremely popular, many generators want to connect to the same thin line but the line is not able to support the transfer of so much electricity.|$|E

Subsequently, we formulate different node-attack strategies based on those centrality metrics, and empirically analyse the impact of targeted attacks on the structural and the operational performance of power grids.

40|$|Abstract—The {{spectrum}} of the Laplacian matrix of a network {{plays a key role}} in a wide range of dynamical problems associated with the network, from transient stability analysis of power networks to distributed control of formations. Using methods from algebraic graph theory and convex optimization, we study the relationship between structural features of a network and spectral properties of its Laplacian matrix. We illustrate our results by studying the influence of structural properties on the Laplacian eigenvalues of the American (western states), French and Spanish <b>high-voltage</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>networks.</b> Our study suggests that for such networks the Laplacian spectral radii and spectral moments are strongly constrained by a particular set of local structural features, namely the degree sequence and the so-called joint-degree distribution. On the other hand, other structural properties that may seem important, such as the distribution of cycles in the network, appear to have a very weak influence on the Laplacian {{spectrum of}} electrical <b>transmission</b> <b>networks.</b> We also show that local structural features are not enough to characterize the Laplacian spectral gap. Therefore, since the spectral gap is fundamental in the analysis of many dynamical processes on networks, random models in which only local structural features are prescribed are typically insufficient to generate synthetic topologies in which these dynamical pro-cesses can be studied.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} modeling approaches and algorithms for the simulation of <b>high-voltage</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>networks</b> with {{various degrees of}} accuracy and computational complexity. For the simulation of switching transients, the so-called Bergeron model {{is perhaps the most}} widely used approach as implemented in the renowned Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). Therein, the transmission line is represented as forward and backward current waves implemented using standard queues with purely algebraic boundary equations. This representation is very efficient for the calculation of switching transients; however, it is inherently a fixed-time-step approach that is not conducive to the study of longer-term transient and dynamical phenomena such as the inter-area inertial oscillations that occur following major disturbances and can lead to transient instabilities. This restriction has led to a completely separate class of computer programs, i. e. transient stability programs, in which electromagnetic transients are completely neglected. In this thesis, a new transmission line modeling structure is set forth that is able to accurately portray the high-frequency switching transients but has a dynamically changing order and structure so that, after the fast switching transients subside, the lower-frequency phenomena can be simulated using a much larger and variable time step. It is argued that the resulting transmission line structure accurately portrays switching transients and, concurrently, is much more efficient than the Bergeron model when simulating long-term transients. The significance of the proposed transmission line modeling structure is that it obviates the need for separate computer programs that focus on specific time frames. ...|$|R

Now, there is a legal serrated edge as to how and which conflicting powers of countervailing federal, state and local exercise of jurisdiction. Access to land uses for power facilities traditionally is a matter of local law and police power, and most states grant their traditional utilities the power to exercise eminent domain to take or use private property. With private stakeholders now supplanting utilities in the supply of new power, presented is the legal issue whether the power of eminent domain should be extended for use by unregulated private “merchant” independent power producers. Does such private use satisfies the required “public” purpose? In the February 2016 Republican primary debate, eminent domain became a hotly debated issue: DONALD TRUMP: “Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country, for our country. ” JEB BUSH: “…That is not public purpose, that is down right wrong. ” DONALD TRUMP: “Jeb wants to be a tough guy tonight. ” This is the emerging new issue along the serrated legal edge of government power over power, which only few states have reconciled or solved to date.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} a {{model to}} analyze the impact of recent developments of the electricity market on the national <b>high-voltage</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>network</b> from an economic perspective is developed. The purpose is to design a tool that allows including the costs induced on the network into an economic assessment {{in order to obtain}} a complete economic picture. In order to allow a reasonable application to the German electricity system and respective inferences, the concept of cost-based redispatch for network congestion relief is modeled. Furthermore, the concept of PTDF matrixes is integrated into the linear dispatch model DIANA thereby modeling the physical characteristics of electricity transmission. The model is applied to the prospective development of the German electricity system by use of a scenario analysis. By this means, the development of redispatch costs and quantities in Germany in the prospective years are highlighted. It can be shown that despite investments in the transmission infrastructure, the costs and quantities of redispatch increase in the course of time. Although the magnitude of this increase varies from scenario to scenario, a general trend of increasing costs and quantities can be observed for all scenarios. Moreover, the foreseeable development of the electricity market makes network extensions indispensable. Such network extensions, however, should not only be evaluated from a technical perspective, but should also be judged economically. As shown, the developed model can be used for such an economic assessment of investments in the transmission infrastructure. Finally, the model results show that the current German market design of cost-based redispatch becomes insufficient for resolving congestion from a technical perspective. The use of dummy redispatch in the model herbey indicates a regional shortage of generation capacity available for redispatch (or the need to curtail demand). As a consequence, the results in this dissertation reveal the necessity to change the market design in the future (e. g. by introducing price regions or a capacity market for redispatch) in order to guarantee a secure and stable functioning of the electricity system. ...|$|E
