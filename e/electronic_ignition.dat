25|$|New for the 1963 {{model year}} was an {{optional}} <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition,</b> the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic, first offered by Pontiac on some 1963 models.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E
25|$|A revised grille {{with fewer}} {{vertical}} bars and revised taillight lenses marked the 1975 Grand Prix. Changes included {{the addition of}} GM's High Energy <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> and a catalytic converter that mandated the use of unleaded gasoline. Radial tires became standard on all models.|$|E
50|$|Class 11 {{vehicles}} {{typically have}} 60-80 horsepower. Single Carburated, dual or single port. <b>Electronic</b> <b>ignitions</b> are allowed. No dry sumps. Larger oil pumps may be installed, and external coolers as well.|$|R
50|$|Renix (Renix Electronique) was a {{joint venture}} by Renault and Bendix that {{designed}} and manufactured automobile <b>electronic</b> <b>ignitions,</b> fuel injection systems, electronic automatic transmission controls, and various engine sensors. Major applications included various Renault and Volvo vehicles. The name became synonymous in the U.S. with the computer and fuel injection system used on the AMC/Jeep 2.5 L I4 and 4.0 L I6 engines.|$|R
50|$|Remington {{produced}} a 700 ML muzzleloading rifle from 1996 onward. The EtronX <b>electronic</b> primer <b>ignition</b> system was {{implemented in the}} Model 700 EtronX introduced in 2000.|$|R
25|$|The last {{evolution}} of the 2CV engine was the Citroën Visa flat-2, a 652cc featuring <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition.</b> Citroën never sold this engine in the 2CV, but some enthusiasts have converted their 2CVs to 652 engines, or even transplanted Citroën GS or GSA flat-four engines and gearboxes.|$|E
25|$|For older cars, it {{is usually}} {{possible}} to retrofit an EI system {{in place of the}} mechanical one. In some cases, a modern distributor will fit into the older engine with no other modifications, like the H.E.I. distributor made by General Motors, the Hot-Spark <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> conversion kit, and the Chrysler breakerless system.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} engine weighs {{less than}} the O-235 and incorporates a throttle body injector system with a tuned intake manifold and dual <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition,</b> or optionally a carburetor {{in place of the}} throttle body injector to save further cost and weight. The engine has a 2400-hour time between overhauls. Additional features include a lightweight 14 volt alternator, an optimized oil sump, a streamlined accessory housing, a lightweight starter and roller tappets.|$|E

50|$|The first {{reliable}} {{battery operated}} ignition {{was developed by}} Dayton Engineering Laboratories Co. (Delco) and introduced in the 1910 Cadillac. This ignition was developed by Charles Kettering and was considered a wonder in its day. Atwater Kent invented his Unisparker ignition system about this time in competition with the Delco system. By {{the end of the}} 20th century mechanical ignitions were disappearing from automotive applications in favor of inductive or capacitive <b>electronic</b> <b>ignitions</b> fully controlled engine control units (ECU), rather than directly timed to the engine's crankshaft speed.|$|R

25|$|Development resumed, {{to improve}} {{emissions}} durability and ready the engine for more stringent 1975 standards. The fuel injection was redesigned for better air distribution. High-energy <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> and mandatory catalytic converter were added; also a Pulse Air system, functionally {{the same as}} an air pump but without the pump's six-horsepower loss. A larger catalytic converter further guarded against power loss. More advanced ignition timing, and the lead-free fuel required with the converter, prevented exhaust-valve failure.|$|E
25|$|Heathkit is {{the brand}} name of kits and other {{electronic}} products produced and marketed by the Heath Company. Their products over the decades have included electronic test equipment, high fidelity home audio equipment, television receivers, amateur radio equipment, robots, <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> conversion modules for early model cars with point style ignitions, and the influential Heath H-8, H-89, and H-11 hobbyist computers, which were sold in kit form for assembly by the purchaser.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, this ballast {{resistor}} would fail and the classic symptom of this failure {{was that the}} engine ran while being cranked (while the resistor was bypassed) but stalled immediately when cranking ceased (and the resistor was reconnected in the circuit via the ignition switch). Modern <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a {{ballast resistor}} as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal operating voltage.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000 it was {{announced}} the final Reliant Robin would be built after 65 limited editions were made, it was named the [...] "Reliant Robin 65" [...] and has a very high specification. All 65s have gold metallic paint, red and grey leather seats, red carpets, walnut dashboards, white dials, minilite alloy wheels, premium stereo systems, <b>electronic</b> <b>ignitions</b> and gold plaques on the dashboards which are numbered to each individual car and have the original owners name engraved onto it, the selling price was £10,000. The last Reliant Robin produced was given away by The Sun newspaper in a Valentine's Day competition in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The Ford EDIS or <b>Electronic</b> Distributorless <b>Ignition</b> System is a {{computer-controlled}} {{ignition system}} developed by Ford that uses an ignition coil for {{each pair of}} cylinders (wasted spark). All the coils are placed in a single module called a coilpack.|$|R
50|$|The first {{amplifier}} produced was the Phase Linear 700. With 350 watts per channel it {{soon became}} the standard amplifier used in recording studios, sound reinforcement companies, professional musicians and audiophiles. It had a retail price of $749.00, or {{a little more than}} a dollar a watt. The design was notable for its brushed aluminum front panel and large dual VU meters, and was made possible by the new high-power transistors designed for the high voltages of auto <b>electronic</b> <b>ignitions.</b> That original amp was replaced by the 700B and the 700 II. All of those designs were made to have extra power to run loudly the relatively inefficient sealed-box speakers like the Acoustic Research AR3/AR3a.|$|R
25|$|Technical {{changes for}} 1975 {{included}} {{the addition of}} a catalytic converter and <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> to not only meet the stringent 1975 and later emission requirements, but also extended routine maintenance intervals, and improved fuel economy and driveability which was a must in the era immediately following the 1973–74 energy crisis, but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems and mandated the use of unleaded gasoline as the converter could be rendered useless if contaminated with lead. Axle ratios were also numerically lowered to aid in improving gas mileage. The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at , was retained as the standard and only available engine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state {{switching}} system. Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> (a {{cold cathode}} type) was tested in 1948 by Delco-Remy, while Lucas {{introduced}} a transistorized ignition in 1955, {{which was used}} on BRM and Coventry Climax Formula One engines in 1962. The aftermarket began offering EI that year, with both the AutoLite Electric Transistor 201 and Tung-Sol EI-4 (thyratron capacitive discharge) being available. Pontiac became the first automaker to offer an optional EI, the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic, on some 1963 models; it was also available on some Corvettes. The first commercially available all solid-state (SCR) capacitive discharge ignition was manufactured by Hyland Electronics in Canada also in 1963. Ford fitted a Lucas system on the Lotus 25s entered at Indianapolis the next year, ran a fleet test in 1964, and began offering optional EI on some models in 1965. Beginning in 1958, Earl W. Meyer at Chrysler worked on EI, continuing until 1961 and resulting in use of EI on the company's NASCAR hemis in 1963 and 1964.|$|E
5000|$|HSV Technologies, Inc. (Stood for {{the last}} names of the {{original}} founders, Herr, Schlesinger and Vernon; this is NOT the same company as Holden Special Vehicles), formerly of San Diego, California, USA, then Port Orchard, WA, designed a non-lethal device which was profiled in the 2002 TIME magazine article [...] "Beyond the Rubber Bullet". It is an electrolaser using ultraviolet laser beams of 193 nm, and promises to immobilize living targets at a distance without contact. There is plan for an engine-disabling variation for use against the <b>electronic</b> <b>ignitions</b> of cars using a 248 nm laser. The lead inventor, Eric Herr, died in 2008 and the company {{appears to have been}} dissolved, as their website now hosts an unrelated business (as of 9/2015) ...|$|R
50|$|The Honda CD250 is a , air-cooled, four stroke, upright twin {{motorcycle}} {{which was}} retailed by Honda in the UK from 1988 to 1993. It {{has a single}} front disc brake and a rear drum. It has two into two exhausts, together with electric starting and capacitor discharge <b>electronic</b> (CDI) <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Six-cylinder X300s are {{powered by}} the AJ16 inline-six engine, which is a further {{enhancement}} of the AJ6 engine that uses an <b>electronic</b> distributorless <b>ignition</b> system. The V12 remained available {{until the end of}} the X300 production in 1997 (although it ended one year earlier in the United States market due to problems meeting OBD-II-related emissions requirements.) ...|$|R
25|$|Unfortunately, {{the model}} was not free from shortcomings. Since 1973, the growing problem of air {{pollution}} (specially in Mexico City) forced the Mexican government to schedule the beginning of emission certification to all engines produced in the country, which would take effect in 1974. This would affect all high compression engines of all marques. For this reason, the 258 cu in six cylinder had dropped from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1 compression ratio in the change between 1973 and 1974. However, this change {{was not enough to}} comply with the government standards and VAM was forced to decrease compression even more in mid 1974. This meant a final 7.6:1 compression ratio for the 258 cu in six engine for {{the second half of the}} year production of the 1974 Rambler American Rally. For this reason, the aforementioned model along with the 1975 American Rally became the lowest performing examples of VAM's original compact sporty model, ending even below the stock 155hp 232 cu in six cylinder of the 1969 Rambler American Rally and the stock 232 1970-1972 Rambler American two-door sedans. The improvements in the form of the four-speed transmission and <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> were insufficient to overcome the problem.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} VC Commodore of March 1980 was the engine upgrading to [...] "XT5" [...] specification. Now painted blue and thus known as the Blue straight-sixes and Holden V8s, these replaced the Red units fitted to the VB and earlier cars. Changes included a new twelve-port cylinder head, re-designed combustion chambers, inlet and exhaust manifolds, a new two-barrel carburettor and a Bosch <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> system for the inline sixes. Tweaks and changes to the V8s surrounded the implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition,</b> revised cylinder head and inlet manifold design and the fitment of a four-barrel carburettor on the 4.2-litre variant. These changes brought improved efficiency, increased outputs and aided driveability. In response to increasing oil prices, a four-cylinder variant was spawned in June 1980. Displacing 1.9-litres, this powerplant known as Starfire was effectively Holden's existing straight-six with two cylinders removed. The four's peak power output of [...] and torque rated at [...] meant its performance was compromised. Reports indicate that the need to push the engine hard to extract performance led to real-world fuel consumption similar to the straight-sixes.|$|E
500|$|Alfa-Romeo’s sportscar-derived flat-12 engine had a {{capacity}} of 2995cc and employed fuel injection and <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition.</b> The engine featured a cast magnesium alloy engine block with aluminium alloy crankcase and magnesium or aluminium cylinder heads. There were four gear-driven valves per cylinder. In Formula One form by 1978 it delivered about 520bhp at 12,000rpm, about 50bhp more than the Cosworth DFV engines used by most teams, {{as well as a}} peak 324lb-ft of torque (439 N·m). [...] However the power came at the expense of greater size, increased fuel and oil consumption and about 40kg more weight. The engine was also difficult to work with, with significant variations in dimensions between units.|$|E
50|$|This {{generation}} of the Escort {{was one of the}} first Ford automobiles to feature, on the 1.9 L engine, distributorless ignition (known as EDIS, <b>Electronic</b> Distributorless <b>Ignition</b> System). It also featured a new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission, as well as an independent rear suspension, both (at the time) relatively uncommon in cars in this class.|$|R
5000|$|Six-cylinder X300s are {{powered by}} the AJ16 inline-six engine, which is a further {{enhancement}} of the AJ6 engine that uses an <b>electronic</b> distributorless <b>ignition</b> system.

50|$|In 1988 {{the second}} {{generation}} of the Valencia unit was launched to meet with tightening European emissions legislation. The redesign included an all-new cylinder head with reshaped combustion chambers and inlet ports, and a fully <b>electronic</b> distributorless <b>ignition</b> system. The engine was renamed the Ford HCS (standing for High Compression Swirl), although some internal Ford service publications call it the Valencia-HCS in reference to its heritage.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 21st century digital <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> modules became {{available}} for small engines on such applications as chainsaws, string trimmers, leaf blowers, and lawn mowers. This was made possible by low cost, high speed, and small footprint microcontrollers. [...] Digital <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> modules can be designed as either capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) or inductive discharge ignition (IDI) systems. Capacitive discharge digital ignitions store charged energy for the spark in a capacitor within the module that can be released to the spark plug at virtually any time throughout the engine cycle via a control signal from the microprocessor. This allows for greater timing flexibility, and engine performance; especially when designed hand-in-hand with the engine carburetor.|$|E
2500|$|However it is {{necessary}} to check periodically the maximum opening gap of the breaker(s), using a feeler gauge, since this mechanical adjustment affects the [...] "dwell" [...] time during which the coil charges, and breakers should be re-dressed or replaced when they have become pitted by electric arcing. This system was used almost universally until the late 1970s, when <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> systems started to appear.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 Astre, {{introduced}} in the United States September 1974, gave U.S. Pontiac dealers a needed fuel efficient subcompact. A budget [...] "S" [...] series was added during 1975. More than 267 changes were made including new High-energy <b>electronic</b> <b>ignition</b> system and a catalytic converter. Power brakes and a tilt steering wheel were new options. The Astre panel delivery was discontinued {{the end of the}} model year.|$|E
5000|$|HCCI engines {{have a long}} history, {{even though}} HCCI {{has not been as}} widely {{implemented}} as spark ignition or diesel injection. It is essentially an Otto combustion cycle. HCCI was popular before <b>electronic</b> spark <b>ignition</b> was used. One example is the hot-bulb engine which used a hot vaporization chamber to help mix fuel with air. The extra heat combined with compression induced the conditions for combustion. Another example is the [...] "diesel" [...] model aircraft engine.|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{operating}} {{performance of the}} <b>electronic</b> control <b>ignition</b> system and meet the requirement of the experiment teaching, an <b>electronic</b> control <b>ignition</b> system based on Lab VIEW and micro-controller was developed in this study. The system was composed of the ignition control circuit, signal processing circuits of various sensors and system software, which combined the functions of data acquisition, analysis and control. According to the working principle of the ignition system and working parameters, the cylinder block temperature signal, throttle position signal and power supply voltage signal were used as the correction references for the ignition advance angle. So the processing circuits of the sensors were designed based on {{the selection of the}} sensors and analysis their working principle or characteristic. The software of the host computer was visual and easy to control the slave computer, which realized the control for the ignition timing and dwell time. The experiment results indicated that the system developed in this study was reliable and that the data communication between the host computer and the slave computer reached the expected requirement. The research results provided a foundation for the further study and performance optimization...|$|R
