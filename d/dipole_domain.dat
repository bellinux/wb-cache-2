40|$|Nonlinear {{transport}} through diluted {{magnetic semiconductor}} nanostructures is investigated. We have considered a II–VI multiquantum well nanostructure whose wells are selectively doped with Mn. The {{response to a}} dc voltage bias may be either a stationary or an oscillatory current. We have studied the transition from stationary to time-dependent current {{as a function of}} the doping density and the number of quantum wells. Analysis and numerical solution of a nonlinear spin transport model shows that the current in a structure without magnetic impurities is stationary, whereas current oscillations may appear if at least one well contains magnetic impurities. For long structures having two wells with magnetic impurities, a detailed analysis of nucleation of charge <b>dipole</b> <b>domains</b> shows that self-sustained current oscillations are caused by repeated triggering of <b>dipole</b> <b>domains</b> at the magnetic wells and motion towards the collector. Depending on the location of the magnetic wells and the voltage, <b>dipole</b> <b>domains</b> may be triggered at both wells or at only one.

We have investigated the dynamics of electrons in a superlattice submitted to both a static voltage and a microwave field by performing a simulation based on a drift-diffusion model and incorporating current-limiting boundary conditions. The motion of electrons in the superlattice was governed by an Esaki–Tsu drift velocity field characteristic with a negative differential mobility above a critical electrical field. The simulation delivered, for a static voltage larger than a critical voltage, the periodic formation and annihilation of propagating <b>dipole</b> <b>domains</b> and, as a consequence, a reduction of the direct current through the superlattice. Our simulation showed that an additional microwave field can periodically induce and subsequently quench domains giving rise to a strongly anharmonic current. The anharmonicity of the current is the origin for the generation of higher harmonics of the microwave field. Both the formation and annihilation of a domain can take place within a time of about 1 ps suggesting that the mechanism of domain induction and quenching {{can be used for}} generation of radiation up to almost 1 THz...|$|R

40|$|Summary In {{the search}} for a model with non-dissipative {{currents}} for the excitation of the Earth’s magnetic ¢eld, stationary <b>dipole</b> <b>domains</b> are found to exist under high pressure. With such domains in an onion-like structure {{as a model for the}} iron-rich core, the Earth’s magnetic ¢eld can be calculated with acceptable accuracy. The magnetic dipole moment is predicted to be proportional to the angular velocity, the core-radius to the fourth power and to the square root of the pressure at the core radius. Field reversal may be explained by a low-loss reversal of dipole orientation, keeping the sta-tionary energy level constant. An application of the theory to other pla-nets yields magnetic ¢elds in the observed order of magnitude with the exception of Mars and Venus, whose magnetic ¢elds are grossly over-estimated; in the case of Mars presumably caused by a drop in energy content of the core, in the case of Venus possibly due to the extremely slow rotation causing hydrodynamic e¡ects to prevent the synchronous rotation of the charges.

40|$|A self-consistent, full-band, {{electrothermal}} ensemble Monte Carlo device simulation tool {{has been}} developed. It {{is used to}} study charge transport in bulk GaN, and to design, analyze, and improve the performance of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) and avalanche photodiodes (APDs). Studies of electron transport in bulk GaN show that both peak electron velocity and saturated electron velocity are higher for transport in the basal plane than along the c-axis. Study of the transient electron velocity also shows a clear transit-time advantage for electron devices exploiting charge transport perpendicular to the c-axis. The Monte Carlo simulator also enables unique studies of transport {{under the influence of}} high free carrier densities but with low doping density, which is the mode of transport in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Studies of isothermal charge transport in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs operating at high gate bias show a drain current droop with increasing drain-source bias. The cause of the droop is investigated and a design utilizing source- or gate-connected field plate is demonstrated to eliminate the drain current droop. Electrothermal aspects of charge transport in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs are also investigated, and the influence of non-equilibrium acoustic and optical phonons is quantified. The calculated spatial distribution of non-equilibrium phonon population reveals a hot spot in the channel that is localized at low drain-source bias, but expands towards the drain at higher bias, significantly degrading channel mobility. Next, Geiger mode operation of wurtzite GaN-based homojunction APDs is investigated. The influences of dopant profile, active region thickness, and optical absorption profile on single photon detection efficiency (SPDE) are quantified. Simulations of linear mode gain as a function of multiplication region thickness and doping profile reveal that weakly n-type active regions may be exploited to achieve higher avalanche gain, without penalty to either applied bias or active region thickness. A separate absorption and multiplication APD (SAM-APD) utilizing a AlGaN/GaN heterojunction is also investigated. The presence of strong piezo-electric and spontaneous polarization charges at the heterojunction enables favorable electric field profile in the device to reduce dark current, improve excess noise factor, improve quantum efficiency, and improve breakdown probability. To maximize SPDE, a new device structure with a buried absorber is proposed and improved SPDE is demonstrated. Lastly, a new approach for the direct generation of self-sustaining millimeter-wave oscillations is proposed. In contrast to Gunn diodes, which exploit a bulk-like active region, periodic oscillation is achieved in the proposed structures through the creation, propagation and collection of traveling <b>dipole</b> <b>domains</b> supported by fixed polarization charge and the associated two-dimensional electron gas along the plane of a polar heterojunction.

40|$|The {{observation}} {{of a very}} sharp low frequency spike in the hyper-Rayleigh spectrum (HRS) of strongly dipolar fluids, such as acetonitrile and water, has been interpreted as reflecting a very slowly relaxing component in the transverse dipole density.

The BaTiO 3 systems exhibit 180 o periodic stripe domains at null electric field, as in PZT ultrathin films. However, the stripes alternate along [1 - 10] in BTO systems versus [010] in PZT systems, and no in-plane surface dipoles occur in BTO ultrathin films (unlike in PZT materials). Moreover, {{the evolution of the}} 180 o stripe domains in the BaTiO 3 systems, when applying and increasing an electric field along [001], involves four regions: Region I for which the magnitude of the down dipoles (i. e., those that are antiparallel to the electric field) is reduced, while the domain walls do not move; Region II in which some local down <b>dipoles</b> adjacent to <b>domain</b> walls switch their direction, resulting in zigzagged domain walls - with the overall stripe periodicity being unchanged; Region III in which nanobubbles are created, then contract along [110] and finally collapse; and Region IV which is associated with a single monodomain.

40|$|International audienceThe {{importance}} of estimating spatially variable aquifer parameters such as transmissivity is widely recognized for studies in resource evaluation and contaminant transport. A useful approach for mapping such parameters is inverse modeling {{of data from}} series of pumping tests, that is, via hydraulic tomography. This inversion of field hydraulic tomographic data requires development of numerical forward models that can accurately represent test conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. One issue this presents is specification of boundary and initial conditions, whose location, type, and value may be poorly constrained. To circumvent this issue when modeling unconfined steady-state pumping tests, we present a strategy that analyzes field data using a potential difference method and that uses dipole pumping tests as the aquifer stimulation. By using our potential difference approach, {{which is similar to}} modeling drawdown in confined settings, we remove the need for specifying poorly known boundary condition values and natural source/sink terms within the problem <b>domain.</b> <b>Dipole</b> pumping tests are complementary to this strategy in that they can be more realistically modeled than single-well tests due to their conservative nature, quick achievement of steady state, and the insensitivity of near-field response to far-field boundary conditions. After developing the mathematical theory, our approach is first validated through a synthetic example. We then apply our method to the inversion of data from a field campaign at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site. Results from inversion of nine pumping tests show expected geologic features, and uncertainty bounds indicate that hydraulic conductivity is well constrained within the central site area...|$|R

Debye and W. Ramm has been made. Time-domain measurements of the dielectric relaxation of six homogeneous polymers have been analysed using the stretched exponential function exp[-(t/. tau.).. beta. ] to describe the dipole relaxation component. The parameter b was found to vary from about 0. 2 at low temperatures to about unity for higher temperatures. The lower value indicates strong correlation between the relaxing dipoles while. BETA. = 1 is characteristic of independently relaxing <b>dipoles.</b> Frequency <b>domain</b> studies of epoxy matrices loaded with barium titanate with and without carbon black as well as with coated carbon or coated copper fibres were also carried out. Due to interfacial polarization, the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity, Re(e*) and Im(e*), of the composites were far higher than those of the matrix itself. In the case of the epoxy-barium titanate system addition of 4. 5 vol% carbon black resulted in a great increase in both Re(e*) and Im(e*). Higher concentrations of carbon black had the effect of short-circuiting the interfacial polarization. In the case of the epoxy-carbon fibre and epoxy-copper fibre systems the fibres were coated with insulating epoxy prior to mixing with the epoxy matrix, thus drastically reducing direct electrical contact between the fibres. The resistivities of the composites thus remained high. The concept of a spectrum of relaxation times was investigated {{in the context of a}} dipole-dipole interaction under the influence of an external field. In particular, the formulation of P. Debye and W. Ramm as embodied in their rate equation was analysed in detail. It was found that in contrast to the assumptions of Debye and Ramm the rate equation has no complete set of eigenfunctions due to the lack of self-adjointness. In fact the solutions proposed by Debye and Ramm can be shown not to satisfy their rate equation. Good approximate solutions were obtained using Fourier integral operators. Numerical analysis of those solutions showed that they are unphysical, that is, they lead to results that are contrary to experimental facts. This indicates that the original rate equation proposed by Debye and Ramm does not give a physically correct description of nature. However, in spite of some attempts "repair" of the rate equation has been unsuccessful as yet. The main conclusion to be drawn from this work is that there are wide gaps in our knowledge of the dielectric {{characteristics of}} polymers and polymer-based composites.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that quadratic nonlinear processes, such as parametric generation or amplification, {{require the use}} of materials {{with a high degree of}} ordering. In some occasions, such ordering is found at a nanoscale, and in other cases, the order is at a micron scale. When such ordering is not intrinsic to the material, one may introduce a periodical distribution within the nonlinear material to, for instance, compensate the phase mismatch. In that event, the final material would be, in general, composed of two types of domains, distributed periodically across the entire material, one with a given nonlinear coefficient, and the other with the same coefficient with opposite sign. In principle, one would expect that small deviations from the adequate period, or some dispersion in the size of the domains, would lead to a cancellation of the coherent nonlinear process of three wave mixing. However, very recently, it was observed that with polycrystalline samples fabricated with a random orientation of zinc selenide (ZnSe) crystalline domains, when the average size of the domains was close to one coherence length (lcc), difference frequency generation grew linearly with the total length of the sample. Similar observations were reported some years ago from SBN needlelike crystalline domains and with the use of rotationally twinned crystals of ZnSe. In all these observations, the efficiency of the process seemed to be strongly linked to an average size of the domain close to the optimal value for quasi-phase matching with periodical inverted domains. In the present work, we study the process of phase matching to compensate the material dispersion in refractive index in materials where there is no structural ordering. We consider, here, one-dimensional (1 -D) structures composed of planar layer domains with a well-defined orientation of the nonlinear susceptibility within the domain. Such domains, however, are randomly ordered and their thickness may vary - - with a Gaussian distribution around a given average size. In other words, the entire structure exhibits no ordering with respect to the orientation of the <b>dipoles</b> and the <b>domains</b> are allowed to have any possible thickness. Contrary to what one could expect, we observe that an increase in the amount of disorder is not necessarily detrimental with respect to the efficiency of a second harmonic generation (SHG) process. Moreover, the linear growth of the second harmonic (SH) intensity with respect to the number of domains is seen when the average size of the domains is close to one lc, but also, for any other average thickness of such domains. We are able to establish a clear link between the disorder inherent to the structure and the linear growth of the intensity with respect to the number of domains. It is also possible to obtain such type of nonlinear processes in random media where there is an index contrast between the several nonlinear domains. Recently significant progress has been made in the development in structured nonlinear materials. In the present paper we will review the performance of some of these nonlinear photonic materials that, eventually, could be implemented in a disordered configuration where the proposals of the present work could be experimentally tested. 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Part I Electrochemical charge {{transfer}} at a metallic electrode: a simulation study The factors which affect {{the rate of}} heterogeneous electron transfer at a metallic electrode {{in the context of}} Marcus theory are investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. The system consists of the ionic melt K 3 Eu 2 + 0 : 5 Eu 3 + 0 : 5 Cl 5 : 5 sandwiched between two parallel plate platinum electrodes held at a preset electrical potential. The charges on the electrode atoms are variationally obtained through the method of Siepmann and Sprik [J. Chem. Phys. 102, 511 (1995) ] which models the polarization of the electrode by the melt and maintains the condition of constant potential. A two-dimensional Ewald summation is employed to ensure that the absolute value of the potential is known, and the expressions derived by Kawata and Mikami [Chem. Phys. Lett. 340, 157 (2001) ] are extended to allow for induced dipoles on the melt ions by their mutual interaction and the interaction with the electrode surface. The Marcus free energy curves are calculated for electron transfer events between a europium ion and the metallic electrode, and their dependence on the position of the redox ion and the applied potential examined. The system is consistently found to be in accord with the linear response regime. A moderately-ranged oscillatory character in the mean electrical (Poisson) potential is observed extending into the fluid, which is in marked disagreement with the predictions of existing mean-field (Gouy-Chapman) predictions. These oscillations are found not to be reflected in the calculated Helmholtz reaction free energy, which indicates that the Poisson potential is not the appropriate potential for discussions of the kinetics of electrode processes. The strong dependence of the reorganization energy on the position of the redox ion is traced to the image charge effect, and appears insensitive to the polarizability of the anion. Following the evolution of the Eu{Cl radial distribution function throughout a redox process reveals that the bond length in the transition complex is exactly in between those of the ground state reactant and product complexes. The potentials of mean force for the approach of a Eu 2 + and Eu 3 + ion to the electrode calculated through umbrella sampling are found to be in quantitative agreement with those calculated through the position-dependence of the respective concentration profiles. A method to parameterize a model of the interactions between the melt ions and the electrode surface from ab initio density functional theory calculations is described. The method is used to obtain a suitable interaction model for a system consisting of a LiCl liquid electrolyte and a solid aluminium electrode. The electrolyte is found to exhibit a potential-driven phase transition which involves the commensurate ordering of the electrolyte ions with the electrode surface; this leads to a maximum in the differential capacitance as a function of applied potential. Away from the phase transition the capacitance was found to be independent of the applied potential. Part II Are dipolar liquids ferroelectric? The observation of a very sharp low frequency spike in the hyper-Rayleigh spectrum (HRS) of strongly dipolar fluids, such as acetonitrile and water, has been interpreted as reflecting a very slowly relaxing component in the transverse dipole density. This suggestion is at variance with the expectation of dielectric theory for an isotropic fluid and has led to the speculation that the slow relaxation is associated with the reorganization of ferroelectric domains. Very large-scale molecular dynamics simulation (28000 molecules) have been carried out using a 3 -site potential model of acetonitrile. The simulated fluid shows no suggestion of strong <b>dipole</b> correlations and <b>domain</b> structure. The <b>dipole</b> density correlations behave as predicted by normal dielectric theory and their spectra do not show the low-frequency feature seen in the HRS. In order to examine the characteristics of the spectra which would be seen in a ferroelectric domain, the acetontrile model was transmuted to more closely resemble a Stockmayer-like fluid with the same dipole density and a ferroelectric phase was observed. In this phase the dielectric spectra show (i) a high-frequency spectral feature due to librational motion of the molecules within a domain, and (ii) slowly-relaxing longitudinal and transverse polar modes, again at variance from the experimental HRS characteristics.
