5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Qur'anic schools (Kuttab) were the only form of education in Bahrain. They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the Qur'an.

40|$|High-quality {{residency}} {{training is}} of utmost importance for residents to become competent medical specialists. Hospital-wide <b>education</b> <b>committees</b> have been adopted by several healthcare systems to govern postgraduate medical education and to support continuous quality improvement of residency training. To understand the functioning and potential of such committees, {{this study examined the}} mechanisms through which hospital-wide <b>education</b> <b>committees</b> strive to enable continuous quality improvement in residency training. Focus group studies with a constructivist grounded theory approach were performed between April 2015 and August 2016. A purposeful sample of hospital-wide <b>education</b> <b>committees</b> led to seven focus groups. Hospital-wide <b>education</b> <b>committees</b> strived to enable continuous quality improvement of residency training by the following mechanisms: creating an organization-wide quality culture, an organization-wide quality structure and by collaborating with external stakeholders. However, the committees were first and foremost eager to claim a strategic position within the organization they represent. All identified mechanisms were interdependent and ongoing. From a governance perspective, the position of hospital-wide <b>education</b> <b>committees</b> in the Netherlands is uniquely contributing to the call for institutional accountability for the quality of residency training. When implementing hospital-wide <b>education</b> <b>committees,</b> shared responsibility of the committees and the departments that actually provide residency training should be addressed. Although committees vary in the strategies they use to impact continuous quality improvement of residency training, they increasingly have the ability to undertake supporting actions and are working step by step to contribute to high-quality postgraduate medical educatio...|$|R

The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed {{as chairman of the}} House <b>Education</b> <b>Committee</b> in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year.

At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.|$|E
