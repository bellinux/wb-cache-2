5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive <b>feedback</b> <b>loop</b> in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive <b>feedback</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{approaches}} {{have been suggested}} over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans. Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation, dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive <b>feedback</b> <b>loop),</b> or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons. Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone. These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived {{for any of the}} weakening techniques to be practical.|$|E
40|$|<b>Feedback</b> <b>loops</b> and {{recurrent}} {{structures are}} essential to the regulation and stable control of complex biological systems. The application of dynamic as opposed to static Bayesian networks is promising in that, in principle, these <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> can be learned. However, we show that the widely applied BGe score is susceptible to learning spurious <b>feedback</b> <b>loops,</b> which are a consequence of non-linear regulation and autocorrelation in the data. We propose a non-linear generalisation of the BGe model, based on a mixture model, and demonstrate that this approach successfully represses spurious <b>feedback</b> <b>loops...</b>|$|R
40|$|A common {{topology}} {{found in}} many bistable genetic systems is two interacting positive <b>feedback</b> <b>loops.</b> Here we explore how this relatively simple topology can allow bistability over a large range of cellular conditions. On the basis of theoretical arguments, we predict that nonlinear interactions between two positive <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> can produce an ultrasensitive response that increases the range of cellular conditions at which bistability is observed. This prediction was experimentally tested by constructing a synthetic genetic circuit in Escherichia coli containing two well-characterized positive <b>feedback</b> <b>loops,</b> linked in a coherent fashion. The concerted action of both positive <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> resulted in bistable behavior over {{a broad range of}} inducer concentrations; when either of the <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> was removed, the range of inducer concentrations at which the system exhibited bistability was decreased by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, bistability of the system could be tuned by altering growth conditions that regulate the contribution of one of the <b>feedback</b> <b>loops.</b> Our theoretical and experimental work shows how linked positive <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> may produce the robust bistable responses required in cellular networks that regulate development, the cell cycle, and many other cellular responses...|$|R
50|$|TSH {{secretion}} is also {{controlled by}} {{thyrotropin releasing hormone}} (thyroliberin, TRH), whose secretion itself is again suppressed by plasma T4 and T3 in CSF (long <b>feedback,</b> Fekete-Lechan <b>loop).</b> Additional <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> are ultrashort <b>feedback</b> control of TSH secretion (Brokken-Wiersinga-Prummel <b>loop)</b> and linear <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> controlling plasma protein binding.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of technology {{by the human}} race has allowed the greater exploitation {{of natural resources and}} has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex <b>feedback</b> <b>loop</b> between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood. Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loop</b> of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Phenotypic traits can be {{displayed}} in one sex and desired {{in the other}} sex, causing a positive <b>feedback</b> <b>loop</b> called a Fisherian runaway, for example, the extravagant plumage of some male birds such as the peacock. An alternate theory proposed by the same Ronald Fisher in 1930 is the sexy son hypothesis, that mothers want promiscuous sons to give them large numbers of grandchildren and so choose promiscuous fathers for their children. Aggression between {{members of the same}} sex is sometimes associated with very distinctive features, such as the antlers of stags, which are used in combat with other stags. More generally, intrasexual selection is often associated with sexual dimorphism, including differences in body size between males and females of a species.|$|E
30|$|Negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> play a {{determinant}} role in {{the dynamics}} of a network. For example, it has been conjectured that negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> are necessary for sustained oscillations [9, 58]. In particular, {{in the context of}} Boolean networks, {{it has been shown that}} as the number of independent negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> increases, the number of limit cycles tends to decrease while their length tends to increase [62].|$|R
50|$|Uncovering {{leverage}} points involves understanding <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> {{that link}} variables, or factors, that cause behavior in other variables. <b>Feedback</b> <b>loops</b> are either self-reinforcing (good or bad) or goal-seeking (seeking equilibrium). Synthesis of improved {{courses of action}} arises from mitigating bad (vicious circles) self-reinforcing <b>feedback</b> <b>loops,</b> exploiting good (virtuous circles) and goal-seeking <b>feedback</b> <b>loops,</b> and iteratively optimizing them, typically using parameter-driven simulations. Leverage point models accomplish this simulation capability in software tools that follow system dynamics conventions. These conventions capture model structure and attach algebraic relationships to all the variables appearing in a diagram, including time span and steps.|$|R
30|$|Balancing and {{reinforcing}} feedbacks at the band level may scale {{up to the}} next hierarchy, the subgenre level of metal. When balancing <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> dominate over reinforcing <b>feedback</b> <b>loops,</b> the whole subgenre is likely to persist and further develop. If the relationship is inverse, a subgenre likely disappears. Balancing {{and reinforcing}} <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> have influenced metal subgenres distinctly. For example, many subgenres see a rapid diversification into derivative styles, based on the constant recalibration resulting from learning that balances <b>feedback</b> <b>loops.</b> For instance, alternative metal diversified into nu metal and funk metal, and death doom, drone metal, funeral doom, and sludge metal derived from doom metal (TableÂ  2). The New Wave of British Heavy Metal that peaked between 1975 and 1985 and which has seen posterior reformation exemplifies that <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> can change over time.|$|R
5|$|The largest {{scale of}} {{ecological}} organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate {{all the way}} up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent <b>feedback</b> <b>loop</b> generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing <b>feedback</b> <b>loop,</b> as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and linolenic acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a <b>feedback</b> <b>loop,</b> amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that cell signaling networks have been evolved to be robust against perturbations. To investigate the topological characteristics resulting in such robustness, we have examined large-scale signaling networks {{and found that}} a number of <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> are present mostly in coupled structures.

Results: We have investigated the role of such coherently coupled <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> through extensive Boolean network simulations and found that a high proportion of coherent couplings can enhance the robustness of a network against its state perturbations. Moreover, we found that the robustness achieved by coherently coupled <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> can be kept evolutionarily stable. All these results imply that the coherent coupling of <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> might be a design principle of cell signaling networks devised to achieve the robustness. Contact...|$|R

40|$|Coupled {{positive}} and negative feedback circuits form an essential building block of cellular signaling pathways Dongsan Kim, 1 Yung-Keun Kwon, 1, 2 and Kwang-Hyun Cho 1, 2 * Summary Cellular circuits have {{positive and}} negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> {{that allow them to}} respond properly to noisy external stimuli. It is intriguing that such <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> exist in many cases in a particular form of coupled {{positive and negative}} <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> with different time delays. As a result of our mathematical simulations and investigations into various experimental evidences, we found that such coupled feedback circuits can rapidly turn on a reaction to a proper stimulus, robustly maintain its status, and immediately turn off the reaction when the stimulus disappears. In other words, coupled <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> enable cellular systems to produce perfect re-sponses to noisy stimuli with respect to signal duration and amplitude. This suggests that coupled positive and negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> form essential signal transduc-tion motifs in cellular signaling systems. BioEssay...|$|R
40|$|<b>Feedback</b> <b>loops</b> play an {{important}} role in determining the dynamics of biological networks. In order to study the role of negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loops,</b> this paper introduces the notion of âdistance to positive feedback (PF-distance) â which in essence captures the number of âindependent â negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> in the network, a property inherent in the network topology. Through a computational study using Boolean networks it is shown that PF-distance has a strong influence on network dynamics and correlates very well with the number and length of limit cycles in the phase space of the network. To be precise, it is shown that, as the number of independent negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> increases, the number (length) of limit cycles tends to decrease (increase). These conclusions are consistent with the fact that certain natural biological networks exhibit generally regular behavior and have fewer negative <b>feedback</b> <b>loops</b> than randomized networks with the same numbers of nodes and connectivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} to enter mitosis is mediated by {{a network of}} proteins that regulate activation of the cyclin BâCdk 1 complex.
