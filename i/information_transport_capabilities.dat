40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{significant}} and increasing interest in ad hoc wireless networks. The design, analysis and deployment of such wireless networks necessitate a fundamental understanding of how much information transfer they can support, as well as what the appropriate architectures and protocols are for operating them. This monograph addresses these questions by presenting various models and results that quantify the <b>information</b> <b>transport</b> <b>capability</b> of wireless networks, as well as shed light on architecture design from a high level point of view. The models take into consideration important features such as the spatial distribution of nodes, strategies for sharing the wireless medium, the attenuation of signals with distance, and how information is to be transferred, whether it be by encoding, decoding, choice of power level, spatio-temporal scheduling of transmissions, choice of multi-hop routes, or other modalities of cooperation between nodes.

Our data-hungry society has driven enormous {{progress in the}} Si electronics industry and we have witnessed a continuous progression towards smaller, faster, and more efficient electronic devices {{over the last five}} decades. The scaling of these devices has also brought about a myriad of challenges. Currently, two of the most daunting problems preventing significant increases in processor speed are thermal and signal delay issues associated with electronic interconnection 1 - 3. Optical interconnects, on the other hand, possess an almost unimaginably large data carrying capacity, and may offer interesting new solutions for circumventing these problems 4, 5. Optical alternatives may be particularly attractive for future chips with more distributed architectures in which a multitude of fast electronic computing units (cores) need to b...|$|R

We describe the cross section generation procedure and compare it to existing methods used to obtain discrete cross sections. The numerical approach presented here is generalized to allow greater flexibility in choosing a cross section model from which to derive discrete values. Cross section data computed with this method compare favorably with discrete data generated with an existing method. Additionally, a charged particle <b>transport</b> <b>capability</b> is demonstrated in the time-dependent Implicit Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, Milagro.

30|$|Most recently, it {{was found}} that when {{nanoparticles}} [13, 14] were added into the base fluid in an OHP, the heat <b>transport</b> <b>capability</b> can be increased. The thermally excited oscillating motion in the OHP helps suspend some types of particles in the base fluid that would otherwise settle out of solution. Although nanoparticles added on the base fluid cannot greatly increase the thermal conductivity [14], the oscillating motion of particles in the fluid might have an additional contribution to the heat transfer enhancement beyond enhancing thermal conductivity. Ma et al. [13, 14] charged the nanofluids (HPLC grade water and 1.0 vol.% diamond nanoparticles of 5 - 50 nm) into an OHP and found that the nanofluids significantly enhance the heat <b>transport</b> <b>capability</b> of the OHP. The investigated OHP charged with diamond nanofluids can reach a thermal resistance of 0.03 °C/W at a power input of 336 W. Lin et al. [15] charged silver nanofluids with a diameter of 20 nm into an OHP and confirmed that the nanofluids can improve the heat <b>transport</b> <b>capability</b> of OHPs. With a filling ratio of 60 %, their OHP can achieve a thermal resistance of 0.092 °C/W. Qu et al. [16] conducted an investigation of the effect of spherical 56 -nm alumina nanoparticles on the heat <b>transport</b> <b>capability</b> in an OHP, and found that the alumina particles can enhance heat transfer and there exists an optimal mass fraction. Although these investigations have demonstrated that the particles can enhance heat transfer in an OHP, it is not known whether there exists an optimum particle shape for a given type of particles.|$|R
