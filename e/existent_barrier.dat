40|$|Structural {{behavior}} and {{equation of state}} of atomic and molecular crystal phases of dense hydrogen at pressures up to 3. 5 TPa are systematically investigated with density functional theory. The {{results indicate that the}} Vinet EOS model that fitted to low-pressure experimental data overestimates the compressibility of dense hydrogen drastically when beyond 500 GPa. Metastable multi-atomic molecular phases with weak covalent bonds are observed. When compressed beyond about 2. 8 TPa, these exotic low-coordinated phases become competitive with the groundstate and other high-symmetry atomic phases. Using nudged elastic band method, the transition path and the associated energy barrier between these high-pressure phases are evaluated. In particular for the case of dissociation of diatomic molecular phase into the atomic metallic Cs-IV phase, the <b>existent</b> <b>barrier</b> might raise the transition pressure about 200 GPa at low temperatures. Plenty of flat and broad basins on the energy surface of dense hydrogen have been discovered, which should take a major responsibility for the highly anharmonic zero point vibrations of the lattice, as well as the quantum structure fluctuations in some extreme cases. At zero pressure, our analysis demonstrates that all of these atomic phases of dense hydrogen known so far are unquenchable. NOTE: In the previous version of this paper (1010. 3392 v 1) we made a mistake when evaluating the enthalpy of Cs-IV phase, which misled us to a conclusion that taking the multi-atomic molecular phases as the ground-state. After corrected this error, however, the atomic phase of Cs-IV becomes the static structure with the lowest enthalpy. Current version not only includes a substantial improvement of the previous one, but also contains many NEW interesting topics that were not touched before.

40|$|There {{are many}} factors which impart the {{globalization}} dynamics: the more accelerated liberalization tendencies of commercial exchanges, the development, without precedent, {{of the capital}} markets which claim a bigger liberty of movement, the internationalization of production and distribution of the great trans-national societies, the huge leap of service commerce and – finally – the means provided by the quick progresses {{in the field of}} technologies. Globalization provides – on new dimensions – opportunity for some wider markets, the possibility of producing and marketing a larger range of goods, increasing chances for attracting capitals and for access the high technologies.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to empirically examine the determinants of bilateral trade of Macedonia, with particular emphasis on the trade with the EU and CEFTA- 2006 countries. The standard Gravity model is used to measure the determinants of the bilateral trade in a panel framework. Results suggest that Macedonian GDP per capita and foreign GDP per capita play significant role in explaining bilateral trade. When Macedonian trade with EU is investigated only, then domestic income has larger magnitude than compared to the entire sample. Importantly, no additional gains have been approximated from FTAs and from CEFTA- 2006, in particular. Potential explanation of this can be the still <b>existent</b> non-tariff <b>barriers</b> across the SEE countries, in terms of the technical, sanitary and phyto-sanitary barriers to trade, the time and costs to export and import, improvement of infrastructure related to trade and so on. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{irrefutable}} experimental evidence has shown that Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) occur in specialized heavy hydrogen systems [1 - 4]. Nevertheless, we are still confronted with a problem: the theoretical basis of LENR are not known and, {{as a matter of}} fact, little research has been carried out on this subject. In this work we seek to analyse the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of Preparata’s model of the palladium lattice [5, 15]. We will also show the occurrence probability of fusion phenomena according to more accurate experiments [6]. We are not going to use any of the research models which have been previously followed in this field. Our aim is to demonstrate the theoretical possibility of cold fusion. Moreover, we will focus on tunneling the <b>existent</b> Coulomb <b>barrier</b> between two deuterons. Analysing the possible contributions of the lattice to the improvement of the tunneling probability, we find that there is a real mechanism through which this probability could be increased: this mechanism is the screening effect due to d-shell electrons of palladium lattice. The accordance between theoretical and experimental results will prove the reality of cold fusion phenomena and show the reliability of our model. 1...|$|R

Even with this early start, however, sport psychology organisations in Brazil still have important issues to address. We will discuss the past and current status of the field in Brazil and propose future directions using a strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Brazil Sport and Exercise Psychology (SEP) field is in a stage of development both in applied practice and in research. A strength in the field in Brazil is that SEP is a recognised specialist field of psychology and there are clear pathways for the accreditation. Nevertheless, there are problems in the educational system (undergraduate and postgraduate levels) that hindered the accreditation process. There are a good number of sport psychologists working in applied work. However, due to the above mentioned issues with the accreditation process the standard of service delivery is not ensured. The weaknesses in the educational system not only has an effect on the applied practice, but it also influences the research in SEP in Brazil. The Brazilian research output in international journals is limited due to the <b>existent</b> language <b>barrier</b> and a system of evaluation of scientific journals that does not incentive this type publication. Brazil, with the upcoming Olympic Games in Rio, has a unique opportunity to conduct applied work, build research projects, and increase public awareness of the role of sport psychology in competitive sport...|$|R

This is the rea son why modalities of translation for the cinema like dubbing and subtitling have assumed a major economic importance in the home vídeo business since its appearance. Nevertheless, there are many subtitl!es thai are not as helpful for the auciience as they should be. This paper offers a contrastive analysis of the Spanish and Catalan subtitling of a Brazilian Portuguese speaking DVD titled Estómago (2007). The main purpose is to examine in detail a number of cultural barriers a translator has to overcome regarding this two less explored language pairs to be able to reach properly the Spanish and the Catalan audiences. The methodology used to develop the study was the compilation of 22 excerpts taken from the previously referred DVD and its corresponding translation into Spanish and Catalan. In order to verify if the translations are linguistically functional for the audience, they were individually analysed and assessed according to their achievements in five different aspects of cultural or contextual transferring: dialectal features, cultural references, humour and puns, language register and the use of equivalent interjections. The results, graphically presented in a table, show that despite the well-known inherent limitations of the subtitling practice and the unquestionable cultural <b>barriers</b> <b>existent</b> between these language pairs, both professionals were able to solve equally well the translation problems analysed. Yet, it is worth mentioning that the translation into Spanish scored slightly higher than the one into Catalan, which could suggest that the Catalan subtitling was based on the Spanish translation...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the efforts made in the latest years, still there is no {{comprehensive}} explanation for the chemical anomalies of globular cluster stars. Among these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values down to [O/Fe]~- 0. 4 in most clusters, but in M 13 it goes down to less than [O/Fe]~ - 1. In this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position of two different events: 1) PRIMORDIAL SELF-ENRICHMENT: this is asked to explain the oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]~ - 0. 4; 2) EXTRA MIXING IN A FRACTION OF THE STARS ALREADY BORN WITH ANOMALOUS COMPOSITION: these objects, starting with already low [O/Fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to the most extreme values. Contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing to explain the chemical anomalies, we {{suggest that it is}} active only if there is a fraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygen depleted, but also extremely helium rich (Y~ 0. 4), as found in a few GCs from their main sequence multiplicity. We propose that the rotational evolution (and an associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected {{by the fact that they}} develop a very small or non <b>existent</b> molecular weight <b>barrier</b> during the evolution. We show that extra mixing in these stars, having initial chemistry that has already been CNO processed, affects mainly the oxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance. The model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygen depletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, which reaches values close to Y= 0. 5 in the computed models. We stress that, in this tentative explanation, those stars that are primordially O [...] depleted, but ARE NOT extremely helium rich do not suffer deep extra mixing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study {{is to develop a}} greater understanding of Honduran youth’s cultural experience upon entering Canada. I have examined the interplay of acculturation, the integration process, and its overall effect {{on the development of the}} self and ethnic identity as a newly-arrived immigrant living in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Specifically, this study performs an in-depth analysis of the cultural <b>barriers</b> <b>existent</b> when a youth is first enrolled in a classe d’accueil at a French primary or secondary public school. The classe d’accueil is a preparatory class for newly arrived immigrant students who do not speak French and who have lived in Quebec for less than five years. The function of the class is the dominant educational model for immigrant students, placed under scrutiny within the context of this research. An interview-based methodology has been used to consider the experiences of five Honduran immigrant adults between the ages of 25 and 30. These individuals engage individually and confidentially in a discourse on their acculturation process within the context of both the socio-cultural and the educational realms in which they find themselves. Therefore, their new lives in Montreal, Quebec, Canada act as the basis for this thesis project. Indeed, by engaging in a comprehensive analysis of the responses provided by the interviewees, Quebec’s unique iii and complex socio-linguistic structure becomes rich grounds for understanding the doubled process of acculturation within an alien cultural milieu for these Honduran immigrants. As such, this project delves into establishing the difficulties Honduran immigrant youths face in adapting to the educational realm within the limitations of the class d’accueil and the acculturative stress that accompanies it. For each of the limitations of the classe d’accueil, the five participants from this research project experienced instances of acculturative stress that were no doubt directly correlated to their immigration and acculturation process. This study also reveals that these Honduran individuals were unprepared for their immigration and their immersion into a new cultural environment at large. As acculturative stress so commonly occurs throughout the acculturation process it is important that schools address this issue and find ways to alleviate the stressors that are often accompanied with immigration. Therefore, the data from this small study may imply that schools – that is, teachers, counselors, administrators, and even policy makers – should consider the benefits of studying theories of acculturation and acculturative stress. Understanding these theories will allow schools to reinvent the classe d’accueil in such a way that it will prioritize the needs of immigrant students, alleviate academic-related acculturative stress, and correct some of its major limitations...|$|R
40|$|O presente estudo pretende descrever o acompanhamento do processo de implementação do SAP R/ 3 no Grupo Martifer, bem como analisar o seu impacto sobre os utilizadores finais dos diversos módulos, de forma a identificar factores facilitadores e barreiras no mesmo processo. Desta forma, pretende-se contribuir para a promoção do desempenho dos indivíduos, bem como para o melhoramento do método de implementação em futuros projectos. A investigação na área dos sistemas ERP tem crescido nos últimos anos, no entanto estudos desta natureza em Portugal são extremamente reduzidos, registando-se, portanto, uma lacuna a este nível. Assim, com esta dissertação pretendeu-se encontrar informações relevantes, de forma a contribuir para o conhecimento ao nível da Gestão Industrial. Este trabalho abrangeu, na primeira etapa, o acompanhamento pessoal do processo de implementação do novo sistema; e, na segunda etapa, centrou-se no estudo do impacto do mesmo nos utilizadores finais. Para tal a amostra incluiu 67 utilizadores do SAP R/ 3, que estiveram presentes em todo o processo de implementação do sistema no Grupo Martifer, provenientes de 6 fábricas distintas. Cada inquirido respondeu a um questionário previamente elaborado e validado para este estudo. Com base nos resultados, foi possível analisar o contributo e/ou influência de diversos factores no processo de implementação do sistema SAP R/ 3. Face aos resultados obtidos, concluiu-se que de uma forma geral a implementação do sistema SAP R/ 3 no Grupo Martifer foi bem sucedida, assim como o impacto deste sobre os utilizadores. Após a implementação do sistema, os inquiridos consideram o seu trabalho mais produtivo e conseguem aceder mais facilmente à informação. No entanto, foram identificadas lacunas que deverão ser colmatadas em futuras implementações para optimização do processo, obtendo-se, desta forma, melhores resultados. Factores como a existência de uma equipa sólida de suporte ao projecto e a compreensão da implementação de um novo sistema por parte dos utilizadores finais, constituem-se como facilitadores no processo. O tempo limitado de implementação, a falta de formação aos utilizadores finais e a complexidade do sistema, surgiram como barreiras na mesma implementação. Verificou-se ainda que, através de associação entre variáveis, os utilizadores que não se sentiam preparados para iniciar a utilização do sistema SAP, necessitaram de apoio aquando da transição. Isto poderá estar relacionado com o período de formação que possivelmente não abrangeu toda a componente prática e/ou teórica, não conseguindo prever todas as dificuldades. Através do mesmo tipo de associação, conclui-se que os utilizadores que consideram o acesso à informação simplificado consideram, igualmente, que o seu desempenho no trabalho tornou-se mais produtivo com a implementação do novo sistema. ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} aims {{not only to}} {{describe}} the monitoring of the implementation of SAP R/ 3 at Martifer Group, and to analyse the impact it has over its different modules over the final users, but also to identify the <b>existent</b> facilitators and <b>barriers</b> in this process. This way, we intend {{to contribute to the}} promotion and improvement of individual performance, as well as to improve the implementation method in other future projects. The investigations in the ERP systems have been rising in the past years. Although, these kinds of studies are incredibly scarce in Portugal, there being a lack at this level. So, with this dissertation we had the intention to find some relevant information about this matter in order to contribute to the knowledge in which concerns the Industrial Management. This dissertation tried to cover, at a first step, the monitoring (in person) of the new system implementation’s process, and the second step consisted in studying the impact the system had on its final users. To make this study possible, we used a sample that included 67 users of SAP R/ 3 system, present during in the entire implementation process of the system in Martifer Group, placed in 6 different factories. Each inquired answered a questionnaire, especially created and prepared for this study. According to the results found, it was possible to analyse the contribution and/or the influence of several aspects in the implementation of the SAP R/ 3 system. Considering the results obtained we can conclude, in a general way, that the implementation of the SAP R/ 3 system at Martifer Group was well succeeded, as well as its impact on its users. After the system’s implementation, the inquired users considered, not only that their work is more productive now, but also that they have quicker and easier access to the information. Despite the advantages this system can have, we must also mention that it has some gaps that should be taken into consideration in future implementations of the system, in order to optimize it and to obtain better results through it. When we talk about the advantages of this project, we can mention the solid support team and the apprehension of the implementation of a new system by the final users. In which concerns the barriers present in the project, we can mention some, such as the limited time we had to implement it, its complexity, and the lack of training of the final users. It was also found that through the association between variables, users who did not feel prepared to start using the SAP R/ 3 system, needed support during the transition. This {{may be related to the}} period of training that may not cover all the practical component and/or theoretical, failing to foresee all the difficulties. Through the same association type, we can conclude that users which consider the simplified access to information consider, also, that their performance at work has become more productive with the implementation of the new system.
