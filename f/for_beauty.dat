5|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, city leaders debated the {{responsibility}} and expense {{of creating a}} waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s {{as a sign of}} prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. With little regard <b>for</b> <b>beauty,</b> steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.|$|E

25|$|Philip, Lord of Mirlemont, has {{announced}} a beauty contest, {{which is to}} be held in the market-place later that day, and has drawn beautiful girls from many adjoining towns.

25|$|Galef popularized {{the concept}} of Straw Vulcan, the {{incorrect}} perception about rationality {{as a way of}} thinking that denies emotions such as love and lacks appreciations <b>for</b> <b>beauty.</b> It refers to the fictional character Mr. Spock (a half-Vulcan) in Star Trek, who is often seen as a poster child for this caricature of rationality. On the contrary, Galef argues that Mr. Spock's failure to adjust his thinking, even though he experiences that humans do not always make rational decisions, is a case of irrationality. In 2011, Galef gave a talk on this subject at Skepticon.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the search}} <b>for</b> <b>beauty</b> that had {{attracted}} Metzinger to the abstract. Beauty depends {{not only on}} geometrical forms or simplified colors, but plainly beauty as it exists in itself. It wasn't just the simple result of a reductive approach to the elements of all the parts. It wasn't either just a dialectic view of everything that led him just as simply to treat each object {{as opposed to the}} other, and therefore thoroughly distinct. The blurring of differences was against the entire tenor of the whole.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Greeks {{perceived}} {{order in}} the universe, and in turn, applied order and reason to their creations. Their humanist philosophy put mankind at the centre of things, and promoted well-ordered societies {{and the development of}} democracy. At the same time, the respect for human intellect demanded reason, and promoted a passion for enquiry, logic, challenge, and problem solving. The architecture of the ancient Greeks, and in particular, temple architecture, responds to these challenges with a passion <b>for</b> <b>beauty,</b> and for order and symmetry which {{is the product of a}} continual search for perfection, rather than a simple application of a set of working rules.|$|E
25|$|Stewart grew up {{with both}} his mother and father, but his mother died {{while he was a}} {{teenager}} and his father remarried. His mother was part of the Dudgeon sept of the Noresmen. His mother was thought to be a major influence in Stewart’s life from whom he received his love and appreciation <b>for</b> <b>beauty.</b> He was a cab proprietor and later ran a farm called Pictstonhill. He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa. He told his cousin, “I shall never be satisfied till I am in Africa with a Bible in my pocket, and a rifle on my shoulder to supply my wants.” From a very young age, James Stewart knew {{what he wanted to do}} with his life: be a missionary in Africa.|$|E
25|$|A {{company profile}} from 1886: Daniel Pabst, Designer and Manufacturer of Artistic Furniture, No. 269 South Fifth Street—One {{of the leading}} and most {{successful}} designers and manufacturers of artistic furniture in Philadelphia is Mr. Daniel Pabst, whose office and manufactory are located at No. 269 South Fifth Street.

500|$|The {{style has}} evolved from the angular German Expressionism of Ward's earlier books to a softer Art Deco one. [...] He uses symbols {{throughout}} the book, such as the spinning of a spiderweb to indicate the passage of time, a fire hydrant echoing the emotions of a street riot, towering city buildings for capitalism, and flags for patriotism. [...] The most prominent symbol is a flower, representing the artist's distracted quest <b>for</b> <b>beauty</b> while he remains indifferent to the turmoil around him.|$|E

Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter.

[...] According to Broadway actress and singer Paige O'Hara, who both recorded the song and provided the voice of Belle, Ashman and Menken [...] "wanted to leave the pop music sound of Mermaid behind and go for something more Jerome Kern/Rodgers & Hammerstein" [...] <b>for</b> <b>Beauty</b> and the Beast. The film's songs and musical numbers, which were written to both [...] "propel the plot" [...] and offer [...] "character development", were heavily influenced by French, classical and traditional Broadway music. Additionally, Menken described [...] "Belle" [...] and the other Beauty and the Beast songs to The New York Times as [...] "tangents from 18th-century France".|$|E
