50|$|If {{the applied}} voltage is normal voltage then normal flux {{will be set}} up. Since iron loss is a {{function}} of applied voltage, normal iron loss will occur. Hence the iron loss is maximum at rated voltage. This maximum iron loss is measured using the wattmeter. Since the impedance of the series winding of the transformer is very small compared to that of the excitation branch, all of the input voltage is dropped across the excitation branch. Thus the wattmeter measures only the iron loss. This test only measures the combined iron losses consisting of the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> and the eddy current loss. Although the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> is less than the eddy current loss, it is not negligible. The two losses can be separated by driving the transformer from a variable frequency source since the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> varies linearly with supply frequency and the eddy current loss varies with the square.|$|E

The experimental fatigue hysteresis modulus and fatigue <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> energy degrade with increasing applied cycles attributed to transverse cracks in the 90 ° plies, matrix cracks and fiber/matrix interface debonding in the 0 ° plies, interface wear at room temperature, and interface and carbon fibers oxidation at 800 °C in air.

40|$|Assuming that {{different}} energy dissipation mechanisms {{are at work}} along hysteresis, a <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> subdivision procedure has been proposed, using the induction at maximum permeability (around 0. 8 T, in electrical steels) as {{the boundary between the}} ""low-induction`` and the ""high-induction`` regions. This paper reviews the most important results obtained in 10 years of investigation of the effect of microstructure on these components of the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss.</b> As maximum induction increases, the ""low-induction loss`` increases linearly up to 1. 2 T, while the ""high-induction loss`` is zero up to 0. 7 T and then increases as a power law with n = 5. Low-induction loss behavior is linearly related to H(c) between 0. 4 and 1. 2 T. Grain size has a larger influence on low-induction losses than on high-induction losses. Texture has a much stronger influence on high loss than on low-induction loss, and it is related to the average magnetocrystalline energy. 6. 5 %Si steel shows smaler <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> at 1. 5 T than 3. 5 %Si steel only because of its smaler high-induction component. The abrupt increase in <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loss</b> due to very small plastic deformation is strongly related to the high-induction loss component.

40|$|Stress-strain {{behaviour}} of silica filled {{styrene-butadiene rubber}} showed strong hysteresis and cyclic softening, while these effects were almost negligible for the neat rubber. Significant Mullins effect occurs {{between the first}} and second loading cycles, whereupon samples reach their steady state after four repeated cycles. The degree of softening increases with volume content of silica characterizing the softening effect as a breakdown of the filler-formed microstructure defined by both, specific interactions in the filler associations and between the filler and rubber matrix. Contribution of different damage mechanisms to the total energy losses on different stages of extension was estimated by strain dependences of the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>losses</b> for different loading cycles. At the very beginning of deformation, energy losses of the filled rubber are associated with intensive destruction of the filler associations, while under large elongations the main contribution comes from the breakage of bonds between the rubber chains and fillers and from the rubber internal viscosity. After repeated loading-unloading cycles, the material structure is practically recovered in each cycle and <b>hysteresis</b> <b>losses</b> are caused by changes in the rubbery phase only.
