40|$|Soft tissue {{artefact}} (STA), i. e. {{the motion}} of the skin, fat and muscles gliding on the underlying bone, may lead to a marker position error reaching up to 8. 7 cm for the particular case of the scapula. Multibody <b>kinematics</b> <b>optimisation</b> (MKO) {{is one of the most}} efficient approaches used to reduce STA. It consists in minimising the distance between the positions of experimental markers on a subject skin and the simulated positions of the same markers embedded on a kinematic model. However, the efficiency of MKO directly relies on the chosen kinematic model. This paper proposes an overview of the different upper limb models available in the literature and a discussion about their applicability to MKO. The advantages of each joint model with respect to its biofidelity to functional anatomy are detailed both for the shoulder and the forearm areas. Models capabilities of personalisation and of adaptation to pathological cases are also discussed. Concerning model efficiency in terms of STA reduction in MKO algorithms, a lack of quantitative assessment in the literature is noted. In priority, future studies should concern the evaluation and quantification of STA reduction depending on upper limb joint constraints...|$|E
40|$|Soft tissue {{artefacts}} (STA) introduce {{errors in}} joint kinematics when using cutaneous markers, {{especially on the}} scapula. Both segmental optimisation and multibody <b>kinematics</b> <b>optimisation</b> (MKO) algorithms {{have been developed to}} improve kinematics estimates. MKO based on a chain model with joint constraints avoids apparent joint dislocation but is sensitive to the biofidelity of chosen joint constraints. Since no recommendation exists for the scapula, our objective was to determine the best models to accurately estimate its kinematics. One participant was equipped with skin markers and with an intracortical pin screwed in the scapula. Segmental optimisation and MKO for 24 -chain models (including four variations of the scapulothoracic joint) were compared against the pin-derived kinematics using root mean square error (RMSE) on Cardan angles. Segmental optimisation led to an accurate scapula kinematics (1. 1 ° ≤ RMSE ≤ 3. 3 °) even for high arm elevation angles. When MKO was applied, no clinically significant difference was found between the different scapulothoracic models (0. 9 ° ≤ RMSE ≤ 4. 1 °) except when a free scapulothoracic joint was modelled (1. 9 ° ≤ RMSE ≤ 9. 6 °). To conclude, using MKO as a STA correction method was not more accurate than segmental optimisation for estimating scapula kinematics...|$|E
40|$|Total knee {{arthroplasty}} is {{a surgical}} procedure with high long-term reliability, yet up to {{a fifth of}} primary implant patients remains unsatisfied. This high patient dissatisfaction rate reveals that the current surgical procedure does not always result in the desired functional outcome. Total knee arthroplasty typically aims to restore an overall neutral leg alignment, such that the line going from {{the centre of the}} hip joint to the centre the ankle joint passes through the knee centre. Currently, this neutral mechanical axis is the gold standard for total knee replacement. The knee is however a complicated joint with bones and soft tissues working together to form a mobile yet stable joint. These soft tissues should be taken into account when determining the optimal implant alignment for a patient. Notably the ligaments have a significant influence on the stability of the artificial joint. At the moment, soft tissue balancing for total knee arthroplasty remains subjective and highly dependent on surgical expertise. Preoperative surgical planning has emerged as a recent trend in orthopaedic surgery. This technology is based on three-dimensional imaging data of the patient and allows the surgeon to plan his surgical approach before going into the operating room. In this PhD dissertation, the possibility to extend preoperative planning with dynamic simulations is investigated. Subject-specific simulations could provide the surgeon with a more comprehensive understanding of the functional outcome, including the behaviour of soft tissues. Many computer models of the knee exist, but validation of such models is essential before they can be applied in clinical practice. In this work, subject-specific models of four cadaveric knees were constructed from computed tomography images. The knee models were validated by comparing experimental cadaveric measures to model-based kinematics and ligament elongations. First, the native knees was mounted onto a mechanical rig to perform squatting, measuring kinematics and ligament elongations with optical markers and extensometers. Next, total knee replacement surgery was performed on each knee by inserting a posterior-stabilised implant and the same squat simulation was performed with the implanted knees. Coronal malrotation was also introduced using tibial inserts with a built-in slope. The presented model could accurately predict tibio-femoral kinematics and ligament elongations, showing excellent correlations and small root-mean-square errors in the same order of magnitude as other studies. Native knee results presented slightly higher deviations than the predictions for the implanted knee, as a consequence of some model simplifications. The model output with malaligned tibial inserts agreed well with the experimental data. A model parameter sensitivity study showed that internal-external rotation and ligament elongations were most affected by model parameter variations. Next, the feasibility of using the computational model to optimise implant position was explored. Surrogate modelling was applied to efficiently search for an optimum {{for each of the four}} specimens. Two different optimisation objectives were formulated. First, approximation of the native knee kinematics was used as a target for the optimisation routine. The implanted <b>kinematics</b> after <b>optimisation</b> resembled closely the native knee, however, the obtained optimal implant positions were unrealistic. Secondly, the aim was to approximate native knee ligament elongations. Optimisation towards native ligament elongations showed excellent resemblance of the ligament behaviour with only limited implant position adjustments. The integration of the presented robust optimisation method into the preoperative plan was demonstrated to be feasible. We conclude that the presented modelling approach is a promising candidate for allowing surgeons to evaluate the patient-specific implant alignment. The current method provides a solid starting point to enhance the integration of computational models into clinical practice and evolve towards an optimised approach for each patient. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Estimating joint {{kinematics}} from skin-marker trajectories recorded using stereophotogrammetry {{is complicated}} by soft tissue artefact (STA), an inexorable source of error. One solution {{is to use a}} bone pose estimator based on multi-body <b>kinematics</b> <b>optimisation</b> (MKO) embedding joint constraints to compensate for STA. However, there is some debate over the effectiveness of this method. The present study aimed to quantitatively assess the degree of agreement between reference (i. e., artefact-free) knee joint kinematics and the same kinematics estimated using MKO embedding six different knee joint models. The following motor tasks were assessed: level walking, hopping, cutting, running, sit-to-stand, and step-up. Reference knee kinematics was taken from pin-marker or biplane fluoroscopic data acquired concurrently with skin-marker data, made available by the respective authors. For each motor task, Bland-Altman analysis revealed that the performance of MKO varied according to the joint model used, with a wide discrepancy in results across degrees of freedom (DoFs), models and motor tasks (with a bias between - 10. 2 ° and 13. 2 ° and between - 10. 2 mm and 7. 2 mm, and with a confidence interval up to ± 14. 8 ° and ± 11. 1 mm, for rotation and displacement, respectively). It can be concluded that, while MKO might occasionally improve kinematics estimation, as implemented to date it does not represent a reliable solution to the STA issue...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{reduce the}} impact of the soft tissue {{artefact}} (STA) on the estimate of skeletal movement using stereophotogrammetric and skin-marker data, multi-body <b>kinematics</b> <b>optimisation</b> (MKO) and extended Kalman filters (EKF) have been proposed. This paper assessed the feasibility and efficiency of these methods when they embed a mathematical model of the STA and simultaneously estimate the ankle, knee and hip joint kinematics and the model parameters. A STA model was used that provides an estimate of the STA affecting the marker-cluster located on a body segment {{as a function of the}} kinematics of the adjacent joints. The MKO and the EKF were implemented with and without the STA model. To assess these methods, intra-cortical pin and skin markers located on the thigh, shank, and foot of three subjects and tracked during the stance phase of running were used. Embedding the STA model in MKO and EKF reduced the average RMS of marker tracking from 12. 6 to 1. 6 mm and from 4. 3 to 1. 9 mm, respectively, showing that a STA model trial-specific calibration is feasible. Nevertheless, with the STA model embedded in MKO, the RMS difference between the estimated and the reference joint kinematics determined from the pin markers slightly increased (from 2. 0 to 2. 1 deg) On the contrary, when the STA model was embedded in the EKF, this RMS difference was slightly reduced (from 2. 0 to 1. 7 deg) thus showing a better potentiality of this method to attenuate STA effects and improve the accuracy of joint kinematics estimate...|$|E
