40|$|Genome-scale {{metabolic}} models {{provide a}} powerful means to harness information from genomes to deepen biological insights. With exponentially increasing sequencing capacity, {{there is an}} enormous need for automated reconstruction techniques that can provide more accurate models in a short time frame. Current methods for automated metabolic network reconstruction rely on gene and reaction annotations to build draft metabolic networks and algorithms to <b>fill</b> <b>gaps</b> in these networks. However, automated reconstruction is hampered by database inconsistencies, incorrect annotations, and <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> largely without considering genomic information. Here we develop an approach for applying genomic information to predict alternative functions for genes and estimate their likelihoods from sequence homology. We show that computed likelihood values were significantly higher for annotations found in manually curated metabolic networks than those that were not. We then apply these alternative functional predictions to estimate reaction likelihoods, which are used in a new <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> approach called likelihood-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> to predict more genomically consistent solutions. To validate the likelihood-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> approach, we applied it to models where essential pathways were removed, finding that likelihood-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> identified more biologically relevant solutions than parsimony-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> approaches. We also demonstrate that models <b>gap</b> <b>filled</b> using likelihood-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> provide greater coverage and genomic consistency with metabolic gene functions compared to parsimony-based approaches. Interestingly, despite these findings, we found that likelihoods did not significantly affect consistency of <b>gap</b> <b>filled</b> models with Biolog and knockout lethality data. This indicates that the phenotype data alone cannot necessarily be used to discriminate between alternative solutions for <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> and therefore, that the use of other information is necessary to obtain a more accurate network. All described workflows are implemented as part of the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase) and are publicly available via API or command-line web interface...|$|R
40|$|In the nonhomologous end joining pathway of DNA double-strand break repair, the {{ligation}} step is catalyzed by {{a complex}} of XRCC 4 and DNA ligase IV. Extracts of CHO-K 1 cells are able to accurately rejoin a site-specific free radical-mediated double-strand break with partially complementary overhangs, by a mechanism involving alignment-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> followed by ligation. Extracts of XR- 1 cells, which lack XRCC 4 and DNA ligase IV, carried out neither <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> nor ligation. Supplementation of the extracts with recombinant XRCC 4 /ligase IV, but not with XRCC 4 alone, restored <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> and accurate end joining. The results imply that XRCC 4 and ligase IV are essential for alignment-based <b>gap</b> <b>filling,</b> {{as well as for}} final ligation of the breaks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{computer code}} which is employed for modelling of fluid flow and heat transfer during braze <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> on vacuum brazing {{has been developed}} by using SIMPLE algorithm and VOF method. By the aid of this program, the flow behavior of liquid filler metal, the location and wave of the free surface, {{as well as the}} temperature distribution can be simulated. In order to verify the computational results, experiments of vacuum brazing thin plate weldment with 0. 03 mm and 0. 2 mm braze gap have been made respectively. The result of comparisons between calculated data and experimental data show that the brazing gap {{is one of the most}} important technological parameters that influences the flow pattern of liquid filler metal during braze <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> and the brazing seam formation process significantly, and the 3 -D modelling of braze <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> are rather accurate and reliable, thereby providing a useful and effective analytic tool for brazing technological design...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{develops}} {{a new standard}} for <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> in incomplete contracts. It focuses on an important class of situations in which parties leave their agreement deliberately incomplete, {{with the intent to}} further negotiate and resolve the remaining issues. In these situations, neither the traditional no-enforcement result nor the usual <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> approaches accord with the parties' partial consent. Instead, the Article develops the concept of pro-defendant gap-fillers, under which each party is granted an option to enforce the transaction supplemented with terms most favorable (within reason) to the other party. A deliberately incomplete contract with pro-defendant gap fillers transforms into two complete contracts, each favorable to a different party, with each party entitled to enforce only the contract favorable to her opponent. Under this approach, partial consent gives rise to a correspondingly intermediate burden of liability. The Article demonstrates that this regime promotes the interests of negotiating parties who enter agreements-to-agree. It also identifies various doctrinal practices that already incorporate the pro-defendant <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> logic. ...|$|R

After studying {{the effects of}} various processes in STI (Shallow Trench Isolation) module with SAC OX free scheme on GOI, {{it was found that}} the dominant process that could degrade GOI was the STI HDP (High Density Plasma) <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> process. STI HDP <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> process could cause Si damage on AA corners, also named as AA clipping, which will result in irregular corners and hence a thinner gate oxide formation at imperfect AA corners. This was observed by a TEM (transmission electron microscopy) study. In SAC OX free scheme, the exposed AA Si corners that were damaged during the HDP process did not get consumed and repaired while they would have gotten in the scheme with SAC OX and hence degraded GOI. By optimizing the STI <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> processes and hardware configuration, the AA clipping can be greatly reduced and GOI can be improved to the required level...|$|R

40|$|Copper {{chemical}} vapor deposition using liquid coinjection of the Cu(I) precursor (hfac) Cu(TMVS) {{along with}} TMVS has been demonstrated. The coinjection of TMVS with (hfac) Cu(TMVS) stabilizes the Cu precursor until it enters the reaction chamber, allowing for better control of the deposition and faster deposition rates. Using this technique, we have grown films with as-deposited resistivities of 1. 86 {plus_minus} 0. 04 {mu}{Omega}-cm, independent of film thickness. Deposition rates of well over 100 nm/min are possible.

40|$|Although recent {{developments}} in DNA sequencing have allowed for great leaps in both {{the quality and quantity}} of genome assembly projects, de novo assemblies still lack the efficiency and accuracy required for studying genetic variation of individuals. Thus, efficient and accurate methods for calling and genotyping genetic variants are fundamental to studying the genomes of individuals. We study the problem of genotyping insertion variants. We assume that the location of the insertion is given, and the task is to find the insertion sequence. Insertions are the hardest structural variant to genotype, because the insertion sequence must be assembled from the reads, whereas genotyping other structural variants only requires transformations of the reference genome. The current methods for constructing insertion variants are mostly linked to variation calling methods and are only able to construct small insertions. A sub-problem in genome assembly, the <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> problem, provides techniques that are readily applicable to insertion genotyping. <b>Gap</b> <b>filling</b> takes the context and length of a missing sequence in a genome assembly and attempts to assemble the intervening sequence. In this paper we show how tools and methods for <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> can be used to assemble insertion variants by modeling the problem of insertion genotyping as <b>filling</b> <b>gaps</b> in the reference genome. We further give a general read filtering scheme to make the method scalable to large data sets. Our results show that <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> methods are competitive against insertion genotyping tools. We further show that read filtering improves performance of insertion genotyping especially for long insertions. Our experiments show that on long insertions the new proposed method is the most accurate one, whereas on short insertions it has comparable performance as compared against existing tools...|$|R

40|$|At low bitrates, next {{generation}} audio coders apply waveform preserving transform coding {{only for the}} perceptually most relevant parts of the signal. The resulting spectral <b>gaps</b> are <b>filled</b> in the decoder through techniques like Intelligent <b>Gap</b> <b>Filling</b> (IGF). IGF is currently being standardized in MPEG-H 3 D-Audio and also in 3 GPP Enhanced Voice Service (EVS). In IGF processing, spectral tiles are copied from a spectral source location into a target location and subsequently adapted by parameter steered post-processing to best match relevant properties of the original signal. Important properties include the spectral and temporal envelope. Since IGF operates on Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) spectra of rather long time blocks, temporal envelope shaping is not trivial. In this paper, Temporal Tile Shaping (TTS) is presented. TTS is based on linear prediction in the MDCT domain for shaping the temporal structure of the <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> signal in the target tiles with subblock granularity.

40|$|Small looped mispairs are {{corrected}} by DNA mismatch repair (MMR). In addition, a distinct process called large loop repair (LLR) corrects loops {{up to several}} hundred nucleotides in extracts of bacteria, yeast or human cells. Although LLR activity can be readily demonstrated, {{there has been little}} progress in identifying its protein components. This study identified some of the yeast proteins responsible for DNA repair synthesis during LLR. Polyclonal antisera to either Pol 31 or Pol 32 subunits of polymerase δ efficiently inhibited LLR in extracts by blocking repair just prior to <b>gap</b> <b>filling.</b> <b>Gap</b> <b>filling</b> was inhibited regardless of whether the loop was retained or removed. These experiments suggest polymerase δ is uniquely required in yeast extracts for LLR-associated synthesis. Similar results were obtained with antisera to the clamp loader proteins Rfc 3 and Rfc 4, and to PCNA, i. e. LLR was inhibited just prior to <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> for both loop removal and loop retention. Thus PCNA and RFC seem to act in LLR only during repair synthesis, in contrast to their roles at both pre- and post-excision steps of MMR.
