40|$|This thesis {{compares the}} effects of energy saving {{measures}} with Active Solar Energy Storage (ASES) on a property owned by Stena Fastigheter. The building is located in Lövgärdet in Gothenburg and {{was a part of}} the Million Homes Program. It was built in 1967, has 9 floors, a heated basement and is heated by district heating. The thermal envelope of the building consists of the walls, doors, windows, roof/attic and the basement.   ASES is a system consisting of solar panels on the roof of a building connected to the heating system. The solar energy that cannot be used immediately is stored in a ground storage unit for when it is needed. ASES can also be supplemented by geothermal heating <b>by</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>boreholes</b> into the ground and, via a Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP), using the heat in the underlying rock.   The ASES and GSHP system combined were compared to energy saving measure on the thermal envelope in terms of reducing the need for purchased energy and increasing profitability. The energy saving measures were: changing the 2 -pane windows to 3 -pane windows (either by adding a window pane or changing to a 3 -pane window), insulating the façade, insulating the attic, insulating and draining the basement, changing doors, replacing the heat exchanger with a more efficient one, and improving ventilation system. The new system, called FTX, reuses the heat from the exhaust air to save energy.   The results of the thesis show that it is difficult to make energy saving measures profitable. Of the measures evaluated, draining and insulating the basement is extremely cost effective, with a payback time of less than two years. Other profitable measures are insulating the walls (renovation costs of the wall excluded) and insulating the attic, but with a much longer payback time. The ASES and GSHP system are profitable and greatly reduced the need for purchased energy, but require a long payback time. The sum of all energy saving measures does not reduce the need for purchased energy as much, or as cheaply, as ASES, which reduced the energy usage by 62 %.   Due to limited solar panel area ASES cannot supply enough heat to cover the heat demand of the studied building. ASES is therefore believed to be better suited for the buildings that surround the evaluated building. The surrounding buildings have fewer storeys, larger roof area where solar panels can be mounted, and open areas better suited for the ground storage. The potential to implement the ASES system for buildings like these from the Million Homes Program should be evaluated further...|$|R

40|$|Drumhead Quarry, {{situated}} a few kilometres north-east of Denny in the Central Belt of Scotland, is one {{of several}} quarries in the Falkirk area which exploited the Cowie Rock, a pale-coloured sandstone in the Upper Limestone Formation (Clackmannan Group). The quarry supplied building stone from the very early 18 th century, working fairly consistently until the late 19 th century. Historical evidence indicates that the stone was primarily used locally in the Falkirk and Stirling areas, until the opening of the Union Canal in 1822 which then allowed the sandstone to be shipped to Glasgow, Linlithgow and Edinburgh, mainly for use as paving stone. Drumhead sandstone was the first ever shipment along the Union Canal in 1822, landing in Edinburgh. The quarry was worked under several different operators throughout the 19 th century and often shared the same operator as Thorneydyke Quarry (located c. 600 m to the north) {{in the latter half of}} the 1800 s. It was not uncommon for the quarry to be operated by local builders and architects, who were most likely to use the stone they were extracting from their own quarry as the main source of building material for their designed and built structures. Drumhead Quarry exposes thick-bedded sandstone with some bedding lamination and wide joint spacing, well-suited to extracting large blocks. The possibility that a unit of limestone - the Calmy Limestone - encroaches near to the quarry‘s east and north boundaries (and might limit the prospects for future expansion) has been recently tested <b>by</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>boreholes.</b> Limestone was not encountered in the drilling exercise, but units of mudstone and shale interbedded with sandstone to the east of the quarry indicate a change in the depositional environment of the sedimentary rocks in this area, and suggest the limestone might be nearby. A borehole to the north of the quarry encountered only sandstone in the bedrock, hence extending the quarry in this direction would appear to offer the best prospect of encountering good reserves of sandstone. Samples of Drumhead sandstone are quartz-rich, well compacted, and have a strong natural mineral cement resulting in a strongly cohesive (difficult to disaggregate) stone. The stone is therefore of good quality and likely to be durable. It has the potential to be a versatile building stone, suited to a range of uses including rubble walling, high quality ashlar and carving. There are two main varieties of the sandstone: a buff variety with faint-to-strong bedding lamination, and an off-white, freestone (uniform) variety. All of these factors will enhance the commercial viability of the stone. The two varieties of Drumhead stone should provide a good substitute for a number of sandstones that were formerly sourced and used widely in the Central Belt, but are now unavailable. Sandstone of this type is in particular demand in the Stirling, Glasgow and Linlithgow areas...|$|R

Similar episodes have been scientifically documented or simply reported in recent and past years. To understandwhy gases are easily entrapped in the shallow subsurface of the Fiumicino area, we used five <b>borehole</b> cores <b>drilled</b> <b>by</b> us, analyzed the stratigraphy of these and other nearby cores, acquired a 2 D seismic refraction tomogram, and performed chemical and isotopic analyses of water samples collected from aquifers intercepted <b>by</b> two <b>drilled</b> <b>boreholes.</b> Our boreholes were realized with proper anti-gasmeasures as,while drilling, we recorded the presence of pressurized gases at a specific permeable gravel level. Results showthat, in the study area, gases become mainly entrapped in a mid-Pleistocene gravel horizon at about 40 – 50 m depth. This horizon contains a confined aquifer that stores the endogenous upwelling gases. The gravel is interposed between two silty–clayey units. The lower unit, very hard and overconsolidated, is affected by fractures that allow ascending gases to bypass the otherwise impermeable shale, permeate the gravel, and dissolve into the aquifer. In contrast, the upper unit is impermeable to fluids and seals the gaspressurized aquifer, which therefore constitutes a source of hazard during human activities such as well drilling, quarrying, and various building-related excavations. As the stratigraphy of the Fiumicino area is very common in large portions of the densely populated Roman area and as the adjacent volcanic districts are hydrothermally active, we conclude that phenomena similar to that observed at Fiumicino could again occur both at Fiumicino and elsewhere in the surrounding region.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Hot Dry Rock (HDR) {{geothermal}} energy originated at Los Alamos National Laboratory {{in the early}} 1970 s, to exploit the heat contained in those vast regions of the earth's crust that contain no fluids in place—by far more widespread than natural hydrothermal resources. Two separate HDR reservoirs were created in deep, hot crystalline rock, at the Fenton Hill HDR Test site about 40 miles west of Los Alamos. These reservoirs, at depths of 2800 m and 3500 m and temperatures of 195 °C and 235 °C respectively, were created with technology that was rapidly evolving at the time. They were flow-tested {{for a period of}} almost a year each. Thermal power production ranged from 4 MW for extended routine production intervals to as high as 10 MW for a 30 -day period. The testing proved beyond a doubt that it is technically feasible to recover useful amounts of thermal energy from HDR. From tracer testing of the deeper reservoir, {{it was found that the}} flow patterns became more diffuse with time, suggesting that more of the reservoir was being accessed as flow continued—with flow definitely not tending toward short-circuiting, which had been a worry. The major finding of the work at Fenton Hill is that an HDR reservoir should first be created from the initial borehole, and then accessed by two production boreholes. It is almost impossible to create an effective system <b>by</b> <b>drilling</b> the <b>boreholes</b> first and then trying to connect them by hydraulic pressurization...|$|R
