5|$|Months earlier, before Ellie meets Joel, Ellie's friend Riley (Yaani King) surprises Ellie {{at their}} {{boarding}} school after weeks away. She reveals {{that she has}} joined the Fireflies, a revolutionary militia group, and takes Ellie to explore an abandoned shopping mall. Riley reveals {{that she has been}} assigned to a group of Fireflies in a different city, and broke the rules to see Ellie again. The girls argue, but Ellie eventually tells her that she supports her decision as it is something that Riley has wanted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Before</b> parting, Riley plugs Ellie's walkman into the sound system and dances with her. Ellie tearfully begs Riley not to leave. Riley rips her dog tags off and Ellie kisses her. Drawn by the noise, the Infected pursue Ellie and Riley; they run, but are bitten. They consider suicide, but choose to spend their final hours together.|$|E

25|$|While {{chemical}} kinetics {{is concerned}} with the rate of a chemical reaction, thermodynamics determines the extent to which reactions occur. In a reversible reaction, chemical equilibrium is reached when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal (the principle of detailed balance) and the concentrations of the reactants and products no longer change. This is demonstrated by, for example, the HaberBosch process for combining nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia. Chemical clock reactions such as the BelousovZhabotinsky reaction demonstrate that component concentrations can oscillate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> finally attaining the equilibrium.|$|E

The engine brand became Andros and the first year's production totalled 31 pieces. Until 1918 two types of Andros engines were produced: heavy types, which run 400–800 1/min, were used on fishing boats and lighter ones on sportboats.|$|E

25|$|Seed {{viability}} is {{the ability}} of the embryo to germinate and is affected by a number of different conditions. Some plants do not produce seeds that have functional complete embryos, or the seed may have no embryo at all, often called empty seeds. Predators and pathogens can damage or kill the seed while it is still in the fruit or after it is dispersed. Environmental conditions like flooding or heat can kill the seed before or during germination. The age of the seed affects its health and germination ability: since the seed has a living embryo, over time cells die and cannot be replaced. Some seeds can live <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> germination, while others can only survive for a short period after dispersal before they die.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism is a {{religious}} category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>before</b> {{there was a need}} for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non-exclusive, suggestive and tolerant in content. Most believe that the ātman (spirit, soul)—the person's true self—is eternal. In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the purusharthas (ordered from least to greatest): (i)Kāma (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii)Artha (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii)Dharma (righteousness, duty, morality, virtue, ethics), encompassing notions such as ahimsa (non-violence) and satya (truth) and (iv)Moksha (liberation, i.e. liberation from Saṃsāra, the cycle of reincarnation).|$|E

25|$|A {{precondition}} for further commercialization of GM forest trees {{is likely to}} be their complete sterility. Plantation trees remain phenotypically similar to their wild cousins in that most are the product of no more than three generations of artificial selection, therefore, the risk of transgene escape by pollination with compatible wild species is high. One of the most credible science-based concerns with GM trees is their potential for wide dispersal of seed and pollen. The fact that pine pollen travels long distances is well established, moving up to 3,000 kilometers from its source. Additionally, many tree species reproduce <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> being harvested. In combination these factors have led some to believe that GM trees are worthy of special environmental considerations over GM crops. Ensuring sterility for GM trees has proven elusive, but efforts are being made. While tree geneticist Steve Strauss predicted that complete containment might be possible by 2020, many questions remain.|$|E
25|$|The 1846 {{abolition}} in Jaipur {{was regarded}} by many British {{as a catalyst}} for the abolition cause within the Rajputana; within 4 months after Jaipur's 1846 ban, 11 of the 18 independently governed states in Rajputana had followed Jaipur's example. One paper says that in the year 1846-1847 alone, 23 states in the whole of India (not just within Rajputana) had banned sati. It was not before 1861 sati was legally banned in all princely states of India, Mewar resisting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> that time. The last legal case within princely states was from 1861 Udaipur the capital of Mewar, but as Anant S. Altekar shows, local opinion had then shifted strongly against the practice. All the widows of Maharanna Sarup Singh flatly refused to become sati when asked, and the one who was burnt with him was a slave girl. Later the same year, the general ban on sati was issued by a proclamation from Queen Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Special {{arrangements}} {{were made to}} allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the Orleans Collection mostly housed in a wing of the Palais Royal in Paris, which could be visited {{for most of the}} 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British Royal Collection remains distinct, but large donations such as the Old Royal Library were made from it to the British Museum, established in 1753. The Uffizi in Florence opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before.</b> The building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. The opening of the Musée du Louvre during the French Revolution (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.|$|E

25|$|Richard was not {{personally}} {{responsible for the death}} of his wife's first husband, Edward of Westminster (the son of Henry VI), nor that of her father, Richard Neville (the Earl of Warwick). They were killed in the battles of Tewkesbury and Barnet, respectively, which restored Edward IV to the throne. Although only eighteen years old, Richard took part in both battles, but no contemporary records indicate him as being involved directly in either death. Richard was also not {{responsible for the death of}} Henry VI, who was probably murdered on the orders of Edward IV. Richard and his wife, Anne Neville, had known each other <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> they married, having spent much of their childhood in the same household. Henry VI's widow, Queen Margaret, would not have been seen at court since the much earlier Battle of Towton, which won the throne for Edward IV for the first time; she became Edward IV's prisoner until she returned to France. Richard was not responsible for the death of his elder brother, George (Duke of Clarence), who was executed by Edward IV for treason after he had rebelled against him. Richard was in the North of England when Edward IV died; this was five years after the execution of Clarence – and after a long period of peace.|$|E
