40|$|Abstract: Air {{and rail}} {{are not only}} {{competing}} modes. Due to their different capabilities and characteristics the two modes fulfil the essential requirement of the market. The High-Speed Train <b>inter-modal</b> <b>connection</b> is inevitable to European airports in particular {{as a response to}} passenger needs. There are numerous advantages to this proposal, principally that it re-leases runway and ATC resources, offers immediate relief to congestion, reduces the nega-tive environmental impacts, and finally improves ground access to airports. In case of air travel, passengers waste at least 3 hours by travelling to airport, walking and waiting at the airport. Travelling by rail the wasted time reduces to 1 hour 10 min. Even if the time spent on train is much longer than the time spent in the air, under certain distance the total journey time is shorter if the journey is undertaken by rail. This paper indicates that high-speed train can be used to replace airline services up to 750 km’s. This distance resulted from an equation, taking into account the wasted time travelled by each transport mode and the average speed of each mode. The passenger market share of each mode depends on the passengers ’ sensitivity to differ-ent travel attributes, such as cost (journey cost, cost to and from the airport/station), time (journey time, time to and from the airport/station, walking/waiting time) and attractiveness (frequency, competition, on-board services).

40|$|Abstract: This paper studies {{pricing and}} {{investment}} decisions on a congested transport corridor where {{the elements of}} the corridor are controlled by different governments. A corridor can be an interstate highway or railway line, or an <b>inter-modal</b> <b>connection.</b> We model the simplest corridor: two transport links in series, where each of the links is controlled by a different government. Each link is used by transit as well as by local traffic; both links are subject to congestion. We consider a two stage non-cooperative game where both governments strategically set capacity in the first stage and play a pricing game in the second stage. Three pricing regimes are distinguished: (i) differentiated tolls between local and transit transport, (ii) one uniform toll on local and transit traffic, and (iii) only the local users can be tolled. Numerical analysis illustrates all theoretical insights. A number of interesting results are obtained. First, transit tolls on the network will be inefficiently high. If only local traffic can be tolled, however, the Nash equilibrium tolls are inefficiently low. Second, raising the toll on transit through a given country by one euro raises the toll on the whole trajectory by less than one euro. Third, higher capacity investment in a given region not only reduces optimal tolls in this region under all pricing regimes but it also increases the transit tolls on the other link of the corridor. Fourth, capacities in the different regions are strategic complements: when one country on the corridor increases transport capacity, it forces the other country to do the same. Fifth, we find interesting interactions between optimal capacities and the set of pricing instruments used: capacity with differentiated tolls is substantially higher than in the case of uniform tolls but overall welfare is lower. Finally, if transit is sufficiently important, it may be welfare improving not to allow any tolling at all, or to only allow the tolling of locals...|$|E

If countries can toll transit, capacity and toll competition would lead to insufficient investment and strong tax exporting behavior, so that welfare is actually higher {{in the absence of any}} tolling at all.

40|$|Air {{and rail}} are not {{necessarily}} competing modes of transport. The complementary capabilities and characteristics of these two modes together can satisfy the principal requirements of the passenger transportation market. The objective {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the necessity and importance of High-Speed Train <b>inter-modal</b> <b>connections</b> between European airports. In particular it will focus on how passenger needs are addressed by inter-modal air-rail links. There are numerous advantages to this proposal, principally that it releases runway and ATC resources, offers immediate relief to congestion, reduces negative environmental impacts, and finally improves ground access to airports. “Inter-modality from a passenger perspective “ investigates how to make inter-modality work by satisfying passenger needs, so that the passengers behaviour can be used to help to improve airport capacity problems i. e. use of High Speed Train links instead of short haul flights could release ATM and airport capacity for users that have no alternative transport. Passenger perspective is the key element; it is rather impossible to develop a well-organised and satisfactory intermodal interchange node with efficient baggage handling logistics and integrated ticketing if there is no passenger feedback. 1 Transport in Europ...|$|R
40|$|Infrastructure {{enhancements}} {{and related}} investments have {{a crucial role}} in the process of regional integration, as clearly highlighted by the TEN-T (Trans-European Network in Transport) policy. Through the funding of several projects, in fact, the European Commission promotes the interoperability and efficiency of the European transport system by removing bottlenecks, by improving cross-border and <b>inter-modal</b> <b>connections</b> and by overcoming technical barriers. In such a context, this article tries to explore the importance of well-structured and interconnected European transport networks by investigating the rail freight capacity of the routes from the Italian north-eastern ports of Venice, Trieste and Koper to three destinations in Central Europe, namely Wien, Budapest and Munich. The paper examines the technical characteristics of the routes (through the TEN-T rail corridors) from the three ports to the selected rail terminals, providing first an overview of the current bottlenecks of the system and then offering an analysis of planned investments (TEN-T projects) and related enhancements in terms of capacity. The research and its outcomes remind the importance of analysing the transport funds and interventions from an inter-modal point of view, in order to achieve a more efficient and sustainable transport system. To guarantee full support to the Motorways of the Sea and to ports competitiveness, for example, funding and interventions should be aimed at eliminating or relieving the current bottlenecks and the related limitations in terms of capacity.

40|$|Rail {{rapid transit}} forms the {{backbone}} of many public transportation systems in cities globally moving people at both high speed and at high capacity. As cities seek to alleviate problems of congestion and environmental pollution many are constructing or expanding urban and suburban rail networks including in Canada where in 2015 numerous projects were underway or recently completed. Traditionally travel choices have been considered to be products of time and monetary cost academics and researchers have resented strong evidence also linking travel behaviour to factors including the built environment, station amenities, and street networks. This thesis links local station level factors, including built form, street network, station amenities and service, and socioeconomic characteristics, and rail rapid transit ridership in Canada. A direct ridership model (DRM) approach is used with OLS, robust, and two-stage least squares regression and bootstrapping is used to enhance the models. Data was collected for from 342 station locations in Canada’s five largest metropolitan areas with an average weekday ridership of over 3 million. Average weekday station boardings were used {{as the dependent variable}} and 53 socioeconomic, built environment, and system attributes were chosen as potential explanatory variables that were chosen after a review of the DRM and travel demand literature. The study yielded three sets of models with an adjusted r-squared values ranging between 0. 650 and 0. 864. Canadian rail rapid transit stations were tested together and separately as urban and suburban service types. The most important factor identified in the models was the supply of transit service, followed by <b>inter-modal</b> <b>connections</b> (bus stops for urban stations and primarily parking for suburban stations), and residential population density. Socioeconomic factors of the population in the area surrounding stations were not found to be significant. The absence of socioeconomic variables in the final model indicates that planners and policy makers have significant scope to exert influence over transit use through land use planning, design, and service features...|$|R
