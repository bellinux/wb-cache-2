The method determines accurate equilibrium <b>initial</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> and accounts for the dynamic holdup inherent in distillation curves measured {{in accordance with the}} ASTM D 86 standard. In this work, the ASTM D 86 distillation setup has been modified to simultaneously measure liquid and vapor temperature using two resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) and a data acquisition system has been employed to record temperature data at one-second time intervals for the duration of each distillation. Additionally, the time for each volume recovery point is recorded. The method presented here uses the time-resolved liquid temperature data to identify the true <b>initial</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (<b>IBP)</b> of four fuel mixtures of known composition; the IBPs are within 2 °C of the calculated equilibrium values. The time-resolved volume recovery information and the identified <b>initial</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> time are used to construct a volume evaporated versus time curve. The measured temperatures determined at the corresponding volume evaporated increments provide an experimental equilibrium distillation curve (EEDC). The EEDCs for the four fuel mixtures of known composition match the calculated equilibrium curves within a few degrees Celsius; a maximum mean absolute error of 2. 2 ± 1. 4 °C was observed. The dynamic holdup (volume difference between volume evaporated and volume recovered) associated with a distillation is found to correlate with the <b>initial</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of the fuel being distilled and the temperature of the condenser bath used in the experiment. The method was also applied to measure EEDCs for a gasoline fuel and a diesel fuel, where the compositions were unknown, to investigate the differences between the EEDCs and the ASTM D 86 distillation curves. The results highlight the large errors incurred when using ASTM D 86 results to approximate equilibrium distillation curves...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{overcome}} the drawback of using diesel in LTC, a new fuel concept called WDF was proposed in recent years. WDF refers to fuels {{with a wide}} distillation range from <b>initial</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (<b>IBP)</b> of gasoline to final <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (FBP) of diesel. In this work, two kinds of WDF (GDBF and FDF) were studied for both short-term and long-term consideration. In the study of GDBF, 50 % gasoline proportion is selected as the optimal choice due to the load adaptability;at the same NOx emissions level for Euro VI, G 50 and diesel have similar ITE, G 50 has the soot emissions around the target value of Euro V, while diesel has one orderhigher soot emissionsat high load. In the long term, {{it is not necessary}} to employ different distillation and refinery processes to produce gasoline and diesel fuels. A novel fuel concept named FDF is proposed and an exploration of the feasibility was conducted. The measured physical and chemical properties of FDF indicate that C/H ratio, density and heat value of FDF vary between those of gasoline and diesel fuel and kinematic viscosity is close to the lower limit of diesel, which is benefit to high pressure injection. Cetane number of FDF is in the lower range of diesel fuel. The thermal efficiency, combustion and emission characteristics of a common-rail diesel engine fueled with FDF were experimentally investigated and compared with those burning the conventional diesel fuel and GDBF. The ignition delay, combustion duration changes little compared to diesel fuel while thermal efficiency is higher than diesel and GDBF; the pressure rise rate and heat release rate of FDF are higher than diesel fuel but lower than GDBF, and as the engine load increases, the combustion characteristics of FDF are close to diesel fuel; the soot, NOx and CO emissions of FDF are close to diesel fuel, however, the THC emissions are slightly higher than diesel fuel...|$|R

These samples are representative of the automotive diesel distributed in the Athens area from all the oil companies operating in Greece. The laboratory examination involved the analysis both for any adulteration with the cheaper domestic heating diesel or marine diesel, and for some key properties of the automotive diesel. The ASTM standard methods were applied for the determination of the sulphur and nitrogen content, the density at 15 degreesC, the Cetane index, the kinematic viscosity at 40 degreesC and the distillation properties of <b>initial</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of the fuel (IBP), 10 per cent volume of the fuel (D- 10), 50 per cent volume of the fuel (D- 50), 90 per cent volume of the fuel (D- 90) and the final <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (FBP). The results indicate that there is a large fluctuation in the fuel properties among the oil marketers. Forty-six samples were found to be adultered with the cheaper diesel (domestic heating or marine diesel fuel) during the sampling period, This means that more than 40 per cent of the automotive diesel distributed in Athens, suffers from some degree of adulteration. One sample was found to be outside the current specifications of density maybe due to contamination with white spirit. The fuel adulteration problem is associated with environmental pollution, problems in engine performance and tax losses. It is a common problem not only to the European countries but practically for every nation in the world. The European Union expressed recently its concern on this issue, mandating that by the year 2002 all the member states will promote the development of a uniform system for fuel quality monitoring.

The technique was used to obtain 13 heavy petroleum cuts from three atmospheric residues (ARs) at 673. 15 K and above. The cuts present <b>initial</b> and final <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> between (673. 15 and 951. 15) K. To evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} technique, chemical characterization of residues and distillate cuts, which included SARA fractionation, 13 C NMR, elemental composition, and density and viscosity analysis, was performed. In addition, extended true <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> curves of crude oils by simulated distillation and by molecular distillation were compared. An increase in the viscosity and in the density was observed in all cuts with an increased molecular distillation temperature. Such behavior demonstrates that highly polar components that have a high structural complexity, such as resins and asphaltenes, are concentrated at the higher temperatures of the process. A sensitivity analysis of these two properties, together with the temperature, showed that viscosity and density decreased with increased temperature. On the other hand, the thermal expansion coefficient values obtained were equivalent to those reported in literature for petroleum products. Furthermore, a complete characterization of crude oils was made using the molecular distillation process to extend the true <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (TBP) curves...|$|R
40|$|In an {{industrial}} hydrocracking plant, except to the reactor, the separation section {{can affect the}} accuracy of the developed mathematical model. In this study, two combined-bed six and seven-lump kinetic models for the hydrocracking of vacuum gas oil in a real refinery are developed and their accuracies for the prediction of product yields are compared. In the six-lump model, the engaged components are selected according to the actual products of the plant, but the seven-lump one is included of lumps which are partitioned based on the specified <b>initial</b> and final <b>boiling</b> <b>points.</b> For both approaches, a complete kinetic network with the catalyst-decay functions is considered. It is found that over a 17 -month period of operation from the start of run, the average absolute deviation (AAD%) of the six-lump and the seven-lump models for the yield prediction are 20. 51 % and 5. 21 %, respectively for all products. Additionally, the sum of residuals for the seven-lump model has been appreciably decreased in comparison to the six-lump one. Therefore, it is confirmed that partitioning of the products to the lumps with specific <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> can acceptably decrease the deviation of the prediction. So it is conclusive that including the operation of the separation section in commercial models can effectively increase {{the accuracy of the}} model and smooth the prediction error...|$|R

25|$|The <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> {{corresponds}} to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Thus, the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> {{is dependent on the}} pressure. <b>Boiling</b> <b>points</b> may be published with respect to the NIST, USA standard pressure of 101.325 kPa (or 1 atm), or the IUPAC standard pressure of 100.000 kPa. At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> is also lower. The <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> increases with increased pressure up to the critical point, where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> cannot be increased beyond the critical <b>point.</b> Likewise, the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> decreases with decreasing pressure until the triple point is reached. The <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> cannot be reduced below the triple point.|$|R
