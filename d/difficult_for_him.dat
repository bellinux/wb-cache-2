5|$|Al-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly {{desires and}} living secluded from others while {{producing}} his works. He opposed {{all forms of}} violence. In Baghdad, while being well received, {{he decided not to}} sell his texts, which made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to live. This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano also {{experienced}} paludism (malaria) {{during the second}} campaign to Upper Peru. On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease, which made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to work or even talk. He was treated by doctor Joseph Readhead, who employed a local species of the Cinchona medicinal plant. The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because of the treatment and by having left the endemic zone.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the {{authorities}} imposed a ban preventing Rajab {{from engaging in}} any new business in Bahrain that made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to earn a living. The ban was subsequently lifted without any official explanation. In mid-August 2010, a number of opposition activists were again arrested. According to Rajab, an order for his arrest was issued on 8 September but was cancelled on 18 October. Rajab was also subject to a travel ban during this period.|$|E

5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as a deterrent. His former supporters were divided between those who supported {{the ideas of the}} Triumvirate and those no longer able to help. Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to speak. He died on October 12, 1812, while the trial was still underway.|$|E
5|$|The {{record is}} {{primarily}} based on DeLonge's post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The recording sessions were particularly <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> {{as he had}} recently undergone back surgery. The record is a concept album detailing {{the end of the}} world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus—the only member of that band not involved in the project—felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion, which evolved into tensions between him and DeLonge. It contributed to the band's 2005 breakup.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail. He {{experienced}} several further strokes, which made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to communicate, {{and he had to}} use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 {{campaign}} for Brandon McDonald was a <b>difficult</b> one <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> after being burned {{many times and}} eventually being replaced {{in the starting lineup}} by safety Mike Adams who outperformed him. He recorded 55 tackles, 1 sack, and 1 interceptions in the 2009 season. 2009 was also the year Steve McNair was murdered. He was Brandon Mcdonald's cousin.|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{he began a}} {{business}} partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette's output increased from then on, with films such as Gang of Four and La Belle Noiseuse receiving international praise. He continued making films until 2009, retiring after the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease made the production of 36 vues du pic Saint-Loup too <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to continue. Many of his films {{are known for their}} long running time, including the 760-minute Out 1. Almost always at the insistence of the distributors, Rivette edited shorter versions of five of his films and considered some of them to be entirely new films with different meanings.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude was {{released}} from police custody shortly after the incident. She was sent to Chicago with $7 and was never heard from again. The hydrochloric acid that Carlton ingested failed to kill him, but did badly burn his esophagus, which made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to ingest food. Carlton was indicted on August 16 and was charged {{with the murder of}} Mamah Borthwick, the only death that was directly witnessed by a survivor. Carlton entered a not guilty plea. Forty-seven days after the fire, before the case could be heard, Carlton died of starvation in his cell.|$|E
5|$|A leading {{member of}} the Yorkshire team which {{achieved}} {{a high level of}} success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to his pace bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he broke down in his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War.|$|E

50|$|Amerio's essays were {{praised by}} {{traditional}} {{scholars in the}} Church, although they came at a <b>difficult</b> time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> because of the then public conflict between archbishop Marcel Lefebvre of the traditionalist Society of St. Pius X and Pope Paul VI. As such, his 1980s research and books were largely ignored and neglected by leaders inside the institutional Church. Amerio died in 1997.|$|R
50|$|When {{his father}} Abdul Husain Husamuddin became the 48th Da'i al-Mutlaq there were huge debts over Dawoodi Bohra sect.

5|$|Entering the 1987 Cleveland Browns season, Junkin was {{projected}} to be the starting outside linebacker opposite Clay Matthews, Jr. despite playing inside linebacker in college, which generated criticism around the league as a transition that would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to make. After a 16-day , the Browns and Junkin agreed to a four-year deal worth nearly two million dollars. After missing the first preseason game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he made his debut against the New York Giants. In that game, he played the second half and failed to record a tackle. By the end of training camp, due to struggles learning the outside linebacker position, he made the roster, but lost the starting job to Anthony Griggs. After the Browns moved to a 4-3 defense for the second game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Junkin made his debut, and the plan was for him to gradually see more playing time each week. In early November, due {{to a combination of}} a players' strike and an injured wrist, Junkin was placed on the injured reserve list and replaced on the active roster by David Grayson.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} on 30 November 1976 {{he continued to}} work, both at the Museum and at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, Richmond (see image), gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35% of his total publications appeared in the quarter century of {{his retirement}}. He was commissioned to write {{a history of the}} Museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to deadlines and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> by the Museum's decision to censor his critical comments. He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended RHS flower shows even after he was barely able to walk.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, making it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished {{in the autumn of}} 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.|$|E

He left the set after the take and cried [...] "for about four hours" [...] until Harris had to calm him down.|$|R
5000|$|... 2006 {{was a very}} <b>difficult</b> year <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> On a {{personal}} level his father passed away, and on the business front the 2006 Lebanon War nearly wiped him out financially, as most of his businesses were {{in the north of}} country and were affected by the war. Bramly has said, however, that through hard work and perseverance he was able to bounce back.|$|R
25|$|The {{captaincy}} {{period was}} on the whole a <b>difficult</b> one <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as it was mired with reports of differences with Gavaskar, {{as well as his}} own inconsistent form as a bowler. However, both men have since insisted that these reports were exaggerated. Above all the controversy, Kapil's performance was better when he was the Captain, than as a player underline that, he enjoyed and suited captaincy.|$|R
5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{bilateral relations}} between Thailand and Cambodia became strained due to overlapping claims {{on the land}} area surrounding Preah Vihear Temple. Sihanouk issued a communique in July 2008 emphasizing the Khmer architecture of the temple as well as ICJ's 1962 ruling of the temple in favour of Cambodia. In August 2009 Sihanouk stated that he would stop posting messages on his personal website as he was getting old, making it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{to keep up with}} his personal duties. Between 2009 and 2011, Sihanouk {{spent most of his time}} in Beijing for medical care. He made a final public appearance in Phnom Penh on his 89th birthday and 20th anniversary of the Paris Peace Accords on 30October 2011. Thereafter, Sihanouk expressed his intent to stay in Cambodia indefinitely, but returned to Beijing in January 2012 for further medical treatment at the advice of his Chinese doctors.|$|E
5|$|Hammond's health {{remained}} poor at {{the start}} of the 1935 season. He developed septic tonsillitis which made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to breathe, eat and sleep, and ultimately required an operation to remove his tonsils in early 1936. Hammond's form was indifferent and he believed it was his worst season. In first-class matches, he scored 2,616 runs (average 49.35) and took 60 wickets (average 27.26). He became the ninth player to reach 100 first-class centuries, emerging from a run of bad form against Somerset. Long a regular in the side, for the first time he captained the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. In the five-Test series against South Africa, a run of low scores again brought press speculation about his place in the national side. He did not pass fifty until the third Test, when he scored 63 and 87 not out, ending a run of 22 innings without a fifty, in which time he averaged 23.47 over 14 Tests. Hammond made two more fifties in the last two Tests, although they were insufficient to prevent England from losing 1–0, their third successive series defeat. He finished the series with 389 runs at an average of 64.83, but remained unsatisfied with his form.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of freedom states that things freely learned are best learned. Conversely, the further {{a student is}} coerced, the more <b>difficult</b> is <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to learn, assimilate and implement what is learned. Compulsion and coercion are antithetical to personal growth. The greater the freedom enjoyed by individuals within a society, the greater the intellectual and moral advancement enjoyed by society as a whole.|$|R
60|$|When we had amused {{ourselves}} a while about this, I said to him: 'Well, you shall go {{away from me}} no more; I'll go {{all over the world}} with you rather.' He told me {{it would be a very}} <b>difficult</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to leave me, but since it must be, he hoped I would make it as easy to me as I could; but as <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> it would be his destruction that he foresaw.|$|R
60|$|However {{it might}} be, certain it was, as I {{set it down}} in my own mind, that after we had met him {{the night before he}} would leave no stone unturned to bring us into trouble, and {{it would not be a}} <b>difficult</b> matter <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to learn from some of the Tory {{citizens}} of York who yet remained in the village, which of the buildings were owned by my father.|$|R
5|$|Headley was {{selected}} for the West Indian tour of Australia in the 1930–31 season, under the captaincy of Jackie Grant. After a brief visit to New Zealand where they played a non-first-class match against Wellington, the tourists arrived in Sydney. Headley made a good start to the tour and attracted praise from the press in Australia and West Indies. The first match of the Australian leg was against New South Wales, where the West Indians were bowled out for 188 and Headley was stumped for 25. However, his runs came {{in less than two}} overs and Learie Constantine later rated this as one of Headley's best innings. In the second innings, Headley made 82, the top score, but could not prevent the tourists losing. The next match was also lost, as Bert Ironmonger took thirteen wickets in the match for Victoria. In the first innings, Headley scored 131 out of 212, regarded by one critic {{as one of the best}} centuries scored on the ground, and top-scored again with 34 in the second innings. By this stage the Australian bowlers had realised that Headley excelled when hitting the ball through the off side, and they began to alter their tactics accordingly. In the final match before the Test series began, against South Australia, Headley had problems playing the Australian bowlers, particularly the leg spin of Clarrie Grimmett. The Australians bowled at Headley's leg stump with fielders concentrated on the leg side, making it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to score runs. Headley scored 27 and 16 as his team were heavily defeated. These bowling tactics were used in subsequent matches, and Headley found difficulty in countering them.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins the}} day before an {{audience}} that Ai has obtained with Argaven Harge, the king of Karhide. Ai manages this through the help of Estraven, the prime minister, who seems to believe in Ai's mission, but {{the night before the}} audience, Estraven tells Ai that he can no longer support Ai's cause with the king. Ai begins to doubt Estraven's loyalty because of his strange mannerisms, which Ai finds effeminate and ambiguous. The behavior of people in Karhide is dictated by shifgrethor, an intricate set of unspoken social rules and formal courtesy. Ai does not understand this system, thus making it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to understand Estraven's motives, and contributing to his distrust of Estraven. The next day, as he prepares to meet the King, Ai learns that Estraven has been accused of treason, and exiled from the country. The pretext for Estraven's exile was his handling of a border dispute with the neighboring country of Orgoreyn, in which Estraven was seen as being too conciliatory. Ai meets with the king, who rejects his offer to join the Ekumen. Discouraged, Ai decides to travel through Karhide, as the spring has just begun, rendering the interior of the country accessible.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruler of}} Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was antipathetic to the Congress, {{and did not}} see much future in India for him or the {{lifestyle}} he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer, he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the designated head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was keen to attract {{some of the larger}} border states, hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the two-nation theory on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.|$|E
60|$|It is {{hard for}} a man to be at once tender and pugnacious--to be sentimental, while he is putting forth his {{physical}} strength with all the violence in his power. It is <b>difficult,</b> also, <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to be gentle instantly after having been in a rage. So he changed his tactics at the moment, and came to the point at once in a manner befitting his present state of mind.|$|R
50|$|While recollecting on {{his playing}} years, he's {{mentioned}} Panagiotis Giannakis as his role model, Rolando Blackman as his best ever teammate, and Nikos Galis {{as the most}} <b>difficult</b> player <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to guard. He's also said that his former coach, Krešimir Ćosić, {{was the man who}} changed his life; when Ćosić signed <b>him</b> <b>for</b> AEK, Katsikaris had actually been about to quit basketball (at the age of 23), and go to the United States for studies.|$|R
50|$|Despite Bosse's {{success with}} his brass figures, {{it was still}} a <b>difficult</b> time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{financial}}ly. In 1953, partly fleeing from financial troubles, he moved to Iserlohn, where he set up a new shop and continued production. In Vienna, the Herta Baller Company continued to make and sell Bosse's designs. Bosse also collaborated with Karlsruhe State Majolika Works on a number of pottery animal figures. In 1958, he designed for Achatit Schirmer in Cologne.|$|R
