5|$|From {{a famous}} school, Mercator {{moved to the}} famous University of Leuven, where his full Latin name appears in the {{matriculation}} records for 1530. He lived {{in one of the}} teaching colleges, the Castle College, and, although he was classified as a pauper, <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> shoulders with richer students amongst whom were the anatomist Andreas Vesalius, the statesman Antoine Perrenot, and the theologian George Cassander, all destined to fame and all lifelong friends of Mercator.|$|E
2500|$|Believing he {{had killed}} Stottor, Nilsen seated the youth in his armchair, then noted his mongrel dog, Bleep, licking Stottor's face. Nilsen {{realised}} the tiniest thread of life still clung in the youth: <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> Stottor's limbs and heart to increase circulation, covered the youth's body in blankets, then lay him upon his bed. When Stottor regained consciousness, Nilsen embraced him; he then explained to Stottor he had almost strangled himself on the zip of the sleeping bag, {{and that he had}} resuscitated him. Over the following two days, Stottor repeatedly lapsed in and out of consciousness. When Stottor had regained enough strength to question Nilsen as to his recollections of being strangled and immersed in cold water, Nilsen explained he had become caught in the zip of the sleeping bag following a nightmare, and that he had placed him in cold water as [...] "you were in shock". Nilsen then led Stottor to a nearby railway station, where he informed the youth he hoped they might meet again before he bade him farewell.|$|E
2500|$|On September 9, 1956, Presley {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on The Ed Sullivan Show (after earlier appearances on shows hosted by the Dorsey Brothers, Milton Berle, and Steve Allen), even though Sullivan had previously vowed never to allow Presley on the show. According to biographer Michael David Harris, [...] "Sullivan signed Presley when the host was having an intense Sunday-night rivalry with Steve Allen. Allen had the singer on July 1 and trounced Sullivan in the ratings. When asked to comment, the CBS star said that he wouldn't consider presenting Presley before a family audience. Less than two weeks later {{he changed his mind}} and signed a contract. The newspapers asked him to explain his reversal. 'What I said then was off the reports I'd heard. I hadn't even seen the guy. Seeing the kinescopes, I don't know what the fuss was all about. For instance, the business about rubbing the thighs. <b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> one hand on his hip to dry off the perspiration from playing his guitar.' [...] " ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} all this," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>rubbing</b> his furrowed brow confusedly. [...] "But it HAS a meaning, maybe, if I {{could find it}} out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha! Enjoying {{the study}} of light literature, my friends," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>rubbing</b> his hands. [...] "Common {{mathematics}} are not for such soaring minds as yours, are they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Both fat," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>rubbing</b> his nose. [...] "This is {{craft and}} cunning such as I love. What did I tell thee when I rode away, boy?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now the Soldier {{knew what}} a capital tinder-box this was. If <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> once, the dog that sat on the chest of copper appeared; if <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> twice, there came the dog that watched over the silver chest; and if <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> three times, the one that guarded the gold appeared. Now, the Soldier went down again to his {{beautiful}} rooms, and appeared once more in splendid clothes. All his friends immediately recognised him again, and paid him great court.|$|E
60|$|John Messner clung with mittened {{hand to the}} bucking gee-pole {{and held}} the sled in the trail. With the other mittened hand <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> his cheeks and nose. <b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> his cheeks and nose every little while. In point of fact, he rarely ceased from rubbing them, and sometimes, as their {{numbness}} increased, <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> fiercely. His forehead was covered by the visor of his fur cap, the flaps of which went over his ears. The rest of his face was protected by a thick beard, golden-brown under its coating of frost.|$|E
60|$|Daughtry grinned denial as <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> his grizzled mat of hair.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>rubs</b> his spectacles, <b>he</b> stares,-- [...] 'Tis {{the same}} face that witched him early! He gropes for his {{remaining}} hairs,-- [...] Is this a fleece that feels so curly? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>rubbing</b> his hands. [...] "I left a {{note for}} you {{at each of the}} Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>rubbing</b> his {{spectacles}} {{with his}} handkerchief before putting them {{away for the}} night, [...] "don't let her project her individuality into my sport. That's all I have to say." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> his face, {{pushed the}} tumbled hair off his forehead, and roused himself.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan {{removed a}} handful {{of them from the}} box and {{examined}} them. <b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> one upon another and discovered that the green came off, leaving a shiny surface for two-thirds of their length and a dull gray over the cone-shaped end. Finding a bit of wood <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> one of the cylinders rapidly and was rewarded by a lustrous sheen which pleased him.|$|E
60|$|She yearned over Olaf. His lambent {{eyes were}} stupid, he moaned, <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> his forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{was quite}} right,' {{returned}} his master, 'and you're a blockhead, possessing no judgment or discretion whatever. Tell {{him to come}} in, and see that <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> his shoes for exactly five minutes first.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He's {{a diamond}} {{in terms of}} wanting to learn, wanting to get better, wanting to get stronger. That's what makes Ryan so potent in this squad. <b>He</b> <b>rubs</b> off on other people with his hunger and desire." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{little fellow}} came slowly {{up to where}} the three rested in the shade. [...] "Mowbray beat me with a strap," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>rubbing</b> his sleeve across his eyes, and {{catching}} his breath at the recollection.|$|R
60|$|Babo said nothing, but <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> {{the places}} where the smith had dusted his coat.|$|E
60|$|His voice grew gentle. <b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> his {{forehead}} with a puzzled air and stroked his long beard.|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been ten o'clock when Phil did awaken. <b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> his eyes and sat up.|$|E
50|$|Lars Ågestam, {{the public}} {{prosecutor}} who will handle {{the case if}} Grens can provide enough evidence to go to court. Smooth and upper class, <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> Grens the wrong way, and the two {{have a history of}} clashing.|$|R
50|$|Tepper keeps a brass {{replica of}} a pair of {{testicles}} in a prominent spot on his desk, a present from former employees. <b>He</b> <b>rubs</b> the gift for luck during the trading day to get a laugh out of colleagues.|$|R
6000|$|... (H. Rumbold, master barber, in a bloodcoloured jerkin and tanner's apron, a rope coiled {{over his}} shoulder, mounts the block. A life {{preserver}} and a nailstudded bludgeon {{are stuck in}} his belt. <b>He</b> <b>rubs</b> grimly his grappling hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.) ...|$|R
60|$|Lethington {{looked at}} the other two, the other two looked at him. <b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> his hands softly.|$|E
60|$|Then, slowly, <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> {{his hands}} over his knees, with the secret craving of the old for warmth.|$|E
60|$|And the Rhinoceros did. He buttoned it up {{with the}} three buttons, and it tickled like cake crumbs in bed. Then he wanted to scratch, but that made it worse; and then he lay down on the sands and rolled and rolled and rolled, and every time he rolled the cake crumbs tickled him worse and worse and worse. Then he ran to the palm-tree and rubbed and rubbed and rubbed himself against it. <b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> so much and so hard that <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> his skin into a great fold over his shoulders, and another fold underneath, where the buttons used to be (but <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> the buttons off), and <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> some more folds over his legs. And it spoiled his temper, but it didn't make the least {{difference}} to the cake-crumbs. They were inside his skin and they tickled. So he went home, very angry indeed and horribly scratchy; and from that day to this every rhinoceros has great folds in his skin and a very bad temper, all on account of the cake-crumbs inside.|$|E
5000|$|A small {{scene is}} added between 3.2 and 4.1 where Antipholus (S) is {{standing}} on his balcony and sees Antipholus (E) wandering in the market place. However, <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> his eyes, looks at his {{glass of wine and}} dismisses what he has seen.|$|R
60|$|But the wintry morning {{wants him}} not and wakes him not. It wakes Mr. George of the {{shooting}} gallery and his familiar. They arise, roll up and stow away their mattresses. Mr. George, having shaved himself before a looking-glass of minute proportions, then marches out, bare-headed and bare-chested, to the pump in the little yard and anon comes back shining with yellow soap, friction, drifting rain, and exceedingly cold water. As <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> himself upon a large jack-towel, blowing like a military sort of diver just come up, his hair curling tighter and tighter on his sunburnt temples the more <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> {{it so that it}} looks as if it never could be loosened by any less coercive instrument than an iron rake or a curry-comb--as <b>he</b> <b>rubs,</b> and puffs, and polishes, and blows, turning his {{head from side to side}} the more conveniently to excoriate his throat, and standing with his body well bent forward to keep the wet from his martial legs, Phil, on his knees lighting a fire, looks round as if it were enough washing for him to see all that done, and sufficient renovation for one day to take in the superfluous health his master throws off.|$|R
50|$|Eddie’s 78th {{birthday}} is approaching {{and he is}} shaving. <b>He</b> <b>rubs</b> his jaw as he remembers the ache of an old illness. His grandson Todd arrives at Eddie’s small, cluttered flat, bringing his girlfriend Lisa with him. More forthright than Todd, Lisa probes Eddie about his life and past.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> his under lip {{with his}} {{umbrella}} handle and reflected upon Masterman and his denunciation of the world.|$|E
60|$|Bostil {{shook his}} huge frame, and <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> {{his eyes as}} if they had become dim, and he stared again.|$|E
60|$|For {{a second}} {{it looked as}} if the Judge might smile, too. <b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> his nose with a fearful violence.|$|E
6000|$|... "At last," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>rubbing</b> {{his hands}} {{together}} gleefully, [...] "I have ample leisure for a good talk with my old friend Unc Nunkie. So let us sit down cosily and enjoy ourselves. After stirring those four kettles for six years I am glad {{to have a little}} rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only think!" [...] says <b>he,</b> <b>rubbing</b> {{his hands}} in great spirits, [...] "I've been to the genteel villa residence, and the moment I {{mentioned}} my business they kicked me out directly. There were two witnesses of the assault, and it's worth a hundred pounds to me if it's worth a farthing." ...|$|R
6000|$|TOPPING has gone. BUILDER sits drawing at {{his pipe}} between the [...] firelight {{and the light}} from the {{standard}} lamp. He takes the pipe [...] out of his mouth and a quiver passes over his face. With a half [...] angry gesture <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> {{the back of his hand}} across his eyes.|$|R
