40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel design for reducing secondary flow in turbines. The design builds on previous work on non-axisymmetric profiled <b>endwalls</b> by combining them with three-dimensional blade design. Profiled <b>endwalls</b> {{have been shown}} to effectively reduce secondary flow but have often been used as a ‘retrofit’ application where the blade design is left unchanged. In the current paper reverse compound lean is used to prepare the blade row for the application of profiled <b>endwalls.</b> Computational fluid dynamic predictions ofthe expected performance show benefits over and above those of applying profiled <b>endwalls</b> to the blade row alone. The paper describes the design of the novel geometry for the so-called ‘Durham Cascade’ and gives predictions of the expected performance...|$|R

The design of this geometry, which features profiled <b>endwalls</b> and three-dimensional blade shaping was discussed in a companion paper [1]. This paper {{presents the results of}} static pressure measurements on the blade surface, pneumatic pressure probe traverses, and surface oil flow visualization in order to build a comprehensive picture of the geometry's performance and function.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the unidirectional solidification of a binary alloy {{for which the}} liquid and solid phases are bounded by <b>endwalls.</b> In order {{to account for the}} transport of latent heat and solute, thermal and solutal boundary layers must be placed at the solidifying interface. Further, under the assumption of fixed temperature gradients, the presence of the <b>endwalls</b> leads to a velocity of solidification that decreases with time, and hence to an unsteady basic state having a planar interface. From a stability analysis of this state, a nonlinear long-wave evolution equation of Sivashinsky type is derived, with modified coefficients, that shows how the onset of cellular structure is delayed by the presence of <b>endwalls...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{experimentally}} {{studies the}} effects of air injection near the blade trailing edge on flow separation and losses in a highly loaded linear compressor cascade. Aerodynamic parameters of eight cascades with different air injection slot configurations are measured by using a five-hole probe at the cascade outlets. Ink-trace flow visualization is performed to obtain the flow details around the air injection slots. The static pressure distribution is clarified with pressure taps on the <b>endwalls.</b> The results indicate that air injection has {{little effect on the}} static pressure distribution on the <b>endwalls,</b> but improves the flow behavior at the corners between the suction surfaces and the <b>endwalls</b> with the decrease in losses at midspan. Slot positions have great effect on the compressor cascade performances. The optimal slot location is 25 % of the blade span. The energy loss coefficient is reduced by 5. 5 % at most...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The non-axisymmetric {{profiling}} of <b>endwalls</b> {{has been}} shown to be a powerful method to reduce loss and secondary flows, but the underlying physics are not fully understood. The identification of flow structures and the accurate quantification of the secondary flows are essential for the investigation of the physical mechanisms. A new criterion is proposed for the visualisation of vortices, as well as a more accurate definition of the secondary kinetic energy applicable to turbomachinery flows. Furthermore, the action of the transverse pressure gradient is visually characterised. These quantities are then used to analyse the flow in two linear cascades with contoured <b>endwalls,</b> both numerically and experimentally, revealing new details of the resulting flow modifications...|$|R

The numerical analysis centres on a dynamical-systems approach and concerns symmetry-based identification of coherent structures in the web of tracer paths (collectively defining the flow topology) {{for a number of}} archetypal flow configurations. The role of the flow topology in the process of tracer transport is investigated by numerical tracking of finite-size material objects released at strategic locations in the flow.

40|$|The {{durability}} of gas turbine engines is strongly {{dependent on the}} component temperatures. For the combustor and turbine airfoils and <b>endwalls,</b> film cooling is used extensively to reduce component temperatures. Film cooling is a cooling method used in virtually all of today’s aircraft turbine engines and in many power-generation turbine engines and yet has very difficult phenomena to predict. The interaction of jets-in-crossflow, which is representative of film cooling, results in a shear layer that leads to mixing and a decay in the cooling performance along a surface. This interaction is highly dependent on the jet-to-crossflow mass and momentum flux ratios. Film-cooling performance is difficult to predict because of the inherent complex flowfields along the airfoil component surfaces in turbine engines. Film cooling is applied to nearly all of the external surfaces associated with the airfoils that are exposed to the hot combustion gasses such as the leading edges, main bodies, blade tips, and <b>endwalls.</b> In a review of the literature, it was found that there are strong effects of freestream turbulence, surface curvature, and hole shape on the performance of film cooling. Film cooling is reviewed through a discussion of the analyses methodologies, a physical description, and the various influences on film-cooling performance.
