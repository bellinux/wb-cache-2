50|$|An <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>storm</b> is a {{turbulence}} in the ionosphere of the Earth's atmosphere. Such storms are {{triggered by}} enhanced flux of energetic electrons that are emitted {{at a large}} level by the Sun.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to solar XUV radiation, magnetospheric disturbances, indicated {{on the ground}} by geomagnetic variations, show an unpredictable impulsive character, from short periodic disturbances {{of the order of}} hours to long-standing giant storms of several day's duration. The reaction of the thermosphere to a large magnetospheric storm is called thermospheric storm. Since the heat input into the thermosphere occurs at high latitudes (mainly into the auroral regions), the heat transport represented by the term P20 in eq.(3) is reversed. In addition, due to the impulsive form of the disturbance, higher-order terms are generated which, however, possess short decay times and thus quickly disappear. The sum of these modes determines the [...] "travel time" [...] of the disturbance to the lower latitudes, and thus the response time of the thermosphere with respect to the magnetospheric disturbance. Important for the development of an <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storm</b> is the increase of the ratio N2/O during a thermospheric storm at middle and higher latitude. An increase of N2 increases the loss process of the ionospheric plasma and causes therefore a decrease of the electron density within the ionospheric F-layer (negative <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storm).</b>|$|E
50|$|The Kp-index is {{used for}} the study and {{prediction}} of ionospheric propagation of high frequency radio signals. Geomagnetic storms, indicated by a Kp = 5 or higher, have no direct effect on propagation. However they disturb the F-layer of the ionosphere, especially at middle and high geographical latitudes, causing a so-called <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storm</b> which degrades radio propagation. The degradation mainly consists of a reduction of the maximum usable frequency (MUF) by as much as 50%. Sometimes the E-layer may be affected as well. In contrast with sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID), which affect high frequency radio paths near the Equator, the effects of ionospheric storms are more intense in the polar regions.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> are {{an extreme}} form of space weather {{phenomena}} which affect space- and ground-based technological systems. Extreme solar activity may {{give rise to}} Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) and solar flares that may result in <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms.</b> This thesis reports on a statistical analysis of the ionospheric response over the ionosonde stations Grahamstown (33. 3 ◦S, 26. 5 ◦E) and Madimbo (22. 4 ◦S, 30. 9 ◦E), South Africa, during geomagnetic storm conditions which occurred during the period 1996 - 2011. Total Electron Content (TEC) derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) data by a dual Frequency receiver and an ionosonde at Grahamstown, was analysed for the storms {{that occurred during the}} period 2006 - 2011. A comprehensive analysis of the critical frequency of the F 2 layer (foF 2) and TEC was done. To identify the geomagnetically disturbed conditions the Disturbance storm time (Dst) index with a storm criteria of Dst ≤ − 50 nT was used. The ionospheric disturbances were categorized into three responses, namely single disturbance, double disturbance and not significant (NS) <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms.</b> Single disturbance <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> refer to positive (P) and negative (N) <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> observed separately, while double disturbance storms refer to negative and positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> observed during the same storm period. The statistics show the impact of geomagnetic storms on the ionosphere and indicate that negative ionospheric effects follow the solar cycle. In general, only a few <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> (0. 11 %) were observed during solar minimum. Positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> occurred most frequently (47. 54 %) during the declining phase of solar cycle 23. Seasonally, negative <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> occurred mostly during the summer (63. 24 %), while positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> occurred frequently during the winter (53. 62 %). An important finding is that only negative <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> were observed during great geomagnetic storm activity (Dst ≤ − 350 nT). For periods when both ionosonde and GPS was available, the two data sets indicated similar ionospheric responses. Hence, GPS data can be used to effectively identify the ionospheric response in the absence of ionosonde data...|$|R
30|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{relative}} importance of penetrating eastward electric field (PEEF) and direct effects of equatorward neutral wind in leading to positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> at low-mid latitudes using observations and modeling. The observations show strong positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> in total electron content (TEC) and peak electron density (Nmax) at low-mid latitudes in Japan longitudes (≈ 125 °E– 145 °E) during the first main phase (started at sunrise on 08 November) of a super double geomagnetic storm during 07 – 11 November 2004. The model results obtained using the Sheffield University Plasmashpere Ionosphere Model (SUPIM) show that the direct effects of storm-time equatorward neutral wind (that reduce poleward plasma flow and raise the ionosphere to high altitudes of reduced chemical loss) can be the main driver of positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> at low-mid latitudes except in Nmax around the equator. The equatorward wind without PEEF can also result in stronger positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> than with PEEF. Though PEEF on its own is unlikely to cause positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms,</b> it can lead to positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> in the presence of an equatorward wind.|$|R

The determination of the time delay in the ionospheric response to the interplanetary medium disturbances leads to significant results concerning the forecast of the ionospheric storms onset and their development during the first 24 h.

40|$|We {{explore the}} ionospheric effects of prompt {{penetration}} electric fields (PPEFs) {{for a variety}} of interplanetary magnetic field directions. We use the great magnetic storm of 30 - 31 October as an example of PPEF effects. For intense southward interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs), inward plasma sheet convection occurs with the result of magnetospheric ring current formation and an intense magnetic storm. Concurrent with the above, positive phase <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> occur in the dayside, and negative phase <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> occur on the nightside, the topics of this paper. The dayside <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> due to PPEFs are characterized by transport of near-equatorial plasma to higher altitudes and latitudes, forming a giant plasma fountain.

For northward IMFs, negative phase <b>ionospheric</b> <b>storms</b> are expected on the dayside if the PPEFs indeed reach that region of space.

According to the mechanism suggested by Balan et al.

Daytime eastward prompt penetration electric fields, if they occur, also shift the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) crests to higher than normal latitudes. The difference between the earlier and recent modelling is in latitudinal coverage: the earlier modelling (e.g., Buonsanto, 1999) considered the effects at high- and mid-latitudes alone, while Balan et al.
