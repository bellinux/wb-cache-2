5|$|In 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer {{became a}} chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an {{accomplished}} player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch {{and a fine}} treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 {{he was invited to}} sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> had he been educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. He may have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

So Naaman dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, and his flesh came back like the flesh of a little child.|$|E

25|$|Alexander {{often had}} to divide his forces and command was given {{to a variety of}} senior {{officers}} on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels. It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> himself without needing instructions.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} a draw, {{the first time}} that the First Test of an Ashes series had been drawn in Australia since 1881-82. The general opinion was that Benaud should have {{declared}} earlier and that had it been any other team <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so. In previous Ashes series Down Under the 30 hours play had been over six days, which with a rest day meant a seven-day-old pitch by the end, which usually produced a result. Still Australia (having won the toss) had the better of the draw and had played the more positive cricket. In the England team only Fred Trueman with the ball and Ted Dexter with the bat had shown any aggression.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the First Test in Mumbai was overshadowed {{by the death of}} Sir Donald Bradman, universally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman in cricket history. After a minute's silence, Australian captain Steve Waugh won the toss and elected to field on a pitch offering assistance to the bowling team. Ganguly stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> likewise. The Australian fast bowlers quickly removed India's top order, with both openers and Rahul Dravid removed in the first hour's play with only 31 runs scored. After Ganguly was removed with the score on 55, the Indians progressed to be 4/62 at lunch. Sachin Tendulkar lead a counterattack in the hour after lunch, scoring 53 runs in 53 balls to take the score to 4/130 before V. V. S. Laxman was removed. The innings lost momentum when Tendulkar was dismissed for 76 to leave the score at 6/139. India were eventually bowled out in the final session for 176. Shane Warne took 4/47 while Glenn McGrath managed 3/19. In reply, Australia reached 1/49 at stumps, losing Michael Slater.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Fadlan {{reports that}} the {{settlement}} of disputes in Khazaria was adjudicated by judges hailing each from his community, be it Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or Pagan. Some {{evidence suggests that the}} Khazar king saw himself as a defender of Jews even beyond the kingdom's frontiers, retaliating against Muslim or Christian interests in Khazaria in the wake of Islamic and Byzantine persecutions of Jews abroad. Ibn Fadlan recounts specifically an incident in which the king of Khazaria destroyed the minaret of a mosque in Atil as revenge for the destruction of a synagogue in Dâr al-Bâbûnaj, and allegedly said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> worse were it not for a fear that the Muslims might retaliate in turn against Jews. Ḥasdai ibn Shaprūṭ sought information on Khazaria in the hope he might discover 'a place on this earth where harassed Israel can rule itself' and wrote that, were it to prove true that Khazaria had such a king, he would not hesitate to forsake his high office and his family in order to emigrate there.|$|E
500|$|Littell said {{he wanted}} to focus on the {{thinking}} of an executioner and of origins of state murder, showing how we can take decisions that lead, or not, to a genocide. Littell claims he set out creating the character Max Aue by imagining what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and how he would have behaved if he had been born into Nazi Germany. One childhood event that kept Littell interested in the question of being a killer was the Vietnam War. According to him, his childhood terror was that he would be drafted, sent to Vietnam [...] "and made to kill women and children who hadn't done anything to me." ...|$|E
500|$|On his deposition, a Sydney Morning Herald {{editorial}} {{summed up}} his leadership thus: [...] "True, the margin [...] was slender. And, true, Morton campaigned vigorously. But his punches {{seemed to be}} rather wild. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better by directing his blows to a few vital points {{instead of trying to}} hit at anything in sight. In addition to losing the last election, when Labour seemed at its most vulnerable after 18 years of office, Mr Morton further disappointed his colleagues – indeed, antagonised some of them – by expanding his private business interests when he was being urged to concentrate wholly on the job of Leader of the Opposition. However, the sad truth is that the genial Mr Morton has never measured up as a sagacious, inspiring leader." ...|$|E

500|$|Dungeon Keeper 2 was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows by Electronic Arts in late June 1999. Goldsworthy believed Peter Molyneux, {{producer of the}} original game, would be pleased with the sequel. Indeed, Molyneux stated that he [...] "liked what they did with it", but also {{said that it was}} not precisely what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and that his focus would have been [...] "expanding that sense of creating the greatest dungeon". A PlayStation version was in development, but cancelled. The first patch, which added levels, fixed bugs, and tweaked gameplay, {{was released}} in August. Ideas such as the merging of the underworld and overworld were planned for Dungeon Keeper 3, but Electronic Arts began focusing on other franchises such as Harry Potter. In August 2000, Bullfrog announced that the development of Dungeon Keeper 3 had been cancelled. Dungeon Keeper 2 is available on gog.com and Origin.|$|E
500|$|After {{his release}} in 1960, Greenglass {{and his family}} lived in New York City under an assumed name. For some years they lived on 228th Street in Laurelton, Queens, New York. In 1996, Greenglass recanted his sworn {{testimony}} {{in an interview with}} The New York Times reporter Sam Roberts and stated he had lied under oath about the extent of his sister's involvement in the spying plot in order to protect his wife. At the trial, Greenglass had testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed his notes to give to the Russians, though he now intimated that Ruth had done the typing, saying [...] "I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember." [...] Greenglass explained, [...] "My wife is more important to me than my sister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children." [...] When Roberts asked Greenglass if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> anything differently, he replied, [...] "Never." [...] The role of Ethel Rosenberg in her husband's espionage ring remains a matter of dispute.|$|E
500|$|Ed Logg, {{a former}} lead {{designer}} at Atari, who never programmed the VCS, considered the development a rushed, [...] "lousy" [...] effort. Frye did not express regret over {{his part in}} Pac-Mans port and felt he made the best decisions he could at the time. However, Frye stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> things differently with a larger capacity ROM. Video game industry researchers Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost attribute the poor reception to the technical differences between the 1977 Atari 2600 console and the 1980 arcade hardware used in Pac-Man cabinets. They further stated that the conversion is a lesson in maintaining {{the social and cultural}} context of the original source. Montfort and Bogost commented that players were disappointed with the flickering visual effect, which made the ghosts difficult to track and tired the players' eyes. The two further said that the effect diminishes the ghosts' personalities present in the arcade version. Chris Kohler of Wired commented that the game was poorly received upon its release and in contemporary times because of the poor quality. However, he further described the game as an impressive technical achievement given its console's limitations.|$|E

500|$|When Leicestershire {{appointed}} Ewart Astill {{as their}} captain for the 1935 season, {{he became the}} first professional [...] to lead any county on a regular basis since the 19th century. Yorkshire did not have a professional skipper in the 20th century until Vic Wilson in 1960. Alan Gibson believed that Yorkshire erred in rejecting Sutcliffe. He further argued that, if appointed, Sutcliffe would have been made England Test captain in 1931 instead of Douglas Jardine and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> a good job for several years. Sutcliffe later regretted withdrawing his acceptance. In later years, he told Bill Bowes that Jack Hobbs, Sutcliffe's opening partner on the national side, should have been made England captain. According to Bowes, he said, [...] "Lord Hawke lifted professional cricket from there to there'... raising his hand from knee to shoulder level. 'Professional cricketers lifted it to there,' he continued, raising his hand above his head, '—and even Lord Hawke wanted it back again. Jack Hobbs, {{for the sake of the}} professional cricketer, should have accepted." [...] Sutcliffe's son Billy subsequently captained Yorkshire from 1956 to 1958.|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, Mark Tooley, then {{director}} of the Institute on Religion and Democracy's (IRD) United Methodist committee, wrote an opinion piece about Jesus for President in the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard. Tooley is heavily critical {{of the book and}} of Claiborne, writing, [...] "On so many different levels, Claiborne lacks moral and spiritual perspective." [...] Tooley argues that Jesus for President is selective in its quotations from Church Fathers and instead relies heavily on the teachings of heterodox theologians, naming specifically Walter Brueggemann, John Dominic Crossan, and Walter Wink, people that Tooley writes would not [...] "inspire confidence in orthodox Christians." [...] While praising Claiborne's story of nonviolence in response to personally being trapped with a friend in an alley by criminals who hit them with sticks, Tooley criticizes Claiborne for not explaining what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in the case of encountering a pregnant woman who was being similarly treated. Christopher Hitchens, an Anglo-American critic of religion, wrote an article in British tabloid newspaper the Sunday Express in response to Tooley's review. He calls Jesus for President [...] "a terrible-sounding book" [...] and Claiborne [...] "a terrible-sounding person." [...] Hitchens argues that Claiborne and Tooley are attempting to justify their own views by ascribing them to Jesus, with Claiborne arguing that a Jesus would have supported liberation theology and Tooley arguing that Jesus would have supported neoconservatism.|$|E
500|$|Arts, which Playford {{showed no}} {{personal}} interest in, and regarded as [...] "frills not fundamentals" [...] and [...] "non-productive", became a more prominent issue among the emerging middle-class. For his attitude, Playford was often mocked by his opponents and critics for his [...] "philistinism". The Nation derisorily quipped that [...] "It is axiomatic that the Premier draws his orchard spray {{gun at the}} mention of the word 'culture'". Sir Arthur Rymill, an LCL member of the upper house, criticised the demolition of the Theatre Royal, lobbied Playford for increased funding without success, pointing out that world-class performing arts venues were generally subsidised by the government. Hurtle Morphett, a former State President of the LCL, quipped that if Playford [...] "had wanted to convert the Art Gallery on North Terrace into a power house <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it without hesitation". In the 1960s, the Adelaide Festival started, while the Australian Dance Theatre and the State Theatre Company of South Australia was founded in the capital, with minimal assistance from Playford's government. The festival was well-received despite the effect of censorship in a state well known for social conservatism. With the success of the festival, public interest in arts increased, and with increasing calls for government funding, particularly from Dunstan, Playford finally agreed to fund the [...] "non-productive area" [...] in 1963 by allocating funding for the eventual building of the Festival Centre.|$|E

500|$|... "Father's Day" [...] was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive reception. Piper stated that this was her favourite episode of the first series, and the most emotionally taxing for her to perform. SFX praised the way the concept of time was explored {{as well as the}} accurate representation of the '80s, and stated that Dingwall gave [...] "one of the series' best performances" [...] as Pete Tyler. However, the reviewer thought that the Reapers were the let-down of the episode, finding that [...] "the episode doesn't feel as much like horror as it should". Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode an A for the emotional impact and the acting. Blumburg did note, however, that there were [...] "enormous logical gaps" [...] involving [...] "glowing TARDIS keys and under-explained paradoxes". In 2013, Radio Times reviewer Mark Braxton described it as [...] "a time-travel tale with immense heart" [...] and highlighted the shift of identification from the Doctor to Rose and the acting of Piper and Dingwall. Braxton, on the other hand, felt that the Reapers were redundant and the episode would have done [...] "equally well if you scythed the Reapers from the script". Reviewing [...] "Father's Day" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins gave it a grade of [...] "A", finding the story powerful. In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith praised the emotion and the dilemma, which he felt was not heavy-handed. He was also positive about the direction and Dingwall's performance, though he felt that removing the Doctor from the plot suggested that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> something else to resolve it, and he was not a fan of the scene where the Doctor tells two ordinary people how important their lives are, because it was [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "disconnected" [...] {{from the rest of the}} story. Coauthor Graeme Burk was also positive, writing that it may be [...] "the best story this season". He called the direction [...] "wonderful" [...] and the script [...] "sublime", and noted how the story was more about family than time travel.|$|E
