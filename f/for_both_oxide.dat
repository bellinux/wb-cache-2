The calculated heats of formation are systematically about 40 kJ/mol less exothermic than the measured values. Based on estimated corrections for zero-point energies and H(298. 15) -H(0), the discrepancy is almost entirely electronic in origin. The decreasingly exothermic ΔHfox with decreasing ionic radius (i. e. LaPO 4 more exothermic than ScPO 4) results from the higher charge localization on the oxide anion (O 2 -) relative to the phosphate anion (PO 43 -). The lattice energy, of course, becomes more negative with decreasing ionic radius <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>oxide</b> and phosphate phases, but does so more rapidly for the oxide, making the reaction less exothermic as ionic radius becomes smaller.

The approach taken {{in this study}} was to use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to predict the thermodynamic energy barriers of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for three MOF functionalizations. A Zr-MIL- 125 MOF design was selected for this study that incorporates three linker designs, a 1, 4 -benzenedicarboxylate (BDC), BDC functionalized with an amino group (BDC+NH 2), and BDC functionalized with nitro group (BDC+NO 2). The study found several key differences between homogeneous planar catalyst thermodynamics and MOF based thermodynamics, the most significant being the non-unique or heterogeneity of reaction sites.

40|$|Manganese is a {{commonly}} occurring mineral found in soil and sediments that takes part in chemical reactions in groundwater and soil systems. It plays {{a significant role}} in controlling the environmental fate and transport of organic and inorganics by facilitating redox reactions. The reactivity of manganese oxides with some emerging contaminants like 4 -tert octylphenol (OP) in aqueous systems is yet to be explored. Additionally, manganese's use within treatment systems designed to remove trace organics is yet to be fully developed. This research work explores the reactivity of manganese oxide to degrade OP in aqueous systems. The rate equation has been determined by conducting experiments at various conditions of oxide and organic loading as well as different pH's. The reaction order was found to be ? 1. 1 <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>oxide</b> as well as the organic. The reactivity was much higher under acidic conditions. The presence of metals and humic acids greatly reduced the reactivity. The primary reaction by-product observed in the system was 4 -(2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentan- 2 yl) benzene- 1, 2 -diol. Magnetic manganese ferrites were further created in the laboratory using a novel combustion method in order to blend the catalytic properties of manganese with the magnetic and structural properties of ferrites. These laboratory prepared catalysts were thoroughly characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, HR-TEM, and BET. Their magnetic properties have also been studied. These manganese ferrites offer the potential to enhance hydroxyl radical production within catalytic ozonation systems. Thus their catalyst effectiveness was determined by measuring R_(ct), ozone exposure, hydroxyl radical production, and ozone decomposition. The effect of catalyst type, catalyst dosage, pre-ozonation, pH, and presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the hydroxyl radical production during catalytic ozonation was also explored. An increase in ozone dosage, catalyst dosage, and PVA content enhanced organic removal in the system. Organic removal was lower at a decreased system pH, in the presence of DOM, and with increasing levels of Mn incorporated into the catalyst. Pre-ozonation of the catalyst at lower dosages did not {{have an effect on the}} system, though extensive pre-ozonation greatly reduced catalyst activity.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a newly developed mechanism and predictive {{model for the}} corrosion of Alloy 800. The Fe-Cr-Ni Alloy (Incoloy 800) is mainly used for steam generator (SG) tubing in CANDU and PWR reactors and is a candidate material for the proposed Canadian Supercritical Water Reactor (SCWR) in which it will be exposed to extreme conditions of high radiation flux and large temperature gradients. The influence of gamma radiation and water chemistry conditions on the corrosion behaviour of Alloy 800 are studied in this work. Ionizing radiation creates reducing (•eaq–, •H, •O 2 -) and oxidizing radiolysis (•OH, H 2 O 2, O 2) products that affect the redox chemistry, controlling corrosion. Water chemistry conditions including pH, temperature and redox agents can significantly influence the corrosion kinetics. A systematic study of Alloy 800 corrosion was carried out to investigate {{the effect of these}} solution conditions. This analysis was used to develop a mechanistic model that takes into account both metal dissolution and oxide formation during the corrosion of Alloy 800. This model is designed to predict the effect of different variables on the corrosion behaviour of Alloy 800 in extreme environments where direct corrosion measurement is nearly impossible. A series of electrochemical experiments and corrosion tests along with post-test surface analyses were performed in order to gather information on the composition and thickness of the oxide formed during corrosion and the metal cations dissolved in the solution. This combination of electrochemical measurements and surface analyses provided a highly-detailed understanding of Alloy 800 corrosion, allowing a mechanism to be proposed. The proposed mechanism can explain the corrosion behaviour of Alloy 800 in a variety of environments and temperatures, including aqueous and steam corrosion. The principles behind the proposed mechanism were used to develop a model to account <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>oxide</b> formation and metal cation dissolution.

40|$|Fast Reactor Fuel Type and Reactor Safety Performance R. Wigeland, Idaho National Laboratory J. Cahalan, Argonne National Laboratory The {{sodium-cooled}} {{fast neutron}} reactor is currently being evaluated for the efficient transmutation of the highly-hazardous, long-lived, transuranic elements that are present in spent nuclear fuel. One of the fundamental choices that will be made is {{the selection of the}} fuel type for the fast reactor, whether oxide, metal, carbide, nitride, etc. It is likely that a decision on the fuel type will need to be made before many of the related technologies and facilities can be selected, from fuel fabrication to spent fuel reprocessing. A decision on fuel type should consider all impacts on the fast reactor system, including safety. Past work has demonstrated that the choice of fuel type may {{have a significant impact on}} the severity of consequences arising from accidents, especially for severe accidents of low probability. In this paper, the response of sodium-cooled fast reactors is discussed <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>oxide</b> and metal fuel types, highlighting the similarities and differences in reactor response and accident consequences. Any fast reactor facility must be designed to be able to successfully prevent, mitigate, or accommodate all consequences of potential events, including accidents. This is typically accomplished by using multiple barriers to the release of radiation, including the cladding on the fuel, the intact primary cooling system, and most visibly the reactor containment building. More recently, this has also included the use of ‘inherent safety’ concepts to reduce or eliminate the potential for serious damage in some cases. Past experience with oxide and metal fuel has demonstrated that both fuel types are suitable for use as fuel in a sodium-cooled fast reactor. However, safety analyses for these two fuel types have also shown that there can be substantial differences in accident consequences due to the neutronic and thermophysical properties of the fuel and their compatibility with the reactor coolant, with corresponding differences in the challenges presented to the reactor developers. Accident phenomena are discussed for the sodium-cooled fast reactor based on the mechanistic progression of conditions from accident initiation to accident termination, whether a benign state is achieved or more severe consequences are expected. General principles connecting accident phenomena and fuel properties are developed from the oxide and metal fuel safety analyses, providing guidelines that can be used as part of the evaluation for selection of fuel type for the sodium-cooled fast reactor...|$|E

We present results on the characterization of two different ways of adhering the up-converter with this fluorescent material to bifacial solar cells: by dissolving the powder in a spin-on oxide and by dissolving it in a silicone gel. The improvement in photocurrent detected <b>for</b> <b>both</b> the <b>oxide</b> and silicone alternatives when including the QDs is 60 % better than without them. It is shown that the absorption and emission characteristics of the PbS QDs embedded in oxide and silicone can be tuned into to the desired spectral region.

40|$|The dibasic amino acid, L-arginine, is a {{substrate}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> nitric <b>oxide</b> synthase (NOS) and arginase and therefore, {{plays an}} important role in cell signaling and cell growth. We examined the effects of various NOS inhibitors on L-arginine transport into rat renal brush border membrane (BBM) vesicles. L-Arginine uptake was stimulated in the presence of an inwardly directed Na 1 gradient and an imposed inside negative potential in BBM but not basolateral membrane vesicles. In BBM vesicles, the L-arginine analogs, N-iminoethyl-L-orinithine and Nw-mono-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) were potent inhibitors of L-arginine uptake (IC 50 of 0. 48 and 0. 82 mM, respectively), while N w-nitro-L-arginine was less active (IC 50 5 10 mM) and N w-nitro-L...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe wetting of {{refractory}} substrates by oxide alloys {{has been}} investigated using a high-temperature sessile drop bench. The {{aim of this study}} was to select the best crucible material for directional solidification processes such as the Bridgman, edge-defined film-fed growth or micro-pulling down methods. Contact angles and surface tension were determined via high-resolution imaging. The O 2 partial pressure in the furnace atmosphere was also measured. Alumina and a eutectic ceramic called A/YAG/Z (Al 2 O 3 /Y 3 Al 5 O 12 /ZrO 2) were studied by investigating the following systems: alumina/molybdenum, alumina/tungsten and alumina/iridium; A/YAG/Z–molybdenum, A/YAG/Z–tungsten and A/YAG/Z–iridium. The results show intermediate wetting <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>oxides</b> (30 ° < θ < 50 °). This is an original result for A/YAG/Z. Several previous studies reported good wetting (7 ° < θ < 20 °) for alumina. Accurate surface tension values could not be obtained by image processing. Therefore, the Wilhelmy method was used, giving γ = 0. 63 ± 0. 03 N m− 1 for alumina, which is comparable to the value of 0. 67 ± 0. 03 N m− 1 reported in the literature. The surface tension obtained for A/YAG/Z was 0. 71 N m− 1, but this value was influenced by the approximate density used. A metal-like layer was observed on the apex of the drops after solidification. According to an SEM–EDS analysis, most of these layers were composed of molybdenum, tungsten and oxygen. Based on thermodynamic calculations, a mechanism which takes into account the oxidation of Mo parts and the dissolution of oxides in the drop is proposed...|$|R

The Mössbauer spectrum of Sr 0. 5 La 0. 5 FeO 3 at 4 K clearly indicates the disproportionation. <b>For</b> <b>both</b> series of <b>oxides,</b> the disproportionation seems {{to set in}} at the TN's...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{sequence}} analysis of cnorB and qnorB, <b>both</b> encoding nitric <b>oxide</b> reductases, {{was performed on}} pure cultures of denitrifiers, for which previously nir genes were analysed. Only 30 % of the 227 denitrifying strains rendered a norB amplicon. The cnorB gene was dominant in Alphaproteobacteria, and dominantly coexisted with the nirK gene, coding for the copper-containing nitrite reductase. Both norB genes were equally present in Betaproteobacteria but no linked distributional pattern of nir and norB genes could be observed. The overall cnorB phylogeny was not congruent with the widely accepted organism phylogeny based on 16 S rRNA gene {{sequence analysis}}, with strains from different bacterial classes having identical cnorB sequences. Denitrifiers and non-denitrifiers could be distinguished through qnorB gene phylogeny, without further grouping at a higher taxonomic resolution. Comparison of nir and norB phylogeny revealed that genetic linkage of both genes is not widespread among denitrifiers. Thus, independent evolution of the genes <b>for</b> <b>both</b> nitrogen <b>oxide</b> reductases does also occur...|$|R
40|$|Anodic oxide {{films were}} formed on {{comparatively}} small area of silicon substrates. Constant current mode of anodization {{has been used}} for oxidation，but during oxidation processes，the current density has been changed to go through one or more stepped transitions either step-up or step-down before the completion of the processes. This modified mode of constant current anodization showed to be effective in reducing the interface state density of a silicon/silicon-oxide system. Among the various stepped transitions in the modified mode of constant current anodization，step-down transition of current density was found to be optimum in reducing the interface-state density. The structure and composition of SiO₂/Si interface regions <b>for</b> <b>both</b> large-area <b>oxide</b> and narrow-area oxide were also investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The composition of SiO₂/Si interface of narrowarea oxide showed less stoichiometry than that of large-area oxide...|$|R
40|$|Pd {{particles}} {{supported on}} SnO 2 and GeO 2 have been structurally investigated by X-ray diffraction, (High-Resolution) transmission and {{scanning electron microscopy}} after different reductive treatments to monitor the eventual formation of bimetallic phases and catalytically tested in methanol dehydrogenation/reforming. <b>For</b> <b>both</b> <b>oxides</b> this included a thin film sample with well-defined Pd particles and a powder catalyst prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The hexagonal and the tetragonal polymorph were studied for powder GeO 2. Pd 2 Ge formation was observed on all GeO 2 -supported catalysts, strongly depending on the specific sample used. Reduction of the thin film at 573 K resulted in full transformation into the bimetallic state. The partial solubility of hexagonal GeO 2 in water and its thermal structural instability yielded Pd 2 Ge formation at 473 K, {{at the cost of}} a structurally inhomogeneous support and Ge metal formation at higher reduction temperatures. Pd on tetragonal GeO 2 entered a state of strong metal–support interaction after reduction at 573 – 673 K, resulting in coalescing Pd 2 Ge particles on a sintered and re-crystallized support, apparently partially covering the bimetallic particles and decreasing the catalytic activity. Pd 2 Ge on amorphous thin film and hexagonal GeO 2 converted methanol primarily via dehydrogenation to CO and H 2. At 573 K, formation of Pd 2 Sn and also PdSn occurred on the Pd/SnO 2 thin film. Pd 3 Sn 2 (and to some extent Pd 2 Sn) were predominantly obtained on the respective powder catalyst. Strong deactivation with increasing reduction temperature was observed, likely not based on the classical strong metal–support interaction effect, but rather on a combination of missing active structural ensembles on Sn-enriched bimetallic phases and the formation of metallic β-Sn. Correlations to Pd and its bimetallics supported on ZnO, Ga 2 O 3 and In 2 O 3 were also discussed...|$|R
