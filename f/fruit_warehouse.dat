2500|$|In December 1969, P-Orridge and Shapiro {{moved out}} of their flat and into a former <b>fruit</b> <b>warehouse</b> in Hull's docking area, {{overlooking}} the Humber. Named the Ho-Ho Funhouse by P-Orridge, the warehouse became the communal home to an assortment of counter-cultural figures, including artists, musicians, fashion designers and underground magazine producers. At Christmas 1969, a woman named Christine Carol Newby moved into the Funhouse after being thrown out of her home by her father. Having earlier befriended P-Orridge at an acid test party, Newby became P-Orridge's roommate at the Funhouse, first taking the name Cosmosis, but latterly adopting the stage name Cosey Fanni Tutti after the title of Amadeus Mozart's 1790 opera Così fan tutte. Joining COUM, Tutti initially helped in building props and designing costumes, and was there when the group began changing its focus from music to performance art and more theatrical happenings; shortly after Evetts, after being expelled from Solihull School joined COUM. The three of them lived in a derelict Georgian warehouse in Prince Street, Hull. An example performance involved the group turning up to play a gig but intentionally not bringing any instruments, something P-Orridge considered [...] "much more theatrical, farcical and light-hearted" [...] than their earlier performances.|$|E

50|$|There {{were wide}} swings {{in the price}} of prunes {{depending}} on time from the harvest. In 1901, the Association built a large dried <b>fruit</b> <b>warehouse</b> near Santa Clara's railroad station. The Cured Fruit Association disbanded in 1903. That year there was an unusually successful plum crop too large to be processed or stored in the association's warehouses. Farmers who were faced with rotting fruit sold outside of their agreement at less than the association approved price. A group of dissident members managed to obtain a majority and had the organization disbanded.|$|E

50|$|By the mid-1960s, the Dance Centre was a Covent Garden Landmark.

As a listed three-storey building, the bell-tower can still be seen rising above the other Floral Street retail units. The fruit and vegetable market was established in the 1600s as a growing area literally annexed to a convent; hence the name.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, {{the area has}} {{developed}} into a historic market district with many ethnic food purveyors, some art studios, antique dealers, unique boutiques, and other businesses setting up shop where trains once delivered produce by the ton. The lack of weekday activity is in someways compensated by retail and leisure facilities which are used primarily on weekends. Particularly in the summer months, there are open-air farmers' markets, a range of street vendors and facilities to enjoy open air drinks. Residential developers have begun to convert old factory and warehouse buildings into apartments and lofts. Examples include the Armstrong Cork Factory, Brake House Lofts, and the Otto Milk Building.

50|$|The Dryden Fruit Growers Union was {{incorporated}} in 1909 {{and the first}} <b>fruit</b> <b>warehouse</b> was constructed. That same year 18 railroad cars of apples were shipped out.

By 1915, the railroad had established a station at Dryden and by 1919, the town had its own bank and school as well as two churches. Currently, Dryden retains a post office, a general store and a small cafe called the Take A Break Cafe which has been a cafe consistently since the early 1930s.

In early August 1957, whilst playing golf at the Childwall Golf Club, with Synter's father, Dr. Joseph Sytner, Nigel Walley—a friend of Lennon’s who was an apprentice golf professional at the Lee Park Golf Club—asked Dr. Sytner if his son would book the Quarrymen at The Cavern Club in Mathew Street, Liverpool. Dr. Sytner suggested that the group should play at the golf club first, so as to assess their talent. The group set up in the downstairs lounge of the golf club, and were surprised when nearly one hundred people filed in to listen. The performance was a success, and a hat was later passed around that collected almost £15; significantly more than other groups were paid at the time. Alan Sytner phoned Walley a week later and offered the group an interlude spot on 7 August, playing skiffle between the performances of three skiffle bands at the club: Ron McKay's Skiffle Group, Dark Town Skiffle Group, and The Deltones Skiffle Group.|$|E

50|$|During the 19th century much of {{the land}} from the Uxbridge Road south to Windmill Road, east to Northfield Avenue and west to Boston Road was market gardens and orchards.

50|$|The Cashmere {{area has}} a rich history of tree fruit production, {{starting}} with the first pioneers. With {{the construction of the}} Peshastin irrigation ditch in the 1890s, ranches and sagebrush gave away to lush orchards climbing up the walls of the valley. While apples grow very well, the soils and climate are ideal for the production of pears. Bartlett and D'Anjou varieties are well represented. It is said that Cashmere might be the best place to grow pears in the US. Beginning in the 1910s, a number of orchards were opened in Cashmere {{to take advantage of the}} area's balmy climate. While many orchards have given way to development, the history of fruit production is still evident in the many orchards and historical <b>fruit</b> <b>warehouses</b> in the area. Overdevelopment is a real threat to the agricultural heritage of the area; the agreeable climate and outstanding scenery attract many people to the area.|$|R

Completed in March 1957 with {{builders}} number A1091, it was sent directly to Winnipeg to replace Midland Railway Engine Number 1. 1685 served all of its time out of Winnipeg, and only went to the U.S. for heavy maintenance. Locally, 1685 switched in and around Winnipeg on the Midland trackage which served the <b>fruit</b> <b>warehouses</b> while they were serviced by rail.During the years that 1685 ventured beyond Winnipeg, it regularly traveled to Emerson on the daily freight until that was discontinued. At times it assisted with the former Great Northern passenger train which ran between Minneapolis and Winnipeg. As built, 1685 originally had a steam generator for that purpose. 1685 was not substantially modified over the years. Other than carrying the Burlington Northern paint scheme when BN took over the Midland, and then again when she became BNSF 1685 in 1999, the only major modification was {{the removal of the}} steam generator. According to motive power rosters, 1685 was the last GP-9 owned by BNSF.|$|R
