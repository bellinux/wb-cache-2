40|$|Randomness extractors are {{important}} tools in cryptography. Their {{goal is to}} compress a high-entropy source into a more uniform output. Beyond their theoretical interest, they have recently gained attention because of their use {{in the design and}} proof of leakage-resilient primitives, such as stream ciphers and pseudorandom functions. However, for these proofs of leakage resilience to be meaningful in practice, it is important to instantiate and implement the components they are based on. In this context, while numerous works have investigated the implementation properties of block ciphers such as the AES Rijndael, very {{little is known about the}} application of side-channel attacks against extractor implementations. In order to close this gap, this paper instantiates a low-cost hardware extractor and analyzes it both from a performance and from a side-channel security point of view. Our investigations lead to contrasted conclusions. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>extractors</b> can be efficiently implemented and protected with masking. On the other hand, they provide adversaries with many more exploitable leakage samples than, e. g. block ciphers. As a result, they can ensure high security margins against standard (non-profiled) side-channel attacks and turn out to be much weaker against profiled attacks. From a methodological point of view, our analysis consequently raises the question of which attack strategies should be considered in security evaluations...|$|R
50|$|A {{principal}} {{benefit of}} using an extractor is that drawn wax comb can be re-used. When using the crush-and-strain method or extracting cut comb, the bees must rebuild the comb structure. On the other <b>hand,</b> a high-quality <b>extractor</b> {{is a significant}} expense for a hobbyists while crush-and-strain methods can require {{as little as a}} strong grip.|$|R
30|$|Many of above {{mentioned}} session initiation protocols {{are based on}} either password or both of password and smart card. However, password based protocol may suffer from password guessing attack, and smart card based protocol may suffer from smart card stolen attack by extracting information stored in smart card, even if the smart card is designed for achieving {{a certain level of}} tamper resistance (Witteman 2002). In order to solve password guessing attack and smart card stolen attack for SIP authentication scheme, we use user’s biometrics to protect user’s password and the sensitive information in smart card, since user’s biometrics have many advantages, such as it is difficult to be fabricated, distributed, lost, forgotten, guessed or copied (Li and Hwang 2010). On the other <b>hand,</b> fuzzy <b>extractor</b> can always output the same random string if the input biometrics has sufficient similarity to the stored biometrics (Dodis et al. 2004). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a biometrics-based SIP authentication scheme, and use pi calculus (Abadi and Fournet 2001) based formal verification tool ProVerif (Abadi et al. 2009) to prove authentication and security of the proposed protocol.|$|R
40|$|Finger-vein recognition, {{a new and}} {{advanced}} biometrics recognition method, is attracting the attention of researchers because of its advantages such as high recognition performance and lesser likelihood of theft and inaccuracies occurring on account of skin condition defects. However, as reported by previous researchers, {{it is possible to}} attack a finger-vein recognition system by using presentation attack (fake) finger-vein images. As a result, spoof detection, named as presentation attack detection (PAD), is necessary in such recognition systems. Previous attempts to establish PAD methods primarily focused on designing feature <b>extractors</b> by <b>hand</b> (handcrafted feature <b>extractor)</b> based on the observations of the researchers about the difference between real (live) and presentation attack finger-vein images. Therefore, the detection performance was limited. Recently, the deep learning framework has been successfully applied in computer vision and delivered superior results compared to traditional handcrafted methods on various computer vision applications such as image-based face recognition, gender recognition and image classification. In this paper, we propose a PAD method for near-infrared (NIR) camera-based finger-vein recognition system using convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the detection ability of previous handcrafted methods. Using the CNN method, we can derive a more suitable feature extractor for PAD than the other handcrafted methods using a training procedure. We further process the extracted image features to enhance the presentation attack finger-vein image detection ability of the CNN method using principal component analysis method (PCA) for dimensionality reduction of feature space and support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Through extensive experimental results, we confirm that our proposed method is adequate for presentation attack finger-vein image detection and it can deliver superior detection results compared to CNN-based methods and other previous handcrafted methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} {{notion of}} a randomness extractor is a procedure which converts any weak source of randomness into an almost uniform distribution. The conversion necessarily uses {{a small amount of}} pure randomness, which can be eliminated by complete enumeration in some, but not all, applications. Here, we consider the problem of deterministically converting a weak source of randomness into an almost uniform distribution. Previously, deterministic extraction procedures were known only for sources satisfying strong independence requirements. In this paper, we look at sources which are samplable, i. e. can be generated by an efficient sampling algorithm. We seek an efficient deterministic procedure that, given a sample from any samplable distribution of sufficiently large min-entropy, gives an almost uniformly distributed output. We explore the conditions under which such deterministic extractors exist. We observe that no deterministic extractor exists if the sampler is allowed to use more computational resources than the extractor. On the other <b>hand,</b> if the <b>extractor</b> is allowed (polynomially) more resources than the sampler, we show that deterministic extraction becomes possible. This is true unconditionally in the nonuniform setting (i. e., when the extractor can be computed by a small circuit), and (necessarily) relies on complexity assumptions in the uniform setting. One of our uniform constructions is as follows: assuming that there are problems in���ÌÁÅ�ÇÒthat are not solvable by subexponential-size circuits with¦� gates, there is an efficient extractor that transforms any samplable distribution of lengthÒand min-entropy Ò into an output distribution of length ÇÒ, whereis any sufficiently small constant. The running time of the extractor is polynomial inÒand the circuit complexity of the sampler. These extractors are based on a connection be...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{comparison}} between three extraction processes, including traditional maceration in n-hexane and ethyl alcohol, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and cyclically pressurized extraction known as rapid solid-liquid dynamic extraction (RSLDE), {{has been carried out}} for the extraction of pyrethrins, predominantly nonpolar natural compounds with insecticidal properties found in pyrethrum, an extract of certain species of chrysanthemums. Pyrethrins are often used in household insecticides and for the control of parasites on pets or livestock. Maceration is the cheapest method, but the values of the percent of extracted material compared to the weight of the dried flowers are lower. The extraction with supercritical CO 2 is less efficient than the Naviglio extractor, but it has the advantage of not requiring the use of solvents. Consequently, all three techniques are valid for the extraction of compounds from pyrethrum flowers. The results obtained show that by suitably varying the parameters of the three extraction procedures, it is possible to obtain pyrethrin extracts for use in the production of low toxicity insecticides for warm-blooded animals and low pollution. In particular, extraction with supercritical CO 2 presents an additional advantage; although oleoresin is a natural product, its extraction involves the use of solvents, while SFE is a highly efficient extraction process due to the use of CO 2 in the supercritical phase without the use of solvents. On the other <b>hand,</b> the Naviglio <b>extractor</b> is an inexpensive technique and requires a minimum energy loss when compared to the extraction with supercritical fluids. Thus, the latter is more convenient on an industrial level but is not universally applicable. Nevertheless, the supercritical extraction {{can be used as a}} medium detergent of the oleoresin produced to avoid residues of the solvents left during the extraction process. Therefore, for demonstration purposes, for the SFE CO 2 extraction process, numerical simulations have been performed, allowing for helpful results to optimize the process for further tests...|$|R
