5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> heart and returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to play Test cricket again. He approached Aubrey Oxlade, the chairman of Australian cricket's Board of Control, to ask if there was any impediment to his return to the Australian team. Oxlade told Barnes that he would be judged solely on his batting performances.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{by what he}} {{felt was}} too much individualism in the game, Schriner {{contemplated}} retiring from professional hockey in favour of taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> heart {{and returned to the}} Leafs for the 1942–43 NHL season. Schriner again announced his intention to leave the game in June 1943, this time citing past injuries to his knee and dissatisfaction with Leafs' owner Conn Smythe's contract offer for the following season.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{proposals}} {{were published in}} March 1958, and a new bill was introduced under the Ten Minute Rule, failing to gain the requisite support. After A. P. Herbert stood for Parliament {{on a platform of}} obscenity reform, the Home Office <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> heart and introduced a new bill through Roy Jenkins in 1959, a compromise between the aims of the campaigners and the goals of the Home Office. It was introduced to the House of Lords by Lord Birkett, received the Royal Assent on 29 July 1959, and came into force on 29 August 1959 as the Obscene Publications Act 1959.|$|E

5|$|After McKinley {{was assassinated}} in September 1901, Long <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> heart, and {{tendered}} his resignation to President Roosevelt on May 1, 1902. The exact reasons for this are unclear, but several factors probably contributed. First, Roosevelt had {{a close relationship with}} Long's political rival Lodge, was known to disagree with Long on naval matters, and was not welcoming of his presence at the White House. Second, an inquiry into the actions of Admiral Winfield Scott Schley around the July 1898 Battle of Santiago de Cuba had resulted in a significant amount of criticism of Long's role in the war. Third, one of his daughters died in October 1901, {{less than a month after}} McKinley's assassination. These matters drove Long into a depression, and the situation was further exacerbated when Roosevelt squabbled with him over the beginning of the war, and then made newsworthy overrides of some of his decisions. Historian Wendell Garrett notes that Roosevelt took a great personal interest in the Navy, and had difficulty working with subsequent secretaries.|$|E
5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> heart and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the Manchester City job, but the offer was {{withdrawn}} after Thaksin Shinawatra's purchase offer of the club was accepted. On 15 May 2007, Newcastle United announced that Allardyce had signed a three-year contract to succeed Glenn Roeder as manager. Ironically Newcastle then also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> owners, as Mike Ashley completed his takeover of the club. The sales of Scott Parker and Kieron Dyer raised £13million, allowing Allardyce to sign Australia international striker Mark Viduka (free transfer), utility man Alan Smith (£6million), midfielder Geremi Njitap, controversial midfielder Joey Barton (£5.5million), left-back José Enrique (£6.3million), right-back Habib Beye (£2million), and defender Abdoulaye Faye. Newcastle enjoyed a good start to the season, beating Allardyce's former club Bolton 3–1 on the opening day in a run of five wins and two draws from the opening nine league games. However they then {{had a series of}} disappointing results in the run-up to Christmas, and after gaining only one point from a possible six from bottom-of-the-table Wigan and Derby. Allardyce parted company with Newcastle United on 9 January 2008. He had gone into the meeting with chairman Chris Mort expecting to be told Newcastle had signed a new player, not expecting that Ashley and Mort had decided to instead sign Kevin Keegan to return as manager.|$|E

She lost her No. 1 ranking for the last time (to Jennifer Capriati) on 14 October 2001. In that same month, Hingis underwent surgery on her right ankle.|$|E

25|$|The murderer {{seems to}} have escaped through the study's open window and the murder was {{committed}} with an ornate dagger that was often lying about the hall.

He and Sheppard went into the study after dinner to read it but Sir Roger <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> mind and asked Sheppard to leave him alone to peruse its contents. Sheppard did so and found Parker just outside the door, {{as if he had}} been listening to what was happening within...|$|E
25|$|Wolfe is reticent {{about his}} youth, but {{apparently}} he was athletic, fit, and adventurous. Before World War I, he spied for the Austrian government's Evidenzbureau, but <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> heart {{when the war}} began. He then joined the Serbian-Montenegrin army and fought against the Austrians and Germans. That means that he was {{likely to have been}} involved in the harrowing 1915 withdrawal of the defeated Serbian army, when thousands of soldiers died from disease, starvation, and sheer exhaustion — which might help to explain the comfort-loving habits that are such a conspicuous part of his character. After a time in Europe and North Africa, he came to the United States.|$|E

25|$|As was {{the case}} for many inter-war era radicals, Corey was opposed to American {{intervention}} in a new European World War and {{was a member of the}} Keep America Out of War Committee. With signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939 and the actual eruption of European war Fraina <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> heart, however, and he resigned from the Keep America Out of War Committee and became supportive of the British war effort against Nazism. Coming on the heels of the 1937-1939 secret police terror, the apparent duplicity of Joseph Stalin in negotiating a peace pact with Adolf Hitler moved Corey away from the Communist movement for a second time — permanently.|$|E

25|$|During 2007, Copeland Council {{declared}} {{that it could}} no longer afford to maintain the remaining Saltom Pit buildings, and decided to allow the pit to fall to the mercy of the Irish Sea. Following an online campaign by myWhitehaven.net, Copeland Council <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> heart and decided to reverse this decision.

By now, Napoleon's second wave of corps was arriving and, after a few clashes, Bennigsen decided to pull back behind the Wkra after all.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778, Washington {{needed a}} {{secondary}} commander {{to lead the}} frontal assault. He unwillingly chose to put Lee in charge, as {{he was the most}} senior of his generals. At first, Lee was so reluctant {{to take part in the}} attack that Washington bestowed command onto the Marquis de Lafayette. Upon this, Lee <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> heart and requested that Lafayette cede command, which he gladly did. Washington ordered him to attack the retreating enemy, but instead, Lee ordered a retreat after only one volley of fire. After seeing this, Lafayette sent a messenger to Washington informing him of this behavior. Lee's troops retreated directly into Washington and his troops, who were advancing, and Washington dressed him down publicly. Lee responded with insubordination, for which he was arrested.|$|E
25|$|Bowman {{realizes that}} his life has been irrevocably changed.
