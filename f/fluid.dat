5|$|<b>Fluid</b> models {{describe}} plasmas {{in terms}} of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters). One simple <b>fluid</b> model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the plasma as a single <b>fluid</b> governed {{by a combination of}} Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. A more general description is the two-fluid plasma picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. <b>Fluid</b> models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Because <b>fluid</b> models usually describe the plasma {{in terms of}} a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects.|$|E

40|$|Objective {{rheological}} {{assessment of}} <b>fluids</b> given to dysphagic patients at mealtime and during videofluoroscopy {{was carried out}} using a multicenter format.

The study was carried out to determine whether perceived subjective differences between mealtime <b>fluids</b> and videofluoroscopy <b>fluids</b> could be quantified using the rheological parameters of viscosity, density, and yield stress. The results showed poor correlation between mealtime <b>fluids</b> and videofluoroscopy <b>fluids</b> over all parameters. In general, the videofluoroscopy <b>fluids</b> were more viscous, more dense, and showed higher yield stress values than their mealtime counterparts. Given these results, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that the <b>fluids</b> used during videofluoroscopy do not provide an accurate indication of swallowing ability at mealtime.

5|$|Cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> is a clear, {{colourless}} transcellular <b>fluid</b> that circulates {{around the}} brain in the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord.

The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal <b>fluid.</b> The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{development in the}} technology of <b>fluids</b> used for drilling oil and gas wells. The development relates {{to the use of}} novel <b>fluids</b> based on a Malaysian palm oil derivative as an alternative to oil based drilling <b>fluids.</b> The advantages of using oil based drilling <b>fluids</b> are well documented. However, there is increasing awareness of the serious environmental problems associated with these <b>fluids.</b> This has led to restrictions on the use of oil based drilling <b>fluids</b> {{in many parts of the}} world. The ultimate objective must be to eliminate the use of diesel and mineral oil based drilling <b>fluids.</b> There have been significant developments in the technology of water based drilling <b>fluids</b> but there are still many situations where the properties of oil based drilling <b>fluids</b> are required. The Malaysian palm oil derivative can be used to replace mineral oil in the formulation of oil based drilling <b>fluids.</b> These <b>fluids</b> are technically equivalent to oil based muds but are essentially non-toxic, readily biodegradable and based on a renewable raw material that is available locally and in large quantities. The chemistry of the palm oil derivative is described in comparison to that of diesel and mineral oils. Studies on the environmental impact of oil based drilling <b>fluids</b> cuttings are discussed. Biodegradation data is presented which indicates that sea bed recovery should be much more rapid using palm oil drilling <b>fluids</b> than conventional oil based drilling <b>fluids.</b> The formulation and properties of the new <b>fluids</b> are describes with some emphasis on their ability to withstand contamination. It is concluded that <b>fluids</b> based on Malaysian palm oil will form effective alternatives to diesel and mineral oil based drilling <b>fluids</b> in many situations...|$|R

The <b>fluid</b> in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a <b>fluid</b> skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing.
