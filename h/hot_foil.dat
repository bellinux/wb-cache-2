40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel concept of hot stamped conductors on wires in a nano- or microscale. The process of producing arrays of wires selectively on the desired contact pad by electroplating of a template foil is described. The new concept provides electrical conductivity by penetration of wire arrays through the conductive layer of a <b>hot</b> stamping <b>foil.</b> Because {{of the small}} {{cross section of the}} wires, a large surface provides a low resistance between the contact pad and the conductor. With this process the non-conductive layer of the <b>hot</b> stamping <b>foil</b> {{does not have to be}} removed. The wires are flexible and provide a good alternative for electrical connection of flexible electronics. Also the process temperature is low, which makes it possible to use materials which are sensitive to high temperatures. When renouncing the use of temperature sensitive materials, this method can be applicable for high temperature operation due to the lack of adhesive or solder...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> {{trick is}} a magic trick {{in which the}} magician places {{a small piece of}} tin or {{aluminium}} foil in a volunteer's hand, and the foil begins to rapidly increase in temperature until the volunteer has to drop it to avoid scalding their hand, and the foil is reduced to ashes on the ground. This effect is achieved by, shortly before performing the trick, surreptitiously exposing the foil to a chemical (such as mercury(II) chloride [...] ) which will cause it to rapidly oxidise. This trick can be very dangerous, since many of the chemicals used it to perform it are highly toxic; mercury(II) chloride was at one point commonly sold in magic stores in the United States, but as of 2009 most such shops had stopped stocking it due to its toxic nature.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{printing}} process via hot embossing of either grating or micro-mirror microstructures {{has been demonstrated}} in thermoplastic acrylic lacquer. Embossing experiments were performed in the temperature range 100 - 150 °C and at 80 kN force. The range of microstructures has included a dot-matrix hologram, grating-based optically variable devices (OVDs) and a micro-mirror based OVD. High quality replicas of each type of device have been fabricated using this process. Embossed replicas of grating-based OVDs have shown optical effects including image switching and color movement. For devices based on micro-mirror arrays, the embossed replicas have shown an optically variable switch between a portrait and a non-portrait image. Printing via an embossing process offers the possibility of incorporating optically variable devices into documents {{without the use of}} <b>hot</b> stamping <b>foil.</b> This is particularly relevant for documents based on polymeric substrates such as credit cards and polymer banknotes...|$|R

Holograms help in curtailing forging, and duplication of products hence are very essential for security purposes. Once stamped on a product, they cannot be removed or forged, enhancing the product at the same time.

She works builds books in small scale before evolving their size. It is part of the permanent collection at MoMA.|$|E
40|$|Magistrska naloga obravnava področje reprodukcije zlate barve na vinskih etiketah. Glede na to, da je vinska etiketa obraz vina, je v etiketni industriji pomemben tako oblikovni kot tehnološki vidik grafike. Predvsem pa je v nasičenem trgu pomembna dodana vrednost etikete, ki jo lahko dosežemo z zlato barvo. Primerjali smo kakovost treh tehnologij za reproduciranje zlate barve na samolepilni etiketni papir v zvitku, in sicer klasični vroči zlatotisk ter alternativni tehnologiji, to sta digitalni tisk (elektrofotografija) ter sitotisk. Ugotavljali smo, katera izmed tehnologij omogoča kakovostnejše odtise in je racionalnejša. Na površinsko neobdelanih odtisih testne forme smo izvedli analizo tiskovnega materiala in analizo odtisov. Analiza tiskovnega materiala je pokazala dobro pregibno odpornost uporabljenih etiketnih papirjev in minimalno hrapavost. Analiza odtisov pa je glede na izvedene teste pokazala različne rezultate. Vizualna ocena in slikovna analiza sta pokazali najboljše rezultate pri odtisih, upodobljenih z vročim zlatotiskom in elektrofotografijo. Pri meritvah adhezivnosti in abrazivnosti odtisov se je najbolje izkazal odtis, upodobljen s tehnologijo sitotiska. Po izpostavljenosti odtisov na alkohol je očitna degradacija samo na odtisu, upodobljenim z vročim zlatotiskom. Manjšo deformacijo odtisov pa sta povzročila tudi {{detergent}} in voda, medtem ko olje ni povzročilo očitnih sprememb na odtisih. Ugotovili smo, da je na umetno staranje najmanj odporen odtis, upodobljen s sitotiskom. Globoko zamrzovanje pa je največje spremembe povzročilo na odtisu, upodobljenim z vročim zlatotiskom. Vsi vzorci imajo dobro svetlobno obstojnost. Iz rezultatov meritev smo ugotovili, da lahko digitalna tehnologija vsekakor konkurira vročemu zlatemu tisku pri reprodukciji zlate barve na vinske etikete. Na koncu praktičnega dela smo oblikovali kolekcijo vinskih etiket z zlatimi in srebnimi elementi. Etiketo smo odtisnili z digitalno tehnologijo (elektofotografija). Tisk nam je omogočil tiskalnik Xeikon 3030. Tiskali smo na metaliziran etiketni papir SilverVac. The master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis {{deals with}} the field of reproduction of a golden colour on wine labels. Considering {{the fact that the}} wine label is the face of the wine, the design and the technical aspect of the graphic is important in the labelling industry. Above all, in the saturated market, the added value of the label is important, which can be achieved with a golden colour. We compared the quality of the three technologies for the reproduction of a golden colour on self-adhesive label paper in rolls: classic <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> stamping and alternative technologies such as digital printing (electrophotography) and screen printing. We have examined which of the technologies enables better quality imprints and is more rational. We analysed the printing material and the imprints on the surface of raw and untreated imprints of the test form. The analysis of the printing material showed good flexural resistance of the used labels and minimal roughness. The analysis of the imprints showed different results according to the tests carried out. Visual evaluation and image analysis showed the best results in the imprints made with <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> stamping and electrophotography. In the adhesiveness and abrasiveness measurements of the imprints, the imprint illustrated with screen printing technology was the best. After being exposed to alcohol, the obvious degradation is only on the imprint made with <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> stamping. Minor deformation of the imprints was also caused by detergent and water, while oil did not cause obvious changes. We have found out that the least resistant to artificial aging is imprint made with screen printing. Deep freezing, however, caused the biggest changes on the imprint made with <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> stamping. All samples have good light resistance. The results showed that digital technology can certainly compete with the <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> stamping when reproducing a golden colour on wine labels. At the end of the practical work we created a collection of wine labels with golden and silver elements. The label was printed with digital technology (electrophotography). The print was enabled by the Xeikon 3030 printer. We printed on the metallised label paper SilverVac...|$|E

40|$|The {{structures}} for the TRI mu P facility {{have been completed}} and commissioned. At the facility radioactive nuclides are produced to study fundamental interactions and symmetries. An important feature is the possibility to trap radioactive atoms {{in order to obtain}} and hold a pure substrate-free sample for precision measurements. In the TRI mu P facility a production target is followed by a magnetic separator, where radioactive isotopes are produced in inverse reaction kinematics. Separation up to 99. 95 % could be achieved for Na- 21. A novel transmitting thermal ionizing device was developed to stop the energetic isotopes. Some 50 % of stopped Na- 21 could be extracted and transported as low energy singly charged ions into a radio frequency quadrupole cooler and buncher with 35 % transmission efficiency. The ions are transported lossless via a drift tube and a low energy electrostatic beam line into the experimental setup. Such ions can be neutralized on <b>hot</b> metal <b>foils</b> and the resulting atoms can be stored in a magneto-optical trap. The functioning of that principle was demonstrated with stable Na extracted from the thermal ionizer, radioactive beams will follow next. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Fraunhofer ICT has {{developed}} a small volume/-calorimeter that permits kinetic and thermodynamic characteristic values and strongly exothermic reactions to be determined isothermally. The reaction heat developed in a micro-reactor induces a thermoelectric force in Seebeck elements {{above and below the}} reactor that can be translated to the corresponding heat performance of the reaction. The Peltier element serves to adjust a constant temperature difference between the micro-reactor and the heat withdrawal block that is under the stack of reactor, Seebeck element, and Peltier element. The system is calibrated using an integrated <b>hot</b> supporting <b>foil.</b> These minimal losses are considered in the calorimetric balancing through a temperature and output dependent loss factor. The example reaction was the nitration of toluene the kinetic and thermodynamic characteristic values of which are well documented. The heat of reaction in the micro-reactor agreed well with published val ues. The continuous -calorimeter is suitable to characterize exothermic reactions in micro-reactors. Because of the large surface/volume ratio and the thereby resulting small time constants of a few seconds (RC 1 of Mettler-Toledo RC 1 reaction calorimeter: 60 sec) {{for the first time as}} well an isothermal measurement is possible of rapid exothermic reactions. Also, critical process conditions can be studied with respect to their energy potential and quantitatively analyzed.

This plasma sprayed coating is {{a variant of the}} patented PS 304 coating and has been formulated to provide higher density, smoother surface finish and better dimensional stability than PS 304. PS 400 is comprised of a nickel-molybdenum binder that provides strength, creep resistance and extreme oxidative and dimensional stability. Chromium oxide, silver and barium-calcium fluoride eutectic are added to the binder to form PS 400. Tribological properties were evaluated with a pin-on-disk test rig in sliding contact to 650 C.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} techniques {{that can be}} used for the decoration of polymeric substrates, dye sublimation, self-colouring, paint spraying, granular injection paint technology, pad printing, in-mould decoration and <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> stamping. Dye sublimation was selected for this research as it was found to be both the most relevant technology area for IDT Systems Limited and the least understood. It is a customisable digital process which uses specialist Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK) inkjet-able dyes that are transferred into a substrate via a carrier. During the process heat is applied which transforms the dyes from a solid into a gas phase. Analysis of literature identified a number of knowledge gaps, which are addressed during this research and detailed in this report. Initial experimentation concluded that the sublimation dyes can penetrate a range of commercially available amorphous polymers, comparably to semi-crystalline types. These findings dispute previously published work, but these also lacked rigorously recorded methodologies to confirm comparable data. All of the materials, equipment and methodologies used throughout this research were therefore developed in this report. Further detailed experimentation was completed, using amorphous polycarbonate, (PC) and semi-crystalline polybutylene terephthalate, (PBT) focusing on the process time and temperature to understand their influence on the level of dye penetration. The results revealed that increasing the process temperature and time improves the level of dye penetration and that comparable penetration levels were noted at 140 - 180 oC. Further research identified the importance of free volume in the polymer, this increases in size and connectivity as temperature increases above the glass transition points. Additional experimentation confirms that the free volume enables the dyes to penetrate into the polymer. Characterisation of the CMYK sublimation dyes was completed using Differential Scanning Calorimetry enabling the thermal transitions to be identified. Visual experimentation confirmed that the dyes start and finish sublimation between 145 - 210 oC. As no software tool existed to visualise the dye penetration, one was developed using MatLab. The tool imports and then interpolates the data and graphically outputs it for the user. This allows a quicker set up time of the process and reduces the number of samples to be destroyed. As a direct result of the innovations described in this report, the industrial sponsor has benefited with an increase in commercial exploitation. Aspects of this research have been published, presented and a patent has been published, details are provided within...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in gas foil bearing technology {{have led to}} numerous advanced high-speed rotating system concepts, {{many of which have}} become either commercial products or experimental test articles. Examples include Oil-Free microturbines, motors, generators and turbochargers. The driving forces for integrating gas foil bearings into these high-speed systems are the benefits promised by removing the oil lubrication system. Elimination of the oil system leads to reduced emissions, increased reliability, and decreased maintenance costs. Another benefit is reduced power plant weight. For rotorcraft applications, this would be a major advantage, as every pound removed from the propulsion system results in a payload benefit. Implementing foil gas bearings throughout a rotorcraft gas turbine engine is an important long-term goal that requires overcoming numerous technological hurdles. Adequate thrust bearing load capacity and potentially large gearbox applied radial loads are among them. However, by replacing the turbine end, or hot section, rolling element bearing with a gas foil bearing many of the above benefits can be realized. To this end, engine manufacturers are beginning to explore the possibilities of <b>hot</b> section gas <b>foil</b> bearings in propulsion engines. This paper presents a logical follow-on activity by analyzing a conceptual rotorcraft engine to determine the feasibility of a foil bearing supported core.
