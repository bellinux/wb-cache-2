[...] Before he could <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> however, he needed to win the impending provincial election.

Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights.

Masters' friend, William Higgins, had been recording sound for his films (but not using it) since 1978, and Falcon Studios released their first sound film in 1979. [...] "I hated sound at this time.

6000|$|It is {{impossible}} that the home-keeping yokel should {{have heard of}} the [...] "obscure" [...] (sic!)

[...] It {{is impossible}} that he should have had [...] "an intimate knowledge of the castle of Elsinore," [...] though an English troupe of actors visited Denmark in 1587. To Will all this knowledge was impossible; for these and many more exquisite reasons the yokel's authorship of the plays is a physical impossibility. But scholars neither invent nor tolerate such strange liberties with time and place, with history, geography, and common sense.

It is assumed, rather lightly in many cases, {{that he has done}} [...] "good work," [...] as they say--the sort of good work that is usually no good at all, that increases nothing, changes nothing, stimulates no one, leads no whither. That, surely, must be altered. We must see to it that our leading schoolmasters at any rate must be men of insight and creative intelligence, men who could at a pinch write a good novel or produce illuminating criticism or take an original part in theological or philosophical discussion, or <b>do</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> minor things.

One calls for food, another for clothes, and a third is sick, and I must see that he has a physician. My other possessions, too, are a constant care.

But even it was almost outshone by the joyous flush on her cheeks as she stood waving the little hand that did not hold Daddy's. She was certainly a picture to dream of! Her father's eyes lost nothing of her dainty beauty. He was so proud of her that he almost forgot to wish that she had been a boy.
