Beezel seems to detest Amy {{and anyone who}} comes between him and Anson, but Anson only sees Beezel as innocent. One day, Amy witnesses Beezel masturbating to summer vacation photos of Anson in a swimsuit. Beezel attacks her and violently urinates on her. Anson still finds his pet innocent but Amy threatens to leave if he doesn't get rid of Beezel. Caring more about his relationship, Anson agrees {{to find a new}} home for him. That night, from a closet, Beezel tearfully watches the couple make love (whilst sodomizing himself with a hairbrush and dry <b>humping</b> a stuffed teddy bear). The next day {{when it comes time to}} take Beezel away, he is nowhere to be found. Amy goes outside to look. Beezel then runs her over with a truck and attempts to shoot her to death with a shotgun, but she chases him into the street and begins beating him with a shovel, which is witnessed by a group of children attending a birthday party at a neighboring house. When Anson approaches to see what is happening, Amy tries to explain Beezel's motives. Beezel acts innocent and Anson sides with his cat. The children of the party then attack and murder Amy for beating up Beezel, stabbing her with plastic forks. Anson grabs Beezel, as Beezel again fantasizes about French kissing his owner.|$|E

However, in many Egyptian roads, {{considerable}} number of these <b>humps</b> is randomly placed without proper engineering studies and justifications.

The paper used 52 speed <b>humps</b> located in an intercity two-lane, two-way road that connects two cities, Tahta and Gerga, in Upper Egypt. The total length of this road is about 34  km. Pavement condition index (PCI), in road sections, near speed <b>humps</b> in the two directions of travel were calculated from the visual inspection measurements.

There {{is a need to}} develop standard speed <b>hump</b> warning signs as well as to determine speed <b>hump</b> markings that take into account both motorist comprehension and community preference. This study had two major goals. The first was to examine preference for various configurations for signs that are placed next to a speed <b>hump</b> as well as for lead signs when approaching a series of speed <b>humps.</b> The second was to examine which type of speed <b>hump</b> markings people prefer. There were 103 research participants in this study. In the first task, participants developed speed <b>hump</b> signs that included speed <b>hump</b> symbols, speed advisory messages, and location indication messages. In the second task, participants compared ten different speed <b>hump</b> markings and determined which markings they: (1) liked the most, (2) thought made it easiest to actually detect a <b>hump,</b> (3) thought made it most difficult to do so, and (4) thought best indicated a raised pedestrian crosswalk. The paper discusses the various speed <b>hump</b> sign configurations and roadway markings that participants preferred or thought would most effectively warn drivers. The results of this study will be used in future research to objectively evaluate comprehension, conspicuity, and driver behavior for different speed <b>hump</b> sign and marking designs...|$|R

[...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see <b>humping.</b> We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut and the next time you see them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X rating—an adults only certificate.|$|E
