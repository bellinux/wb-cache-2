In particular, the paper focuses {{on the use of}} the expression to play the race card and the creative figurative language motivated by the use of this expression in the contemporary American political discourse. The aim of this paper is to show that conventional metaphors can be creatively stretched through conceptual blending, producing instances of creative figura-tive language which contributes to achieving different <b>discourse</b> <b>goals</b> and <b>discourse</b> coherence. Specifically, applying conceptual integration theory, the paper analyzes innovative conceptual blends, motivated by the conventional CARD GAME metaphor, which are used to achieve different <b>discourse</b> <b>goals.</b> In addition, such creative metaphorical blends also provide discourse coherence at the intertextual level.

In this thesis four studies were conducted to learn what discourse goals are accomplished through social movie quoting and if Roberts and Kreuz’ (1994) <b>discourse</b> <b>goal</b> taxonomy for figurative language would be a suitable theoretical framework {{for the study of the}} social movie quoting phenomenon. Study 1 examined movie quoting without being tied to any specific movie quotes. Demographic variables were correlated with common movie viewing preferences, behaviors, and attitudinal responses. Study 2 had participants generate a realistic movie quote they would actually use for accomplishing each of several specific discourse goals in conversation. Study 3 had participants generate a plain English interpretation of the movie quotes selected from Study 2. Study 4 participants rated the movie quotes and plain English equivalents generated in studies 2 and 3 for aptness and likelihood for use in conversation with the knowledge (Condition 1) and without the knowledge (Condition 2) of the underlying <b>discourse</b> <b>goal.</b> Quotes were randomized and counterbalanced so that half the participants in each condition received all movie quotes first (Group 1) and half the plain English first (Group 2). Results indicated that movie quotes were used to accomplish a set of discourse goals most similar to the traditional figures of speech of hyperbole, understatement, metaphor, and simile. The most common purposes of social movie quoting were to compare similarities and either downplay or exaggerate these similarities. Knowledge of the underlying <b>discourse</b> <b>goal</b> significantly increased the aptness and likelihood of both quote types for several discourse goals. The order of presentation did not significantly affect participants’ ratings. The aptness of the quote was strongly related to participants’ likelihood of using a particular quote, regardless of quote type. Future research should focus on capturing naturally occurring language to further increase the ecological validity of these results. It appears that the act of quoting movie lines in conversation is heavily dependent on individual preferences and a method should be developed to capture movie quoting in such a way.

Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of how people generate metaphors or identify an apt vehicle for a given topic of me-taphors. Specifically, we examine how the process and prod-uct of metaphor production differ between two <b>discourse</b> <b>goals</b> of metaphor, namely an explanatory purpose (e. g., to clarify) and a literary purpose (e. g., to aesthetically pleasing). Exper-iment 1 analysed the metaphors (or vehicles) generated in the metaphor production task, and demonstrated that people iden-tified more prototypical exemplars of the property attributed to the topic as a vehicle for explanatory metaphors than for liter-ary metaphors. In addition, it was found that explanatory me-taphors were more apt and conventional, and had high topic-vehicle similarity than literary metaphors, while literary meta-phors were more familiar and imageable than explanatory me-taphors. Experiment 2 used a priming paradigm to assess the online availability of prototypical and less prototypical mem-bers of the topic property during metaphor production. The re-sult was that both prototypical and less prototypical members were activated in producing literary metaphors, while neither members were activated in the production of explanatory me-taphors. These findings indicate that the process of metaphor production is affected by <b>discourse</b> <b>goals</b> of metaphor, and sug-gest that only prototypical members of the category are rapidly searched for a vehicle during the production of explanatory metaphors, while both prototypical and less prototypical mem-bers are searched to generate literary metaphors...|$|R

By contrast, little work has been conducted on {{the investigation of the}} discourse goals for the speaker or the writer's figurative production. This study, going beyond the customary metalinguistic approaches to figurative investigation, aimed at shedding light into a number of different discourse goals as they were identified by Iranian EFL undergraduates in sentences containing figurative language based on 4 independent variables: Figure Type, Tenor Concreteness, Context, and Modality. The participants were given a number of sentences, containing both metaphors and similes, and were asked to choose as many 12 discourse goals as possible which they considered to be the reasons for triggering the utterances. The results indicated that the <b>discourse</b> <b>goal</b> of Compare Similarities was more frequently selected for similes than for metaphors by the participants. The Context variable turned out to have significant interaction with the choice of the discourse goals of Provoke Thought, Get Attention, Clarify, and Contrast Differences, whereas the factor of Modality influenced only Add Emphasis. Also, 3 goals, Add Interest, Clarify, and Show Positive Emotion significantly affected Tenor Concreteness. Comparatively, some marked differences were noticed between Iranian L 2 learners and native speakers.

Moreover, this research also explains how the metadiscourse functions are applied {{in relation to the}} moves. The method of this study is qualitative research. The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, interactional metadiscourse is infrequently used. In terms of functions of metadiscourse in relation to moves, <b>discourse</b> <b>goal</b> (sub-type of frame markers) characterizes Move 2. Then, the resources of boosters which characterize move 4 are show, found, obtained, embodied, and revealed. Conclude (resources of frame markers sub-type—discourse stage) characterizes move 5. Some metadiscourse types related to the moves applied are evidentials, hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions. There are also certain resources in certain metadiscourse types which exist in certain move such as the resource of transitions and code glosses. In conclusion, only few abstracts from science support support Day’s (1995) model. In the use of metadiscourse, the use of interactive metadiscourse is dominant.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Computer {{generation}} of natural language requires {{the ability to}} make reasoned choices from a large number of possible things to say as well as from a large number of expressive possibilities. This paper examines in detail how one influence on a generated text, focus of attention, can be used to constrain the many possibilities that a generation system must consider. A computational treatment of focus of attention is presented {{that can be used to}} constrain what the system needs to consider when deciding what to say next. In this process, information is produced that provides constraints on which words and syntactic structures best express the system's intent, thus ensuring that its resulting text is coherent.

Two key {{objectives}} of conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) systems are (1) eliciting case facts {{in a manner}} that minimizes the user’s burden in terms of resources such as time, information cost, and cognitive load, and (2) integrating CBR with other problem solving modalities.

The dialogue engine determines when CBR or other problem-solving techniques are needed to achieve pending <b>discourse</b> <b>goals.</b> Conversely, the CBR component has the full resources of a dialogue engine to handle topic changes, interruptions, clarification questions by either the user or the system, and other speech acts that arise in problem-solving dialogues. ...|$|R

A system that explains interactively {{must be able to}} recognize how to elaborate its answer to produce an explanation that meets a listener’s informational needs. Sometimes, listeners ask questions that digress from the purpose of the discussion. Therefore, a system that provides interactive explanations must also be able to distinguish pertinent questions from questions that digress from the discussion purpose. It must also be able to recognize questions that are incoherent. This paper discusses the representation issues that are involved in building such a system. The Interactive Discourse Planner (IDP) plans text to describe and/or justify a domain plan inter-actively. To perform these tasks, both the system’s text plans and the domain plans are represented uniformly. The uniform representation of information makes it possible for IDP to access both domain and discourse information to recognize how to plan each response. The system’s planning rules refer to information at both the domain- and discourse-level. Therefore, these levels of information are reasoned about together to plan additional discourse. IDP uses questions from the user to recognize how to extend its own text plan in a way that both satisfies its listener and achieves the system’s <b>discourse</b> <b>goal.</b> In {{the process of trying to}} recognize ways to expand its own text plan, IDP can detect three types of digressions from the discourse purpose that the user can initiate with a question.

The main goal when redescribing an entity is to re-evoke the appropriate discourse entity.

This paper investigates what <b>discourse</b> <b>goals</b> can be fulfilled by hyperbole, using conversations from some classic Hungarian films as the data. The reason why film conversations were selected is that {{the knowledge of the}} story and the transparency of the characters' intentions make the understanding of communicative motives easy. Besides, the situations in feature films are very similar to spontaneous everyday interactions. Analyses demonstrate that hyperbolic utterances convey the speakers' attitudes, either real or only presented, towards the topic of conversation. According to the social psychological laws of public behaviour, the expression of emotional relation or attitude is mostly subordinated to the speaker's attempt to construct an intended impression on conversational partners. Thus, the use of hyperbole has two main goals: to express emotions and to reach a desired self-presentation...|$|R
