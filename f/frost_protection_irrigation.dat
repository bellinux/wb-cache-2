40|$|Water table {{control has}} been {{successfully}} tested to improve the sustainability of water management in cranberry production. In the province of Québec (Canada), three sites were investigated to determine the optimum water table depth below soil surface (WTD) using three criteria: (1) increasing yield without decreasing fruit quality; (2) minimizing {{the amount of water}} needed by the sprinkler system; and (3) avoiding hypoxic stresses in the rhizosphere. Our results show that the final yield, the berry sugar content, the total number of berries, the number of berries per upright, and the fruit set were maximized when the WTD was 60 cm. Sprinkler water savings of 77 % were obtained where the WTD was shallower than 66 cm. In order to avoid hypoxic conditions due to poor drainage, the water level in the canals surrounding the beds should be lowered to 80 cm when a rainfall or a <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> <b>irrigation</b> is anticipated. All sides of a block of beds must be surrounded by canals to ensure a uniform WTD and to avoid lateral hydraulic gradients that could cause peripheral seepage losses...|$|E

Ten of the fourteen acres in the Peerless fernery were equipped with oil heaters for protection against damaging temperatures. The fouracre test plot was not equipped with heaters and was separated from the rest of the fernery by a high board fence which isolated it from the heated area. The test plot was located in the northern part of the fernery, which made the effect from the heaters in the other plot too small to be of consequence since the nocturnal air drift was mostly from the north.

40|$|Commercial {{production}} of the kiwiberry (Actinidia arguta) is relatively new in northern and western Europe. When introducing the kiwiberry to a region where fruit growers have no experience with Actinidia, many challenges {{have had to be}} overcome. For instance, the profile of the growers willing to invest in this crop is very diverse, the geographic regions have their specific climatic and soil conditions and, clearly, cultivation of the kiwiberry has very specific requirements. Therefore, proper technical advice is extremely important to obtain productive orchards. Although A. arguta is quite hardy, spring frosts are a major concern and a strongly limiting factor for yields in Europe. In recent initiatives, different cultivars with a commercial potential are being screened for frost tolerance, but currently, <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> using sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> is in many cases the only and most effective system. However, growing kiwiberries in greenhouses appears to be a valuable and commercially viable alternative in The Netherlands and Belgium. The combination of a recommended fertilizer program and irrigation management, artificial pollination methods, appropriate pruning and good training {{has proven to be a}} very successful approach with yields as high as 18 t/ha five years after planting. Apart from establishing productive orchards, the successful introduction of kiwiberry as a novel fruit onto the market involves other important issues as well. Since the price of new fruits is usually rather high, growers have to realize that a product quality is essential for long-term success. Therefore, much attention must be paid to efficient grading and stringent quality control...|$|R

40|$|The Russian River <b>Frost</b> <b>Protection</b> Regulation (“Frost Protection Rule”) {{states that}} “any {{diversion}} {{of water from}} the Russian River stream system, including the pumping of hydraulically connected groundwater, for purposes of frost protection” must be diverted in accordance with an approved “water demand management program” (WDMP), or the diversion “is an unreasonable method of diversion and use and a violation of Water Code section 100. ” The California State Water Resources Control Board (“State Water Board”) adopted the <b>Frost</b> <b>Protection</b> Rule on September 20, 2011. Litigation over the rule culminated in the decision in Light et al. v. State Water Res. Control Bd., 226 Cal. App. 4 th 1463 (2014), which confirmed that the State Water Board has authority to adopt quasi-legislative rules for the reasonable use and reasonable manner of water diversion. The court also reiterated that the reasonable use doctrine applies to all water rights—including riparian and pre- 1914 appropriators. Finally, the court approved the State Water Board’s reliance on industry-led consortiums of water right holders to assist in the management of the <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> program through the adoption of the WDMPs.

The purpose of <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer is to prevent frost from penetrating down through the pavement and into the sub-soils. Frost susceptible soils under the road can be cause damages on the roads or other structures due to frost heave or reduced capacity characteristics thaw period. "Frost heave" is the term given to the upwards displacement of the ground surface caused by the formation of ice within soils or aggregates (Rempel et al., 2004).

Based on the capillary rise, the mechanics of frost heave phenomenon is based on the interaction between aggregates and water, as suggested by Konrad and Lemieux in 2005 that said that the fraction of material below the 0. 063 mm sieve for coarse-grained soils must be controlled so as to reduce the sensitivity to frost heave. The study conducted in this thesis project is divided in two parts: - the analysis of the coarse grained aggregates used in <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> layer in Norway; - the analysis of the frost heave phenomenon in the laboratory under known boundary conditions, through the use of the most widely used method, the frost heave test, in” closed system” (without access of water). ...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{will discuss}} the Light case from the {{perspective}} of my firm’s vineyardist clients—including our understanding of the Reasonable Use Doctrine and its application to the <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> regulation. The underlying premise of the <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> regulation is the theory that reductions in streamflow caused by <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> diversions cause or contribute to stranding of juvenile salmonids in the exposed gravel banks of the rivers and streams in the Russian River watershed. One of the key issues in Light was whether good science supports this theory. From the perspective of my vineyardist clients, the State Board relied on very weak science in support of this theory. As always, perspective is crucial in determining what level of science is necessary to support a regulation that will impose major costs on vineyardists in Mendocino and Sonoma Counties. From the perspective of my clients, there ought to be sound science underlying the relationship between frost diversions and salmonid strandings before imposing any water use regulation. In contrast, members of the environmental and academic community seem less interested in examining the science and more inclined to accept the State Board’s conclusion tying frost diversions to salmonid strandings—at least in my conversations with these folks.

40|$|Abstract – Vineyards are a {{dominant}} feature of many landscapes in Mediterranean-climate regions. We {{examined the effects}} of streamflow declines, associated with vineyard water-withdrawals for <b>frost</b> <b>protection,</b> on benthic-macroinvertebrate communities at three sites along three small streams in the Mediterranean-climate region of Northern California. One site was heavily affected by water withdrawals for <b>frost</b> <b>protection,</b> the other two were not. In addition, we examined relationships between vineyard coverage and benthic-macroinvertebrate community response using data from 59 sampling events at 39 sites along 35 small streams in Napa County, California. We tested three a priori hypotheses in terms of the response of biological traits of benthic macroinvertebrates to high vineyard coverage: (1) proportion of individuals with semi-voltine (i. e., one generation every 2 years) life cycles would be lower compared to those with uni- and multi-voltine cycles, (2) proportion of individuals able to undergo diapause would be higher, and (3) proportion of individuals with the ability to burrow into the substrate would be higher. In the three-site study, we found that vineyard water-withdrawals for <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> coincided with consistently lower values in both the benthic-macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) developed for Northern California streams and the ratio of Ephemeroptera–Plecoptera–Trichoptera to Odonata–Coleoptera–Hemiptera individuals (EPT/OCH), a metric developed for European Mediterranean streams. In the broader-scale study, we observed that vineyard-coverage levels above about 20 % coincided with lower values of the B-IBI. The semi-voltine life-cycle trait was lower above this level, whereas the diapause and burrowing traits were not affected...|$|R

40|$|The American {{cranberry}} (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is {{an important}} temperate woody shrub crop whose fruit has human health benefits. Cranberry acquires cold hardiness in the autumn and loses it in spring, following deacclimation. <b>Frost</b> <b>protection</b> is necessary in cranberry production {{as a means to}} reduce bud damage due to low spring temperatures. The objectives of the field studies were to evaluate two methods of sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> for <b>frost</b> <b>protection,</b> the conventional approach consisting of continuous irrigation throughout the night (CON) and intermittent cycling of sprinklers (INT) incorporating cycling on and off throughout the night, by (i) assessing bud damage and yield for cranberry cultivars 2 ̆ 7 Early Black 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Howes 2 ̆ 7, and 2 ̆ 7 Stevens 2 ̆ 7 managed under both methods and (ii) to determine the volume of water used in each method. The objectives of the laboratory studies were to (i) evaluate and quantify carbohydrates and lipids synthesized by cranberry during the cold acclimation period under a controlled environment and to (ii) determine the cold hardiness (LT 50) and lowest survival temperature (LST) of buds of economically important cranberry cultivars during acclimation. For INT to be an effective frost control method, temperature set points should be cultivar specific. Despite differences in bud damage, cranberry yield data did not show any {{significant differences between the two}} frost management methods. Since cranberry plants produce more flowers than the number of set fruit that can be supported, the remaining flowers in damaged buds may have been sufficient to produce similar yields in both methods. Substantial water savings were obtained under INT, especially on mild frost nights. Greater concentrations of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNSC) and membrane stabilizing lipids and a higher fatty acid unsaturation index were associated with low acclimation temperatures. This result suggests the importance of these compounds in increasing cold hardiness in cranberry during acclimation. In addition, a progression of freezing tolerance, determined as the LT 50 and LST, was noted in the fall for all the cranberry cultivars. Knowledge of bud hardiness in the fall is important in considering the need to protect buds.
