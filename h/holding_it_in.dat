5|$|In 1309 Sir Nicholas de Boys {{granted the}} manor of Shalden to Robert de Kendale and his wife, Margaret, {{along with her}} heirs. The manor was then held by Ralph le Mareschal indefinitely. He was still <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1310, however it had passed to Robert de Kendale {{sometime}} before 1316. Robert died in 1330, and his son Edward succeeded to the manor, but it was held by his widow Margaret until her death in 1347. Sir Edward de Kendale died in 1373, leaving a widow and a son as his heir for the manor of Shalden. Edwards's son and his brother, Thomas, both died without issue in 1375. Sir Robert Turk and his wife, Beatrice, conveyed the manor in 1376–7 to Sir William Croyser and William Bukbridge, trustees of Sir Edward de Kendale, to whom they transferred {{it in the same}} year. Edward's widow Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Croyser, soon married Sir Thomas Barre, and died in 1420. Her heir was her grandson, but the manor of Shalden passed to John de Kendale, who held it in 1428.|$|E
5|$|The island {{seems to}} have been held, in {{association}} with the local manors of Uphill and Christon, by the Bek family, who granted it to Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. Although the mechanism is unclear, it next passed to the Berkeley family with Maurice de Berkeley, the second Baron Berkeley, <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1315. The site was used again by warreners in the 14th and 15th centuries. They lived in one of the ruined priory buildings which was rebuilt. By 1453 the overlordship of the island was held by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, and in 1460 the advowson was exercised by Margaret Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury. In the years following, the ownership of a variety of estates, including Norton Beauchamp, to which Steep Holm was attached, was disputed. In the 16th century Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset took over, and then lost, large estates including Brean, to which Steep Holm was allied. The Seymour descendants recovered the estates, owning them into the 17th century, although the only activity on Steep Holm {{seems to have}} been the employment of gull watchers and fishermen. In 1684 the Norton Beauchamp estate was sold to Edward Ryder. It appears to have been auctioned by decree of the Court of Chancery 11years later in 1695, possibly because of difficulties in maintaining sea defenses along the Somerset coast; however, this {{seems to have been}} disputed in the light of outstanding mortgages. In 1699 the estates, including Steep Holm, were sold to Philip Freke of Bristol, whose descendants held it for the next 130 years. Freke's granddaughter married into the family of John Willes, who was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and Member of Parliament. During their ownership, probably around 1776, a new cottage was built on Steep Holm for fishermen. It was built using stones from the ruined priory. In 1830 the island was sold again, according to some sources this was to a cousin of John Freke Willes named William Willes; however, other sources suggest it was to a solicitor in Weston-super-Mare named John Baker.|$|E

In 1917 this stela, already tilting away from vertical, finally fell over completely after heavy rains, although it remained unbroken. In 1934 an attempt was made to raise the stela using a winch and steel cables, during which the cables snapped and the monolith fell and was broken into two pieces, which have since been joined back together using concrete. This stela bears portraits of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on its front and back.|$|E
500|$|The chase {{scene at}} the end of the game, in which Don pursues Adrienne {{throughout}} the entire mansion, took a full week to film. Homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from Adrienne pouring acid on him. Only one prosthesis was available, and it was in such bad shape by the end of filming that Williams said [...] "we were essentially <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place with the proverbial wire and bailing wax". Several scenes in Phantasmagoria involved animals, including a Doberman Pinscher, two cats, a beagle and several rats. Sierra commissioned Dave Macmillian and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals. Two cats were required to portray Adrienne's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform. Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game. The society was thanked in the credits as a result. Ultimately, all of the scenes filmed for Phantasmagoria were used in the final game. Some were edited for length and pacing, but none were cut altogether.|$|E

500|$|Stelae {{were usually}} crafted from quarried limestone, {{although}} in the Southern Maya area other types of stone were preferred. Volcanic tuff was used at Copán to craft their stelae in three dimensions. Both limestone and tuff were easily worked when first quarried and hardened with exposure to the elements. At Quiriguá a hard red sandstone was used that was unable to reproduce the three-dimensionality of Copán but was of sufficient strength that the kings of the city were able to raise the tallest free-standing stone monuments in the Americas. The Maya lacked beasts of burden and did not employ the wheel; therefore the freshly quarried blocks of stone had to be transported on rollers along the Maya causeways. Evidence {{of this has been}} found on the causeways themselves, where rollers have been recovered. The blocks were sculpted to their final form while still soft and they then hardened naturally with time. Stone was usually quarried locally but was occasionally transported over great distances. Calakmul in Mexico was one of two powerful cities that shaped the political landscape of the Classic Period, the other being Tikal. It imported black slate for one stela from the Maya Mountains, more than [...] away. Although Calakmul raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, they were sculpted from poor quality limestone and have suffered severe erosion, rendering most of them illegible. Stelae could be of substantial size; Quiriguá StelaE measures [...] from the base to the top, including the [...] buried portion <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place.
