40|$|Abstract The paper {{discusses}} the functions and effectiveness games and simulations {{in the learning}} processes, in particular as an experiential learning methodology. The paper describes {{the application of the}} game Lemonade Tycoon ™ in the development of lean manufacturing concepts. This article addresses the use of the game to teach Principles of Lean Enterprise including zero waiting time, zero inventory, scheduling, internal customer pull instead of push system; batch to <b>flow,</b> <b>cut</b> batch sizes; line balancing; and cut actual process times. Other outcomes of learning such as promoting communication and interaction, facilitating cooperative learning, encouraging peer-learning and fostering teamwork are also discussed. Games and simulations are relevant in all of the four learning phases of experiential learning and have a very positive impact on the learning and future application of lean manufacturing principles. Games are especially relevant in the generalization and application phases by helping shift learner’s personal paradigms.

40|$|Central venous {{catheter}} dysfunction is {{a frequent}} problem and often {{is defined as a}} blood flow< 300 ml/min. This prospective, cross-sectional study included 259 patients and examined the relationship between catheter blood flow and dialysis adequacy as measured by urea reduction ratio (URR), single pool urea kinetics, and online effective ionic dialysance clearance. Dialysis adequacy at blood flow rates of < 300, < 275, and < 250 ml/min; sensitivity; specificity; and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Mean blood flow was 352 ml/min (SD 48. 8). Mean blood flow < 300 ml/min occurred in 10. 5 % of the patients, and only 26 % had a URR of < 65 %. Maximum blood flows < 300 ml/min occurred in 6. 9 % of patients, and only 22. 2 % had URR < 65 %. The positive predictive value of mean blood flow of < 300 and < 275 ml/min to predict a URR < 65 % was 22 and 40 %, respectively. Using receiver operator characteristic curves, the area under the curve was not significantly different for blood flows of 300, 275, or 250 ml/min. This study indicates that mean blood flows < 300 ml/min are not commonly associated with dialysis inadequacy. Setting a single blood <b>flow</b> <b>cut</b> point of < 300 ml/min to define the need for intervention will result in a significant number of unnecessary interventions. There is a need to reexamine the definition of catheter dysfunction and expand the definition beyond blood flow rates.

40|$|M. Sc. (Mathematics) In Chapter 1, we {{consider}} the relevant theory pertaining to graphs and digraphs {{that will be used}} in the study of flows in networks. Warshall’s algorithm for reachability is also considered since it will allow us to ascertain whether some paths exist in some instance. In Chapter 2, we explore <b>flows</b> and <b>cuts</b> in networks. We define the basic concepts of source, sink, intermediate vertices, capacity, costs and lower-bounds. Feasible flows are defined, as well as the value of a <b>flow.</b> <b>Cuts</b> in capacitated networks are explored and further theory relating the value of a <b>flow</b> and <b>cuts</b> is given. We considered the problem of determining a maximal flow. In particular, {{we consider}} augmentations of the flow—this allows us to give a characterization of a maximal flow. The important Max-flow Min-cut theorem is also considered. After having explored the relevant theory, we move on to methods of finding a maximal flow for a given s-t network that has a capacity on each of its arcs. Firstly, we consider zero-one and unit-capacity networks since these {{play a role in the}} applications of maximal flows in Chapter 4. We, then, compile the relevant theory and algorithms in order to implement two augmenting path finding algorithms...|$|R

Hernandez & Salazar introduced a multi-commodity flow (MCF) formulation for a generalisation of the SOP in which the vehicle has a limited capacity. We strengthen this MCF formulation by fixing variables and adding valid equations. We then use polyhedral projection, together with some known results on <b>flows,</b> <b>cuts</b> and metrics, to derive new families of strong valid inequalities for both problems. Finally, we give computational results, which show that our findings yield good lower bounds in practice...|$|R

Standard introductions to game theory include Fudenberg and Tirole [75], Osbourne and Rubinstein [139], and Owen [140].

It overlies unconformably {{a complex of}} highly metamorphosed and deformed ancient rocks. The series consists of first, a basal conglomerate composed of angular fragments, second, a succession of "red" siltstone, sandstone, and arkose, all of which contain pebbles and conglomerate bands and, third, coarse loosely consolidated conglomerates composed of well-rounded fragments. Because of its similarity to the Athabaska Sandstone of Keweenawan Age, south of Lake Athabaska, the series is called the Athabaska Series. Interbedded with sandstone in a zone about halfway up the series are several bodies of highly amygdaloidal basic lava <b>flows.</b> <b>Cutting</b> the structure are narrow basic dykes.

40|$|We {{consider}} multicommodity <b>flow</b> and <b>cut</b> {{problems in}} polymatroidal networks {{where there are}} submodular capacity constraints on the edges incident to a node. Polymatroidal networks were introduced by Lawler and Martel and Hassin in the single-commodity setting and {{are closely related to}} the submodular flow model of Edmonds and Giles; the well-known maxflow-mincut theorem holds in this more general setting. Polymatroidal networks for the multicommodity case have not, as far as the authors are aware, been previously explored. Our work is primarily motivated by applications to information flow in wireless networks. We also consider the notion of undirected polymatroidal networks and observe that they provide a natural way to generalize <b>flows</b> and <b>cuts</b> in edge and node capacitated undirected networks. We establish poly-logarithmic flow-cut gap results in several scenarios that have been previously considered in the standard network flow models where capacities are on the edges or nodes. Our results have already found aplications in wireless network information flow and we anticipate more in the future. On the technical side our key tools are the formulation and analysis of the dual of the flow relaxations via continuous extensions of submodular functions, in particular the Lovász extension. For directed graphs we rely on a simple yet useful reduction from polymatroidal networks to standard networks. For undirected graphs we rely on the interplay between the Lovász extension of a submodular function and line embeddings with low average distortion introduced by Matousek and Rabinovich; this connection is inspired by, and generalizes, the work of Feige, Hajiaghayi and Lee on node-capacitated multicommodity <b>flows</b> and <b>cuts.</b> The applicability of embeddings to polymatroidal networks is of independent mathematical interest.
