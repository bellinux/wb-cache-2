5|$|After {{defeating}} George Washington 27–6, the Terrapins {{went on to}} {{shut out}} two ranked teams: 11th-ranked Mississippi and 11th-ranked Alabama.

Maryland finished the regular season 10–0 and were crowned the national champions.|$|E
5|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the late}} 1880s were {{a period of}} growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State. Agriculture picked up, and the railway system became {{an important source of}} income as well. Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming, propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues. Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his father had been before him.|$|E

5|$|Already in 1878, voices sounded for Reitz {{to run for}} the presidency, but President Brand's {{position}} was still very strong and Reitz openly praised his qualities and refused to stand against him. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the political temperature ran high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State. The annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) by the British in 1877 and the First Anglo-Boer War of 1880–1881 in which that republic regained its autonomy impacted deeply on political sentiments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State. On the one hand there were those who propagated caution in the relationship with the British, on the other there developed a political movement that strongly propagated a (reawakened) Afrikaner national consciousness. Reitz was part of the latter, and together with C.L.F. Borckenhagen, editor of the Bloemfontein Express newspaper, he wrote a constitution for the Afrikaner Bond (Afrikaner Union), a political party originally set up by leading Afrikaner politicians in the Cape Colony, like Rev S.J. du Toit and his Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners ('Society of True Afrikaners') and Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and the Zuidafrikaansche Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging ('South African Boer Protection Association'). Among the supporters of this new Afrikaner nationalism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State was also Reitz's successor, M.T. Steyn, then still a young lawyer. The constitution was presented in April 1881, and several months later Reitz became the chairman of the Bond. His overt political activities earned Reitz criticism from those who feared a breakdown of relations with the British. It is obvious, however, that a wind of change was blowing through the Boer republics and among the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony, which was to change Anglo-Boer relations drastically.|$|E
5|$|Among Cincinnati receivers, {{there was}} none of the {{uncertainty}} that afflicted the Bearcats' quarterbacks. Wide receiver Mardy Gilyard caught 74passes during the regular season, setting a Cincinnati record with 1,118receiving yards. He also had 10touchdowns during the season, leading all Cincinnati players. Gilyard also played as the Bearcats' primary kick returner. He returned 32kicks, accumulating a school-record 897yards and 2touchdowns. Fellow wide receiver Dominick Goodman outpaced Gilyard in receptions with 78, but he had only 977receiving yards and 7touchdowns. On the first play of Cincinnati's game against Hawaii, Dominick injured his shoulder {{and his ability to}} play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Bowl was in doubt.|$|E
5|$|As an {{important}} public figure, Reitz was honoured and remembered in different ways. In 1923 Reitz the University of Stellenbosch bestowed on him an honorary doctorate in law for his public services. Already in 1889, a village {{was named after}} him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State. In 1894 one also named a village after his second wife, Cornelia. A ship named after him, the President Reitz, sank off Port Elizabeth in 1947. The Jubilee Diamond, found in the Free State village of Jagersfontein in 1895 was originally named the Reitz Diamond, but renamed in honour of the sixtieth anniversary of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1897.|$|E

5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E
5|$|As {{president}} Reitz {{was one of}} {{the first}} Afrikaners to actively develop a so-called Bantu policy, in philosophy and terminology going beyond contemporary ideas on segregation between white and black. Under his government Indian immigrants were by law forbidden to settle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State (1890). This led to a confrontation with the British government and an extensive correspondence between Reitz and the British high commissioner in Cape Town, in which internal sovereignty was claimed and established.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they are plentiful at such sites as Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in Cornelia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Luck {{distributed}} his passes relatively evenly {{among his}} receivers. Doug Baldwin was the team's leading receiver, with 56 receptions for 824 yards and 9 touchdowns {{during the regular}} season. Wide receiver and kick returner Chris Owusu, who played in only six games because of a knee injury, underwent arthroscopic surgery and was expected to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Bowl.

5|$|Thanks to its {{appearance}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Bowl and a revenue-sharing agreement with other Big East schools, Virginia Tech earned $3.981 million for {{playing in the}} 1996 Orange Bowl. $3.5 million of that total came directly from the bowl, while the remaining $481,000 came from the revenue-sharing pool generated by all the Big East teams that participated in bowl games. The almost-$4 million payout made Virginia Tech's football team the wealthiest of the 36 schools that participated in bowl games after the 1996 season.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Orange Bowl {{kicked off}} at 8:47p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.
