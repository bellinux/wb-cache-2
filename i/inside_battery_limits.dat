40|$|Research on {{improving}} ethanol production {{as an alternative}} to petroleum based fuel has been accelerating for both ecological and economical reasons. A simplified procedure for rapid ball-park cost estimate that {{can be used as a}} research tool by energy policy makers for targeting area of cost reduction in a project, for comparing alternative design and for reviewing achieved costs on completed projects is described. In this study, an operating, commercial scale fuel-ethanol plant annexed to a sugar industry and based on molasses in a poorly accessible rural and landlocked African country was used to determine the cost structure. Analysis of the breakdown of the fixed capital investment (FCI) cost, based on the principle of factorial method of capital cost estimation and using Lang factor (fL) analysis was used to create an econometric model for calculating FCI cost. The model suggests a Lang factor of 2. 40 and 2. 81 for outside and <b>inside</b> <b>battery</b> <b>limits</b> plant, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—The {{estimation}} of temperature <b>inside</b> <b>battery</b> cells requires accurate {{information about the}} cooling conditions even when {{the temperature of the}} battery surface is measured. This paper presents a novel approach of estimating temperature dis-tribution <b>inside</b> cylindrical <b>batteries</b> under unknown convective cooling conditions. A computationally efficient thermal model is first developed using a polynomial approximation of the temperature profile <b>inside</b> the <b>battery</b> cell. The Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) is then applied for the identification of the convection coefficient and the {{estimation of}} temperature <b>inside</b> the <b>battery.</b> In the proposed modeling approach, the thermal properties are represented by volume averaged lumped values with uniformly distributed heat generation. The model is parameterized and validated using experimental data from a 2. 3 Ah 26650 Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LFP) battery cell with a forced-air convective cooling during hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) drive cycles. Experimental results show that the proposed DEKF-based estimation method can provide an accurate prediction of core temperature under unknown cooling condition by measuring the cell current, voltage, and surface and ambient temperature. The accuracy is such that the scheme cam also be used for fault detection of a cooling system malfunction...|$|R

40|$|Researchers are {{in search}} of {{parameters}} <b>inside</b> Li-ion <b>batteries</b> that can be utilized to control their external behavior.

In this paper, two commercially available Li-ion anode materials: graphite and Lithium titanate (Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 or LTO) were selected and a physics-based electrochemical model was developed based on half-cell assembly and testing. It is found that LTO has a smaller diffusion coefficient (Ds) than graphite, which causes a larger overpotential, leading to a smaller capacity utilization and, correspondingly, a shorter duration of constant current charge or discharge. However, in large current applications, LTO performs better than graphite because its effective particle radius decreases with increasing current, leading to enhanced diffusion. In addition, LTO has a higher activation overpotential in its side reactions; its degradation rate is expected to be much smaller than graphite, indicating a longer life span...|$|R

In process of battery production,metallic contaminant mix with parts of a battery can be a cause of short circuit <b>inside</b> <b>battery.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to detect at production stage. Study for detection metallic contaminant in battery using high temperature SQUID is currently in progress and by using this, 50 tm ferromagnetic metal piece can be detected successfully. However, a cooling medium or cryogenic refrigerator is necessary for SQUID operation, so that the total measurement system becomes large size and expensive. On the other hand, Hall probe is known to be cheap and high versatility magnetic field sensor. Although measurement sensitivity of magnetic field for Hall probe is much lower than SQUID, by applying an external magnetic field can increase the field generated from magnetized metallic contaminant, resulting into increase for possibility to detect the metallic contaminant. In this research, we measured the magnetic field distribution of metallic contaminant in electrode for lithium-ion battery using Hall probe and examined the applicability for metallic contaminant detection technology that is more simple, easier and cheaper...|$|R
