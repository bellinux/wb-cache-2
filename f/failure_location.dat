40|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} materials characterization program at the NASA Lewis Research Center, tensile creep-rupture tests were performed on a SiC-fiber-reinforced SiC-matrix composite. The results of these tests and subsequent analysis revealed an oxidation embrittlement phenomena that occurs readily at a discreet temperature range below the maximum use temperature. The graph shows rupture lives for a creep stress of 83 MPa as a function of temperature. Note that the rupture time is constant at an intermediate temperature range of 700 to 982 C. This graph also shows the <b>failure</b> <b>location,</b> as measured {{from the center of the}} specimen. Whereas for temperatures of 500 to 700 C, failure occurred in the specimen gage section; at higher temperatures, the <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> migrated toward the cooled grip ends. Although the results initially suggested that the test procedure was influencing the measured creep rupture lives and driving the <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> out of the gage section, subsequent experiments and thermal stress analyses verified the robustness of the test method employed...|$|E

An unfilled acrylic cement gave the highest values of {{bond strength}} for both the plastic and ceramic brackets, whereas a highly-filled diacrylate cement gave the highest bond strength for the metal brackets.

40|$|Purpose Femoral {{fracture}} is {{a common}} medical problem in osteoporotic individuals. Bone mineral density (BMD) is the gold standard measure to evaluate fracture risk in vivo. Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) -based homogenized voxel finite element (hvFE) models have been {{proved to be more}} accurate predictors of femoral strength than BMD by adding geometrical and material properties. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the ability of hvFE models in predicting femoral stiffness, strength and <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> for a large number of pairs of human femora tested in two different loading scenarios. Methods Thirty-six pairs of femora were scanned with QCT and total proximal BMD and BMC were evaluated. For each pair, one femur was positioned in one-legged stance configuration (STANCE) and the other in a sideways configuration (SIDE). Nonlinear hvFE models were generated from QCT images by reproducing the same loading configurations imposed in the experiments. For experiments and models, the structural properties (stiffness and ultimate load), the <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> and the motion of the femoral head were computed and compared. Results In both configurations, hvFE models predicted both stiffness (R 2 = 0. 82 for STANCE and R 2 = 0. 74 for SIDE) and femoral ultimate load (R 2 = 0. 80 for STANCE and R 2 = 0. 85 for SIDE) better than BMD and BMC.

40|$|Abstract. This paper gives {{a survey}} of the {{techniques}} for <b>failure</b> <b>location,</b> protection and restoration in IP over optical fiber networks. The first part of the paper reviews <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> algorithms at the optical and the IP layers. We classify the <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> algorithms at the optical layer into two main categories: the model based approach, that builds an abstract model of the network and uses this model to diagnose failures, and the learning based approach, that views the network as a black box and diagnoses failures using a set of rules obtained either by learning or by the expertise of the human manager. At the IP layer, we focus on the location of one of the main sources of failure: lossy links. The lossy link location algorithms can also be classified into two categories: the correlation approach, that requires strong correlation between monitoring packets, and the simple tomography approach, that requires some knowledge of the distribution of lossy links. The second part of the paper describes the main strategies that ensure survivability in IP-over-fiber networks. After a failure, traffic can be restored either at the optical layer or at the IP layer. Protection at the optical layer amounts to dedicate some lightpaths to reroute the traffic disrupted by the failure. Restoration at the IP layer eliminates the need to set up back-up optical paths, but requires to map the IP layer on the optical layer in a survivable way. We describe the most common approaches achieving this. ...|$|E
30|$|In this experiment, {{we do not}} {{desire to}} observe {{the effect of the}} <b>{{failures}}</b> <b>location</b> over the techniques, thus we select failures randomly. To mitigate the effect of the number of test cases that fail, we assign a constant rate of 10 % of the test cases to reveal failure based on the profile of the applications considered in the first experiment. Likewise, the fixed value of depth of generated models is chosen according to the general depth of the models of the first experiment.|$|R
30|$|Performance {{of chairs}} can be {{clarified}} by {{the behavior of}} component parts. In addition, loading type is effective {{on the behavior of}} component parts. In this study, chairs are made from straight and curved parts. In practice, chairs with curved parts are under tension or compression load. Various failure modes of curved parts were different between tension load and compression load. Compression loads are applied to entirely curved frame of one-piece type (b) when the chairs are subjected to the top to down load or the front to back load. Tension <b>failure</b> <b>locations</b> of curved frame have occurred in the bottom. But shear failure modes appeared in curved frame of two-piece type (a) when the chairs are subjected to the front to back load. Two curved dimensional parts were separated under tension load. The shear <b>failure</b> <b>locations</b> of curved frame were found in the front-curved legs. The various failure modes of curved parts are shown in Fig.Â  13. Since performance of chairs is similar to curved samples, and these properties are known in the initial step of the study and step of performance test of chairs, the first step in this study was performed to identify the behavior of component parts in the chairs.|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of heavy snow in February 1999, trees were damaged in the City of Ljubljana, Slovenia. Of the {{investigated}} 624 trees, 195 (31 %) were damaged by snow. On average, 1. 7 branch and top per tree were broken. Snow damaged 17 tree species, affecting particularly Aesculus hippocastanum L. and, to a lesser extent, Betula pendula ROTH. and Salix x sepulcralis SIMONK. Decay was the most frequent defect at the <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> and was often associated withincluded bark and vicinity of old mechanical wounds. 87 % of broken branches and tops with diameter exceeding 20 cm were decayed at <b>failure</b> <b>location.</b> The research showed that failures were associated rather with structural growth defects and wood decay than with tree species. Broken parts of half of all damaged trees impeded the traffic or caused material damages. Regular control of the trees' safety stage would enable early identification and removal of potentially hazardous trees and their parts.

40|$|We address <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> and {{restoration}} in both optical and wireless ad hoc networks. First, we show how Maximum Likelihood inference can improve <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> algorithms {{in the presence}} of false and missing alarms. Next, we present two efficient algorithms for mapping an IP network on an optical network {{in such a way that}} it is protected against failures at the optical layer. The first algorithm offers a method to formally verify the existence of a solution, contrary to all other heuristics known to date. The second algorithm is a heuristic search that takes capacity constraints in account. Both algorithms are shown to be faster by orders of magnitude than existing solutions. Finally, we develop a new routing algorithm for wireless mobile ad hoc networks, adopting ideas from the Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic. The routing scheme can adapt to network and traffic changes and uses multipath routing and an efficient local repair mechanism to improve failure resilience.

40|$|System {{reliability}} calculation {{for large-scale}} structural systems is complex {{due to the}} large number of potential <b>failure</b> <b>locations</b> and <b>failure</b> modes unless a priori knowledge can be used to significantly reduce the number of <b>failure</b> <b>locations</b> and modes. However, a priori knowledge may not be available for future aircraft systems that operate in new environments â such as hypersonic â or consist of unconventional designs with limited production runs. As a result, a fast first-order reliability based filtering method has been developed to numerically quantify the error incurred by filtering a limit state. A âfiltering error â is calculated based on a certain limit stateâs contribution to the system probability of failure. This is compared to a chosen error tolerance to determine if a limit state is a critical location or should be filtered. The method is fast and scalable to large models.

40|$|Ultrasonic cutting is an {{established}} {{technology in the}} cutting of food products. As the high-cost components of an ultrasonic cutting system are the ultrasonic generator and transducer, some designs have concentrated on running several cutting blades from a single power source. This strategy is undoubtedly economic, but problems remain with reliability. Blade failure during cutting is a common problem in ultrasonic systems and therefore strategies are proposed to reduce stress levels at the failure locations. Many alternative blade profiles are investigated using finite element (FE) models, which are validated by experimental modal analysis (EMA) using a 3 D laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). Combining three strategies can reduce the stress level at the <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> on cutting blades. The first investigates the blade profile at the <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> {{with the aim of}} incorporating sufficient gain at reduced stress levels. The second concentrates on detuning the block horn and blades in order to move the longitudinal node away from the highest stressed section of the blade. Finally, a redesign of the block horn is studied in order to eliminate the effects of blade flexural vibrations in the longitudinal cutting mode...|$|E

Finite element models built on quantitative CT (QCT) are computer tools {{that can be used to}} predict femoral strength and evaluate the mechanical effect of surgical correction. Questions/purposes We asked: (1) What is the effect of a resection of the superolateral aspect of the ovine femoral head-neck junction on failure load?

40|$|Many BGA and CSP {{component}} suppliers {{have begun}} shipment of components {{with a variety}} of second generation lead-free solder ball alloys based on the improved mechanical shock resistance. Although in general mechanical performance has been improved, there have been questions raised on how much the mechanical performance of these lead-free solder ball alloys can vary with different board surface finishes such as NiAu and OSP. Mechanical testing was performed on Sn 3. 5 Ag and Sn 1 Ag 0. 5 Cu 676 PBGA components with 1 mm pitch and electrolytic Ni/Au finished component pads. These components were soldered with Sn 3 Ag 0. 5 Cu paste on either electrolytic Ni/Au or high temperature rated OSP board surface finish. The mechanical shock data indicated that among the four board surface finish/BGA component sphere alloy combinations, the Sn 1 Ag 0. 5 Cu (SAC 105) BGA sphere with NiAu board surface finish had the lowest drop test resistance among the combinations evaluated, which was not expected. Failure analysis of this and the other drop test combinations was carried out by dye-pry analysis and cross-sectioning to understand the <b>failure</b> <b>locations</b> on the soldered BGA joints. The results were assessed in terms of Weibull failure distributions, <b>failure</b> modes, <b>failure</b> <b>locations,</b> and microstructural analysis which included IMC thickness measurement and IMC compositional analysis and distribution.

In {{order to reduce}} the complexity and synergistic effect of tailor-welded blank (TWB) parameters, the same material and thickness sheets are considered for the entire work. The forming limit curve (FLC) of welded blanks for varied weld conditions - namely, weld orientation and location - are predicted by simulating the limit dome height (LDH) test using PAM-STAMP (ESI Group, PAM System International), a finite element code. The un-welded blank and TWB FLCs thus predicted by the thickness gradient-based necking criterion are compared with the experimental FLCs obtained by LDH test. Dome height at failure and <b>failure</b> <b>location</b> data of TWBs from experiments and prediction are also compared for varied weld conditions. It is found from the analyses that limit strain predictions correlate well (less than five per cent error) with the experimental results in the drawing region of the forming limit diagram, with the stretching region showing considerable difference.

40|$|Fatigue is {{the most}} common {{mechanical}} cause of engineering failures, but it is not well understood. Current methods of predicting fatigue failure rely on empirically-derived equations instead of having a truly scientific foundation. These have very high uncertainties, and they often do not consider the cycling frequency even though it has been proven to affect fatigue life. The power density theory is a new way of describing fatigue. It is based on the concept of power density, which is physically equivalent to the amount of power deposited into a unit volume. Power density results from changes in stress magnitude over time. Stress alternations that occur across a broad bandwidth of frequencies must be factored in. Higher frequencies coupled with faster changes in stress contribute more power density. Power density accumulates at every frequency and time, damaging the part. After this accumulation reaches the material?s power density threshold, a fundamental property of the material, it is expected to fail by fatigue. A previously-published multiaxial vibration fatigue test was referenced and replicated using computer simulations, and the concept of power density was applied to predict its results. This served as a feasibility study for the theory, as well {{as an example of how}} to apply it. The power density response of the system was analyzed, and the <b>failure</b> <b>locations</b> were predicted for each of the ten load cases considered. The predicted <b>failure</b> <b>locations</b> followed the same trend as the experimental results.
