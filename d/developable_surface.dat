40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model fabrication scheme that automatically approximates a model whose boundary consists of several freeform <b>surfaces</b> by <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> and then unroll these <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> onto a plane. The model {{can then be}} fabricated by assembling the sets of <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> which have been cut from planar sheets and rolled back to their proper Euclidean locations. Both the approximation and the rolling methods can be made arbitrarily precise. 1 Introduction It is common to find freeform surfaces manually approximated and assembled as sets of piecewise <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> [9]. In general, freeform <b>surfaces</b> are not <b>developable</b> and cannot be exactly represented as piecewise <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Yet, "developable surfaces are of considerable importance to sheet-metal- or plate-metal-based industries This work {{was supported in part}} by DARPA (N 00014 - 91 -J- 4123).

40|$|<b>Developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> form a {{very small}} subset of all {{possible}} surfaces and were for centuries studied only in passing, but the discovery of differential calculus {{in the seventeenth century}} meant that their properties could be studied in greater depth. Here we show that the generating principles of <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> were also at the core of their study by Monge. In a historical context, {{from the beginning of the}} study of <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces,</b> to the contributions Monge made to the field, it can be seen that the nature of <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> is closely related to the spatial intuition and treatment of space as defined by Monge through his descriptive geometry, which played a major role in developing an international language of geometrical communication for architecture and engineering. The use of <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the architecture of Frank Gehry is mentioned, in particular in relation to his fascination with ‘movement’ and its role in architectural design...|$|R

Special emphasis is devoted to practical choices of free parameters and to error estimation. Furthermore, a new algorithm for the approximation of spatial curves with a circular arc spline is presented which stands in close relation to above algorithms on <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The proposed arc spline has contact of order 2 to the given curve in a series of curve points.

2500|$|Once {{a choice}} is made between {{projecting}} onto a cylinder, cone, or plane, {{the aspect of}} the shape must be specified. The aspect describes how the <b>developable</b> <b>surface</b> [...] is placed relative to the globe: it may be [...] normal (such that the surface's axis of symmetry coincides with the Earth's axis), transverse (at right angles to the Earth's axis) or oblique (any angle in between).|$|E
2500|$|A {{surface that}} can be {{unfolded}} or unrolled into a plane or sheet without stretching, tearing or shrinking is called a <b>developable</b> <b>surface.</b> The cylinder, cone and the plane are all developable surfaces. The sphere and ellipsoid do not have developable surfaces, so any projection of them onto a plane will have to distort the image.

2500|$|Finding {{algebraic}} equations is straightforward, {{the solutions}} {{of which have}} the topology of a Möbius strip, but in general, these equations do not describe the same geometric shape that one gets from the twisted paper model described above.

30|$|In geometry, {{a surface}} {{is called a}} ruled surface if it is swept out by a moving line in R^ 3. The theory of ruled {{surfaces}} is a classical subject in differential geometry.

5000|$|A <b>developable</b> <b>surface</b> is {{a surface}} {{that can be}} (locally) {{unrolled}} onto a flat plane without tearing or stretching it. If a <b>developable</b> <b>surface</b> lies in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and is complete, then it is necessarily ruled, but the converse is not always true. For instance, the cylinder and cone are developable, but the general hyperboloid of one sheet is not. More generally, any <b>developable</b> <b>surface</b> in three dimensions {{is part of a}} complete ruled surface, and so itself must be locally ruled.

5000|$|Most smooth {{surfaces}} (and most {{surfaces in}} general) are not <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Non-developable surfaces are variously {{referred to as}} having [...] "double curvature", [...] "doubly curved", [...] "compound curvature", [...] "non-zero Gaussian curvature", etc.|$|R
40|$|<b>Developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{are widely}} used in {{manufacturing}} with materials that are not amenable to stretching. Applications include the formation of ship hulls, ducts, shoes, clothing and automobile parts such as upholstery and body panels. In shipbuilding, <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> are shaped using only rollers or presses. Heat treatment is then used only to remove distortion induced by welding or other means. Doubly curved surfaces, on the other hand, must be heat treated after rolling to induce the additional curvature. The heat treatment is normally done by hand, by a skilled artisan with years of training to achieve the correct amount of bending. This is an extremely time consuming, labor intensive and thus expensive process. According to Avondale/IHI Shipbuilding Technology Transfer data for a tanker, only 15. 1 % of the curved plates in a ship hull are singly curved, while 65. 8 % of the plates are doubly curved, requiring roller and heat treatment processes. An intensive effort {{to increase the amount}} of <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the hulls of merchant ships at Burmeister & Wain Shipyard has resulted in a reported 20 % reduction in manhours required to produce a hull. Designing a ship entirely of singly curved, or <b>developable,</b> <b>surfaces</b> would reduce construction costs even more. The main goal of this research is to develop a user-friendly method of designing <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> with a B-spline representation. The effort is then extended to address some common differential geometry properties that will be useful in the design and manufacturing process. The ultimate goal is to provide a method to design a complete ship hull from <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> and to generate cutting and bending information in a format that is user friendly for both the engineer and the worker. Although this thesis does not go that far, it takes a major step toward this goal[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Shape from texture has {{received}} much {{attention in the}} past few decades. We propose a computationally efficient method to extract the 3 D shape of <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> from the spectral variations of a visual texture. Under the assumption of homogeneity, the texture is represented by the novel method of identifying ridges of its Fourier transform. Local spatial frequencies are then computed using a minimal set of selected Gabor filters. In both orthographic and perspective projection cases, new geometric equations are presented to compute the shape of <b>developable</b> <b>surfaces</b> from frequencies. The results are validated with semi-synthetic and real pictures. ...|$|R
