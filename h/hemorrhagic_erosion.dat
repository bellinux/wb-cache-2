Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was enhanced in the midbrain but was lowered in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum in stressed rats.

These finding suggested that immobilization stress generated hydroxyl radicals and accelerated lipid peroxidation, and affected mitocho-drial SOD activity which may lead to neuronal damage in stressed rats...|$|E
40|$|Iron is {{essential}} for the survival of mammals, but iron overload causes fibrosis and carcinogenesis. Reduced iron absorption and regulated release into circulation in duodenal mucosa constitute two major mechanisms of protection against dietary iron overload; however, their relative contribution remains elusive. To study the significance of the former process, we generated SLC 11 A 2 transgenic mice (TGs) {{under the control of the}} chicken Î²-actin promoter. TGs were viable and fertile, and displayed no overt abnormalities up to 20 months. No significant difference in iron concentration was observed in major solid organs between TGs and their wild-type littermates, suggesting that increased number of iron transporters does not lead to increased iron absorption. To test the sensitivity to iron overload, TGs and wild-type mice were fed with an iron-rich diet containing 2 % ferric citrate. Iron supplementation caused suppression of endogenous duodenal SLC 11 A 2 expression, down-regulation of duodenal ferroportin, and overexpression of hepatic hepcidin, precluding excessive iron uptake both in the TGs and wild-type mice. However, iron-treated TGs revealed increased mortality, resulting from oxidative mucosal damage leading to <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>erosion</b> throughout the whole intestinal area. These findings suggest that reduced iron release from duodenal cells into circulation plays a role in mitigating excessive iron uptake from the diet and that finely regulated duodenal absorption {{is essential}} to protect intestinal mucosa from iron-induced oxidative damage...|$|E
40|$|Effects of a nitroxybutylester {{derivative}} of aspirin (NCX 4215) on platelet aggregation and prostanoid synthesis {{were compared to}} the effects of aspirin. NCX 4215 was approximately seven times more potent than aspirin as an inhibitor of thrombin-induced human platelet aggregation in vitro, but did not inhibit platelet thromboxane synthesis or gastric prostaglandin synthesis. NCX 4215 released nitric oxide when incubated in the presence of platelets and increased platelet levels of cGMP within 10 min of exposure, while aspirin did not. The anti-aggregatory effects of NCX 4215 in vitro were significantly attenuated by 10 microM hemoglobin. In ex vivo studies of ADP- or collagen- or thrombin-induced rat platelet aggregation, aspirin and NCX 4215 had comparable inhibitory effects 3 h after administration. Aspirin (10 - 120 mg/kg) caused extensive <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>erosion</b> formation in the stomach of the rat within 3 h of oral administration, while NCX 4215 did not produce significant damage at doses of up to 300 mg/kg, nor when given daily for two weeks at 166 mg/kg. NCX 4215 did not alter systemic arterial blood pressure when administered intravenously to the rat. These studies demonstrate that NCX 4215 has comparable or enhanced anti-thrombotic activity to that of aspirin, but does not cause gastric damage or alter systemic blood pressure. The anti-thrombotic actions of NCX 4215 are, at least in part, due to generation of nitric oxide...|$|E

40|$|The {{first line}} of mucosa! defence {{includes}} the juxtamucosal unstirred layer/pH gradient and the apical surface of the luminal epithelial cells. Many damaging agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can overwhelm these defences and destroy extensive regions of the luminal epithelium. This damage is readily tolerated in the normal mucosa. Furthermore, a combination of increased mucosal bloodflow, epithelial migration, mucus release, and efflux of bicarbonate- rich fluid usually allows rapid recovery of mucosa I integrity. In the presence of vascular damage and congestion, however, luminal acid can kill mucosal cells and destroy the substrate necessary for repair (by epithelial migration). Damage of this type results {{in the production of}} <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>erosions,</b> which may then develop into chronic ulceroinflammatory disease if healing is prevented by excess luminal acid or by impaired mucosal immune response. Endogenous and exogenous prostaglandins could affect all aspects of the mucosal defensive responses, from the juxtamucosal unstirred layer/pH gradient (via effects on secretion of bicarbonate, acid and mucus, as well as stimulation of fluid efflux) to the function of the mucosal immune system. Protection against the acute damage produced by topically administered NSAIDs or concentrated ethanol can result from either administration of prostaglandins or topical application of'mild irritants'. This is referred to as 'adaptive cytoprotection'. Parenterally administered NSAIDs can also produce mucosa! erosions. Protection against this type of damage may depend on the effects of prostaglandins on neural and contractile elements in the mucosa. Studies on animal models also suggest that by preventing acute <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>erosions,</b> prostaglandins may prevent the development of chronic ulcer in susceptible individuals...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} suggested, since many years, that {{endocrine}} {{function of the}} pancreas {{may be related to}} the peptic ulceration of the stomach. There has been, however, no unanimous opinion on this item. To clarify this problem, the author investigated, from several points of view, the changes in gastric mucosa following administration of NPH-Insulin to the rat. By the intramuscular administration of NPH-Insulin <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>erosion</b> of the gastric mucosa, instead of ulceration, was observed especially on the corpus of the glandular stomach. The occurrence of erosion was related to the severity of hypoglycemia produced by the Insulin and the rats showing erosion of the gastric mucosa were always associated with hypoglycemic shock. In the rats with gastric erosion weight of their adrenal glands was increased, concentration of K in sera was decreased, and concentration of Na in sera was increased. The occurrence of erosion in the gastric mucosa following administration of NPH-Insulin was completely hindered by vagotomy and was slightly depressed by administration of Chlorpromazin and of Dietazin. In the adrenaletomized rat, the erosion was more marked even after administration of small dosis of NPH-Insulin, and was not hindered by vagotomy. Gastric secretory function in rat with erosion of the gastric mucosa was depressed by administration of the Insulin. In the histological study of the stomach, contraction of the arteries in the submucosa, dilatation and stagnation of the veins in the submucosa and the mucosa were observed. The erosion did not develop to chronic ulcer even after repeated administration of the Insulin. It was, therefore, confirmed that circulatory disturbance in the gabtric mucosa caused by vascular change which was produced by means of vagal stimulation played a main role on the occurrence of erosion in the administration of the Insulin, and was also surmized that the reduced resistance of the gastric mucosa caused by hypoglycemia promoted formation of erosion...|$|E
40|$|Dietary nitrate {{is reduced}} to nitrite by some oral {{bacteria}} and the resulting nitrite is converted to nitric oxide (NO) in acidic gastric juice. The {{aim of this study}} is to elucidate the pathophysiological role of dietary nitrate in the stomach. Intragastric administration of nitrate rapidly increased nitrate and NO in plasma and the gastric headspace, respectively. Water-immersion-restraint stress (WIRS) increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in gastric mucosa and induced <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>erosions</b> by a nitrate-inhibitable mechanism. In animals that had received either cardiac ligation or oral treatment with povidone-iodine, a potent bactericidal agent, administration of nitrate failed to increase gastric levels of NO and to inhibit WIRS-induced mucosal injury. WIRS decreased gastric mucosal blood flow by a mechanism which was inhibited by adminis-tration of nitrate. These data suggested that the enterosalivary cycle of nitrate and related metabolites consisted of gastrointestinal absorption and salivary secretion of nitrate, its conversion to nitrite by oral bacteria and then to NO in the stomach might play important roles in the protection of gastric mucosa from hazardous stress...|$|R

Peripheral, splenic and thymic T lymphocyte subsets were also analyzed to assess the underlying morbid conditions. Colitis with inflammatory changes consisting mainly of <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>erosions</b> at the distal large intestine was induced by the administration of a 2 % DSS solution for 14 consecutive days. The DSS-induced colitis was inhibited by pre-irradiation of the spleen with 20 Gy prior to the development of DSSinduced colitis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) are severe adverse cutaneous drug {{reactions that}} predominantly involve {{the skin and}} mucous membranes. Both are rare, with TEN and SJS affecting approximately 1 or 2 / 1, 000, 000 annually, and are considered medical emergencies as they are potentially fatal. They are characterized by mucocutaneous tenderness and typically <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>erosions,</b> erythema and more or less severe epidermal detachment presenting as blisters and areas of denuded skin. Currently, TEN and SJS {{are considered to be}} two ends of a spectrum of severe epidermolytic adverse cutaneous drug reactions, differing only by their extent of skin detachment. Drugs are assumed or identified as the main cause of SJS/TEN in most cases, but Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Herpes simplex virus infections are well documented causes alongside rare cases in which the aetiology remains unknown. Several drugs are at "high" risk of inducing TEN/SJS including: Allopurinol, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other sulfonamide-antibiotics, aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and NSAID's of the oxicam-type. Genetic susceptibility to SJS and TEN is likely as exemplified by the strong association observed in Han Chinese between a genetic marker, the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B* 1502, and SJS induced by carbamazepine. Diagnosis relies mainly on clinical signs together with the histological analysis of a skin biopsy showing typical full-thickness epidermal necrolysis due to extensive keratinocyte apoptosis. Differential diagnosis includes linear IgA dermatosis and paraneoplastic pemphigus, pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), disseminated fixed bullous drug eruption and staphyloccocal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). Due to the high risk of mortality, management of patients with SJS/TEN requires rapid diagnosis, evaluation of the prognosis using SCORTEN, identification and interruption of the culprit drug, specialized supportive care ideally in an intensive care unit, and consideration of immunomodulating agents such as high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. SJS and TEN are severe and life-threatening. The average reported mortality rate of SJS is 1 - 5 %, and of TEN is 25 - 35 %; it can be even higher in elderly patients and those with a large surface area of epidermal detachment. More than 50 % of patients surviving TEN suffer from long-term sequelae of the disease...|$|R

However, the characteristic upper gastrointestinal lesions in symptomatic clopidogrel users remain unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate the characteristics of endoscopic findings in clopidogrel users undergoing endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal symptoms and to compare the clinical characteristics and upper gastrointestinal lesions between symptomatic clopidogrel and aspirin users. Methods: This observational study included 215 consecutive patients receiving clopidogrel (n= 106) or low-dose aspirin (n= 109) therapy who underwent endoscopy for dyspeptic symptoms. The upper gastrointestinal lesions were carefully assessed, and a complete medical history was obtained by a standard questionnaire. Results: The frequencies of <b>hemorrhagic</b> spots, <b>erosions</b> and peptic ulcers in the symptomatic clopidogrel users were 25 %, 39 % and 39 %, respectively. Among the peptic ulcer patients on clopidogrel therapy, the distributions of ulcers were 78 %, 5 % and 17 % in the stomach, duodenum and both, respectively. Compared with the aspirin group, the clopidogrel group was older and had higher frequencies of past ulcer history and past gastrointestinal bleeding history in their clinical characteristics. By contrast, the clopidogrel users had a lower prevalence of active Helicobacter pylori infection than aspirin users (17 % vs. 35 %, respectively, p= 0. 007). Regarding to the endoscopic findings, the clopidogrel users had higher frequencies of hemorrhagic spots (25 % vs. 10 %) and peptic ulcer (39 % vs. 24 %) than aspirin users (p= 0. 004 and 0. 027, respectively).
