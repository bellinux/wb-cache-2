5|$|At {{the time}} of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's {{political}} elite was divided between those who embraced the Arab nationalist movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its <b>hinterland</b> within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian <b>hinterland,</b> which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.|$|E

5|$|The Kačić family {{originated}} in the Zadar <b>hinterland</b> near the Krka river, and when King Petar Krešimir IV mastered the Pagania, {{some members of the}} family likely relocated to the area between the Cetina and Neretva rivers. The social distinction between noble Kačićs in the Zadar-Biograd <b>hinterland</b> and the princely (knezes) Kačićs from Omiš remains uncertain, but the two families are considered to be related. The clearest established connection is the noble Hodimir, mentioned in 1207 in a charter of St. Peter's Church in Bubnjani near Tinj, whose son Nikola was an Omiš knez.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{economic}} and political policies alienated four broad and influential factions in Palestine, namely the effendiyat (notables) of Jerusalem, {{the bulk of the}} major clans in Jabal Nablus, the clans of the Jerusalem <b>hinterland,</b> and the Bedouin tribes in the areas of Hebron and Bethlehem.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a great}} {{tradition}} of public access and outdoor recreation in the area. The Peak District formed a natural <b>hinterland</b> and rural escape for the populations of industrial Manchester and Sheffield, and remains a valuable leisure resource in a largely post-industrial economy.|$|E
5|$|After the 1990 electoral {{defeat of}} the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened, and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana, or TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August an open revolt broke out among the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian <b>hinterland</b> near Knin and parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|After this failure, Pyrrhus ravaged the Spartan <b>hinterland</b> whilst {{fending off}} counter-attacks by the victorious Spartans. On the {{invitation}} of an Argive ally, Pyrrhus attempted to seize Argos. The assault culminated in a fiasco with Pyrrhus being attacked by his Argive opponents, the pursuing Spartan army of Areus and a Macedonian army commanded by Antigonus Gonatas. Pyrrhus {{was killed in the}} ensuing battle in the streets of Argos, ending Epiriote hopes of establishing a hegemony in Greece.|$|E
5|$|Born in Naples, Italy, {{he came to}} the United States in 1895 {{with his}} parents at the age of nine. His father Francesco Cotillo, had been a caterer in Naples. The family {{originally}} came from Avellino (Montella), in the <b>hinterland</b> of Naples. The family settled in East Harlem in East 113th Street among the increasing numbers of Italian immigrants. His father took up catering again and opened a popular pastry and confectionery shop. He has been credited with introducing the Italian ice cream spumoni into the United States.|$|E
5|$|Croatia can be {{subdivided}} {{between a}} number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently {{one of the richest}} in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate <b>hinterland,</b> Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.|$|E
5|$|Gedi {{also has}} a <b>hinterland</b> {{consisting}} of several smaller sites made up of either solitary mosques and tombs or several houses. The sites of Shaka and Kilepwa are nearby. Kilepwa, located on an island in Mida Creek, is closer to Gedi and consists of three stone houses. There is also an isolated mosque at {{the west end of}} the creek, a mosque at Watamu, and a mosque and tombs at Kiburugeni.|$|E

5|$|In early 1992, the Independent Škabrnja Battalion {{became the}} 1st Battalion of the 159th Infantry Brigade. Control of the {{battlefield}} changed slightly during the night of 22–23 May 1992, when Croatian forces captured Križ Hill (near Bibinje, southeast of Zadar); this improved security along the Adriatic Highway. Another change took place in JanuaryFebruary 1993, when Croatian troops recaptured part of the Zadar <b>hinterland</b> in Operation Maslenica. The rest of the region was recaptured by Croatia during Operation Storm in August 1995.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman conquests {{led to the}} Battle of Krbava field (1493) and the Battle of Mohács (1526), both decisive Ottoman victories, {{the latter}} of which caused a {{succession}} crisis in the Kingdom of Hungary. In the 1527 election in Cetin, Ferdinand I of Habsburg {{was chosen as the}} new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire, which had extended as far as Lika in the immediate <b>hinterland</b> of the region since 1522. As the region became a point of contention between the Habsburgs, Ottomans, and Venetians, its defense was given high importance in the newly established Croatian Military Frontier, as exemplified by the Uskoks of Senj. After the Ottoman conquest of their original base in Klis, the Uskoks established a new headquarters in Nehaj Fortress as a bulwark against westward expansion by the Ottomans. They also launched raids against Christian communities under Ottoman rule and Venetian commerce and subjects. Increasing conflict between the Uskoks and Venice culminated in 1615– 1617 Uskok War, which resulted in the resettling of the Uskoks, whose final years in Senj were marked by piracy and looting. Between 1684 and 1689, the Ottomans were forced to retreat from Lika and the entire <b>hinterland</b> of the region.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Empire's {{military}} {{position in}} the Balkans collapsed in the early 7th century {{as a result of}} disastrous military ventures against the Persians and then the Arabs in the East, which forced the effective abandonment of the Danube limes and opened the way for large-scale penetration and settlement of the Balkan <b>hinterland</b> by various Slavic tribes. The Slavs raided as far as southern Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor. Most of the region's cities were sacked or abandoned and only a few, including Thessalonica, remained occupied and in imperial hands.|$|E
5|$|The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a {{grouping}} of conservation and environmental bodies, divide {{the coast and}} its <b>hinterland</b> into three zones for tourism development purposes. Blakeney Point, along with Holme Dunes and Holkham dunes, {{is considered to be}} a sensitive habitat already suffering from visitor pressure, and therefore designated as a red-zone area with no development or parking improvements to be recommended. The rest of the reserve is placed in the orange zone, for locations with fragile habitats but less tourism pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Istria by the Franks brought {{the realm of}} Charlemagne {{adjacent}} to Dalmatia. Dalmatia at that time included both Roman cities and a Slavic-Croatian <b>hinterland</b> that was loosely subject {{to the rule of}} the Byzantine Empire. In the treaty of 798, the Franks acknowledged Byzantine rights over the Slavs, but in the following years both Croatian Župans (dukes) and Roman communities recognized an opportunity to win full independence from both Imperial powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of a port in Rijeka dates back to 1281, when the Great Council of the Republic of Venice {{reported}} a conflict of Venetian merchants and ship owners from Zadar and Rab. In 1719, the Port of Rijeka was granted a charter as a free port by Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, and the first road connecting the port to the <b>hinterland,</b> the Caroline road, was completed in 1728. The inland connections were gradually improved by {{the construction of the}} Josephina and Louisiana roads in 1779 and 1810 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The huge {{extent of}} the mediaeval parish of Llanbadarn made Sunday worship {{impossible}} for distant inhabitants, so early centres with a Christian identity like Llanychaearn and Llaneithr would act as chapels of ease, and later churches whether built by Welsh princes (such as Llanfihangel-y-Creuddyn) or Norman lords (e.g. Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn) were also subordinate to Llanbadarn before developing as separate parishes. Churches like Llanbadarn with a large <b>hinterland</b> of lesser churches are often known as mam-eglwysi, mother churches. There were no parishes in Wales prior to {{the coming of the}} Normans.|$|E
5|$|The present-day {{northern}} border of Somerset (adjoining {{the counties of}} Bristol and Gloucestershire) runs along the southern bank of the Avon from the Bristol Channel, then follows around {{the southern edge of}} the Bristol built-up area, before continuing upstream along the Avon, and then diverges from the river to include Bath and its historic <b>hinterland</b> {{to the north of the}} Avon, before meeting Wiltshire at the Three Shire Stones on the Fosse Way at Batheaston.|$|E
5|$|The present-day parish of Ifield {{covers the}} west of Crawley and its rural <b>hinterland.</b> The A23 and A2220 roads, between County Oak and the A264, form the eastern and {{southern}} boundaries. Beyond {{the edge of the}} Ifield West estate, the boundary extends to Faygate and the farms and rural roads around that hamlet. The northern border is close to the county boundary with Surrey and the southern edge of Gatwick Airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} government {{under the leadership}} of Premier Frederick Haultain struck a deal with the federal Government of Canada in early 1905 to bring provincial powers to the territories. This {{led to the creation of}} the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta from the southernmost and most populous areas of the territory. The Northwest Territories, reduced to its northern, lightly populated <b>hinterland,</b> continued to exist under the 1870s constitutional status under control of the federal government. A new council was convened in Ottawa, Ontario to deal with the region.|$|E
5|$|As Tikal and its <b>hinterland</b> reached peak population, {{the area}} {{suffered}} deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings {{seem to have lost}} most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Soviet Union, the Armenian SSR {{transformed}} from a largely agricultural <b>hinterland</b> to an important industrial production center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian Genocide survivors and their descendants. On August 23, 1990, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in the Soviet Union until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991. Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. After {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, the state of the post-Union Republic of Armenia existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire {{gradually}} {{occupied the}} entire eastern Adriatic coastline and {{a substantial part}} of its <b>hinterland,</b> ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics, establishing the Illyrian Provinces. In response the Royal Navy started the blockade of the Adriatic Sea leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811. The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813, and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This led to formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia, now both under the same crown.|$|E
5|$|Britain's hold on Gibraltar was {{reconfirmed}} in 1729 by the Treaty of Seville, which satisfied neither side; the Spanish {{had wanted}} Gibraltar returned, while the British disliked {{the continuation of}} the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Utrecht. Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across {{the upper end of the}} peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its <b>hinterland.</b> The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as La Línea de Contravalación (the Lines of Contravallation), were later to give their name to the modern town of La Línea de la Concepción. Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|By 1892, Mogadishu {{was under}} the joint control of the Somali Sultanate of the Geledi and the Omani Sultanate of Zanzibar. The Geledi Sultans were {{at the height of}} their power. They {{dominated}} the southern ivory trade, and also held sway over the Jubba and Shebelle valleys in the <b>hinterland.</b> The Omani Sultans' authority in Mogadishu, however, was largely nominal. When Imam Azzan bin Qais of Oman sought to build a fort in the city, he was thus obligated to request permission from Sultan Ahmed Yusuf of Geledi. This Fort of Garessa was eventually constructed in 1870. The Sultan of Zanzibar later leased and then sold the infrastructure that he had built to the Italians, but not the land itself, which was Somali owned.|$|E
5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and {{exhausted}} {{by the time he}} reached Asunción. As he did not feel up to the task of pursuing López into the Paraguayan <b>hinterland,</b> he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E
5|$|For {{these reasons}} the ancients instead settled {{at the head}} of the bay in what is today known as the Campo (<b>hinterland)</b> of Gibraltar. The town of Carteia, near the {{location}} of the modern Spanish town of San Roque, was founded by the Phoenicians around 950 BC on the site of an early settlement of the native Turdetani people. The Carthaginians took control of the town by 228 BC and it was captured by the Romans in 206 BC. It subsequently became Pompey's western base in his campaign of 67 BC against the pirates that menaced the Mediterranean Sea at the time. Carteia appears to have been abandoned after the Vandals sacked it in 409 AD during their march through Roman Hispania to Africa. The region subsequently fell under the rule of the Christianised Visigoths.|$|E

5|$|In August 1990 an {{insurgency}} {{known as the}} Log Revolution took place in Croatia, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian <b>hinterland</b> around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and, after the RSK declared its intention to unite with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a breakaway state. By March 1991 the conflict escalated, resulting in the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium on Croatia and the RSK's declarations followed, after which their decisions were implemented on 8 October.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to expand his zone of {{influence}} to Nablus, the commercial center of Palestine and its agriculturally-rich <b>hinterland,</b> Zahir besieged Nablus in late 1771. By then, Zahir had secured an alliance with the powerful Jarrar clan, who were incensed at Uthman Pasha's assignment of Mustafa Bey Tuqan as the collector of the miri (hajj pilgrimage tax). Nablus was under the de facto control of the Tuqan and Nimr clans, local rivals of the Jarrars. The loss of Jaffa and Bani Sa'b stripped Nablus of its sea access. Nablus was defended by 12,000 mostly peasant riflemen under Nimr and Tuqan commanders. After nine days of clashes, Zahir decided to withdraw and avoid a costly stalemate. As he departed Nablus, his forces raided many of the city's satellite villages, from which its peasant defenders originated.|$|E
