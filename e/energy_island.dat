40|$|The Third Package allows EU <b>energy</b> <b>islands</b> to be {{exempted}} from most {{if not all}} of the acquis communautaire in energy, both on market design and the regulatory framework. However, even if a supply monopoly is the most efficient market structure in a given situation, this monopoly in theory still needs to be regulated. Therefore, has the EU struck the right balance in this area? This paper first disentangles the complex system of derogations open to EU <b>energy</b> <b>islands.</b> It focuses inter alia on the unbundling regime {{and what it means to}} have an express derogation from Article 9 (ownership unbundling). The second part looks at the opening of the Cyprus gas market and the concrete effects of the derogation system on the powers of the Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority, the national regulator, in monitoring this market. Cyprus is considered to be both an isolated (Article 49 (1) of Directive 2009 / 73) and an emergent (Article 49 (2) of Directive 2009 / 73) market under the new legislation and, as such, is an interesting case. The paper argues that, beyond the complexity of the derogation regime applying to <b>energy</b> <b>islands,</b> the scope of possible derogations from the Third Energy Package seems to be exceedingly wide. The Package allows for full vertical reintegration and a loss in regulatory independence and powers which does not seem justified. The Third Energy Package’s derogation system for <b>energy</b> <b>islands</b> should, strictly, be used to ensure the viability and attractiveness of the investments and, in particular, should not reduce the role, power and responsibilities of the national regulatory authority, especially on the issues of security of supply, transparency and consumer protection through the proper regulation of tariffs, bearing in mind that the market will be monopolistic...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFor {{the last}} two decades, {{economic}} development in Reunion Island has led to major structural changes. The latter have been characterized {{by an increase in}} energy demand per person. This demand is mostly related to a high population growth (1. 55 % per year). Reunion currently has 833, 000 inhabitants. The population will rise to 1 million in 2030. Like most ultraperipheral regions of the European Union, Reunion is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels for its energy production. The total primary energy consumption amounted to 1352 ktep in 2009 and 87. 1 % is imported energy. The development of various renewable energies such as solar energy, biomass, ocean energy, etc. is thus of priority concern to aim to achieve energetic independence. Just like other French overseas territories, Reunion policies have widely invested in Renewable Energy Sources (RES) since 2000. This paper aims at presenting the current status, the major achievements of policies and the future objectives in the deployment of renewable energy programmes. The perspective of a net zero <b>energy</b> <b>island</b> versus the pressure of the population is analysed. The barriers to penetration of RES in a small-scale territory are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The {{burning of}} the fossil fuels for {{electricity}} generation has an environmental impact on a global scale. Also, {{the world is going}} to be running out of the fossil fuels before or within the next century. This is the reason why renewable energy sources are used more often. The growth of renewable energy can be expected to continue, because of the European targets which are set for future share of renewable energy of almost 100 % in 2050. The problem with the electricity production from renewable sources is the mismatch between demand and supply. Wind is not always available at a wind park and the sun does not always shine all day and every day on solar panels. This can vary from minutes to seasons. One of the potential possibilities to cope with this problem is to store the electricity directly or indirectly in an energy storage facility during the time when the electricity production is higher than the electricity demand. When the electricity production is lower than the electricity demand, the stored electricity is supplied to the electricity grid. The main research question in this research is: To which extend can be the role of large scale energy storage systems in the Dutch electricity grid to intercept the mismatch between the electricity demand and the electricity production from renewable sources to meet the European targets in 2050 ? Literature research shows that wind onshore and offshore, and fewer solar photovoltaic and biomass, are the most potential renewable energy sources for electricity production in the Netherlands. Data patterns of the wind electricity production and electricity demand with chronological time intervals of 1 hour over a whole year are used in the simulation program PowerPlan. PowerPlan is used to generate the Dutch electricity demand and production till 2050, where the European target is met. The chronological hourly patterns of the total electricity demand and production in 2050 are used as input for the model made with GoldSim. This model is used to calculate the electricity surplus and shortage and to see to which extend energy storage systems can dissolve the mismatch. For this, five energy storage systems are included, which are considered from a literature study as the best storage systems for large scale use. These are: an <b>energy</b> <b>island</b> (inverted pumped hydro storage on the North Sea), Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and three kinds of Flow Battery Energy Storage (FBES). The results show that the total electricity shortage over 2050 is 6. 4 TWh. An energy capacity of 1. 2 TWh from the storage systems is needed to dissolve this electricity shortage. The needed power capacity of the storage systems is 10. 3 GW for charging and 8. 5 GW for discharging. To have a technical reliable Dutch electricity grid in 2050, 40 Energy Islands, 140 CAES systems or 10, 000 PSB systems are needed. These scenarios are not very practical, because of the required space and locations. A more practical scenario is a combination of 2 Energy Islands, 20 CAES systems and 100 of each type Flow Battery Energy Storage, but this scenario is not technical reliable. The only economical attractive scenarios are the technical reliable scenario with 140 CAES systems and the practical scenario without FBES systems, but these are respectively not practical and not technical reliable. The main conclusion of this research is: Large scale energy storage systems in the Dutch electricity grid can technically intercept the mis-match between the electricity demand and the electricity production from renewable sources for 100 % to meet the European targets in 2050, but this is not practical through the needed space and not economical attractive. The results also show that 150 GWh storage capacity (12. 5 % of the 1. 2 TWh needed storage capacity) dissolves 50 % of the electricity shortage. This can be done by 1 <b>Energy</b> <b>Island</b> and 20 CAES systems. For the other 50 %, 1. 05 TWh more capacity is needed. This could be dissolved with the use of other alternatives, for example the installation of gas turbines. This is economical attractive, but then the European target for 2050 is not met. Another alternative is the use of an European electricity grid. ...|$|E

40|$|Energy Union (En Un) is {{a program}} {{released}} by the European Commission intended to create a single energy market between the European Union {{in order to have}} secure, affordable and sustainable energy. This way the imports will be reduced and the final price should be lower (theoretically) increasing the energy security for all the countries. The first communication was in February 2015 and is a very new topic for all the energy stakeholders in the EU. This is why a dissertation for the implications of this policy in UK was developed as part of the Master in Energy, Environmental Technology & Technology from City University London. UK is currently catalogued as an <b>Energy</b> <b>Island</b> (less than 10 % of cross-border interconnection), with 30 % of the generation based in coal, 30 % in gas and 20 % renewable, a liberalised market that varies with changes in gas or wind availability and the third highest kWh price from the EU. More than 20 energy policies and Conservative government with a constraint view against renewables’ subsidies. The implication for the UK and the En Un are divided into three: Infrastructural, Political and Economical. In the middle a map of the new cross-border grids proposed by this policy some of the findings are. The Energy Union in the UK will happen even if there’s no political wiliness or if they decide to not be part of the EU, mainly because the new infrastructure is already being developed (UK-Belgium) additional to the four current cross-border interconnectors. The wholesale market in UK is already liberalized and some cross border trades are being done with clean and cheap electricity from France and Holland; the key development is UK-Ireland, because UK, instead of being a 100 % exporter to Ireland, will flip the coin with an import-export relationship with 8 interconnectors, electricity generated in Euros and close distance. Now it will not really matter if you generate electricity from Fossil Fuels, Nuclear or Renewable; the country will purchase from where is cheapest and available, independently from the source.  Shale Gas, Nuclear, Gas and coal with CCS will be the important investment in the next years, not only in PPP (private public partnership) schemes but with R&D.  New Universities courses will be develop (energy traders / brokers, cross border trade supervisors, etc) and more women should get involved.  The £/ kWh for domestic and small companies will not be significantly reduced (albeit the low cost of it), those companies more engaged with the market will have very good deals and low £/ kWh.
