5|$|On Boxing Day 1935, Tranmere faced Oldham Athletic at Prenton Park in the Third Division North. Oldham {{had beaten}} Tranmere 4–1 the {{previous}} day, but Tranmere won 13–4 in the return fixture, including nine goals by Bunny Bell. At the time Bell's feat was an individual record, but <b>it</b> <b>stood</b> for only {{four months before}} Joe Payne netted ten for Luton Town, on his debut against Bristol Rovers. However, the aggregate of 17 goals in one game remains a league record.|$|E

5|$|Gisborough Priory was rebuilt three times; {{the ruins}} visible today are principally {{those of the}} third rebuild. The site was {{occupied}} in Anglo-Saxon times {{by at least one}} structure, possibly a timber-framed church or boundary wall, indicated by a number of postholes. It is believed there was a Saxon settlement in the vicinity as late-Saxon potsherds and an 8th-century coin have been found buried under the remains of the priory's west nave. The site was abandoned at some point {{and by the time the}} priory was built the land on which <b>it</b> <b>stood</b> was mostly under cultivation. Part of it was used as a graveyard in the early 12th century and an early Norman building was erected in the vicinity, possibly a temporary church.|$|E
5|$|In 631 Anna was {{probably}} at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, {{according to the}} Liber Eliensis, the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth {{is said to have}} been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as <b>it</b> <b>stood</b> just on the East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the Fen edge and the headwaters of the River Stour, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.|$|E

In 1958 Angel's Bakery moved to its present {{location in the}} Givat Shaul industrial zone {{at the corner of}} Beit Hadfus and Farbstein Streets. The site was chosen because <b>it</b> <b>stood</b> across the street from a flour mill. The Angel brothers built Israel's first flour silo and commissioned a Texas company to construct a 750-foot pipeline to convey flour directly from the mill to the silo to the bakery. Today this pipeline brings 120 tons of flour to the bakery daily. The invention, initially opposed by the Jerusalem municipality for being above-ground, won the Kaplan Prize for distinction in productivity and efficiency.|$|E

5|$|In the {{election}} of 1796, under the Constitution as <b>it</b> <b>stood</b> then, each of the presidential electors had two votes, which they were to cast for different men. The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President. This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind, {{as they had been}} thought disreputable and factious. The Federalists planned to deal with this by having all their Electors vote for John Adams, the Vice President, and all but a few for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Like many bipedal dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex was {{historically}} {{depicted as}} a 'living tripod', with the body at 45 degrees or less from the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground, similar to a kangaroo. This concept dates from Joseph Leidy's 1865 reconstruction of Hadrosaurus, the first to depict a dinosaur in a bipedal posture. In 1915, convinced that the creature stood upright, Henry Fairfield Osborn, {{former president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, further reinforced the notion in unveiling the first complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton arranged this way. <b>It</b> <b>stood</b> in an upright pose for 77 years, until it was dismantled in 1992.|$|E

Doubts over Matthew Etherington's fitness resurfaced when he was taken off in the 63rd minute, with Stoke City still in the game at 0–0 as <b>it</b> <b>stood.</b>|$|E
