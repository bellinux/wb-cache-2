5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 20 essential and nonessential amino acids. Analysis of the free amino acids (that is, those not bound up in protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the team {{departed}} for Australia in late March they had played 74 matches in Britain, winning 49, losing 20, and drawing 5. However, due to injury, Warbrick only appeared in 14 matches; in contrast David Gage featured in 68, and eight other members played more than 50. Warbrick {{was not the only}} player to experience injury; the taxing schedule of matches took a toll, and he frequently struggled to find a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 15 fit players. On top of playing relatively few matches in Britain, Warbrick scored only once there – a conversion against Devon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months, the wing was not {{assigned}} any aircraft, and thus worked with other units who were in possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. In March and April, the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April. This gave the newly activated 69th Bombardment Squadron a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> aircraft. By the end of August, the number had increased to 27 bombers, 322 officers, 313 airmen, and 350 civilians. Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, making it more of a home for airmen and their families.|$|E

2500|$|Although Kaikohe {{has become}} {{established}} as the service {{centre of the}} Far North, it failed to generate much rail traffic {{in the early years}} of the line. [...] During the first ten months of existence, just 1,500 tons of inbound freight was carried, with roughly half that carried outbound; the decline continued to the point that in 1918 Kaikohe lost its stationmaster. [...] Minimal services were offered, and although losses increased up to 1930, fortunes had somewhat improved by 1940, and by 1950 there was sufficient traffic to justify six trains each way a week.

50|$|Issaquah {{was placed}} on the route running from Leschi to Mercer Island and then to Newport. In 1891 the eastern {{terminus}} of this route connected to a road that ran to Lake Sammamish, Fall City, Preston, Issaquah, North Bend, and Snoqualmie, Washington. It is doubtful whether Issaquah ever carried the <b>full</b> licensed <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> automobiles when on Lake Washington.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} work {{was carried out}} by over 5,000 workers, mostly German engineers drafted in from several companies including Mannesmann, Gute Hoffnungshütte, Krupp and the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, supplemented by 430 miners recruited from the Ruhr and Soviet prisoners of war who were used as slave labourers. The intensive Allied bombing campaign caused delays, but {{construction work}} continued nonetheless at a high pace underground. The original plans had envisaged having the first battery of five guns ready by March 1944 and the <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 25 guns by 1 October 1944, but these target dates were not met.|$|E
5|$|The frigate Thétis, {{stationed}} to {{the south}} of Brest at Lorient, was selected to carry supplies to Martinique and given a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 330 men, 40 cannon and a new captain, Jacques Pinsum. Supplies were loaded, including over 1,000 barrels of flour and 106 soldiers to reinforce the garrison at Martinique. Secrecy was tight: to prevent the British discovering Thétis mission, even the local shore defences were not informed of the frigate's departure early on 10 November 1808.|$|E
5|$|The most {{stringent}} {{tests are}} reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.|$|E
40|$|Keratin 5 (K 5) mRNA {{and protein}} are {{shown to be}} {{expressed}} in normal mammary epithelial cells in culture and are absent from tumor-derived cell lines. To extend these findings, the <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> <b>of</b> keratins in normal, immortalized, and tumor cells were compared. It is shown here that normal cells produce keratins K 5, K 6, K 7, K 14, and K 17, whereas tumor cells produce mainly keratins K 8, K 18, and K 19. In immortalized cells, which are preneoplastic or partially transformed, the levels of K 5 mRNA and protein are lower than in normal cells, whereas the amount of K 18 is increased. Thus, K 5 is an important marker in the tumorigenic process, distinguishing normal from tumor cells, and decreased K 5 expression correlates with tumorigenic progression...|$|R
50|$|One {{development}} was that Wessex and its recent south-eastern conquests became a united kingdom. Unlike his predecessors, Æthelberht did not appoint {{another member of}} his family as under-king of Kent.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to {{the deterioration of the}} warships, decades of peace along the coast had relegated the military to a low importance, and garrisons became severely understaffed due to desertion. By the early 1550s these garrisons were reduced to roughly one third <b>of</b> their <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> <b>of</b> soldiers. During the wokou crisis, defenders had to augment their forces with various militia and mercenary groups like gentry guards, local ruffians, and even Shaolin monks. The Ming government, being committed to the northern frontier defence against the Mongols, could only spare reinforcements to the coast in the form of bandit fighters, ex-pirates, and aboriginal [...] "wolf troops" [...] (狼兵, langbing) led by government-recognized tribal headmen. These assorted troops, euphemistically called [...] "guest troops" [...] (客兵, kebing), were generally ineffective in battle, and were often a burden to the local populace.|$|R
5|$|Even {{though the}} brigade was an Imperial Service unit, the cavalry regiments and brigade {{headquarters}} included attached British Indian Army Special Service Officers (SSO), {{but only as}} advisors. In 1914, the three cavalry regiments had two SSOs attached, and Colonel J. Desaraj Urs Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore State Forces accompanied the Mysore Lancers as an observer. The Jodhpur Lancers joined the brigade with seven SSOs attached. Throughout the war the establishment of British officers assigned to the cavalry regiments was gradually increased; in February 1915 there were four in each regiment, in 1917 another two were assigned and in mid-1918 a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> twelve British officers {{in each of the}} regiments was reached.|$|E
5|$|Modified bases {{also occur}} in DNA. The {{first of these}} {{recognised}} was 5-methylcytosine which {{was found in the}} genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1925. The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and halovirus FH the <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present in DNA in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975. 7-methylguanine was described in 1976. N4-methylcytosine in DNA was described in 1983. In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the Rhizobium phages RL38JI and N17. α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the Delftia phage ΦW-14 and the Bacillus phage SP10. α-glutamythymidine is found in the Bacillus phage SP01 and 5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the Bacillus phage SP15.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanized}} divisions {{were organized}} along the Soviet model with three mechanized infantry regiments, one tank regiment, and a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 12,000 infantry soldiers, while the armored divisions were composed of 3 tank and one mechanized infantry regiment plus support units. The artillery, antitank, and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver. The air defense regiments {{consisted of two}} anti-aircraft artillery battalions and one surface-to-air missile (SAM) battalion, each composed of several batteries. In the late 1980s the artillery regiments of mechanized and tank divisions included two artillery battalions, one multiple rocket launcher battalion, and one surface-to-surface missile battalion.|$|E
40|$|SummaryOne of {{the reasons}} that the {{crystalline}} lenses of vertebrate eyes are highly transparent {{is that most of the}} cells have broken down all of their organelles, including the nuclei. These cells can neither synthesize new proteins nor generate energy by electron transport in the mitochondria [1, 2]. Only in the peripheral layers—in the cichlid fish Aequidens pulcher, beyond 92 % of the lens radius—are there cells with <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> <b>of</b> organelles. We report here that the optical properties of the lens change between the light-adapted and dark-adapted states in A. pulcher. Changes occur even in cell layers free of organelles, and they occur in parallel with changes in retinal function between the light-adapted (all-cone, color vision) and dark-adapted (all-rod, grayscale vision) states. Depleting the eye of dopamine also caused changes in the optical properties similar to those of dark adaptation. Our results indicate that the refractive index of the organelle-free lens fiber cells can be adjusted quickly and accurately...|$|R
40|$|A few simply-stated rules {{govern the}} {{entanglement}} patterns {{that can occur}} in mutually unbiased basis sets (MUBs), and constrain the combinations of such patterns that can coexist (ie, the stoichiometry) in <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> <b>of</b> p^N+ 1 MUBs. We consider Hilbert spaces of prime power dimension (as realized by systems of N prime-state particles, or qupits), where <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> are known to exist, and we assume only that MUBs are eigenbases of generalized Pauli operators, without using a particular construction. The general rules include the following: 1) In any MUB, a particular qupit appears either in a pure state, or totally entangled, and 2) in any <b>full</b> MUB <b>complement,</b> each qupit is pure in p+ 1 bases (not necessarily the same ones), and totally entangled in the remaining p^N-p. It follows that {{the maximum number of}} product bases is p+ 1, and when this number is realized, all remaining p^N-p bases in the complement are characterized by the total entanglement of every qupit. This "standard distribution" is inescapable for two qupits (of any p), where only product and generalized Bell bases are admissible MUB types. This and the following results generalize previous results for qubits and qutrits. With three qupits there are three MUB types, and a number of combinations (p+ 2) are possible in <b>full</b> <b>complements.</b> With N= 4, there are 6 MUB types for p= 2, but new MUB types become possible with larger p, and these are essential to the realization <b>of</b> <b>full</b> <b>complements.</b> With this example, we argue that new MUB types, showing new entanglement characteristics, should enter with every step in N, and when N is a prime plus 1, also at critical p values, p=N- 1. Such MUBs should play critical roles in filling complements. Comment: 27 pages, one figure, to be submitted to Physical Revie...|$|R

5|$|After Point Grey and Point Orient {{were turned}} over to the RVN on 14 July only Point Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13. On that day the {{remaining}} two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone. On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked, making the decks very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats. The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents. A week later both cutters with Australian Army explosive ordnance disposal soldiers aboard cruised the My Thanh River and destroyed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Despite its severe {{financial}} straits, by 1953, DuMont {{appeared to}} be {{on its way to}} establishing itself as the third national network. DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, but it could count on only seven primary stations – its three owned-and-operated stations ("O"), plus WGN-TV in Chicago, KTTV (channel 11) in Los Angeles, KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV) in Denver and WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio. In contrast, ABC had a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> five O, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network (it was descended from NBC's Blue Network) from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty and a profit stream to subsidize television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while CBS and NBC had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters (the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off {{as a result of the}} United States v.

50|$|Daniel Frohman ran the Lyceum Theatre Company, a {{stock company}} with {{a more or less}} {{constant}} troupe of actors performing several different plays each season. Frohman sought to introduce as many new, “modern plays” as possible. The plays reflected both the older melodrama style and the newer naturalistic or realistic style, common to the last decades before the motion picture era. The Lyceum Company also sent productions on the road with <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> <b>of</b> actors, sets, musicians, crew, and publicists. (Prior to this, lead actors tended to tour alone and work with local actors and musicians, with results of varying artistic quality.) From 1886 until 1890, David Belasco worked for the Lyceum Company as stage manager (in today's terms, director or artistic director), co-wrote three of the company’s productions with Henry Churchill de Mille, and taught at the acting school. In January 1899, three years before the old Lyceum shut down, Daniel Frohman moved the Lyceum Theatre Company to Daly’s Theatre. He and his brother Charles Frohman continued to produce plays at the Lyceum after the stock company moved.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} investigated whether single snowpits can reliably represent snowpack stability on uniform slopes. The study utilized seven {{carefully selected}} slopes, three {{each in the}} Bridger and Madison Ranges of Southwest Montana, {{and one in the}} Columbia Mountains near Rogers Pass, British Columbia. Teams performed ten Quantified Loaded Column Tests in each of five snowpits within a 900 m 2 plot at a slope, measuring shear strength in a single weak layer. Collection of slab shear stress data enabled the calculation of a strength/stress stability ratio. Altogether, eleven stability-sampling trials were performed during 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002, testing several weak layer types exhibiting a wide range of strengths. Of the 54 snowpits completed, 26 pits (48 %) represented plot-wide stability and 28 pits (52 %) did not. One plot collapsed prior to completion of a 55 th pit. Two of the eleven plots did contain <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> <b>of</b> five representative snowpits.

5|$|In July 1809, Hamelin had {{departed}} Île de France for the Bay of Bengal in Vénus, {{accompanied by the}} corvette Créole and the frigate Manche. The frigates were both armed with at least 40 cannon each and the corvette 14. All three ships were crewed by a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> experienced sailors drawn from the pool of unemployed men stranded in Île de France by the British blockade. This force was followed a month later by the similarly sized frigate Bellone. Hamelin's early cruises were successful: operating initially off the Nicobar Islands, Vénus captured the HEIC armed ship Orient on 26 July. After this however, targets became scarcer and despite the capture {{of a number of}} small merchant vessels, Hamelin was forced to take his squadron further east and south to find British shipping to attack. On 10 October, he raided the small trading port of Tappanooly on Sumatra, captured its British population and razed the town.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh {{arrived in}} Australia in October 1914 {{to take up}} his duties, and was {{immediately}} faced with major difficulties. Without warning or notification, Shackleton had cut the Ross Sea party's allocated funds in half, from £2,000 to £1,000. Mackintosh was instructed {{to make up the}} difference by soliciting free gifts, and to mortgage the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the purchase of Aurora had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts to mortgage it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an extensive overhaul, which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government. The task of dealing with these difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a negative image of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public. Some members of the party resigned, others were dismissed; recruiting a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> crew and scientific staff involved some last-minute appointments which left the party noticeably short of Antarctic experience.|$|E
5|$|With {{continuing}} budgetary restraints, the {{air force}} remained in an overall state of neglect during the 1920s. 27 Twenty-seven Fokker D.VII, 16Hanriot HD.1, and 15Nieuport 28 Bébé war surplus airplanes were acquired in 1920(as were 20Zeppelin LZ C.11 reconnaissance biplanes obtained on the postwar black market) but were soon obsolete, and further efforts to develop indigenous aircraft (MA-6, MA-7, and MA-8) were unsuccessful. Seven pilots were killed in 1925and 1926before all Swiss military aircraft were equipped with parachutes. By 1929, only 17of its 213airplanes were considered fit for service. The air force consisted of 18aviation companies (Flieger-Kompagnien), three aerial photography platoons and one airfield company.
