40|$|The {{need for}} {{courts and the}} {{judiciary}} to operate in public and for their activities {{to be open to}} public scrutiny is a well-established goal of liberal democracies. One of its recent policy manifestations is in debates about confidence in the <b>justice</b> system <b>and</b> initiatives designed to improve confidence. In the majority of cases, public scrutiny of court <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>activity</b> relies upon the media. Reports in regional and national newspapers have long been – and research suggests continue to be – an important source of information, shaping public knowledge and facilitating public scrutiny of the justice system. Unlike in some other common law jurisdictions, in the UK there is almost no scholarship on these representations, past or present. The result is that {{little is known about the}} representation of courts and the judiciary in Press reports. The aim of this paper is to take a first step towards changing that state of affairs. It uses a data set made up of 205 contemporary newspaper reports of court <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>activity.</b> These come from a sample of 24 daily newspapers: 10 national newspapers and 14 from the regions. All were published on Thursday 16 February 2012, an unexceptional day in the life of the <b>justice</b> system <b>and</b> the Press. The modest goal of this paper is to offer an analysis of this snapshot of the courts and the judiciary in the Press in England and Wales...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} shows that, despite high interest rates, wage earners {{in the early}} twentieth century frequently obtained credit from retail shops, from loan sharks, and from the emerging formal consumer credit market. When wage earners defaulted, the options for collection available to their creditors were governed by state laws on garnishment and wage assignment. These important laws varied widely from state to state, and little is known about their origins or evolution. In Illinois, the law put significant restrictions on creditors in the late nineteenth century, but the restrictions were removed in the first quarter of the twentieth century. This article shows how this dramatic shift resulted from the interaction of legislative <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> was driven by both interest group politics <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> action. </p...|$|R

Already 7 years into recession, crisis-hit Greece {{is experiencing a}} tremendous institutional change. This change, which takes place informally rather than formally, is affecting state institutions- primarily its parliament, the executive and courts.

How have state institutions reacted to the financial crisis? How do economic emergency and external players interplay with local institutions and interests?
