5|$|Multiple escape {{attempts}} were made {{throughout the history of}} the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. The guards forced all prisoners to watch as the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other escape {{attempts were}} made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which motivated the POWs to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on others to prevent them from making escape attempts.|$|E

Once again, he had a talented regular officer as chief of staff, Brigadier Ragnar Garrett, with whom he had worked in Greece during 1941 and more recently in New Guinea. Moreover, as a corps commander, tactical details could be left to subordinates, although Savige still had to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on them to ensure that they did not take unnecessary risks or incur needless casualties. Savige continued to tour the front lines wearing his scarlet cap band and flying his car flag. He also maintained his concern for, and rapport with, the ordinary soldiers under his command. The final campaign on Bougainville cost 516Australian lives. Some 8,500Japanese were killed while 9,800died of other causes, leaving 23,571still alive when the war ended. On 8September 1945, Savige accepted their surrender at Torokina.|$|E

They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past.

500|$|O'Reilly ran most Mint {{operations}} under Scobey and his successor, Robert J. Grant. Although the Mint Bureau {{was very}} {{busy in the}} booming economy of the 1920s, numismatic historian Roger Burdette points out that there were flaws in operations—for example, Philadelphia Mint officials, instead of setting aside gold coins from each batch delivered for inspecting and testing by the annual Assay Commission, took all assay coins from a bag set aside {{at the start of}} the year, increasing the likelihood that nonstandard coins would go undetected. O'Reilly did <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on coinage operations, warning the San Francisco Mint in November 1931 that it had produced fewer than 200,000 nickels, a figure that if allowed to stand would have resulted in the issue being hoarded by collectors. [...] She directed the mint to strike nothing but nickels for the remainder of the year, resulting in a total mintage for the 1931–S of 1,200,000, still the second-lowest by date and mint mark in the Buffalo nickel series.|$|E

She allows Sayid to return to his camp, and cautions him to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on the other survivors. Over two weeks later, she comes across a delirious Claire (Emilie de Ravin), who had been left in the jungle after being kidnapped by the Others. Noticing that Claire's shouting is alerting the Others to her presence, Rousseau knocks her unconscious and carries her back to the other survivors. Rousseau makes her next appearance in [...] "Numbers", where she shoots at Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) and Hurley (Jorge Garcia), suspecting them of being Others. In the season one finale, set 43 days after the plane crash, Rousseau arrives on the beach and warns everyone that the Others are coming. After Claire gives birth to her son Aaron, Rousseau steals him and intends to swap him for her own child. When the Others do not come, Rousseau reluctantly returns him to Sayid. In season two, set two weeks later, Rousseau informs Sayid that she has caught one of the Others, who later turns out to be Ben. Later, Rousseau joins Claire and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) who are searching for medicine for Claire's baby, in one of the Others' work stations. Disappointed that she has not found any trace of Alex, she begins to leave them when Claire tells her that she believes Alex helped her escape when the Others captured her.|$|E

500|$|Historians {{note that}} women during the Tang dynasty were brazen, assertive, active, and {{relatively}} more socially liberated than Song women. Women of the Song period are typically seen as well educated {{and interested in}} expressing themselves through poetry, yet more reserved, respectful, [...] "slender, petite and dainty," [...] according to Gernet. Evidence of foot binding as a new trend in the Southern Song period certainly reinforces this notion. This trend had roots in Neo-Confucian beliefs according to Blake. [...] "However, the greater number of documents due to more widespread printing reveal a much more complex and rich reality about family life and Song women. Through written stories, legal cases, and other documents, many different sources show that Song women held considerable clout in family decision-making, and some were quite economically savvy. [...] Men dominated the public sphere, while affluent wives {{spent most of their}} time indoors enjoying leisure activities and managing the household. However, women of the lower and middle classes were not solely bound to the domestic sphere. It was common for women to manage town inns, some to manage restaurants, farmers' daughters to weave mats and sell them on their own behalf, midwives to deliver babies, Buddhist nuns to study religious texts and sutras, female nurses to assist physicians, and women to <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on their own financial affairs. In the case of the latter, legal case documents describe childless widows who accused their nephews of stealing their property. There are also numerous mentions of women drawing upon their dowries to help their husband's sisters marry into other prominent families. One notable figure was Empress Liu 劉 (969-1033), the first empress in the Song dynasty, who wore the emperor’s robes while conducting an imperial sacrifice {{in the last year of}} her life.|$|E
