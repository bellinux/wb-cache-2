500|$|All of {{the episodes}} open with Bathurst portraying Mark Taylor, a sitcom writer, {{apparently}} performing stand-up {{in a small}} comedy club. These performances are fantasy sequences, playing out in the character's mind and portraying his internal creative processes as comedic monologues; these monologues mainly employ material from the character's failing marriage and are intended to show that [...] "he thinks in punchlines, in comedy". Episodes regularly cut back to these fantasy performances, which usually open with the signature line: [...] "My wife left me...". Moffat felt that audiences needed to know <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>that</b> the relationship would not survive. However, it was unclear to some viewers that the fantasy sequences were set in the writer's mind; many journalists reported that the character Mark was a stand-up comic, not a sitcom writer.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} company was founded, {{production}} started in the SAT factory in Vallila, Helsinki. The Yhteissisu vehicles were built separately from SAT vehicles. It was clear <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>that</b> vehicles should be produced away from Helsinki; the company sought a suitable location close to good rail, road and waterway connections. The original idea was to build the factory inside caves mined into bedrock; the place {{would be required to}} have suitable geology. A suitable area was finally found in Vanaja next to Hämeenlinna. Yhteissisu bought [...] of land on 14 March 1944. A contract for factory construction was signed with a contractor on 30 March. The Railway Administration accepted Yhteissisu's plan to build a railway connection in the area. Quarrying work for the underground workshop began in July 1944. The expense and a shortage of time meant the plan had to be amended, and the entire production area was built above ground. The factory buildings were completed in early November 1944. Alvar Aalto's architectural office designed houses for the factory workers.|$|E

[...] Lesser and Palmer developed many of the research methods used to study the show's impact on children throughout the show's history.

[...] Knell also stated that Lesser challenged the conventional wisdom of the time that television could not teach young children, and proved that [...] "TV was something organic in itself; it was a technological species that lived under its own rules of engagement".|$|E

50|$|Opa-opa, one of Sega's early mascot {{characters}} (debuting in the 1986 arcade game Fantasy Zone), was {{a frequent}} minor character on the show.

Series artist Andrea Sorrentino stated, [...] "it was clear <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>that</b> for this project Sony and DC [...] wanted something a bit different from a 'classical' comic. So I just took my usual style and added to it something new, like new colors from the videogame palette." [...] She stated that the games have strong, epic images, and that she easily adapted her style to Wolfman's writing as he [...] "did really good work showing both dramatic and epic scenes." [...] Sorrentino used color to give importance to each scene, adding hot colors (red, orange, or brown) in action scenes and cold ones (green or light blue) in others so that readers could immediately have an emotional reaction.|$|E

[...] "Malaysia 32" [...] is the band's first instrumental song, and {{was based on a}} synthesizer riff made by the band's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera which was then completed with ideas from everyone in the band. The song was called [...] "Malaysia" [...] because of how at one point they added a vocal melody that sounded like the name of the city Kuala Lumpur. The number 32 in the title is a reference {{to the fact that the}} song is based on a synthesizer loop of 32 bars. Originally [...] "Uneri" [...] had been envisioned as a rock song, but the band decided against this after creating [...] "Night Fishing Is Good".
