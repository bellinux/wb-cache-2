5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has been done}} at Mount Baker over the past decade, and it is now among the most-studied of the Cascade volcanoes. Recent and ongoing projects include <b>gravimetric</b> and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, fumarole gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow lava flow, and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continues, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.|$|E
5|$|Lead dihalides are well-characterized; this {{includes}} the diastatide, and mixed halides, such as PbFCl. The relative insolubility of the latter forms a useful basis for the <b>gravimetric</b> determination of fluorine. The difluoride was the first solid ionically conducting compound to be discovered (in 1834, by Michael Faraday). The other dihalides decompose on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light, especially the diiodide. Many lead pseudohalides are known. Lead(II) forms an extensive variety of halide coordination complexes, such as 2−, 4−, and the n5n− chain anion.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} silver {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u; this value is very important because {{of the importance of}} silver compounds, particularly halides, in <b>gravimetric</b> analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{is closely}} {{monitored}} by the Osservatorio Vesuvio in Naples with extensive networks of seismic and <b>gravimetric</b> stations, {{a combination of a}} GPS-based geodetic array and satellite-based synthetic aperture radar to measure ground movement and by local surveys and chemical analyses of gases emitted from fumaroles. All of this is intended to track magma rising underneath the volcano. No magma has been detected within 10km of the surface, and so the volcano is classified by the Observatory as at a Basic or Green Level.|$|E
5|$|White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a {{versatile}} precursor {{to many other}} silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver {{was associated with the}} moon. It is often used for <b>gravimetric</b> analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} of the project {{included}} several elements such as a powerful main engine whose propellant was pressure fed, a computer and a unit to measure inertia {{in order to control}} maneuvers. In addition, a long and close range radar system was required to guide the satellite (the system was taken from the Westinghouse radar used in Bomarc surface-to-air missiles), as were lights to illuminate the other satellite, and four cameras for observation. A radiation detector was to be installed to determine if a satellite was carrying either a nuclear weapon or something whose power source involved a radioactive substance. Other sensors included infrared and <b>gravimetric</b> sensors to ascertain the mass of the other satellite, while defensive counter measures would be installed to identify decoys, booby traps, anti-jamming devices, and enemy attack, along with nitrogen cold gas thrusters for orientation.|$|E
25|$|The National Aeronautic and Space Administration {{also used}} Derrick Cave in the 1960s. As {{the agency was}} {{planning}} lunar landings, it was interested in determining if underground caverns could be detected from high altitude using <b>gravimetric</b> instruments. To support the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, North American Aviation and Pacific Northwest Bell conducted high altitude <b>gravimetric</b> tests using Derrick Cave as the underground target.|$|E

25|$|MOF-177 has larger pores, so {{hydrogen}} is compressed within holes rather than adsorbed to the surface. This leads to higher total <b>gravimetric</b> uptake but lower volumetric storage density compared to MOF-5.|$|E
25|$|Using LOHCs {{relatively}} high <b>gravimetric</b> storage densities {{can be reached}} (about 6 wt-%) and the overall energy efficiency is higher than for other chemical storage options such as producing methane from the hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{amount of}} raw {{materials}} is very important. Semolina dosing is done by two methods: volumetric feed (measurement by volume), and <b>gravimetric</b> feed (measurement by weight). In volumetric feed, a specific volume of semolina is measured by variable speed screws or rotary air-lock valves. This method is not very accurate since the amount depends on {{the density of the}} semolina. In <b>gravimetric</b> feed, semolina is weighed by a variable speed transport system, which is equipped with a device measuring the flow. Although this method is more accurate, it is more expensive and needs to be isolated.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{the only}} {{hydrides}} which {{are capable of}} achieving the 9 wt% <b>gravimetric</b> goal for 2015 (see chart above) are limited to lithium, boron and aluminium based compounds; {{at least one of}} the first-row elements or Al must be added. Research is being done to determine new compounds which can be used to meet these requirements.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneous {{advances}} in early seismic imaging techniques {{in and around}} Wadati–Benioff zones along the trenches bounding many continental margins, together with many other geophysical (e.g. <b>gravimetric)</b> and geological observations, showed how the oceanic crust could disappear into the mantle, providing the mechanism to balance {{the extension of the}} ocean basins with shortening along its margins.|$|E
25|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} of Earth's deep interior can be acquired only indirectly by geophysical and geochemical methods. For the investigation of postulated plumes, <b>gravimetric,</b> geoid and in particular seismological methods along with geochemical analyses of erupted lavas have proven especially useful. Numerical models of the geodynamical processes attempt to merge these observations into a consistent general picture.|$|E
25|$|Water {{content or}} {{moisture}} content is {{the quantity of}} water contained in a material, such as soil (called soil moisture), rock, ceramics, crops, or wood. Water content is used {{in a wide range}} of scientific and technical areas, and is expressed as a ratio, which can range from 0 (completely dry) to the value of the materials' porosity at saturation. It can be given on a volumetric or mass (<b>gravimetric)</b> basis.|$|E
25|$|It {{was headed}} by British {{explorer}} Dr Vivian Fuchs, with New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary leading the New Zealand Ross Sea Support team. After spending {{the winter of}} 1957 at Shackleton Base, Fuchs finally {{set out on the}} transcontinental journey in November 1957, with a twelve-man team travelling in six vehicles; three Sno-Cats, two Weasels and one specially adapted Muskeg tractor. On route, the team were also tasked with carrying out scientific research including seismic soundings and <b>gravimetric</b> readings.|$|E
25|$|The quake gave {{scientists}} {{the opportunity}} to collect {{a large amount of}} data so as to model in great detail the seismic events that took place. This data is expected to be used in a variety of ways, providing as it does unprecedented information about how buildings respond to shaking, and other effects. <b>Gravimetric</b> data from the quake has been used to create a model for increased warning time compared to seismic models, as gravity fields travel faster than seismic waves.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} is to combine multiple information sources: not just terrestrial gravimetry, but also satellite geodetic data on {{the figure of the}} Earth, from analysis of satellite orbital perturbations, and lately from satellite gravity missions such as GOCE and GRACE. In such combination solutions, the low-resolution part of the geoid solution is provided by the satellite data, while a 'tuned' version of the above Stokes equation is used to calculate the high-resolution part, from terrestrial <b>gravimetric</b> data from a neighbourhood of the evaluation point only.|$|E
25|$|Nova derives {{his powers}} from an energy source called the Nova Force which all Nova Corps Centurions wield. This energy was {{transferred}} to Rider by the Nova-Centurion Rhomann Dey. The Nova Force affords Rider superhuman powers including flight, superhuman strength, speed, and durability, {{as well as the}} power to absorb energy directed against him and release it as <b>gravimetric</b> pulses and beams, either from specific parts of his body or from his entire body. Nova is a good hand-to-hand combatant, and has been coached by Chord.|$|E
25|$|The expedition, {{part of the}} Russian {{program for}} the 20072008 International Polar Year, used the Akademik Fedorov {{research}} ship, with both MIR submersibles on board and the nuclear icebreaker Rossiya (Russia) led it through the Arctic ice. The ships had two Mi-8 helicopters and geological probe devices, and Il-18 aircraft with <b>gravimetric</b> devices. Its aim {{was to investigate the}} structure and evolution of the Earth's crust in the Arctic regions neighbouring Eurasia, such as the regions of Mendeleev Ridge, Alpha Ridge and Lomonosov Ridge, to discover whether they are linked with the Siberian shelf.|$|E
500|$|<b>Gravimetric</b> data {{indicate}} that a vertical low density body connects Uturunku with the APVC magma body {{at a depth of}} [...] Several such bodies with radii [...] are found beneath the APVC. In 2013, del Potro et al. estimated that this body may contain 25% by volume of molten dacite. The exact shape of this body is unknown due to insufficient resolution of the <b>gravimetric</b> and magnetotelluric measurements. The formation of buoyant mobile layers following heating may destabilize this magma mush and cause lavas to accumulate a few kilometres below the volcano and erupt.|$|E
500|$|<b>Gravimetric</b> {{data from}} Cassinis December 2010 flybys showed that Enceladus likely has a liquid water ocean beneath its frozen surface, {{but at the}} time it was thought the {{subsurface}} ocean was limited to the south pole. The top of the ocean probably lies beneath a [...] thick ice shelf. The ocean may be [...] deep at the south pole.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{impetus for}} Operation Sandblast was to {{increase}} American technological and scientific prestige before the May 1960 Paris Summit between U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. [...] It {{also provided a}} high-profile public demonstration of the capability of U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarines to carry out long-range submerged operations independent of external support and undetected by hostile forces, presaging the initial deployment of the U.S Navy's Polaris ballistic missile submarines later in 1960. [...] Finally, Operation Sandblast gathered extensive oceanographic, hydrographic, <b>gravimetric,</b> geophysical, and psychological data during Tritons circumnavigation.|$|E
500|$|Remembering Q {{from the}} Enterprise, O'Brien spots Q {{on the station}} and warns Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), speculating that Q may be {{responsible}} for the power drains. When confronted, Q denies any wrongdoing, although he offers no alternative explanation. As the power drains become more severe, an unknown <b>gravimetric</b> field begins pulling the station toward the nearby wormhole. Q challenges Sisko to a boxing match on the Promenade, and suddenly, they are both wearing antique-style boxing costumes. A few punches are thrown, and Q is shocked when Sisko knocks him down. [...] "You hit me! Picard never hit me!" [...] Q exclaims.|$|E

Soon after, however, {{the source of the}} <b>gravimetric</b> field and power losses is traced to the crystal itself. The crystal is quickly beamed into space before it can destroy the station. Once outside, it transforms into an alien life form and travels into the wormhole. After the incident, Bashir finally awakens from his slumber. Unaware of what has just transpired, he yawns and tells Dax that he feels like he has been asleep for days. A bemused Dax gives him a strange look to which Bashir replies [...] "What--did I miss something?" ...|$|E
500|$|In stark {{contrast}} to this, all four silver(I) halides are known. The fluoride, chloride, and bromide have the sodium chloride structure, but the iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic zinc blende structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements. As the halogen group is descended, the silver halide gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the color changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for ligand-metal charge transfer (X−Ag+ → XAg) decreases. The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small {{that it has a}} considerable solvation energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates. The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in <b>gravimetric</b> analytical methods. All four are photosensitive (though the monofluoride is so only to ultraviolet light), especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal, and thus were used in traditional photography. The reaction involved is: ...|$|E
500|$|Operation Sandblast {{gathered}} extensive oceanographic, hydrographic, <b>gravimetric,</b> and geophysical data. [...] Water {{samples were}} taken throughout Tritons circumnavigation, which were tested {{for differences in}} chemical composition, salinity, density, and temperature. Such samples were vital for submarine operations. Water salinity and density affects submerged trim, as well as sonar performance, while warmer water affects the efficiency of shipboard condensers and, consequently, ship speed. [...] Measurements from the installed gravity meter provided a continuous record of variations in earth's gravity field throughout Tritons circumnavigation. This extensive gravity study assisted the Navy in developing navigational aids. [...] Some 144 hydrographic bottles to track ocean currents were released during Operation Sandblast. [...] Triton mapped uncharted seamounts, coral reefs, and other submerged topographic structures using its fathometer and sonar systems. [...] These scientific data gathered during Operation Sandblast continued to be invaluable in providing information on oceanic changes, with Sydney Levitus, the director of NOAA's Ocean Climate Laboratory in Silver Spring, Maryland, characterizing Tritons data (pictured) as being [...] "a very exciting set of observations." ...|$|E
