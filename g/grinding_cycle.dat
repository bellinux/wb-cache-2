In the protocol, a preliminary <b>grinding</b> <b>cycle</b> was first employed, which significantly reduced {{the effect of}} the initial wheel geometry error on the ground profile accuracy. A new compensation approach was developed. The compensation used the ground profile measured from a Talysurf profilometer to modify the NC toot path for the next <b>grinding</b> <b>cycle.</b> The tool path was modified by offsetting the residual profile error along the normal direction of a grinding point, rather than in the horizontal direction commonly used in the conventional method. The performance of the developed method was evaluated by fabricating aspherical mould inserts on cemented tungsten carbide. The result indicated that the residual profile error after two grinding cycles was reduced to approximately 0. 4 mu m in PV, with average surface roughness of below 10 nm, which is more efficient than the conventional compensation process.

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} and intractable problem of domestic engineering industry is the low productivity of operations performed on CNC machines. The {{reason for this}} is the absence of standards and methodologies for the design of optimal cycles for CNC machines. As a result, in practice, one has to manually choose processing modes which presents no {{solution to the problem of}} low productivity, as this method generates losses, particularly in relation to automated production intra grinding processing on CNC machines in series production. To solve this problem the research, primarily, proposes a methodology for the design of optimal multivariable stepwise <b>cycles</b> internal <b>grinding</b> processing, allowing to calculate as follows: optimal values of the radial flow at all stages of the cycle; the optimum value of the axial feed at all stages of the cycle; optimal allocation deduct allowance on the steps of the cycle for radial and axial feeds, which provide the minimum cycle time, given the technological constraints of the objective function. As a mathematical method of optimization of <b>grinding</b> <b>cycles,</b> applied dynamic programming method (DPM) is used. The application of the DPM is permissible due to the fact that this method does not require constructing an a priori bounds of the permissible restrictions and is not sensitive to the properties of management models and constraints.

The developed technique focuses on the compensation of form error resulted by two major error sources, wheel radius and waviness errors. Using the developed technique, the initial residual form error upon the completion of primary grinding is minimized. Subsequently, the residual form error is compensated by modifying the NC tool path. With this technique, the speed of convergence of the residual form error has improved markedly.

40|$|Accuracy in {{precision}} grinding is strongly affected by {{variations in the}} normal grinding force. The force gives rise to deflections of the machine, grinding wheel and workpiece. To allow relaxation of the deflection a dwell period is included {{at the end of}} the <b>grinding</b> <b>cycle.</b> Estimation of the time constant during grinding allows the automatic selection of the correct dwell time for the individual workpiece and current force level. A new strategy has been developed for the estimation of the time constant based on power measurement during dwell. The strategy employs the weighted least mean squares technique together with weightings based on classification of the power level into bands. The power bands are designed so as to employ lower weightings to be applied to power samples in the regions of the power curve most prone to causing an inaccurate estimate of the time constant.

In case of rough grinding, with a wheel of 46 µm abrasives, ELID-grinding is preferable compared to grinding with a conventional resin-bonded wheel or a CIB wheel without ELID. Resin-bonded wheels are characterized by low G-ratios and are prone to chattering effects.

Unlike other conventional and superabrasive wheels, these wheels are not periodically trued or dressed. Consequently, their performance during grinding varies significantly as the wheel wears down and its topography changes. ^ An investigation was undertaken of the grinding process with electroplated CBN wheels. The topography of unused wheels of various different grain sizes was characterized in terms of areal grain density and protrusion height distribution of the grain tips. Internal cylindrical and straight surface grinding tests were then conducted to investigate the wheel wear {{and its effect on}} the wheel topography and grinding performance. Grinding tests were performed mostly on hardened AISI 52100 steel over a wide range of operating conditions. Measurements were made of the forces, grinding power, surface roughness, radial wheel wear, and wheel topography. ^ The overall radial wheel wear in each case was found to consist of an initial transient followed by a steady state regime. With continued grinding, a progressive increase in power and a decrease in surface roughness were observed. Wheel failure tended to occur by stripping of the abrasive layer when the radial wear reached about 70 – 80 % of the grain dimension. ^ Wheel wear was found to occur by attrition, grain fracture, and grain pullout. Attritious wear increases the active grain density and causes wheel dulling which lead to a smoother workpiece and higher forces. The effects of attritious wear are offset {{to a greater or lesser}} degree by grain fracture and grain pullout. Grain fracture which dominates in the steady state is shown to be related to the uncut chip thickness taken by an individual cutting point. The initial transient wear at the start of grinding is mainly due to pullout of loosely held grains, although grain fracture also contributes to the transient. ^ The results of this work provide the technological basis for predicting grinding behavior, design of <b>grinding</b> <b>cycles,</b> and optimal utilization of the process with electroplated CBN wheels. ...|$|R

The main objective of this work is to compare the plunge cylindrical conventional <b>grinding</b> <b>cycle</b> (with spark out) and a three-phase one in terms of workpiece surface roughness. In order to accomplish this goal, several plunge grinding of hardened AISI 4340 steel experiments were carried out using both kinds of cycles in different grinding conditions. The vibration signal of the system was acquired in order to better understand the differences between the two kinds of cycles. The main conclusion was that conventional cycle produces lower workpiece surface roughness than the three-phase one (both with the same cycle time). It happens because the elastic deformation is better released in the conventional cycle...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} model of punch grinding {{has been developed}} which calculates the instantaneous material-removal rate, arc length of contact and temperature based on the kinematic relationships between wheel and workiece and determines the optimum machine parameters to reduce cycle time and achieve a constant-temperature no-burn situation. Two basic outputs of the {{simulation model}} include arc length of contact and specific material-removal rate. A thermal model {{is included in the}} simulation to calculate maximum grinding zone temperature rise. A novel method is developed to constrain this temperature rise in the simulation. The thermal model inputs a constant value of specific grinding energy and the energy partition, which represents the fraction of the grinding energy conducted as heat to the workpiece. The simulation-based optimization can lead to a drastic reduction of <b>grinding</b> <b>cycle</b> time. Moreover, the limitation of maximum grinding zone temperature rise below the transitional temperature can help to avoid generation of workpiece thermal damage, which includes thermal softening, residual tensile stress, and rehardening burn. The grindability of high speed steel (HSS) is also discussed in terms of power consumption, specific grinding energy and undeformed chip thickness. QC 20110913 EUREKA E! 4957 -PUNCH-GRIN...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the molecular biology toolbox allow access to the genetic structure and diversity of microbial communities. More specifically, the advances in metaproteomics allow us to identify the functional expression of the genome and link this information to the biogeochemical processes of an ecosystem. One of the challenges, in this field, is the optimisation of protein extraction methods from environmental samples where protein concentrations can be low {{and the presence of}} interfering substances high. Experiments were conducted by extracting proteins from freshwater microbial communities utilising an array of physical and chemical methods. We used protein yield and 1 D SDS-PAGE resolution as deciding factors. Liquid N 2 <b>grinding</b> and freeze-thaw <b>cycles</b> resulted, after purification, in an enhanced resolution and protein yield. Furthermore, regarding sample purification, the use of detergent removal columns resulted in higher yields but literature indicates that acetone precipitation is more efficient in removing interfering substances...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{determine}} {{and understand the}} influence of UV weathering on the reprocessing of a wood-plastic composite (WPC), i. e. of a wood flour reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites. Two wood flour contents (10 % w/w and 30 % w/w) were studied in comparison with neat PP. Compounds were produced by twin-screw extrusion. Then, ISO 1 A “dog bone” samples were obtained by injection molding and exposed to an artificial UV weathering using a xenon arc climatic chamber in order to simulate a long-term outdoor exposure. After this weathering stage, photo-degraded samples were submitted to <b>grinding</b> and injection <b>cycles</b> and characterized through different experimental technics. The visual evolution of the surface was followed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In {{order to understand the}} material physical degradation, the mechanical behavior was measured thanks to tensile, Charpy impact and DMTA (Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis) tests. The assessment of the microstructural evolution was performed by differential scanning calorimetry (crystallinity ratio), size exclusion chromatography (average molecular weights) tests and infrared spectroscopy (chemical structure). Additional rheological tests assessed assumptions on degradation mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{high energy}} wheel/rail impact forces arising from defects such as poorly aligned welds in rails can in time cause serious defects in track {{components}} and deterioration of geometry. Suitable weld straightening operations improve the matter {{but there is}} uncertainty about the longevity of the effect and about what degree of misalignment (dip or peak) warrants straightening. Three 2 km long test sections were established on the Mt Isa Line in Queensland {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of weld straightening operations. Each section received different levels of intervention to correct the welds and over 15, 000 measurements of weld alignment were recorded and analysed over the life of the project. For welds with a dip less than 0. 3 mm, straightening produced no improvement. Cycle tamping produced an improvement in the alignment of dipped welds but <b>cycle</b> <b>grinding</b> produced a slight worsening of dipped welds. After approximately 4 million gross tonnes of traffic the straightened welds appeared to remain unaltered by and large; those welds which received no straightening showed a minor worsening of both dipped and peaked welds due to the traffic...|$|R
