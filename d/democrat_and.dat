5|$|Following {{his service}} in the Spanish–American War, White ran for {{election}} as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> won {{a seat on the}} Charleston City Council.

While serving on the Board of Affairs, he frequently performed duties as the city's mayor pro tempore. Around 1931, White became a member of the West Virginia Board of Control and was serving as the board's treasurer by 1932. White later served as the board's president for two years.

5|$|Gillibrand's special {{election}} victory in 2010 {{gave her the}} right to serve the rest of Clinton's second term, which ended in January 2013. Gillibrand ran for a full six-year term in November 2012. In the general election, Gillibrand faced challenger Wendy E.

She carried all counties except for two in western New York.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not {{consistently}} vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system {{in a state of}} flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.|$|E
50|$|The Conservative {{remained}} dominant on {{the council}} gaining seats from the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> the Labour Party.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{conceptual}} metaphors use of four (former) prominent American politicians in representing their worldviews. A {{review of the}} research regarding this topic shows that <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> Republicans arguably apply different cognitive models to structure their worldview via the use of metaphorical language. In thesis I will illustrate that each politician has his style regarding his metaphorical language-use. Although <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> Republicans show dissimilarities in their metaphorical language, the language of both <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> Republicans primarily represent the shared worldview of American exceptionalism...|$|R
5|$|In the 1854 elections, Lincoln {{was elected}} to the Illinois {{legislature}} but declined to take his seat. In the aftermath of the elections, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Lincoln instead sought election to the United States Senate. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting, but unable to obtain a majority, Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull. Trumbull was an antislavery <b>Democrat,</b> <b>and</b> had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, Joel Aldrich Matteson.|$|E
5|$|The {{city council}} {{is made up}} of 42 councillors. After the May 2014 local elections, the Conservatives formed a {{minority}} administration with just 12councillors. The largest party within the council is the Liberal Democrats with 19councillors (including the Lord Mayor). The other parties represented in council are the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and Labour, with five and four Councillors, respectively. There are also two independent councillors, Eleanor Scott (elected as a Liberal <b>Democrat)</b> <b>and</b> Paul Godier (elected as UKIP). Councillors are returned from 14wards, with each ward having three councillors and a four-year term. The leader of the council is the Conservative Donna Jones. The position of Lord Mayor of Portsmouth is usually held for a one-year period.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{controversy}} of Sampson's administration {{was over the}} selection of the state's highway commissioner. The Highway Department employed over ten thousand people and spent nearly 45% of the state's budget. Legislators' votes could often be bought with promises of new road construction in their districts. Thus, the department became a primary vehicle for dispensing patronage to political supporters. Sampson's predecessor, Governor Fields, had chosen retired congressman and Democratic political boss Ben Johnson to head the department, and Sampson had agreed to retain him in exchange for his support against Beckham. However, Sampson felt that such a powerful position could not be left {{in the hands of a}} <b>Democrat,</b> <b>and</b> he removed Johnson from office in December 1929.|$|E
50|$|At the 2003 {{election}} the Conservatives held {{control of}} the council with 34 seats, compared to 15 for the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>and</b> 6 independents.

5|$|Vizzini {{offered to}} meet with Aldisio – who had been {{appointed}} High Commissioner in August 1944 – to solve the island’s grain problem, implying he {{had the power to}} do so. There is no evidence that Aldisio and Vizzini ever met to discuss the issue. Aldiso did, however, invite , a fellow Christian <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> Mafia member befriended by Vizzini, to secret gatherings with Christian Democrats. The meetings were seen as a first step in a government alliance with the Mafia. Aldisio’s appointment was perceived by Mafia chieftains as a first indication of the government’s determination to subdue the separatist movement. They were now forced to reconsider their support.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward {{picked a}} good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former <b>Democrat,</b> <b>and</b> Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, as the two men differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal <b>Democrat</b> <b>and</b> subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E

Haynsworth was the first Supreme Court nominee since John J. Parker (1930) to be defeated by the Senate.|$|R
