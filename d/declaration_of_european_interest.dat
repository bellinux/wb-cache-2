30|$|The {{western part}} of Germany saw {{unification}} much less as a national undertaking.

40|$|Abstract We {{compared}} the Atlantic and Mediterranean beach and foredune habitats <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interest,</b> focusing on floristic, structural and ecological features. We selected two representative sites of Atlantic (The Netherlands) and Mediterranean (Italy) coastal dunes. From a georeferenced vegetation database, samples of: (a) annual vegetation on drift lines (European Union habitat type 1210), (b) {{embryonic shifting dunes}} (2110), and (c) shifting dunes along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria (2120), were selected. Floristic representativity and comparability of plot sizes were considered. For each habitat, the frequency and the fidelity of the species, the life form frequency spectra and Ellenberg ecological indicator values were assessed. We found a consistent floristic differentiation between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean coastal dune habitats and only a small set of shared species. The Italian and the Dutch annual vegetation of drift lines (1210) register a high structural similarity that strongly declines landwards. Floristic composition, life forms and Ellenberg indicator values show higher similarities among different foredune habitats of the same site than between homologous habitats of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. The results confirm the current description and distribution of the habitat <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interest</b> annual vegetation <b>of</b> drift lines (1210). On the other hand, the floristic, structural and ecological differences between the Atlantic and the Mediterranea...|$|R

50|$|Aberdeen {{qualified}} for the Europa League {{for the fourth time}} in a row with another second place finish in the 2016-17 Scottish Premiership. As the top Scottish seeds in the tournament, the first qualifying stage was bypassed; in the second round Široki Brijeg were defeated thanks to an away win in Bosnia to set up a tie with Apollon Limassol from Cyprus. Despite winning the first leg at home, a 2-0 defeat in the return meant the end <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interest</b> at the same stage for another season.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} debt and interest rates within the context <b>of</b> the <b>European</b> Monetary Union which, after ten years since its creation, constitutes a convenient framework to test any sensible explanation. My findings highlight that a substantial fraction <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interest</b> rate is accounted for by domestic fiscal fundamentals. Identification of {{the relative importance of}} fiscal variables requires joint modelling of international rates to distinguish between the effects of their common dynamics from credit risk implications of worsening fiscal conditions. The estimated model also quantifies liquidity premia. Debt, interest rates, spreads, VECM, cointegration...|$|R

40|$|For a {{long period}} the study <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interest</b> group {{politics}} remained somewhat disconnected from other areas <b>of</b> <b>European</b> Union studies. There exists little cross-fertilization between the burgeoning literature on European party politics and political cleavages, on the one hand, and the literature on <b>European</b> <b>interest</b> groups, on the other hand. Although, recent scholarship has moved towards a more comparative approach, researchers still do not {{pay much attention to}} the possibility that a small number of political cleavages shapes the emerging <b>European</b> <b>interest</b> group system. This paper, which {{is part of a larger}} ongoing research project, aims to connect the study of interest group politics with the literature on party politics and political cleavages. The empirical corpus of the paper analyses data on political support networks among interest groups and political parties and uses German, Dutch, French, Belgian and EU-level elite survey-data. More in particular, I demonstrate that support networks between interest groups and political parties are structured according to traditional party political cleavages...|$|R
