500|$|Snyder's {{first cut}} of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself [...] "the gatekeeper" [...] of the comic's easter eggs, [...] "while [...] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost {{perspective}} on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut.</b> You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about? Of course you do. Are you crazy? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me." [...] Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized {{there was a way}} to further trim the film: removing the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which [...] "was easy without destroying the movie".|$|E
500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 Mudvayne {{released}} The End of All Things to Come, {{which the}} band considers its [...] "black album" [...] {{due to its}} largely-black artwork. Isolation inspired the album's songs. During its mixing, Gray and McDonough stopped at Bob's Big Boy and Gray remembered overhearing someone [...] "say something like, '... and he's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> his own eye out'". When he asked McDonough if he heard the conversation McDonough said he hadn't, and Gray thought it was someone discussing a scene from a screenplay.|$|E

2500|$|Prominent Republican {{politicians}} {{reacted to}} the speech as well. Former Arkansas governor and 2008 candidate for president Mike Huckabee praised Obama's speech on the MSNBC program Morning Joe, while also commenting on the Rev. Wright controversy. Huckabee argued that Obama [...] "handled this {{about as well as}} anybody could" [...] and suggested that it was [...] "a very historic speech." [...] While he decried the remarks made by Wright, Huckabee, a former pastor himself, also noted that [...] "sermons...are rarely written word-for-word" [...] and that pastors often get [...] "caught up in the emotion of the moment." [...] Referencing his experience growing up in the segregated South and the legacy of Jim Crow, the former Arkansas governor noted that [...] "we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> some slack to people who grew up being called names, being told, 'You have to sit in the balcony when you go to [...] movie'...Sometimes people do have a chip on their shoulder and resentment. And you have to just say, I probably would too." [...] Huckabee suggested that he was [...] "probably the only conservative in America who's going to say something like this." ...|$|E

60|$|Sir Garnet Wolseley {{set up his}} Kilkenny cat Government in Zululand, or the Home Government did it for him, I do {{not know}} which. In place of one king, {{thirteen}} chiefs were erected who <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the throats {{of each other and}} of the people.|$|R
6000|$|I objected {{that this}} would require too {{lingering}} a death; {{it was a good}} speech for a consumptive, but not suited to the exigencies of the field of honor. We wrangled over a good many ante-mortem outbursts, but I finally <b>got</b> him <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> his obituary down to this, which he copied into his memorandum-book, purposing to get it by heart: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stood before}} the mirror over the shelf, {{examining}} his features. He had trimmed his beard--they had not <b>got</b> him <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it off--and his hair was neat. He was dressed in the clothing of the middle-twentieth century, the odd collar and coat, the shoes of animal hide. In his pocket was money of the times. That was important. Nothing more was needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{got some}} bad news, Honora," [...] he said. [...] "That is, bad {{from the point}} of view of our honeymoon. Sid Dallam is swamped with business, and wants me in New York. I'm afraid we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it short." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There she blows!" [...] Matt cried. From the Yukon arose the hoarse bellowing {{of a river}} steamboat. [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it short. Be {{sure and}} lock the front door. I'll go out the back. Get a move on!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing easier," [...] {{returned}} Slagg, {{seizing the}} axe and wrenching up the plank that had prevented Stumps from finding a watery grave, [...] "I've on'y <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> a handle at one end, an' we've got an oar at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The blues--the blues!" [...] screamed the girl. [...] "They {{had all but}} {{overtaken}} me when I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{the short}} <b>cut</b> through the wood.

5000|$|Before {{the release}} of the film, the CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification) ordered the sex scenes in the movie to be reduced by 50%, dialogues were left untouched. Vikaram Bhatt has praised the censors and was quoted to have said - [...] [...] "The censor board has been great. They've passed all the dialogues and only <b>got</b> us <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the excesses in the love-making scenes. I'm {{extremely}} pleased with their progressive thinking". One sex scene that was cut in particular can be viewed in the trailer, although no uncut version of the film is available via home entertainment.|$|R
60|$|And as she {{continued}} to plead, almost with tears, so intent was she on this little outing, her mother at length gave her consent. She even <b>got</b> her scissors <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off the ragged fringing from the girl's dress to make her look more trim, and mended her torn shoes with needle and thread; then cut her a hunk of bread for her dinner.|$|R
6000|$|The {{voice in}} the gloom swore again, and then broke into a jolly laugh. [...] "No," [...] it said; [...] "I've really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> down this fence somehow; it's spoiling all the plants, {{and no one else}} here can do it. But I'll only carve another bit off the front door, and then come out and welcome you." ...|$|E

Well, as you can't be trusted with dollars, I'll have {{to put you on}} an allowance. I hate to be mean, but if you waste what I give you, you'll get no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Or," [...] {{the manager}} went on without minding Maxwell, [...] "you have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> {{the part of}} Salome, and {{subordinate}} it entirely to Haxard"--Maxwell made a movement of impatience and refusal, and the manager finished--"or else {{you have got to}} treat it frankly as the leading part in the piece, and get it into the hands of some leading actress." ...|$|E
50|$|Gustard had {{an injury}} blighted career, {{but managed to}} {{represent}} England at all levels and the Barbarians. He was in the England pre World Cup squad in 1999 of 36 before it finally <b>got</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> 30 playing against the USA in August 1999. He ultimately never played for the senior side.|$|R

It ain't that I'm figgering to have my boots shined for nothing; but I'm feeling a good deal as he does. I'd like to have him come 'round regularly, an' we'll be certain of it if there's work to be done." ...|$|R

6000|$|I tell you, Lenore, {{a fellow}} has his eye teeth cut in this getting [...] {{ready to go}} to war. It makes me sick.

6000|$|... "Forget it," [...] said Del. [...] "Drink {{and tobacco}} {{may be all}} right {{for a man who}} makes his living with his hands; but they won't do if you're {{depending}} on your head or your feet.

50|$|Cassie {{suggests}} {{to the others}} {{that they need to}} find out how the Yeerks <b>got</b> permission <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> trees in a National Forest. If they didn't have permission, the news media would bring attention to them, something they surely did not want. The group decides to go back and enter the logging camp to find this information. Tobias notices that there are termite tunnels in the building, and they decide to morph termites to get in. Jake causes a distraction by morphing into a wolf while the others (excluding Tobias) morph and enter the building. There is a brief episode where they are controlled by the termite queen's orders and lose control of themselves. Cassie kills the termite queen to free her friends and herself from the queen's control, but felt much guilt by it. The Animorphs get the information they need, disable the Yeerks' defenses, and escape unnoticed.|$|R
25|$|Footvolley {{was created}} by Octavio de Moraes in the 1970s. It {{is a mix of}} {{football}} and volleyball, where the players must use their feet and head to get the ball over the net and into the opponent's side, and is played on the beaches. It {{is one of the most}} popular beach sports in Brazil. Footvolley started out with 5 players on each team but later <b>got</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> 2 players on each team and is still so to this day.|$|R
6000|$|The {{tears came}} to the old woman's eyes, and her voice broke as she replied: [...] "I knew you would say that, Lee Virginia, but all the same I don't intend to have you do any such thing. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> loose from me altogether, because some fine chap {{is going to come}} along one of these days, and he won't want me even as a step-mother-in-law. No, I have decided that you and me had better live apart. I'll get you a place to live up in Sulphur, where I can visit you now and again; but I guess I am elected to stay right here in the Fork. They don't like me, and I don't like them; but I have kind o' got used to their ways of looking at me sidewise; they don't matter as much as it would up there in the city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "CARRIE'S all right. She's finicky, but she'll {{get over}} it. But I wish she'd hurry up about it! What she can't {{understand}} is that a fellow practising medicine {{in a small town}} like this has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> out the highbrow stuff, and not spend all his time going to concerts and shining his shoes. (Not but what he might be just as good at all these intellectual and art things as some other folks, if he had the time for it!)" [...] Dr. Will Kennicott was brooding in his office, during a free moment {{toward the end of the}} summer afternoon. He hunched down in his tilted desk-chair, undid a button of his shirt, glanced at the state news in the back of the Journal of the American Medical Association, dropped the magazine, leaned back with his right thumb hooked in the arm-hole of his vest and his left thumb stroking the back of his hair.|$|E
6000|$|Pinney {{kissed her}} and then he sat down to his work again; {{and when he was}} tired with writing, his wife took the pen and wrote from his dictation. As they wrought on, they lost the sense, if they ever had it, of a fellow {{creature}} inside of the figure of a spectacular defaulter which grew from their hands; and they enjoyed the impersonality which enables us to judge and sentence one another in this world, and to do justice, as we say. It is true that Pinney, having seen Northwick's home, and faced his elderly, invalid daughter, was moved to use him with a leniency which he would not otherwise have felt. He recognized a merit in this forbearance of his, and once, towards the end of his work, when he was taking a little rest, he said: [...] "Reporters get as much abuse as plumbers; but if people only knew what we kept back, perhaps they would sing a different tune. Of course, it's a temptation to describe his daughter, poor old thing, and give the interview in full, but I don't quite like to.

Then to-morrow I'll give you just one hour after you've finished your breakfast {{to get out of this}} camp altogether, entirely out of my sight. I tried to have you sent away before, but other people took you up, and so I said no more; but now things are different. When a man pulls up what I've drove down, and sets loose what I've locked up, and the same as snaps his fingers in my face when I'm attendin' to my business, then I don't let that man stay in my camp." ...|$|R
