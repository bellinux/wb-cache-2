5|$|The medical {{management}} of iron toxicity is complicated, and can include {{use of a}} specific chelating agent called <b>deferoxamine</b> to bind and expel excess iron from the body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deferoxamine</b> is only {{effective}} via daily injections which makes its long-term use more difficult. It has {{the benefit of}} being inexpensive and decent long-term safety. Adverse effects are primary skin reactions around the injection site and hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{blood transfusions}} {{can result in}} iron {{overload}}. The iron overload related to thalassemia may be treated by chelation therapy with the medications <b>deferoxamine,</b> deferiprone, or deferasirox. These treatments have resulted in improving life expectancy in those with thalassemia major.|$|E
25|$|Currently, two iron {{chelators}} {{are available}} in the US, <b>deferoxamine</b> for intravenous use and deferasirox for oral use. These options now provide potentially useful drugs for treating this iron overload problem. A third chelating agent is available in Europe, deferiprone for oral use, but not available in the US.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the type and severity. Treatment for those with more severe disease often {{includes}} regular blood transfusions, iron chelation, and folic acid. Iron chelation may be done with <b>deferoxamine</b> or deferasirox. Occasionally, {{a bone marrow transplant}} may be an option. Complications may include iron overload from the transfusions with resulting heart or liver disease, infections, and osteoporosis. If the spleen becomes overly enlarged, surgical removal may be required.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{children}} require regular lifelong {{blood transfusion}} and can have complications, which may involve the spleen. Bone marrow transplants can be curative for some children. Patients receive frequent blood transfusions {{that lead to}} or potentiate iron overload. Iron chelation treatment is necessary to prevent damage to internal organs. Advances in iron chelation treatments allow patients with thalassemia major to live long lives with access to proper treatment. Popular chelators include <b>deferoxamine</b> and deferiprone.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} patient <b>deferoxamine</b> {{complaint}} {{is that they}} are painful and inconvenient. The oral chelator deferasirox was approved for use in 2005 in some countries, it offers some hope with compliance at a higher cost. Bone marrow transplantation is the only cure and is indicated for patients with severe thalassemia major. Transplantation can eliminate a patient's dependence on transfusions. Absent a matching donor, a savior sibling can be conceived by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to be free of the disease as well as to match the recipient's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type.|$|E
2500|$|Drug imports to Iran {{from the}} U.S. and Europe {{decreased}} by approximately 30 percent in 2012, {{according to a}} report by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. In 2013, The Guardian reported that some 85,000 cancer patients required forms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy that had become scarce. Western governments have built waivers into the sanctions regime to ensure that essential medicines get through, but those waivers conflict with blanket restrictions on banking, as well as bans on [...] "dual-use" [...] chemicals that might have a military as well as a medical application. An estimated 40,000 haemophiliacs cannot get blood-clotting medicines, and operations on haemophiliacs have been virtually suspended because of the risks created by the shortages. An estimated 23,000 Iranians with HIV/AIDS have severely restricted access to the drugs they need. The society representing the 8,000 Iranians suffering from thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder, has said its members are beginning to die because of a lack of an essential drug, <b>deferoxamine,</b> used to control the iron content in the blood. Further, Iran can no longer buy medical equipment such as autoclaves, essential for the production of many drugs, because some of the biggest Western pharmaceutical companies refuse to do business with the country.|$|E
50|$|Exposure {{can cause}} iron poisoning, {{which can be}} treated with <b>deferoxamine,</b> a {{chelating}} agent. After administering <b>deferoxamine,</b> the person's urine must be monitored for a pink or orange coloring, which is caused by the deferoxamine-iron complex. When the urine returns to a normal coloring and iron levels are normal, <b>deferoxamine</b> administration may stop. Excessive short-term <b>deferoxamine</b> consumption can result in hypotension and lung damage. It was founded in the 1880s.|$|E
50|$|The {{toxic effect}} of <b>deferoxamine</b> on linear growth {{could also be}} due to excess <b>deferoxamine</b> accumulating in tissues and interfering with iron-dependent enzymes which are {{involved}} in the post-translational modification of collagen.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{who receive}} vitamin C {{supplements}} have shown improved iron excretion by <b>deferoxamine.</b> This occurs {{due to the}} expansion of the iron pool brought about by vitamin C, which <b>deferoxamine</b> subsequently has access to. However, vitamin C supplementation could also worsen iron toxicity by promoting the formation of free radicals. Therefore, only 100 mg of vitamin C should be taken 30 minutes to one hour after <b>deferoxamine</b> administration.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Deferoxamine</b> is {{administered}} via intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injections. Oral {{administration is not}} possible as <b>deferoxamine</b> is rapidly metabolized by enzymes and is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The required parenteral administration represents one of deferoxamine’s downfalls as it is harder for patients to follow up with their therapy due to the financial and emotional burdens experienced.Deferoxamine was proven to cure many clinical complications and diseases that result from iron overload. It beneficially affects cardiac disease, such as myocardial disease which {{occurs as a result}} of iron accumulation in the heart. [...] <b>Deferoxamine</b> was also shown to improve liver function by arresting the development of hepatic fibrosis which occurs as a result of iron accumulation in the liver. [...] <b>Deferoxamine</b> also has positive effects on endocrine function and growth. Endocrine abnormalities in thalassemic patients involve the overloaded iron interfering with the production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), as well as stimulating hypogonadism, both of which cause poor pubertal growth. A study showed that 90% of patients who were regularly treated with <b>deferoxamine</b> since childhood had normal pubertal growth, which fell to 38% for patients treated only with low doses of <b>deferoxamine</b> since their teens. Another endocrine abnormality that thalassemic patients face is diabetes mellitus, which results from iron overload in the pancreas impairing insulin secretion. Studies have shown that patients who were regularly treated with <b>deferoxamine</b> have a reduced risk of developing diabetes mellitus.|$|E

50|$|<b>Deferoxamine</b> acts by binding free iron in the {{bloodstream}} and enhancing its elimination in the urine. By removing excess iron, the agent reduces {{the damage done to}} various organs and tissues, such as the liver. Also, it speeds healing of nerve damage (and minimizes the extent of recent nerve trauma). <b>Deferoxamine</b> may modulate expression and release of inflammatory mediators by specific cell types.|$|E
50|$|The drug <b>deferoxamine,</b> {{also known}} as desferoxamine B and DFO-B, is a trihydroxamic acid that is {{produced}} by the actinobacteria Streptomyces pilosus. It binds iron, decreasing the toxic reactions catalysed by the unbound metal, and it also decreases the uptake of iron by tissues. <b>Deferoxamine</b> achieves this by acting as a hexadentate iron-chelatingligand: it binds to all six coordination sites on nontransferrin-bound iron, effectively deactivating it. <b>Deferoxamine</b> is mostly specific to ferric iron (Fe3+) and coordinates to Fe3+ using the oxygen atoms on its multiplehydroxyl and carbonyl groups, forming a structure called ferrioxamine. This drug-iron complex is mostly excreted by the kidneys as it is water-soluble. Approximately one-third of ferrioxamine could also be excreted through the feces in bile.|$|E
50|$|When {{comparing}} deferiprone to <b>deferoxamine,</b> {{it should}} be noted that they both bind iron with similar efficiency. However, drugs with different properties are able to access different iron pools. DFP is smaller than <b>deferoxamine</b> and can thus enter cells more easily. Also, at the pH of blood, the affinity of DFP for iron is concentration dependent: at low DFP concentrations, the iron-drug complex breaks down and the iron is donated to another competing ligand. This property accounts for the observed tendency of DFP to redistribute iron in the body. For the same reason, DFP can ‘shuttle’ intracellular iron out to the plasma, and transfer the iron to <b>deferoxamine</b> which goes on to expel it from the body.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deferoxamine</b> is {{also used}} to {{minimize}} doxorubicin's cardiotoxic side effects and in the treatment of a patient with aceruloplasminemia.|$|E

50|$|It {{has also}} been proven that {{combined}} treatment with <b>deferoxamine</b> and deferiprone leads to an increased efficiency in chelation and doubles iron excretion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deferoxamine</b> {{is being}} studied as a {{treatment}} for spinal cord injury and intracerebral hemorrhage. It is also used to induce hypoxia-like environment in mesenchymal stem cells.|$|E
50|$|In case of {{suspected}} sudden intake {{of a large}} amount of aluminium, <b>deferoxamine</b> mesylate may be given to help eliminate it from the body by chelation.|$|E
50|$|Later stage {{treatment}} {{consists of}} cleaning the iron from the blood, using a chelating agent such as <b>deferoxamine.</b> If this fails then dialysis {{is the next}} step.|$|E
50|$|The medical {{management}} of iron toxicity is complicated, and can include {{use of a}} specific chelating agent called <b>deferoxamine</b> to bind and expel excess iron from the body.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1970s, iron {{chelation}} {{therapy with}} a similar agent, <b>deferoxamine,</b> {{has been used as}} an alternative to regular phlebotomy to treat excess iron stores in people with haemochromatosis.|$|E
50|$|Apart from iron toxicity, <b>deferoxamine</b> {{can be used}} {{to treat}} {{aluminium}} toxicity (an excess of aluminium in the body) in select patients. In US, the drug is not FDA-approved for this use.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is by phlebotomy, erythrocytapheresis or {{chelation}} {{therapy with}} iron chelating agents such as <b>deferoxamine,</b> deferiprone or deferasirox.If iron overload has caused end-organ damage, this is generally irreversible and may require transplantation.|$|E
50|$|Selectivity is {{determined}} by various factors. In the case of iron overload, which may occur in individuals with β-thalessemia who have received blood transfusions, the target metal ion is in the +3 oxidation state and so forms stronger complexes than the divalent ions. It also forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. <b>deferoxamine,</b> a naturally occurring siderophore produced by the actinobacter Streptomyces pilosus and was used initially as a chelation therapy agent. Synthetic siderophores such as deferiprone and deferasirox have been developed, using the known structure of <b>deferoxamine</b> as a starting point. Chelation occurs with the two oxygen atoms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Deferoxamine</b> {{could lead}} to toxic side effects if doses greater than 50 mg/kg body weight are administered. These side effects may include {{auditory}} and ocular abnormalities, pulmonary toxicity, [...] neurotoxicity, as well as changes in renal function. [...] Another toxic effect of <b>deferoxamine</b> mostly observed in children is the failure of linear growth. This reduction in height may occur {{as a result of}} <b>deferoxamine</b> chelating metals other than iron which are required for normal growth.Deferoxamine has an affinity constant (Ka) of 1031 for Fe3+, 1014 for Cu2+ and 1010 for Zn2+, and so may coordinate to zinc and copper when little iron is available for chelation. Zinc is needed for the proper functioning of various metalloenzymes involved in bone formation. Zinc chelation may cause zinc deficiency in the body, which can thus lead to a reduced growth rate, reduced collagen formation and defective bone mineralization. Similarly, copper functions as an enzyme cofactor in bone formation. Copper chelation may result in copper deficiency as well, leading to metaphyseal cupping and osteoporosis. For example, abnormal collagen is formed when copper is deficient as the enzyme lysyl oxidase, which uses copper as a cofactor and catalyzes the oxidative deamination step that is important for cross-linking of collagen, cannot function properly. Studies have shown that even though the blood serum of patients receiving <b>deferoxamine</b> was not deficient in copper and zinc, deficiencies of the metals in the metaphyseal matrix were observed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Deferoxamine</b> is used {{to treat}} acute iron poisoning, {{especially}} in small children. This agent is also frequently used to treat hemochromatosis, a disease of iron accumulation that can be either genetic or acquired. Acquired hemochromatosis is common in patients with certain types of chronic anemia (e.g. thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) who require many blood transfusions, which can greatly {{increase the amount of}} iron in the body. Administration for chronic conditions is generally accomplished by subcutaneous injection over a period of 8-12 hours each day. Administration of <b>deferoxamine</b> after acute intoxication may color the urine a pinkish red, a phenomenon termed [...] "vin rosé urine".|$|E
50|$|<b>Deferoxamine</b> is only {{effective}} via daily injections which makes its long-term use more difficult. It has {{the benefit of}} being inexpensive and decent long-term safety. Adverse effects are primary skin reactions around the injection site and hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|DFP {{was also}} found to be {{significantly}} more effective than <b>deferoxamine</b> in treating myocardial siderosis in patients with thalassemia major: DFP is thought to improve the function of mitochondria in the heart by accessing and redistributing labile iron in cardiac cells.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{blood transfusions}} {{can result in}} iron {{overload}}. The iron overload related to thalassemia may be treated by chelation therapy with the medications <b>deferoxamine,</b> deferiprone, or deferasirox. These treatments have resulted in improving life expectancy in those with thalassemia major.|$|E
50|$|Predisposing {{factors for}} mucormycosis include HIV/AIDS, {{diabetes}} mellitus, cancers such as lymphomas, kidney failure, organ transplant, long term corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, cirrhosis energy malnutrition, and <b>deferoxamine</b> therapy. Despite this, however, {{there have been}} cases of mucormycosis reported with no apparent predisposing factors present.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} two iron chelators {{available in the}} US, <b>deferoxamine</b> for IV use and deferasirox for oral use. These options now provide potentially useful drugs for treating this iron overload problem. A third chelating agent is available in Europe, deferiprone for oral use, but not available in the US.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include pain {{at the site}} of injection, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, hearing loss, and eye problems. Severe {{allergic}} reactions including anaphylaxis and low blood pressure may occur. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the baby. <b>Deferoxamine</b> is a siderophore from the bacteria Streptomyces pilosus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deferoxamine</b> (DFOA), {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Desferal, is a {{medication}} that binds iron and aluminium. It is specifically used in iron overdose, hemochromatosis either due to multiple blood transfusions or an underlying genetic condition, and aluminium toxicity in people on dialysis. It is used by injection into a muscle, vein, or under the skin.|$|E
