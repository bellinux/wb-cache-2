40|$|Single fibre EMG {{was used}} to record bizarre {{repetitive}} discharges in patients with chronic denervation or muscle disorders. The low variability of intervals between individual spike components on successive discharges suggests that the bizarre repetitive discharges are based on ephaptic impulse transmission from the muscle fibre starting the discharge (principal pacemaker) to the adjacent muscle fibres. The low variability of the interdischarge intervals is explained by ephaptic reactivation of the principal pacemaker {{by one of the}} fibres participating in the previous discharge (a co-pacemaker). Secondary activator fibres may spread activity to more fibres. The bizarre repetitive <b>discharge</b> <b>stops</b> when either the principal pacemaker or the co-pacemaker become sufficiently subnormal to block.

40|$|International audienceInteraction of {{discharges}} in heptane with magnetron-sputtered {{thin films}} made of aluminum, copper or iron is studied in a pin-to-plate configuration. The behavior of discharges on thin films {{can be used}} to better understand the interaction of discharges with given surfaces and it might also improve the reproducibility of the impacts in order to better control their shape. Single layers and bilayers of metals are characterized after impact by SEM, AFM, micro-EDX and nano-SIMS analyses. Discharges last typically for a few hundreds of nanoseconds and dissipated energies range between 1 and 100 mJ. We show that at low impact energy, copper and aluminum are heated and stretched by surface stress. At intermediate energy, melting occurs, leading to the synthesis of external beads by Marangoni's convection. At high energy, the shape of the impact is defined by the pressure release when the <b>discharge</b> <b>stops.</b> When iron is deposited onto silicon, dewetting is an important mechanism. The columnar structure of the deposit may have two distinct roles. On the one hand, gases trapped in intercolumnar boundaries can produce tiny holes.

40|$|Background: Management of {{lymphadenopathy}} {{caused by}} nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is primarily surgical. Where this cannot achieve sufficient clearance of infected nodes, chemotherapy is often given. Aim: This study compared results of surgery alone with surgery followed by chemotherapy in instances {{where there was}} incomplete surgical removal of diseased tissue. Methods: Chemotherapy comprised azithromycin 10 mg/kg and rifabutin 6 mg/kg both given once daily for 6 mo. Ninety-eight children with NTM infection were seen in the period 1990 - 2004. Sixty-eight cases with adenopathy where "time to healing" (<b>discharge</b> <b>stopped</b> and inflammation settled) was known were available to compare response to treatment. Results : The median (range) "time to healing" in weeks for 43 patients who had surgery alone was: incision and drainage (I&D) /curettage 6 (1 - 72) (n = 10); excision 3 (1 - 28) (n = 22); and from the last operation of multiple (repeat) surgery 3 (1 - 40) (n = 11). For 25 patients who required chemotherapy in addition to surgery, the median (range) "time to healing" in weeks was I&D/curettage 10 (1 - 40) (n = 17), excision 14 (8 - 20) (n = 2) and multiple surgery 29 (2 - 88) (n = 6). Conclusion: In children with adenitis due to NTM, where surgical resection is followed by continued discharge and inflammation, chemotherapy should be considered before further surgery is undertaken...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model that computes {{the accumulation of}} Kepone in the stripped bass food chain of the James River estuary was developed. The purpose of the model was to help understand the relationship of Kepone levels in important fish species to sediment and water column Kepone concentrations and then {{to address the question}} of why these levels still exceed Food and Drug Administration limits 8 years after <b>discharge</b> <b>stopped.</b> The model considers exposure through diet and respiration at rates based on species bioenergetics. It was successfully calibrated to observed 1976 through 1982 striped bass, white perch, and Atlantic croaker Kepone concentrations. The model indicates that for the upper levels of the food chain, diet is the major route of contamination, accounting for 87 - 88 % of the observed concentration in croaker and white perch and 91 % of the observed concentration in striped bass. The two Kepone sources; sediment and water column, contribute approximately equally to the croaker and white perch. The water column is more significant for striped bass, being the original source for approximately 60 % of the observed body burdens. It was estimated that a criterion requiring Kepone concentrations in fish to be at or below 0. 3 ng/g would require dissolved water column and sediment Kepone concentrations to be reduced to somewhere between 3 and 9 ng/l and 13 - 39 ng/g, respectively, depending on the species. Striped bass require the greatest reductions in dissolved water column and sediment Kepone concentration to somewhere between 3 and 5 ng/l and 13 and 24 ng/g respectively...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstract:This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{influence}} of the direction of the applied electric field (namely perpendicular and parallel to the insulator surface) and the type of insulator materials on the propagation of creeping <b>discharges</b> (pattern and <b>stopping</b> length) in presence of air under standard lightning impulse voltage. The investigated materials belong to two distinguished families among the mostly used in electrical industry: (i) thermoplastics (namely polyamide 6 and polyarylamide), and (ii) one cycloaliphatic filled epoxy resin. It is shown that the <b>stopping</b> <b>discharges</b> length on a solid/air interface covers generally 55 % of the creeping distance for both polarities under perpendicular E-field right before the flashover. While with parallel E-field, the stopping length is included between 20 to 30 % for positive polarity and less than 25 % for negative polarity. Also, the application of a perpendicular E-field is more straitened than the tangential one due mainly to the dielectric constant of polymers. Numerical simulations show that the electric field is more reduced for perpendicular E-field inferring that discharges (streamers) lengthen and develop easily at lower voltage levels...|$|R
40|$|High {{nitrogen}} (N) {{and phosphorus}} (P) fluxes from upstream agriculture threaten aquatic ecosystems in surface waters and estuaries, especially in areas characterized by high agricultural N and P inputs and densely drained catchments like the Netherlands. Controlled drainage {{has been recognized}} as an effective option to optimize soil moisture conditions for agriculture and to reduce unnecessary losses of fresh water and nutrients. This is achieved by introducing control structures with adjustable overflow levels into subsurface tube drain systems. A small-scale (1  ha) field experiment was designed to investigate the hydrological and chemical changes after introducing controlled drainage. Precipitation rates and the response of water tables and drain fluxes were measured in the periods before the introduction of controlled drainage (2007 – 2008) and after (2009 – 2011). For the N and P concentration measurements, auto-analyzers for continuous records were combined with passive samplers for time-averaged concentrations at individual drain outlets. The experimental setup enabled the quantification {{of changes in the}} water and solute balance after introducing controlled drainage. The results showed that introducing controlled drainage reduced the drain discharge and increased the groundwater storage in the field. To achieve this, the overflow levels have to be elevated in early spring, before the drain <b>discharge</b> <b>stops</b> due to dryer conditions and falling groundwater levels. The groundwater storage in the field would have been larger if the water levels in the adjacent ditch were controlled as well by an adjustable weir. The N concentrations and loads increased, which was largely related to elevated concentrations in one of the three monitored tube drains. The P loads via the tube drains reduced due to the reduction in discharge after introducing controlled drainage. However, this may be counteracted by the higher groundwater levels and the larger contribution of N- and P-rich shallow groundwater and overland flow to the surface water...|$|R
