40|$|When topical {{controlled}} delivery of ophthalmic drugs is realised via erodible inserts, drug bioavailability is maximised, if release is controlled exclusively by insert erosion, since parallel mechanisms which increase the release rate, also increases the dose fraction cleared from the precorneal area by tear fluid draining. The respective contributions of diffusion and erosion {{to the release}} mechanism of different drugs, namely, prednisolone (PDS), oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTH) and gentamicin sulfate (GTS), from erodible ocular inserts based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) of molecular weight 400 or 900 kDa was determined by an in vitro technique adequate to predict the release mechanism in vivo. PDS and OTH were released with erosion-controlled kinetics. With therapeutic doses of these drugs in the inserts (0. 3 mg, 1. 5 %), {{the possibility of a}} purely <b>erosive</b> <b>mechanism</b> was shown to rely upon drug–PEO molecular interactions, which limit drug diffusion in the swollen matrix. This was the case with OTH, for which strong interactions with PEO were measured, whereas some contribution from the parallel diffusive mechanism was evidenced for PDS, which showed weaker interactions with polymer. Such a contribution disappeared when the PDS concentration in the insert was increased to 6 %, which suggested that the <b>erosive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is favoured by a drug concentration in the hydrated insert substantially higher than solubility. On the other hand, the release of about 50 % GTS dose was controlled by diffusion, due to the high water solubility of this drug, accompanied by weak drug–PEO interactions. In this case the residence time of drug in the precorneal area is expected to be significantly shorter than that of the PEO carrier...|$|E

40|$|Lemmings are {{a classic}} example of animals with strong {{population}} cycles. High-amplitude density fluctuations with low numbers during the low phase are expected to lead to strong genetic drift, which erodes genetic variability. By compiling data on mitochondrial DNA polymorphism for 72 lemming populations from 5 species, we found no evidence for this <b>erosive</b> <b>mechanism.</b> On the contrary, high levels of haplotype diversity (average h of 0. 75 for samples of the genus Lemmus) were observed in many populations. Although the effective size determines the level of genetic diversity in closed populations, diversity is primarily determined by immigration in open populations. Simulations of genetic drift in open populations fluctuating in density confirmed the independence of genetic variability from local effective size, and predicted a deficit of rare alleles, as observed in lemming samples. High genetic variability thus implies high gene flow over a considerable area for lemmings, but does not provide information about the local effective size of populations. Examination of empirical data suggests that high genetic diversity may be the rule rather than the exception in cyclic populations...|$|E
30|$|The {{state of}} {{conservation}} of Crevoladossola {{is characterized by the}} presence of a diffused colour alteration which is responsible for the current dark to light grey appearance of the originally white stone blocks (Fig.  1 d). The altered blocks also show reduced granular cohesion so that mild mechanical actions on the surfaces result in grain detachments and powdering. The combined action of atmospheric corrosion and thermal weathering on the dolomitic matrix causes intergranular crack formation and enhanced chemical dissolution along the grain borders and the cleavage plane (Fig.  1 e) [1, 44]. These last appear deeply corroded forming fissures and micro-cracks which can cross the grains almost up to their entire thickness (Fig.  1 f). The cross-section observation (Fig.  1 f) does not show the presence of a continuous superficial deposition; on the other hand, the surface discontinuities and micro-fissures appear partly filled by soil dust and particulate matter which can be responsible for the observed colour alteration. Given the previously discussed conditions, the most external and altered stone material has to be considered unstable and loss of material occurs {{as a result of the}} rain wash. Where the <b>erosive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is particularly active, namely along the borders and edges of the blocks, a remarkable surface recession is observed. In such condition, the resulting surface still suffers from granular disaggregation and it is characterized by a lighter colour due to the removal of the superficial altered stone material (Fig.  1 d).|$|E
40|$|River bank erosion occurs {{primarily}} {{through a combination}} of three mechanisms: mass failure, fluvial entrainment, and subaerial weakening and weathering. Subaerial processes are often viewed as preparatory processes, weakening the bank face prior to fluvial erosion. Within a river basin downstream process domains occur, with subaerial processes dominating the upper reaches, fluvial erosion the middle, and mass failure the lower reaches of a river. The aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate that (a) subaerial processes may be underestimated as an erosive agent, and (b) process dominance has a temporal, as well as spatial, aspect. Bank erosion on the River Arrow, Warwickshire, UK, was monitored for 16 months (December 1996 to March 1998) using erosion pins. Variations in the rate and aerial extent of erosion are considered with reference to meteorological data. Throughout the first 15 months all erosion recorded was subaerial, resulting in up to 181 mm a- 1 of bank retreat, compared with 13 to 27 mm a- 1 reported by previous researchers. While the role of subaerial processes as preparatory is not contended, it is suggested that such processes can also be erosive. The three bank erosion mechanisms operate at different levels of magnitude and frequency, and the River Arrow data demonstrate this. Thus the concept of process dominance has a temporal, as well as spatial aspect, particularly over the short time-periods often used for studying processes in the field. Perception of the relative efficacy of each <b>erosive</b> <b>mechanism</b> will therefore be influenced by the temporal scale at which the bank is considered. With the advent of global climate change, both these magnitude-frequency characteristics and the consequent interaction of bank erosion mechanisms may alter. It is therefore likely that recognition of this temporal aspect of process dominance will become increasingly important to studies of bank erosion processes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} initial work {{attempting}} {{to reproduce the}} <b>erosive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> found to operate under high-energy sand impingement on CVD boron carbide coatings. Static Hertzian tests were conducted using spherically capped cone indenters, 90 ° cone angle, of radii 20 and 40 ?m. The calculated contact stresses generated were comparable with those predicted by dynamic Hertzian theory for 235 ?m angular sand particles impacting between 65 - 270 m/s and at 90 °. The load varied between 1 - 7. 5 N {{and the depth of}} penetration between 1 - 5 ?m. The calculated depth of maximum shear stress is between 4 - 7 ?m, i. e. within the coating thickness. Discontinuities (Pop-in’s) are observed at loads over 2 N during loading across several indentations on the surface. Microscopic examination of the indented coating surface revealed little surface damage, suggesting the discontinuities observed are predominantly a result of sub-surface damage. For repetitive indentation, at a single location, these discontinuities are magnified 3 - 5 times in depth with those compared to the static indentation tests. As the load is increased, the time of apparent failure shows a steady decrease. However, no widespread surface failure is observed even from these tests, suggesting the absence of local surface damage phenomena in the coating during multiple repetitive impacts...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Detonation gun coatings of tungsten carbide have been widely recognised {{as one of the}} most effective anti-wear coatings for oilfield applications. However, very little fundamental tribological information exists for the material, which hinders coating development and the evolution of correct specifications. This study redresses this problem by conducting adhesive, abrasive and erosive tests upon the coating and relating the findings to the coated microstructure. The intention has been to simulate the in-service behaviour of parallel gate valves, which are used primarily to control flow in remote locations where reliability and freedom from maintenance are essential. Although problems with such valves are rare, costs associated with replacement are exceptionally high and therefore a high research priority has been placed on valves of this type. Currently, new designs of valve are tested using a pipe loop rig at BP Research Centre. However, such tests are both expensive and time consuming and with the increasing desire to bring products to market more quickly an alternative is sought. Probably, the area offering most scope for improvement is in material specification of the sealing surfaces and this work sets out to produce a first stage selection procedure for candidate materials. Uniquely, the study has taken one component, systematically categorised its failure mechanisms using non-destructive replication techniques and then reproduced them in the laboratory. The failure analysis has pointed to three-body abrasion, erosion and adhesion being the dominant failure modes and therefore, a suite of tribo-test methods have been developed to replicate them These are namely reciprocating diamond-on-flat, slurry erosion and reciprocating pin-on-plate tests. The material studied was a proprietary detonation gun coating of tungsten carbide, LW 45, which is currently the most popular seal facing material specified for gate valves. A conformal contact geometry was chosen for the reciprocating pin-on-plate tests and problems with alignment were overcome by using a pre-test running-in procedure with 1 μm metallographic paste. Wear of LW 45 occurring during the pin-on-plate test was not affected by test speed over the range selected, but was highly dependent upon load. Four different categories ranging from minimal wear to catastrophic wear have been identified. Extensive post test analysis using optical and scanning electron microscopy has further classified the failure that occurs into two groups, termed mild and severe. In the mild regime wear occurs by preferential removal of the binder phase, which is minimised on further sliding by protruding carbide particles. Eventually sufficient binder is removed for carbide fall-out to occur, upon which the cycle is repeated. A greater wear volume is produced by the severe wear mechanism which is caused by the interlinking of cracks present within the microstructure of the coating. To ensure operation in the mild regime, continuous sliding under operating pressures of above 7. 84 MPa should be avoided. Abrasive wear simulated by the diamond-on-flat test increased with load. However, the failure mechanisms produced were independent of load and consist of a combination of plastic deformation and brittle fracture with plastic deformation representing the rate controlling step in the wear process. Slurry erosion tests have shown that LW 45 wears by a brittle <b>erosive</b> <b>mechanism</b> and is therefore best able to resist erosion at low impingement angles. The volume loss per particle impact for LW 45 is proportional to the kinetic energy of the impinging particles. The failure mechanism involved the growth of cracks in the microstructure by a fatigue action eventually leading to crack interlinking and material fall out. For all wear conditions, it is suggested that the removal of microcracking from the coating microstructure will lead to significant improvements in wear performance. A simplified design guide has been produced that gives a weighted importance to the various failure modes attributable to the respective tests. A significant improvement in performance was recorded by LW 45 in comparison to typical substrate materials such as AISI 410 and Ferralium F 255 stainless steels. SER...|$|E

Erosive wear behaviour was examined on newly fabricated nano-powder infiltration and transient eutectoid (NITE) SiC/SiC composites and two commercial composites by the chemical vapour infiltration (CVI) and NITE fabrication route. Microstructural observation was performed to examine the correlation between erosive wear behaviours and fabrication impurities. Conspicuous defects were observed in the prototype materials as the forms of porosity, fibre deformation, residual oxide, pyrolytic carbon (PyC) deformation, PyC cleavage, among others. Erosive wear behaviour was rather serious in the prototype of fabricated composites, which employ pre-SiC fibre and phenolic resin. Two dominant <b>erosive</b> wear <b>mechanisms</b> were observed: delamination of constituents, mainly caused by erosive crack propagation, and fragmentation and detachment of constituents, which usually resulted from erosive impact. A unit size of delamination was the most decisive factor affecting wear volume. The bonding strength of each constituent was mostly affected by various forms of porosities. Therefore, the fundamental cause and subsequent results must be carefully elucidated. The correlation of microstructural defect and wear behaviour was investigated {{with the aim of}} reducing dominant wear by improving fabrication conditions. The final product of the cost-effective composite had a 2. 5 -fold higher resistance than the commercial CVI composite. Consequently, by controlling fabrication impurities, we have been successful in developing and improving a new fabrication technique; consequently, the known defects are rarely observed in final product.

Studies of the emerged and {{submerged}} coastal zone of the island through direct investigation, the study of aerial and satellite photographs, and bathymetric relief to a depth of- 20 /- 30 m has determined the morphological and morphoevolutive features and identified hazard factors that characterize the high rocky coasts of island. The island is almost completely bordered by high and steep rocky coasts (coastal cliffs) of structural control, often articulated in a succession of prominent headlands and embayments. The effects of a parallel retreat of the coastal cliffs are evident in the eastern coastal area resulting in a high degree of hazard in this stretch. The morphology of the coastal system consists in a cliff with sloping shore platform at the base of the cliff. The presence of the shore platform, which controls the erosional and shaping activities by wave motion of the cliff, plays an important role and represents the main hazard factor. The other main erosional processes on rocky coast represent subordinated hazard factors. Namely, structural and stratigraphic features (hard limestone, above clastic less resistant rocks, involved in rock falls caused by basal mechanical wave erosion; the rock strata dipping seaward; presence of NW-SE trending fault), high and very steep cliffs and limestone features. Instead, the western sector of the island of Capri has a limestone coast with a plunging cliff; the water depth at the base of the cliff is greater than the breaker depth. The waves are reflected from the cliff face and the mechanical wave erosion and subsequent mass movements do not occur; weathering and bio-erosion processes are the major <b>erosive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> As a result the coastal hazard for the western sector is very low...|$|R

At the present time, the main challenge is to define {{the status of the}} site by describing its formation dynamics. This necessitates investigating the taphonomic and <b>erosive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> using a combined method adapted to the shell midden levels, before undertaking spatial analysis. The archaeological level is protected by a thick dune and is subdivided into several stratigraphic units (SU), which record several changes in the function of the site. It is made up of accumulations of shell pockets covered in sandy sediments. The micromorphological analysis shows that this waste area seems to develop into an area of activities and movement. These surfaces also record alternating dry and wet seasonal conditions, but with no phase of abandonment. Systematic pH measurements show variations of 7. 7 to 9. 0 depending on the layers, corresponding to a slightly alkaline to alkaline acid-basic status. The mapping of measurements can be correlated to structures and archaeological remains of organic origin. The excavation shows that the division of the dwelling area was guided by topographic factors, with a circular dwelling 3. 50 m in diameter installed on a flat zone and a shell waste zone on a slope towards the sea. Numerous fire-related activities were also carried out in this zone (pits, hearths). Spatial analysis by GIS shows a high concentration of recorded objects (lithics, bones, shells) {{to the west of the}} excavated area, in the shell level. Marine erosion is the main erosive factor limiting our knowledge of the site. The distance to the coastline was estimated after reconstruction of the relative sea level during the Holocene using the “Sea-Level Index Points” (SLIPs) methodology. Three SLIPs indicate a relative sealevel position between − 15. 5 m and − 11 m and a foreshore area at a depth between − 7. 15 and − 14. 02 m around 6200 BCE.

Our goal was to develop a shock initiation model that would accurately describe the existing shock initiation data in terms of physically measurable or calculable quantities. We used a simple Arrhenius fit to experimental data to describe the decomposition of the explosive (PBX 9501) in hotspots and in the bulk explosive.

The corrosion-erosion experiments were performed in a test machine in which the impingement velocity, impact angle, concentration of solids and pH of the solution were controlled.

Wear resistant materials {{are designed to}} prolong the life of equipment used to transport the slurry such as pumps, hoses, grinders, conveyor belts, screens, etc. In this study, the <b>erosive</b> wear <b>mechanisms</b> of rubber pump lining materials used in slurry pumps were explored at a structural level. The <b>erosive</b> wear <b>mechanisms</b> for rubber pump lining materials have not be extensively investigated in the literature. Arnold and Hutchings [1] were the pioneers in this field of tribology, however, {{a number of key}} areas for study remain. Although the wear mechanisms of rubber wear in slurry erosion are well documented in the literature, the chemical degradation of the rubber during this erosive wear has not been investigated. Furthermore, the viscoelastic properties of the rubber and their correlation with erosive wear have not been well documented. The approach to {{this study was to investigate}} four different rubber compounds used in slurry transport pumps and determine the wear mechanisms and their correlation with physical, viscoelastic and chemical properties of the rubbers. A slurry jet erosion test was used to investigate the wear rate of each compound under different variables. The samples were then chemically analysed using a Fourier Transfer Infra Red (FT-IR) Spectrometer to determine the extent of chemical change to the surface of the rubber during erosive wear testing. The physical properties of the rubber were tested using conventional test methods, whereas a Rubber Process Analyser 2000 (RPA 2000) was used to determine the key viscoelastic properties. It was important to investigate these properties of the rubber compounds to determine which properties could be correlated with erosive wear. Through FT-IR analysis of heat aged samples of the rubber compounds, it was established that erosive slurry wear does not correlate with aging, however, heat aging influences the hardness, resilience and viscoelastic properties which increases the wear rate of the rubber compounds. The key findings from this study were that heat aging would increase the tan &# 948; and hardness, and lower the resilience, hence, causing lower erosive wear resistance in all the rubbers. Tan &# 948;, hardness and resilience could be correlated with erosive wear loss, the heat aging effect and the chemistry of the rubber compounds. The influence of the type of reinforcing filler and cure systems could also be correlated with erosive wear resistance. Rubbers with a high loading of reinforcing carbon black resulted in a low wear resistance in comparison to a high wear resistance for silica and silane filled rubber compounds. Tan &# 948; was also correlated with the type of reinforcing filler used in the rubber chemistry. The significance of these findings is important for the future design of rubber compounds used in slurry erosion wear resistant pump liners. For a highly slurry erosion wear resistant pump liner, a high resilience, low tan &# 948; and hardness (as are found in silica and silane reinforced rubber) would be required...|$|R

High speed test runs restricted increase in speed due to material wear, which eventually affected the life of bearings. Being low saturation temperature fluids, change of phase is very common in refrigerants and cryogenic liquids, which lead to cavitation. Silicon nitride rolling elements with different sintering additives, properties and microstructure were experimentally studied {{to understand the nature}} of cavitation erosion. Advanced surface analysis technique was used study the erosive wear correlation to microstructure of test materials. Cavitation erosion wear initiated by multiple intergranular and transgranular fracture, leading to erosion pit formation. Grain size and grain boundary composition have shown to be the dominant factors for providing resistance to cavitation. Effect of surface defects and lubricant viscosity on cavitation erosion was investigated and is detailed in this thesis. A rotary specimen method was designed to study the effect of cavitation on rolling bodies. Computational modelling of acoustically generated cavitation was attempted and is also reported in this work. A novel test methodology was designed and manufactured by modifying a rotary tribometer to allow controlled experimental testing of two different phenomena rolling contact fatigue and cavitation erosion. This testing made it possible to study rolling and <b>erosive</b> wear <b>mechanisms</b> of rolling elements. Cavitation created far away in this new system is shown to be transported to the rolling contacts. The mechanism of material damage was by surface weakening due to mechanical impact of bubbles, which enhance fluid entrance and hydrodynamic pressure leading to wear initiation. Micro erosion pits formed in the rolling contact, which accelerated the damage by dislodging grains and bunch of grains.

40|$|Metal matrix {{composites}} {{consisting of}} 6061 and 2014 aluminium alloys, reinforced with 10 %, 15 % and 20 % alumina particulates and a 6061 alloy reinforced with 20 % SiC particulates, have been characterised {{in terms of}} their behaviour under various tribological conditions. In abrasive environments, the wear behaviour of each composite is dominated by their ability to resist indentation by hard particles. Abrasion against fine grit particles leads to a reduced load per abrasive particle and a correspondingly significant reduction in wear loss. Reciprocating sliding wear tests, conducted in an aqueous environment and against hardened steel counterfaces, displayed composite wear rates that were up to three orders of magnitude below those of their monolithic alloys. This is attributed to the increased resistance to surface shear provided by the reinforcing particulates themselves and their constraining effects on the matrix. The particulates become load bearing and protect the matrix by reducing the metal to counterface adhesive wear. However, the counterface wear increases due to the interaction with the hard reinforcements. Transmission electron microscopy of the worn composites reveal the formation of a transfer layer and subsurface dislocation structures which are similar to those found in metals subjected to low amplitude fatigue. In contrast to the results for abrasive and sliding wear, the composites show increasingly inferior cavitation and solid particle erosion resistances with increasing volume fractions of particulates. This depreciating effect was especially evident for particle erosion and can be related to the inability of metal matrix composites to accommodate the increments of strain which accompany <b>erosive</b> processes. The <b>mechanisms</b> responsible for the various performances have been studied by scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. An attempt is made to reconcile the steady state wear rates of the reinforced and unreinforced alloys with their observed wear modes, microstructures and bulk mechanical behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The erosion {{behaviour}} of titanium aluminide intermetallic alloys has {{not been}} widely reported in the scientific literature and {{is part of the}} current international research effort aimed at exploiting these materials for turbine engine and automotive applications. In the present study titanium aluminides have been subjected to both solid particle erosion and cavitation erosion. The erosion rates have been measured and the damage mechanisms have been identified and discussed in terms of the microstructures and mechanical properties of the titanium aluminide alloys. This has been achieved with a variety of investigative techniques, including electron microscopy, mechanical testing and microstructural examination; and, where necessary, the erosion performance of other materials have been evaluated for comparison. In particle erosion, conducted with air blast rigs at room temperature and at elevated temperature, the titanium aluminide alloys exhibit a ductile mode of material removal, and their limited strain to fracture results in higher particle erosion rates than those for 304 stainless steel. Heat treatment to produce changes in microstructure and hardness does not significantly affect particle erosion performance, and elevated temperature tests reveal an increase in particle erosion rate with increasing temperature. In cavitation erosion, the titanium aluminide alloys exhibit a ductile mode of damage accumulation and material loss, and the rates of material loss are lower than those for other engineering materials such as 304 stainless steel and some hardmetal grades which are currently used in <b>erosive</b> environments. The <b>mechanism</b> of cavitation erosion of the Ti₃Al-based alloy involves the accumulation of strain in phase boundary regions and the preferential removal of the more brittle component of the microstructure. For the Ti₃Al-based alloy, cavitation erosion resistance increases with an increase in hardness produced by heat treatment. The TiAl-based alloys exhibit twinning during the initial stages of cavitation, which is characteristic of the high strain rate deformation of TiAl-based alloys, followed by substantial work hardening and preferential material loss from phase interfaces and twinned regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{superior}} {{mechanical properties}} of boron carbide (B 13 C 2 phase) {{make it an}} attractive candidate for application as a wear resistant coating in tribological applications. The present work aims to determine the solid particle erosion behaviour of 12 – 18 ?m thick CVD boron carbide coatings on cemented tungsten carbide substrates. The erosion tests were performed on a high-energy air solid particle erosion rig using 150 – 420 ?m spherical soda-lime glass beads and 90 – 355 ?m angular quartz silica sand under normal impact, at impingement velocities between 132 and 250 m s? 1 and a flux rate of 0. 5 kg m? 2 s? 1. The erosion rates and mechanisms are presented and {{discussed in terms of}} coating thickness, particle velocity, particle shape and size. The eroded surfaces were examined using 2 - and 3 D white light optical interferometry profiling and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDS mapping to investigate the <b>erosive</b> wear damage <b>mechanisms</b> of the CVD boron carbide. The nature of post-test erodent fracture was determined using laser diffraction particle size analysis. The results indicate that erosion of CVD boron carbide occurs predominantly through a single-stage mechanism by the formation of lateral–radial crack systems that propagate outwards towards the free CVD surface and extend into the coating substrate interface. This was confirmed by optical depth profiling and from the presence of substrate and interlayer peaks in the EDS map from the vertex of the radial–lateral crack systems. The damage mechanism observed appears to be independent of the erodent shape. Adjacent lateral cracks intersect, resulting in further material loss as erosion progresses. The density of the lateral–radial crack systems is higher at the centre of the wear scar compared to the outer regions. Similar failure mechanisms for brittle coatings have recently been predicted through fracture mechanics considerations and also observed experimentally by other authors. Some evidence of surface micro- and nanochipping is also observed in other regions of the eroded CVD boron carbide surface. Comparisons have been made with previous investigations into the erosion behaviour of CVD diamond coatings under similar test conditions...|$|R
