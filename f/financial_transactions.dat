5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis, the movement advocating for a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax gained considerable support, culminating in the presentation of a proposal for such a tax by the European Commission on September 28, 2011. This thesis researches and analyzes the use of a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax in light of the stated purpose of the Commission’s proposal. The primary goals of the tax are to (1) raise revenue, (2) curb excessive volatility, and (3) harmonize the internal market. Taxes are most commonly implemented for their revenue-raising qualities rather than as tools for remedying market distortions. In contrast, many view the primary function of the <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax as a regulatory tool to minimize excessive risk taking in financial markets. Although this thesis will analyze the potential effects on revenue and the tax’s ability to contribute to harmonization of the internal market, the primary focus is on the volatility-reducing effect regulatory authorities can expect from implementing such a tax. Although the thesis will use the European Commission proposal for a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax as its starting point, it will also review other variations on the <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax. The thesis will also present alternative measures that should be considered for achieving the goals set forth by the European Commission in lieu of, or in addition to, a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax, and evaluate these measures in light of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax. The thesis concludes that while a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction,</b> in theory, may seem like a dynamic solution that could accomplish several different goals, a multifaceted approach tailored to each individual issue is likely to create a more strategic solution in the long run. A more narrowly tailored strategy is also less likely to negatively affect GDP and trading patterns than a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax...|$|R
5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen in the ghetto consists of <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.|$|E
5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E
