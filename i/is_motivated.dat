He <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> {{by the death of}} family members and has mild autism. He divides his time between managing his successful corporation and work as a superhero.|$|E
5|$|Ferris {{returns to}} Hoffman in Washington, and they devise {{a new plan}} to find Al-Saleem. Suspecting he <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> more by pride than ideology, they stage a fake {{terrorist}} attack and set up Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman), an innocent Jordanian architect, as its instigator, hoping Al-Saleem {{will come out of}} hiding and attempt to contact him. Al-Saleem sees TV news coverage of the attack and takes the bait.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hawkins (Kevin Michael Richardson) – A {{social worker}} who runs the Freeman Community Center as head counselor. He is a widower and the single father of two teenagers—Virgil and Sharon. He dislikes gangs and the {{destructive}} attitudes of most Bang Babies, and {{his work at the}} community center <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> by a desire to counteract their bad influence on young people.|$|E
50|$|An egg donor may <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> {{to donate}} eggs for altruistic reasons. A survey of 80 American women showed that 30% <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by {{altruism}} alone, another 20% were attracted only by monetary compensation, while 40% of donors <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by both reasons. The same {{study found that}} 45% of egg donors were students {{the first time they}} donated and averaged $4,000 for each donation.|$|R
50|$|Theory Y puts forward {{that workers}} <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> by higher order needs and tend towards {{self-control}} and self-direction. People {{have the capacity}} to problem-solve, <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> by affiliation, esteem and the possibility of self-actualization besides physiological and security needs.|$|R
50|$|Like many EAs, BBO <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> by {{a natural}} process; in particular, BBO <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> by biogeography, {{which is the}} study of the {{distribution}} of biological species through time and space. BBO was originally introduced by Dan Simon in 2008.|$|R
5|$|James Frain plays Kieran Ashton, {{a former}} {{colleague}} of Karl, who faked his suicide {{and became the}} Truth Terrorist, serving as the primary antagonist. The character <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> {{by the loss of}} his identity and family, as well as betrayal from Karl by his affair with Kieran's wife before her death. Frain believed that Kieran is the most disturbing character he has played. Portraying the character, the actor wanted to make his actions understandable, though not justifiable.|$|E
5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> by altruism or {{by the promise of}} a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence of money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} man killed {{outside the}} bowling alley is discovered, missing a tongue. It is {{identified}} as a retired police officer, Detective Mellen, who had given false testimony that had sent Annie Tisman's late husband to prison. Black realizes that the killer <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> {{by the need to}} right wrongs such as this, killing those who have gotten away with crimes. Meanwhile, The Judge passes sentence on another victim—a slumlord whose negligence caused a tenant's death. Bardale is ordered to cut the landlord's leg off while he is still alive; the leg is later found in a postal depot in a package.|$|E
50|$|Justinian I {{started a}} short period of mourning. He did not wear his crown for the forty days {{following}} the earthquake. The earthquake was later commemorated by an annual liturgy of supplication. Agathias also claimed there was a short-lived effect on the attitude of the population: the wealthy <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to charity, doubters <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to pray, and the vicious <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to virtue, all in an apparent effort of propitiation. Agathias reports that soon enough everyone lapsed into their former attitudes.|$|R

5|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will versus determinism. Other themes explored by the film include involuntary commitment, the nature of political and legal systems in a high technology-advanced society, the rights of privacy in a media-dominated world, {{and the nature of}} self-perception. The film also continues to follow Spielberg's tradition of depicting broken families,*Vest. pg. 136 which he has said <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> by his parents' divorce when he was a child.|$|E
5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E

5000|$|The idea of “Engineering of Consent” <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> by Freud’s {{idea that}} humans are irrational beings, and <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> {{primarily}} by inner desires hidden in their unconscious.

25|$|The town is of {{particular}} cultural significance to the Kurdish people: the delegation found a widespread perception that the GAP project, and Ilısu in particular, <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> primarily {{by a desire to}} destroy the Kurds as an ethnic group by destroying their most important cultural sites.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the protests}} that sparked the {{creation}} of the Conch Republic (and others since then) have been described by some as [...] "tongue-in-cheek," [...] they <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> by frustrations over genuine concerns. The original protest event <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> by a U.S. Border Patrol roadblock and checkpoint that greatly inconvenienced residents and tourists.|$|R
25|$|Chris Cooper (Kevin McDonald, Jason Barr, younger) is the {{inventor}} of the drug, and main protagonist of the film. He <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> by the clumsy suicide of his father (also played by McDonald) to create a cure for clinical depression, but quickly gets swept up in the resulting fame.|$|E
25|$|Toastmasters {{also teaches}} {{leadership}} skills. This <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> {{in part by}} the fact that Toastmasters International is staffed completely by volunteers (except for a staff of about 90 paid personnel at the World Headquarters). Even the board of directors is composed of volunteers, who still hold memberships in local clubs and are not paid.|$|E
25|$|In Scanning {{fluorescence}} {{correlation spectroscopy}} (sFCS) the measurement volume is moved across the sample in a defined way. The introduction of scanning <b>is</b> <b>motivated</b> by its ability to alleviate or remove several distinct problems often encountered in standard FCS, and thus, to extend the range of applicability of fluorescence correlation methods in biological systems.|$|E

Using Web 2. 0 technologies such as blogging, in the classroom students <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> to write and read more. A study was conducted with three participants using a classroom blog to see if they <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> to write and read more while completing various writing tasks on the blog.

25|$|In January 2009, the Baku authorities' {{demolition}} of the 26 Commissars Memorial commemorating the 26 Baku Commissars began {{and was soon}} completed.
