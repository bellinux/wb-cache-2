5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} has {{important}} implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence <b>in</b> <b>relationships</b> increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people <b>in</b> <b>relationships</b> should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners. DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was inexperienced <b>in</b> <b>relationships,</b> but {{the well-to-do}} widow {{encouraged}} him and provided for {{him with her}} substantial savings. The two were married on 9 July 1735, at St. Werburgh's Church in Derby. The Porter family did not approve of the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder. His mother's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he stopped talking to her. Her other son Joseph later accepted the marriage, and her daughter, Lucy, accepted Johnson from the start.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dysfunction}} is a stressor <b>in</b> <b>relationships.</b> People {{are often}} as concerned about failing {{to keep a}} partner satisfied as they are about meeting their own sexual needs. In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for wanting to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner. The frequency of sex correlates with {{the desire of the}} uninjured partner.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{estimates}} that 35% {{of women in}} the world have experienced physical or sexual violence over their lifetime and that the commonest situation is intimate partner violence. 30% of women <b>in</b> <b>relationships</b> report such experience, and 38% of murders of women are due to intimate partners. These figures may be as high as 70% in some regions. Risk factors include low educational achievement, a parental experience of violence, childhood abuse, gender inequality and cultural attitudes that allow violence to be considered more acceptable.|$|E
5|$|David Schwimmer portrays Ross Geller, Monica Geller's older brother, a {{paleontologist}} {{working at}} the Museum of Natural History, and later a tenured professor of paleontology at New York University. Ross is a sweet-natured man of good humor, although he is often clumsy and socially awkward. Ross is involved in an on-again-off-again relationship with Rachel throughout the series. He has three failed marriages during the series: Carol Willick, a lesbian {{who is also the}} mother of his son, Ben; Emily Waltham, who divorces Ross after he accidentally says Rachel's name instead of hers during their wedding vows; and Rachel, as the two drunkenly marry in Las Vegas. His failed love life is potentially due to his paranoia and jealousy <b>in</b> <b>relationships,</b> and his divorces become a running joke within the series. Following a one-night stand, he and Rachel have a daughter, Emma, by the end of season eight. They finally confess that they are still in love with each other in the series finale.|$|E

5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes <b>in</b> <b>relationships.</b> Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E
5|$|The Time Traveler's Wife is {{the debut}} novel of American author Audrey Niffenegger, {{published}} in 2003. It {{is a love}} story about {{a man with a}} genetic disorder that causes him to time travel unpredictably, and about his wife, an artist, who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences. Niffenegger, frustrated in love when she began the work, wrote the story as a metaphor for her failed relationships. The tale's central relationship came to her suddenly and subsequently supplied the novel's title. The novel, which has been classified as both science fiction and romance, examines issues of love, loss, and free will. In particular, it uses time travel to explore miscommunication and distance <b>in</b> <b>relationships,</b> while also investigating deeper existential questions.|$|E
