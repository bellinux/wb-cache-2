5|$|During {{the latter}} part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a {{multi-media}} project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be <b>gigging</b> again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.|$|E

After continuous <b>gigging</b> around the Midlands, it wasn't long until word of mouth helped them become a popular unsigned band. The band then sent out a one track demo cd of Bullets, earning them the interest of several British labels, with thirty A reps coming to see them play at Birmingham. In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle based indie label Kitchenware Records. Upon signing to the record label they changed their band name to Editors.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd had stabilised with a line-up of Barrett, Waters, Mason and Wright by mid-1965, {{and after}} {{frequent}} <b>gigging</b> that year became regulars on the underground live circuit in London. While Barrett was the dominant member, writing most material, singing most lead vocals and playing lead guitar, Wright played a supportive role, playing keyboards and singing, with occasional lead, and writing his own material. As {{the most qualified}} musician, Wright was responsible for tuning guitars, and would often tune Waters' bass for him in concert. Later on, he had a Strobotuner to tune guitars silently during gigs. In the band's early days, before acquiring a full-time road crew, Wright was responsible for unloading the gear {{at the end of}} each gig.|$|E

5|$|The Leslie was {{originally}} designed to mimic the complex tones and constantly shifting sources of sound emanating from {{a large group of}} ranks in a pipe organ. The effect varies depending on the speed of the rotors, which can be toggled between fast (tremolo) and slow (chorale) using a console half-moon or pedal switch, with the most distinctive effect occurring as the speaker rotation speed changes. The most popular Leslies were the 122, which accepted a balanced signal suitable for console organs, and the 147, which accepted an unbalanced signal and could be used for spinet organs with a suitable adapter. The Pro-Line series of Leslies which were made to be portable for <b>gigging</b> bands using solid-state amps were popular during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Metallica {{released}} {{their debut}} album Kill 'Em All on the independent label Megaforce Records in July 1983. The album helped to establish thrash metal, a heavy metal subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material and from September began performing {{the songs that}} were to make up Ride the Lightning at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate one meal a day and stayed at fans' homes while playing clubs across the US. An incident occurred when part of Metallica's gear was stolen in Boston, and Anthrax lent Metallica its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not <b>gigging,</b> the band stayed in a rented house in El Cerrito, California, called the Metallica Mansion. Frontman James Hetfield felt uneasy about performing double duty on vocals and rhythm guitar so the band offered the job to Armored Saint singer John Bush, who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time. Hetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist and kept his original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984 at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album was produced by Flemming Rasmussen, founder of Sweet Silence, {{who went on to}} produce the band's next two albums. Drummer Lars Ulrich chose Rasmussen because he liked his work on Rainbow's Difficult to Cure (1981) and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the band's talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallica's tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the album's material at Mercyful Fate's practice room in Copenhagen.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Technological {{advancement}} and {{the proliferation}} of the smartphone have reshaped the commercial landscape, providing consumers new ways to access the retail marketplace. On-demand companies are one such innovation, and underpinning on-demand commerce is the <b>gig</b> economy, the collection of markets that match service providers to consumers of on-demand services on a <b>gig</b> (or job) basis. Flagship on-demand companies such as Uber (driver services) and Handy (home cleaners and household services) have garnered significant media attention both for their market success and recent legal challenges, particularly concerning the classification of <b>gig</b> workers. Broader questions about {{the pros and cons of}} the <b>gig</b> economy have emerged as on-demand markets grow and the <b>gig</b> economy expands into new sectors. By some accounts, workers’ willingness to participate in the <b>gig</b> economy provides evidence that <b>gig</b> work is a beneficial arrangement. Indeed, <b>gig</b> jobs may yield benefits relative to traditional employment in terms of the ease of finding employment and greater flexibility to choose jobs and hours. The <b>gig</b> economy may facilitate bridge employment (e. g., temporary employment between career jobs or between full-time work and retirement) or provide opportunities to generate income when circumstances do not accommodate traditional full-time, full-year employment. At the same time, however, the potential lack of labor protections for <b>gig</b> workers and the precarious nature of <b>gig</b> work have been met with some concern. The nationwide reach of <b>gig</b> work and its potential to impact large groups of workers, and their livelihoods, have attracted the attention of some Members of Congress. These Members have raised questions about the size and composition of the <b>gig</b> workforce, the proper classification of <b>gig</b> workers (i. e., as employees or independent contractors), the potential for <b>gig</b> work to create work opportunities for unemployed or underemployed workers, and implications of <b>gig</b> work for worker protections and access to traditional employment-based benefits. In support of these policy considerations, this report provides an overview of the <b>gig</b> economy and identifies legal and policy questions relevant to its workforce...|$|R

25|$|After an {{appearance}} at the 1964 Antibes Jazz Festival in France, the group decided stay in Europe. They spent some additional time in France before taking up club residencies in Zurich and Geneva, Switzerland for nearly a year. In April 1965, they played a short residency at Ronnie Scott's Club in London, and decided to stay on in Britain. Unfortunately, their arrival coincided with a downturn in the fortunes of jazz in the UK, as recording and <b>gigging</b> opportunities began drying up. There is also the suspicion that they were deliberately frozen out of the British scene by established local musicians, who considered them interlopers.|$|E
25|$|Their {{relationship}} {{often was}} combative.

According to Tina, they would eventually marry in 1962 in Tijuana, though Ike later disputed the account. The entire Revue relocated from East St. Louis to Los Angeles in 1960. <b>Gigging</b> for 300 days a year touring the chitlin' circuit {{to make up for}} a lack of hit records put a strain on Tina. In 1964, after months of tense business relations, Ike Turner ended his contract with Juggy Murray and Sue Records. He signed with the Kent label and a year later signed with Warner Bros. Records and its subsidiary Loma Records, where they met Bob Krasnow. Krasnow would begin managing them in 1965.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A {{candidate}} oncogene <b>GIG</b> 47, previously {{known as}} a neudesin with a neurotrophic activity, was identified by applying the differential expression analysis method. Methods As a first step to understand the molecular role of <b>GIG</b> 47, we analyzed the expression profile of <b>GIG</b> 47 in multiple human cancers including the breast cancer and characterized its function related to human carcinogenesis. Based on this oncogenic role of <b>GIG</b> 47, we then embarked on determining the high-resolution structure of <b>GIG</b> 47. We have applied multidimensional heteronuclear NMR methods to <b>GIG</b> 47. Results <b>GIG</b> 47 was over-expressed in primary breast tumors {{as well as other}} human tumors including carcinomas of the uterine cervix, malignant lymphoma, colon, lung, skin, and leukemia. To establish its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer in humans, we generated stable transfectants of MCF 7 cells. The ectopic expression of <b>GIG</b> 47 in MCF 7 cells promoted the invasiveness in the presence of 50 % serum. In addition, it also resulted in the increased tumorigenicity in in vivo tumor formation assay. The tumorigenesis mechanism involving <b>GIG</b> 47 might be mediated by the activation of MAPK and PI 3 K pathways. These results indicate that <b>GIG</b> 47 plays a role in the breast tumorigenesis, thus representing a novel target for the treatment of breast cancer. To facilitate the development of <b>GIG</b> 47 -targeted therapeutics, we determined the structural configuration of <b>GIG</b> 47. The high-resolution structure of <b>GIG</b> 47 was obtained by combination of NMR and homology modeling. The overall structure of <b>GIG</b> 47 has four α -helices and 6 β -strands, arranged in a β 1 - α 1 - β 2 - β 3 - α 2 - β 4 - α 3 - α 4 - β 5 - β 6 topology. There is a potential heme/steroid binding pocket formed between two helices α 2 and α 3. Conclusion The determined three-dimensional structure of <b>GIG</b> 47 may facilitate the development of potential anti-cancer agents. </p...|$|R

25|$|In 1974, {{immediately}} after the recording of Unconditionally Guaranteed, which markedly continued the trend towards a more commercial sound heard {{on some of the}} Clear Spot tracks, the Magic Band's original members departed. Disgruntled and past members worked together for a period, <b>gigging</b> at Blue Lake and putting together their own ideas and demos, with John French earmarked as the vocalist. These concepts eventually coalesced around the core of Art Tripp III, Harkleroad and Boston, with the formation of Mallard, helped by finance and UK recording facilities from Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. Some of French's compositions were used in the band's work, but the group's singer was Sam Galpin and the role of keyboardist was eventually taken by John Thomas, who had shared a house with French in Eureka at the time. At this time Vliet attempted to recruit both French and Harkleroad as producers for his next album, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Andy Di Martino produced both of these Virgin label albums.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter, Cunningham and Chino Moreno {{were friends}} from their childhood. All three went to McClatchy High School in Sacramento and {{remained}} friends through the city's skateboarding scene. While Carpenter {{was a fan}} of heavy metal, Moreno was also interested in hardcore punk bands such as Bad Brains and post-punk and new wave bands such as Depeche Mode. When Moreno found out that Carpenter played guitar, {{he set up a}} jam session with Cunningham, who played drums, and the three began playing regularly in Carpenter's garage around 1988. They recruited bassist Dominic Garcia some time after, and the band became a four-piece. When Cunningham left Deftones to join Phallucy, another band from Sacramento, Garcia switched to drums. The band acquired Cheng to play bass, and recorded a four-track demo soon afterwards. John Taylor replaced Cunningham on drums in 1991, until Cunningham's return in 1993. Within two years, the band began playing club shows and later expanded their <b>gigging</b> territory to San Francisco and Los Angeles, where they played shows alongside bands such as Korn. While closing for another band in L.A., after the majority of the audience had left, the band impressed a Maverick Records representative. They were signed to the label after performing three of their songs for Freddy DeMann and Guy Oseary.|$|E
25|$|The Grateful Dead {{began their}} career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the {{remnants}} of a Palo Alto, California jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. The band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza located at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban Menlo Park, California, on May 5, 1965. They were initially known as the Warlocks; coincidentally, the Velvet Underground (similarly influenced by avant-garde music) was also using that name on the East Coast. The show was not recorded but the set list has been preserved. <b>Gigging</b> as a bar band, the group quickly changed its name after finding out that another band of the same name (not the Velvet Underground, who by then had also changed their name) had signed a recording contract. The first show under the new name Grateful Dead was in San Jose, California on December 4, 1965, at one of Ken Kesey's Acid Tests. Earlier demo tapes have survived, but the first of over 2,000 concerts known to have been recorded by the band's fans was a show at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on January 8, 1966. Later that month, the Grateful Dead played at the Trips Festival, an early psychedelic rock concert.|$|E

25|$|River boating also becomes {{significant}} {{during the}} atlatl stone dart and stone arrow point arrival, with {{some evidence of}} a coastal trade. Some hunters and warriors transitioned to bow and arrow. Although, the atlatl and dart continued in use alongside the arrow into the Late Protohistoric. The main water way trade was the Ohio River tributaries to the Tennessee River system and the James and Potomac rivers to Chesapeake Bay. Although <b>gigging</b> from canoe is suspected, bow fishing is unknown. Eventually, not only localized trademen canoeing (Wakeman 2003:19). It is thought that forts were built as a defence against raids on these sedentary, agrarian, but productive people, who lived in their villages year round. Dr. McMichael explained that warfare can be assumed, as some corpses with projectile points in them were found at the last occurrence of a culturally uncommon large palisaded Fort Ancient village at the Buffalo Site, 46PU31. Along with other local smaller groups of Fort Ancients, 'Rolfe Lee 46Ms123 village period #2' is suspected to have returned to Buffalo's last occupation. Traditional historians, Atkinson, Lewis and others within the state, declare Buffalo village was destroyed {{as a result of}} Fur Trade encroachment. Since then, a shell tempered pipe (Fort Ancient) and part of an Iroquois pipe were found in one of the 46PU31 occupational period sites. Soon there follows the Late Clover phase and 'Orchard of mixed cultures' with much larger towns without palisaded walls. With advanced hunting tools in hand, and a changed focus, these people now seasonally break away from the town to winter camps up river tributaries to gather fur for trade. The last occupation at 'Rolfe Lee 46Ms123 period #1' is suspected to be one of these un-palisaded towns, during the dawn of local history.|$|E
