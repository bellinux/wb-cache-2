2500|$|Most glucometers today use an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>method.</b> Test strips {{contain a}} {{capillary}} that sucks up a reproducible amount of blood. The glucose {{in the blood}} reacts with an enzyme electrode containing glucose oxidase (or dehydrogenase). The enzyme is reoxidized with an excess of a mediator reagent, such as a ferricyanide ion, a ferrocene derivative or osmium bipyridyl complex. The mediator in turn is reoxidized by reaction at the electrode, which generates an electric current. [...] The total charge passing through the electrode {{is proportional to the}} amount of glucose in the blood that has reacted with the enzyme. The coulometric method is a technique where the total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction is measured over a period of time. The amperometric method is used by some meters and measures the electric current generated at a specific point in time by the glucose reaction. This is analogous to throwing a ball and using the speed at which it is travelling at a point in time to estimate how hard it was thrown. The coulometric method can allow for variable test times, whereas the test time on [...] a meter using the amperometric method is always fixed. Both methods give an estimation of the concentration of glucose in the initial blood sample.|$|E

5000|$|Manganese(III) acetate is an {{chemical}} compound {{that is used}} as an oxidizing agent in organic synthesis and materials science. Like the analogous acetates of iron and chromium, it is an oxygen-centered coordination complex containing three manganese atoms bridged by acetate units. The anhydrous form of this compound crystallizes as a linear coordination polymer, with an additional acetic acid molecule bridging between manganese atoms on consecutive three-manganese clusters. The chemical is therefore not a simple metal acetate ionic compound nor does the actual structure of it reflect the simple [...] "Mn(OAc)3" [...] chemical formula that is commonly given. It is usually used as the dihydrate, though the anhydrous form is also used in some situations. The dihydrate is prepared by reacting potassium permanganate and manganese(II) acetate in acetic acid; addition of acetic anhydride to the reaction produces the anhydrous form. It is also synthesized by <b>electrochemical</b> <b>method</b> starting from Mn(OAc)2.|$|E
50|$|Alexander von Humboldt {{synthesized}} one of {{the first}} synthetic peroxides, barium peroxide, in 1799 as a by-product of his attempts to decompose air. Nineteen years later Louis Jacques Thénard recognized that this compound could be used for the preparation of a previously unknown compound, which he described as oxidized water - subsequently known as hydrogen peroxide. Thénard and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac synthesized sodium peroxide in 1811. The bleaching effect of peroxides and their salts on natural dyes became known around that time, but early attempts of industrial production of peroxides failed, and the first plant producing hydrogen peroxide was built in 1873 in Berlin. The discovery of the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide by electrolysis with sulfuric acid introduced the more efficient <b>electrochemical</b> <b>method.</b> It was first implemented into industry in 1908 in Weißenstein, Carinthia, Austria. The anthraquinone process, which is still used, was developed during the 1930s by the German chemical manufacturer IG Farben in Ludwigshafen. The increased demand and improvements in the synthesis methods resulted in the rise of the annual production of hydrogen peroxide from 35,000 tonnes in 1950, to over 100,000 tonnes in 1960, to 300,000 tonnes by 1970; by 1998 it reached 2.7 million tonnes.|$|E

The use of synthetic antioxidants has decreased due to the ssociation of these compounds with certain cancers. Thus, the search for novel natural antioxidants has gained much focus in research. Most common methods of determining antioxidant capacity are the radical generated assays and biological assays such as lipid peroxidation and the nitroblue tetrazolium assay. <b>Electrochemical</b> <b>methods</b> have been proposed for the determination of bio-active compounds such as antioxidants. The <b>electrochemical</b> <b>methods</b> of cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry were evaluated for the determination of antioxidant capacity initially examining known antioxidants and then using plant extracts of Sutherlandia frutescens as a case study. The antioxidant properties determined by <b>electrochemical</b> <b>methods</b> were validated utilising the non-biological methods of the DPPH, TEAC, ferrozine and FC assay and biological pharmacological methods.
