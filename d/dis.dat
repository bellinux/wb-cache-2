5|$|In {{a number}} of older books, the MiG I-211 is called the MiG-5. It is now {{established}} that the MiG-5 designation was reserved for the production version of the MiG <b>DIS,</b> a twin-engine fighter that did not enter production. The acronym <b>DIS</b> comes from Dalnij Istrebitel Soprovozhdenya or long-range escort fighter. Similarly, the MiG-9 designation was intended for the production version of the MiG-3 with the ASh-82 radial engine. This name was reused shortly afterwards for the first Mikoyan-Gurevich jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|The Polkarpov TIS was {{a heavily}} armed Soviet heavy fighter {{designed}} {{during the early}} 1940s. Competing contemporaneous designs in the USSR included the Grushin Gr-1, Mikoyan-Gurevich <b>DIS</b> and Tairov Ta-3.|$|E
5|$|As {{the two are}} {{otherwise}} unattested outside of Snorri's Prose Edda, suggestions have been made that Hjúki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) posits that Snorri may have known or had access to a now lost verse source wherein Hjúki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} <b>dís</b> (a type of female deity).|$|E
5|$|Jellyvision Games did {{not want}} to change much of the older games for the 2011 version. They sought to keep as many of the old game {{question}} types, such as the Jack Attack and <b>Dis</b> Or Dat questions, updating the games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles: they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in-game achievements.|$|E
5|$|Micaëla {{enters with}} a guide, seeking José and {{determined}} to rescue him from Carmen ("Je <b>dis</b> que rien ne m'épouvante"). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is José, who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo. José's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight ("Je suis Escamillo, toréro de Grenade"), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls ("Holà, holà José"). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Micaëla is discovered; at first, José will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. As he departs, vowing he will return, Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador's song.|$|E
5|$|Young Bosnia's activists {{regarded}} {{literature as}} indispensable to revolution, {{and most of}} them wrote poems, short stories, or critiques. Stojanović wrote poems, and read the works of Petar Kočić, Aleksa Šantić, Vladislav Petković <b>Dis,</b> Sima Pandurović, Milan Rakić, and later the works of Russian authors. In his final years at the gymnasium, he read Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Bakunin, Nietzsche, Jaurès, Le Bon, Ibsen, and Marinetti. National Unity held meetings at which its members presented lectures and discussed current issues concerning the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All members of the association were Serbs. Generally, Stojanović's lectures were about educating people on practical issues of health and the economy. During the summer break of 1911, Stojanović travelled across Bosanska Krajina lecturing in villages. One of the aims of Young Bosnia was to eliminate the backwardness of their country.|$|E
5|$|The airline started {{negotiating}} a charter contract {{agreement with the}} Danish tour operator Spies Rejser in July 1970. Trans Polar offered the operator the use of two Boeing 720s for 55 million Danish krone (DKK), 10 million lower than the incumbent Scanair was bidding, which would allow Spies to transport 140,000 of their annual 250,000 passengers. As the first aircraft was bound to existing operations, Trans Polar would have to procure two additional aircraft for the contract, as well as receive operating permission in Denmark. Trans Polar and Spies signed a contract in mid-August for one weekly service from Copenhagen to Gran Canaria, while another weekly contract was awarded to Maersk Air. Negotiations for the main contract started on 5 September; Scanair had stated a minimum price it could accept, largely {{based on the fact}} that Spies did not have an alternative operator. The successful negotiations with Trans Polar also included an agreement with Spantax, who each could offer Spies 70,000 seats for the season. The contract brought annual revenue of DKK25 million to Trans Polar. To fly the operations, two ex-Aer Lingus Boeing 720s were registered on 16 October. The company later signed agreements with the Danish tour operators Karavan-rejser and Danmarks Internasjonale Studentkomite (<b>DIS).</b>|$|E
25|$|In the distance, Dante {{perceives}} high towers {{that resemble}} fiery red mosques. Virgil informs {{him that they}} are approaching the City of <b>Dis.</b> <b>Dis,</b> itself surrounded by the Stygian marsh, contains Lower Hell within its walls. <b>Dis</b> {{is one of the}} names of Pluto, the classical king of the underworld, in addition to being the name of the realm. The walls of <b>Dis</b> are guarded by fallen angels. Virgil is unable to convince them to let Dante and him enter, and Dante is threatened by the Furies (consisting of Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone) and Medusa.|$|E

25|$|While Cernunnos {{was never}} assimilated, {{scholars}} have sometimes compared him functionally to Greek and Roman divine {{figures such as}} Mercury, Actaeon, specialized forms of Jupiter, and <b>Dis</b> Pater, the latter of whom Julius Caesar said was considered the ancestor of the Gauls.|$|E

25|$|Though jazz rap had {{achieved}} little mainstream success, Miles Davis' final album Doo-Bop (released posthumously in 1992) was based around hip hop beats and collaborations with producer Easy Mo Bee.

25|$|Many of {{the great}} epics of European {{literature}} include episodes that occur in Hell. In the Roman poet Virgil's Latin epic, the Aeneid, Aeneas descends into <b>Dis</b> (the underworld) to visit his father's spirit. The underworld is only vaguely described, with one unexplored path leading to the punishments of Tartarus, while the other leads through Erebus and the Elysian Fields.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} {{author who}} has most {{benefited from the}} finds at Oxyrhynchus is the Athenian playwright Menander (342291 BC), whose comedies were very popular in Hellenistic times and whose works are frequently found in papyrus fragments. Menander's plays found in fragments at Oxyrhynchus include Misoumenos, <b>Dis</b> Exapaton, Epitrepontes, Karchedonios, Dyskolos and Kolax. The works found at Oxyrhynchus have greatly raised Menander's status among classicists and scholars of Greek theatre.|$|E
25|$|In Shakespeare's The Tempest, the masque that Prospero conjures to {{celebrate}} the troth-pledging of Miranda and Ferdinand echoes the Eleusinian Mysteries, although it uses the Roman names for the deities involved – Ceres, Iris, <b>Dis</b> and others – instead of the Greek. It is interesting that a play which is so steeped in esoteric imagery from alchemy and hermeticism should draw on the Mysteries for its central masque sequence.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Circle is {{guarded by}} a figure Dante names as Pluto: this is Plutus, the deity of wealth in {{classical}} mythology. Although {{the two are}} often conflated, he is a distinct figure from Pluto (<b>Dis),</b> the classical ruler of the underworld. At the start of Canto VII, he menaces Virgil and Dante with the cryptic phrase Papé Satàn, papé Satàn aleppe, but Virgil protects Dante from him.|$|E

25|$|Despite these {{handling}} problems, {{the aircraft}} was ordered by Austro-Hungary as the D.I. A total of 122 <b>D.Is</b> were built, with 50 built by Hansa-Brandenburg in Germany - powered by 110kW (150hp) Austro-Daimler engines - while a further 72 were built under license by Phönix in Vienna, powered by 138kW (185hp) Austro-Daimler engines. While {{it was intended}} that the D.I also be built by Ufag, none were delivered. The KD also {{formed the basis for}} the Hansa-Brandenburg KDW floatplane fighter.|$|E
25|$|Temples {{to several}} other deities {{overlooked}} the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to Ceres and Flora stood close {{together on the}} Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to Luna, the moon goddess. Aventine temples to Venus Obsequens, Mercury and <b>Dis</b> (or perhaps Summanus) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to Magna Mater and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god Apollo.|$|E
25|$|RFC {{casualties}} {{increased in}} mid-September, {{due to a}} German reorganisation of air units according to function, Kampfeinsitzer units were combined into seven bigger Jagdstaffeln (Jastas, fighter squadrons) with new and better Albatros <b>D.Is</b> and hand-picked pilots, trained at Valenciennes in new tactics based on the Dicta Boelcke. The first of the new aircraft for Jasta 2 arrived on 16 September. A modest technical superiority and better tactics enabled German aircrew to challenge Anglo-French air supremacy but the more manoeuvrable British fighters, greater numbers and aggressive tactics, preventing the Germans from gaining air superiority.|$|E
25|$|Both {{outflanking}} moves {{having failed}} {{because of the}} terrain and the weather, the British 2nd Division concentrated on attacking the Japanese positions along Kohima Ridge from 4 May onwards. Fire from Japanese posts on the reverse slope of GPT Ridge repeatedly caught British troops attacking Jail Hill in the flank, inflicting heavy casualties and preventing them from capturing the hill for a week. However, the various positions were slowly taken. Jail Hill, together with Kuki Picquet, FSD and <b>DIS,</b> was finally captured by 33rd Indian Infantry Brigade on 11 May, after a barrage of smoke shells blinded the Japanese machine-gunners and allowed the troops to secure the hill and dig in.|$|E
25|$|One main {{theme of}} Greek New Comedy is the father–son relationship. For example, in Menander's <b>Dis</b> Exapaton {{there is a}} focus on the {{betrayal}} between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it's not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus is still on the relationship between father and son, but we see betrayal between the two men that wasn't seen in Menander. There is {{a focus on the}} proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, was so important to Roman society at the time of Plautus.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has {{damaged and}} threatens to damage {{a number of}} sites of {{interest}} to Palestinian archaeology {{in and around the}} Green Line, prompting condemnation from the World Archaeological Congress (WAC) and a call for Israel to abide by UNESCO conventions that protect cultural heritage. In the autumn of 2003, bulldozers preparing the ground for a section of the barrier that runs through Abu <b>Dis</b> in East Jerusalem damaged the remains of a 1,500-year-old Byzantine era monastery. Construction was halted to allow the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) to conduct a salvage excavation that recovered a mosaic, among other artifacts. Media reported that an IAA official media blamed the IDF for proceeding without procuring the opinion of the IAA.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic traditions were {{initiated}} {{with the arrival}} of the Portuguese in 1510. The Almacho <b>Dis</b> (Souls Day) is commemorated on Nov 2, following all Saints Day (Nov. 1). On this day, the forgotten souls are remembered and spiritual charity is done though prayer for the deceased family and ancestral souls. Charity is practiced also by offering food for the poor called beggars lunch (bikareanchem jevonn) where the poor are invited for lunch, from the village and treated with dignity and respect. The invited down trodden are served as guest and usually commences with prayers for the deceased souls. Following mass on all souls day, the deceased visit the graveyard of the deceased souls and pray and also decorate their graves.|$|E
25|$|The city is {{surrounded}} on four sides by the Judean Desert and {{is linked to}} Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area via Highway 1. Due to its strategic location between {{the northern and southern}} parts of the West Bank, Palestinians see this {{as a threat to the}} territorial continuity of a future Palestinian state. This claim is disputed by mayor Benny Kashriel, who claims that continuity would be attained by circling Ma'ale Adumim to the east. Israeli drivers use a bypass road that exits the city to the west, entering Jerusalem through the French Hill Junction or a tunnel that goes under Mt. Scopus. These routes were built in the wake of the First and Second Intifadas when Palestinian militants shot at motorists and cars were stoned. The previous road passed through al-Eizariya and Abu <b>Dis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cernunnos, as the conjectured Gaulish {{manifestation of}} the Roman <b>Dis</b> Pater, is {{considered}} to share the latter’s attributes of ruling over the hidden treasures of the underworld. Subterranean treasures were commonly linked in Medieval Bestiaries to the serpent, the occupant of the underground, or otherworld, and the keeper of its treasures and mysteries. This aspect of Cernunnos is depicted on a stone statue from a well in Sommerécourt, Haute-Marne, France, and on a bronze figurine from Autun. Both statue and figurine portray Cernunnos with the two ram-headed serpents encircling his waist. This {{is more than just}} a small similarity to the instance of the serpent that guarded the treasure of the fort in Táin Bó Fraích surrendering to Conall Cernach and becoming his belt. Cernunno’s connections to the deity Mars serve to underline Conall’s role as hero-warrior in the tale.|$|E
25|$|Allegorically, the Inferno {{represents}} the Christian soul seeing sin {{for what it}} really is, and the three beasts represent three types of sin: the self-indulgent, the violent, and the malicious. These three types of sin also provide the three main divisions of Dante's Hell: Upper Hell, outside the city of <b>Dis,</b> for the four sins of indulgence (lust, gluttony, avarice, anger); Circle 7 {{for the sins of}} violence; and Circles 8 and 9 for the sins of malice (fraud and treachery). Added to these are two unlike categories that are specifically spiritual: Limbo, in Circle 1, contains the virtuous pagans who were not sinful but were ignorant of Christ, and Circle 6 contains the heretics who contradicted the doctrine and confused the spirit of Christ. The circles number 9, with the addition of Satan completing the structure of 9 + 1 = 10.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 2011 {{radioactive}} caesium in concentrations above the governmental safety limit {{was found in}} rice samples collected in an area in the northeastern part of the prefecture Fukushima. Rice-samples taken before the harvest showed 500 becquerels per kilogram {{in the city of}} Nihonmatsu. The Japanese government ordered a two way testing procedure of samples taken before and after the harvest. Pre-harvest tests were carried out in nine prefectures in the regions of Tohoku and Kanto. After the find of this high level of cesium, the prefectural government <b>dis</b> increase the number of places to be tested within the city from 38 to about 300.
