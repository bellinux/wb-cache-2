5000|$|Various {{earthing}} {{systems are}} used {{to ensure that the}} ground and neutral wires have zero voltage with respect to earth, to prevent shocks when touching grounded electrical equipment. In some installations, there may be two line conductors which carry alternating currents in a single-phase three-wire. Small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables (these exist with either two or three insulated conductors) terminated in a plug, which is inserted into a fixed receptacle (socket). Larger <b>household</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>equipment</b> and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building. For example, in North American homes a window-mounted self-contained air conditioner unit would be connected to a wall plug, whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired. Larger plug and socket combinations are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents, higher voltages, or three phase electric power. These are often constructed with tougher plastics and possess inherent weather-resistant properties needed in some applications.|$|E
5000|$|Solar {{panels are}} {{generally}} connected together in series, or strings, which allows cabling to be daisy-chained between the panels. In {{the early days}} of solar power the panel connectors were generally screw terminals located under a removable panel, but due to electrical code restrictions this could not be assembled except by a licensed electrician. Non-licensed technicians do have exceptions when dealing with a [...] "convenience receptacle", a plug that was designed specifically for end-users, like those found on common <b>household</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>equipment</b> like desk lamps. To allow roofers and other laborers without a license install panels, a number of such connectors entered the market in the 1990s, with the better known examples being the MC3 connector and Radox connector. Both designs were essentially weatherproofed versions of small phono jacks, with the connector and sockets surrounded by rubberized material to protect them from water. These had the downside that they could be disconnected by pulling on them, which could occur naturally with snow buildup and similar effects. The code in the NEC required such connectors to lock, leading to a market for new designs.|$|E

40|$|Executive summary： Repair in {{the context}} of the {{circular}} economy. The growth in sales of <b>household</b> <b>electrical</b> and electronic <b>equipment</b> in recent years, combined with faster product obsolescence, has resulted in waste <b>electrical</b> and electronic <b>equipment</b> becoming the fastest growing waste stream globally (Baldé, Wang, Kuehr, & Huisman, 2015). Many products develop simple faults which are challenging for the amateur to repair; this quite often results in replacement products being purchased and equipment with small faults being disposed of, or hoarded (Green Alliance, 2015; WRAP, 2011 a). It is within this context that innovative approaches to repair are emerging in the UK, with communitybased organisations focused on enabling consumers to attempt to repair a variety of products including clothing and <b>electrical</b> <b>equipment.</b> Access to information, spare parts and tools is being made available by companies like iFixit, providing consumers with the resources they need to attempt their own repairs. Some consumers, however, lack the skills, knowledge or confidence to attempt repairs, even when the resources are available. This report focuses on the work of the London-based Restart Project, who organise community-based events to assist these consumers. Volunteers acting as "Repair Coaches" at Restart Project repair events offer support and guidance to participants, enabling them to attempt to repair items that they may not have had the knowledge, skills or confidence to undertake previously. This report presents the findings from a survey with 99 participants undertaken at Restart Project events in late 2016. Key points to emerge are: - Many people (45...|$|R
