5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales. Different tales <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> of the corgi's origin: {{some believe that}} the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either the extinct Deutsches Brachen, or the Dachshund breed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Civil War, {{stories of}} the Confederate gold and its vast wealth <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> and retold. One of those stories {{involves}} Alexander. He helped organize search parties in Lincoln and Wilkes counties. Alexander and bank officials soon located some of the gold through Alexander's neighbors in Wilkes county and persuaded them that the money belonged to wives and children of Confederate veterans. With Alexander's help, bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the stolen money. Former Confederate cabinet official Robert Toombs also turned over $5,000 that, intentionally or accidentally, had been thrown into his yard in Washington.|$|E

5|$|Various stories <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> about Bregowine's origins, {{including}} {{that he was}} a nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus. Others say that he owed his elevation to King Æthelbert II of Kent, but all these stories rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop. It does not appear, however, that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors Tatwin and Nothhelm.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As {{can be seen in the}} table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.|$|E
5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared for staff duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that there was too much emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that they could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told.</b>|$|E

5|$|In couples' counseling, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> {{to express}} {{appreciation}} for the things their spouse does for them, be frank about things that make them unhappy, and refer to anything {{they do not want}} to do but must as an opportunity. Their exercising of these three habits is stiff and formal to begin with, and becomes increasingly snarky as the day goes on. Despite this, as Jim leaves the office to return to his business, he confesses to Pam that he thinks the three habits are helping and that they should keep them up. After he leaves, Pam runs after him to give him an umbrella. Jim takes the umbrella, and then embraces his wife, who finds that she lacks the emotional conviction to hug him back. It then flashbacks to their wedding with Michael, Dwight and the gang, she remembers that by marrying Jim she promised to love him in spite of any hardships, and she lovingly embraces him and kisses him.|$|E
5|$|The player character, a boy scout, has {{approached}} a mansion {{looking for work}} during Bob a Job week. The door is answered by an old man wearing horn-rimmed glasses—the owner of the mansion. The man, a mad scientist, expresses surprise that the boy has managed {{to get past the}} guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds. As the boy scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away.

The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E

Lukashenko also fired his air defence chief {{and the head of}} the border guards over the incident.

25|$|Since then, many {{elaborate}} and often conflicting stories <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> regarding Gómez's alleged exploits alongside Jose Gaspar, with some claiming that Gómez was the pirate's cabin boy, others stating {{that he was}} the Floriblancas first mate, and some claiming that he was Gaspar's brother-in-law.

25|$|Artemis punished Agamemnon {{after he}} killed a sacred stag in a sacred grove and boasted {{that he was}} a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was {{preparing}} at Aulis to depart for Troy to begin the Trojan War, Artemis becalmed the winds. The seer Calchas advised Agamemnon {{that the only way to}} appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia. Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer. Various myths <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> about what happened after Artemis took her. Either she was brought to Tauros and led the priests there or became Artemis' immortal companion.|$|E

You <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that this will have an international ramification and will affect the image of Mauritius… this is not your role, Fekna said.

25|$|Reliant was {{dismantled}} by the National Maritime Museum and sectioned {{for display}} in {{pride of place}} in the Museum's Neptune Hall, where it remained on display until 2005.

Further controversy followed as members of the public complained to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that the tug, having been visited by many during its nearly 25 years on display, had been put into 'storage' when this was not the case.|$|E
25|$|Thatcher's {{popularity}} {{once again}} declined in 1989 {{as the economy}} suffered from high interest rates imposed to stop an unsustainable boom. She blamed her Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, who had been following an economic policy which was a preparation for monetary union; Thatcher claimed not to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> of this and did not approve. At the Madrid European summit, Lawson and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe forced Thatcher to agree {{the circumstances under which}} she would join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a preparation for monetary union. Thatcher took revenge on both by demoting Howe, and by listening more to her adviser Sir Alan Walters on economic matters. Lawson resigned that October, feeling that Thatcher had undermined him.|$|E
