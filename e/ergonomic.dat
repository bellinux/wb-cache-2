5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more <b>ergonomic</b> than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E
5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7Ã—28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive <b>ergonomic</b> research. The weapon is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E

5|$|The LS 400 {{was praised}} for its quietness, {{well-appointed}} and <b>ergonomic</b> interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy and value. However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models. It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E
25|$|Again, {{some claim}} that pro-active {{ways to reduce}} stress on the wrists, which alleviates wrist pain and strain, involve {{adopting}} a more <b>ergonomic</b> work and life environment. For example, some have claimed that switching from a QWERTY computer keyboard layout to a more optimised <b>ergonomic</b> layout such as Dvorak was commonly cited as beneficial in early CTS studies, however some meta-analyses of these studies claim that the evidence that they present is limited.|$|E
25|$|The {{software}} tools typically calculate biomechanical properties including individual muscle forces, joint forces and moments. Most of these tools employ standard <b>ergonomic</b> evaluation {{methods such as}} the NIOSH lifting equation and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). Some simulations also analyze physiological measures including metabolism, energy expenditure, and fatigue limits Cycle time studies, design and process validation, user comfort, reachability, and line of sight are other human-factors that may be examined in <b>ergonomic</b> simulation packages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ergonomic</b> {{simulation}} {{involves the}} analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of ergonomics is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments. <b>Ergonomic</b> simulation utilizes an anthropometric virtual representation of the human, commonly referenced as a mannequin or Digital Human Models (DHMs), to mimic the postures, mechanical loads, and performance of a human operator in a simulated environment such as an airplane, automobile, or manufacturing facility. DHMs are recognized as evolving and valuable tool for performing proactive ergonomics analysis and design. The simulations employ 3D-graphics and physics-based models to animate the virtual humans. Ergonomics software uses inverse kinematics (IK) capability for posing the DHMs. Several <b>ergonomic</b> simulation tools have been developed including Jack, SAFEWORK, RAMSIS, and SAMMIE.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the release}} of the Wii console, many aesthetic, <b>ergonomic,</b> and {{functional}} accessories have been developed for the Wii Remote by third parties.|$|E

25|$|Factors of a motorcycle's <b>ergonomic</b> {{geometry}} {{that determine}} the seating posture include the height, angle {{and location of}} footpegs, seat and handlebars. Factors in a rider's physical geometry that contribute to seating posture include torso, arm, thigh and leg length, and overall rider height.|$|E
25|$|Handheld <b>ergonomic</b> {{keyboards}} {{are designed}} to be held like a game controller, and can be used as such, instead of laid out flat on top of a table surface. Typically handheld keyboards hold all the alphanumeric keys and symbols that a standard keyboard would have, yet only be accessed by pressing two sets of keys at once; one acting as a function key similar to a 'Shift' key that would allow for capital letters on a standard keyboard. Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to lean back on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer. Some variations of handheld <b>ergonomic</b> keyboards also include a trackball mouse that allow mouse movement and typing included in one handheld device.|$|E
25|$|An <b>ergonomic</b> {{feature of}} the Wang PC was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that {{attached}} {{to the side of}} the desk and held the rather large computer box.
