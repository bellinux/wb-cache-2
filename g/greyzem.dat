40|$|Burning Vegetation {{produces}} partly charred {{plant material}} which subsequently {{could contribute to}} the highly refractory proportion of soil organic matter. The presence of charred organic carbon (COC) was investigated in 17 horizons originating from nine soils from Germany and the Netherlands using a suite of complementary methods (high-energy ultraviolet photo-oxidation, scanning electron microscopy, solid-state C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance, lignin analysis by CuO oxidation). Charred organic carbon could not be detected in the A horizons of an Alisol and a Gleysol, but it contributed up to 45 % of the organic carbon and up to about 8 g kg(- 1) of the soil {{in a range of}} grey to black soils (Cambisol, Luvisol, Phaeozem, Chernozem and <b>Greyzem).</b> All these soils have chernozemic soil properties (dark colour, A-C profile, high base saturation, bioturbation). A 10 -km colour sequence of four chernozemic soils, which were very similar in chemical and physical properties, showed a strong relation between colour and the content of COG. This suggests that the COC affects mainly soil colour in the sequence studied. Finely divided COC seems to be a major constituent of many chernozemic soils in Germany. These results suggest that besides climate, vegetation and bioturbation, fire has {{played an important role in}} the pedogenesis of chernozemic soils. [References: 37...|$|E
5000|$|Obukhiv has a dry sub-humid (0.5 - 0.65 p/pet) climate. The {{land area}} is not cultivated, {{most of the}} natural {{vegetation}} is still intact. The landscape is mostly covered with mosaic vegetation/croplands. The climate is classified as a humid continental (humid with severe winter, no dry season with a cool temperate moist forest bio-zone [...] The soil in the area is high in chernozems, phaeozems, <b>greyzems</b> (ch), dark colored, deep soils in organic matter, calcareous lower in profile, also typical of grass steppe/prairie.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} pedochronocatenas which include soils of archaeological sites is a {{reliable}} approach to reconstruct environmental changes {{since the time}} of the settlements existence. The studied pedochronocatenas include: 1) soils buried under ancient earth ramparts, 2) soils formed on the surface of these ramparts, and 3) natural undisturbed soils located close to the ramparts. The studied sites are located on the plateau between the Prut and Siret rivers (in the Glyboka district of the Chernivtsi region, South-Eastern part of the Ukrainian Carpathians). At present, this area is covered mainly by Haplic <b>Greyzems</b> and Dystric Cambisols under broad-leaved forests.  Pedochronocatenas at two sites have been studied: 1) the Glyboka defensive rampart built during the IX-Xth centuries AD (1100 - 1000 yr BP, 14 C 1040 ± 190, the Early Slavic time) and 2) the Grushivka rampart built as a defence from the Scythians during the Vth century BC (2500 - 2400 BP), but also with the new material deposited on the old rampart during the Early Slavic times. According to archaeologists [3 – 6] the ramparts were built in order to defend those sides of the settlements which were unprotected by natural barriers. Morphological and morphometrical soil analysis, as well as pollen study have been carried out in order to trace pedogenic, vegetational and climatic changes {{since the time of}} the rampart’s construction.  </p...|$|R
