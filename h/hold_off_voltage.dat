40|$|Multi-electrode spark {{switches}} can be {{used for}} switching applications at elevated voltages or for command triggering. Symmetrical field graded electrodes allow the electrical stress across individual gaps to be controlled, thus maximising the <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> <b>voltage</b> and reducing switch pre-fire. The paper considers some aspects of multielectrode switch design and their influence on switching behavior. Non-symmetrical, uni-directional electrode topologies can be employed with advantages over traditional symmetrical design. The choice of working gas and gas pressure can influence switching performance in terms of delay-time and jitter. Transient analysis of switch characteristics has been undertaken in order to understand multi-electrode switching...|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of more powerful high power electromagnetic sources, the transmission of high voltage power particularly between pulsed power systems to huge power rated microwave sources in absence of electrical breakdown and pulse distortion has begun to become a vital issue. A high voltage coaxial type transmission line with 500 kV peak voltage in vacuum is proposed. A novel proposal of configuration bearing a positive angle of 45 o with socket-type filed shaper is being discussed in this paper in a manner to improve surface flashover properties and also to decrease the distortion seen in the pulse shape. This type of transmission line provides high capability of <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> <b>voltage.</b> The electric field distribution of the coaxial geometry with different field shaper configurations and different spacer parameters are also investigated using COMSOL software...|$|E

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Electrical and computer engineering. This research work discusses the effort at the Electrical and computer engineering (ECE) department at the University of Missouri Columbia (UMC) in developing this technology through simulation and experiments with SiC material. Specifically, the rationale for employing extrinsic photoconductivity, the role of compensation mechanisms have been demonstrated, modeled, and analyzed. The device material fabrication methods and package structures developed to date are discussed. The behavior and the response of the two compensated structures have been discussed in terms of recombination time and optical sensitivity. Material characterization showing agreement with the experimental results was based on choosing the right parameters on trap levels and compensation mechanisms. The experimental switching results with both intrinsic and compensated SiC photo switches using sub-band gap photon energy for code calibration and high power PCSS analysis is presented and compared with semiconductor physics models. The methods used to determine the density and recombination cross section of interband dopants is also presented. A method to improve the <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> <b>voltage</b> of the PCSS by many orders of magnitude is proposed. Laser illumination data with the improved design is also presented...|$|E
40|$|A multielectrode device {{housed in}} an {{insulator}} vacuum vessel, the metal vapor vacuum switch has high power capability and can <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> <b>voltages</b> {{up to the}} 100 kilovolt level. Such switches can be electronically triggered and can interrupt or commutate at a zero current crossing. The physics of arc initiation, arc conduction, and interruption are examined, including material considerations; inefficiencies; arc modes; magnetic field effects; passive and forced extinction; and voltage recovery. Heating, electrode lifetime, device configuration, and external circuit configuration are discussed. The metal vapor vacuum switch is compared with SCRs, GTOs, spark gaps, ignitrons, and mechanical breakers...|$|R
40|$|Our capillary-discharge driver CAPEX-U, as {{many other}} pulsed-power devices, {{requires}} very accurate triggering of high-voltage gas switch. Laser-triggered switches offer many advantages over electrical triggered ones in terms of reproducibility, reliability, suitability for multi-gap or multi-channel operation and electrical isolation from the main high-voltage pulse. Results on the simultaneous initiation of four-channel high voltage spark gap by a neodymium dopped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG, λ= 1064 nm) laser are presented. The switch is pressurised with SF 6 and N 2 and <b>holds</b> <b>off</b> <b>voltage</b> about 500 kV at a gap separation of 13 mm. Electrical parameters of the spark channels are obtained from the comparison of experimental and modelling (equivalent circuit) results...|$|R
50|$|The {{drawback}} to using {{water is the}} short length of time it can <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> the <b>voltage,</b> typically in the microsecond to ten microsecond (μs) range. Deionized water is relatively inexpensive and is environmentally safe. These characteristics, along with the high dielectric constant, make water an excellent choice for building large capacitors. If a way can be found to reliably increase the <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> time for a given field strength, {{then there will be}} more applications for water capacitors.|$|R
40|$|Pulsed power gas {{switches}} {{operate under}} extreme conditions <b>holding</b> <b>off</b> <b>voltages</b> at millions of volts and greater, conducting currents at 100 ’s of kiloamps, and can reliably trigger {{with less than}} 10 ns of jitter at optimal operating conditions. However as Martin and Braginskii had noted the impedance of these switches is dynamic and a function of many parameters such as gas pressure, current, {{and the number of}} channels. In systems such as Protogen or Ursa Minor many gas switches are utilized to enable optimal performance and pulse shaping. A challenge with either system is that, if the switches are tightly coupled and one switch triggers early, then the fields on the second switch change dramatically and can move the second switch into a new operating regime that will result in a different dynamic resistance. This paper presents a least squares approach to extracting the Martin and Braginskii switch resistance with field dependent carrier recombination from measured data. I...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} an investigation which had as its major pur-pose {{the development of}} a high-power switch for use in the modulators for the proposed Stanford two-mile linear electron accelerator. It has been found that existing ignitron tubes can be used to switch current pulses of thousands of amperes and several microseconds duration at repetition frequencies of hundreds per second while <b>holding</b> <b>off</b> <b>voltages</b> of tens of kilovolts. The performance of a typical switch is described in detail with regard to: (2) maximum peak current capability, (3) maximum peak power capability, (4) average power capability, (3) pulse-time jitter and anode delay, and (6) effective deionization time. (1) maximum reliable hold-off voltage, Several additional experimental observations are reported here which provide some insight into the pulsed operation of the ignitron and which were used as guideposts in the design of an ignitron specifi-cally for high-power switching purposes.
