5|$|In {{the island}} village of Mandwa, the school teacher Dinanath Chauhan (Chetan Pandit) is highly {{respected}} by the villagers. The {{chief of the}} village, extremely jealous of Dinanath's popularity {{in the eyes of}} citizens, summons his evil son Kancha to destroy Dinanath's image in citizen's eyes. Kancha also has plans to start a drug cartel from Mandwa, knowing that the soil of Mandwa is rich for cultivation of cocaine. When Kancha requests the people to lend their lands to him under the pretext of expanding the salt industry of Mandwa, Dinanath dissuades the villagers from doing so. Knowing this, Kancha decides {{to get rid of the}} school teacher. He ambushes and murders a young girl inside the school, framing Chauhan for the murder. With the support of the villagers, Kancha then kills Chauhan by hanging him to death from a tree which is witnessed by young Vijay Chauhan (Arish Bhiwandiwala), the son of the teacher. Vijay Chauhan along with his pregnant mother Suhasini Chauhan (Zarina Wahab) leaves the village. Destitute, they find shelter in the city of Dongri,Mumbai but Vijay harbours intentions to go back to Mandwa and kill Kancha. While in Mumbai, Vijay's mother delivers a baby girl named Shiksha. Vijay is attracted to Rauf Lala (Rishi Kapoor), a local girl-trafficker and importantly an enemy of Kancha and wants to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> company. He earns his favour by refusing to stand as a witness in court to a crime committed by Lala and joins his gang. Meanwhile, his mother along with his baby sister leave Vijay's side as he kills a corrupt cop at a young age and resorts to violence.|$|E

25|$|On December 30, the Union force {{moved into}} line two miles (threekm) {{northwest}} of Murfreesboro. The two armies were in parallel lines, about four miles (sixkm) long, oriented from southwest to northeast. Bragg's left flank was weak at the start, and Rosecrans could have attacked {{there when he}} arrived and wheeled left, around the flank and directly into the town of Murfreesboro, {{but he did not}} know the full disposition of Bragg's forces because of the skillful screening of the Confederate cavalry during the Union march. In a manner similar to the previous year's First Battle of Bull Run, both commanders devised similar plans for the following day: envelop the enemy's right, <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> rear, and cut him off from his base. Since both plans were the same, the victory would probably go to the side that was able to attack first. Rosecrans ordered his men to be ready to attack after breakfast, but Bragg ordered an attack at dawn.|$|E

25|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished the session 15th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify. The {{second part of the}} qualifying session lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 14th. The final part of the qualifying session determined the positions from first to tenth, deciding the pole position. Cars in the final qualifying session were not allowed to change tyres, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. Rosberg was fastest in all three qualifying sessions, and clinched his tenth pole position of the season, and the 14th of his career, with a time of one minute and 10.023 seconds, surpassing the previous pole lap record set by Rubens Barrichello in the 2004 race by six-tenths of a second. The result meant he became the first winner of the FIA Pole Trophy as Hamilton could not surpass him in the season's one remaining race. He was joined on the grid's front row by Hamilton who recorded a lap 0.033 seconds slower than his teammate and lost time after entering turn ten too quickly, causing him to lose control of his car's rear-end. Massa qualified in third and was delayed by slower traffic on his final timed lap and locked his tyres at the Senna S chicane, forcing him to abort his final attempt. The Brazilian was further hindered when fuel pressure was unable to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> car, shutting down his engine. Bottas also aborted his final qualifying lap after locking his tyres three times and was restricted to fourth.|$|E
500|$|... "JJ" [...] {{was filmed}} in November 2008. Barbieri {{undertook}} various measures to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> character's mindset, including research, creating {{part of the}} set himself, and later destroying it. The episode featured numerous cameo appearances by the series' crew members. [...] "JJ" [...] drew just under one million viewers on its first broadcast and was E4's highest-rated programme of the week. It was received generally well by critics, though the writers' decision for Emily {{to have sex with}} JJ drew criticism from the lesbian community.|$|E
500|$|The gig was {{scheduled}} on July 3, Sunday afternoon. The day before, performances by Ray Charles and singing group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross {{were met with}} crowd rushes. About 300 drunken hipsters made an uproar during Charles' performance caused by poor police security. The policemen attacked with teargas and water hoses. The riots became so out of control that the National Guard was called in at midnight to calm the crowd. [...] When Waters and his band arrived on the scheduled day, they intended to drive back on the next day, until driver James Cotton saw John Lee Hooker standing at a corner, his guitar on his back without a guitar case. Cotton said Hooker should <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> car to get the musicians out of harm's way. At the same time, the city council decided to cancel the concert, but concert promoter George Wein convinced them {{when he said that}} the United States Information Agency (USIA) planned to film the festival to teach American culture in other countries.|$|E

After several other scenes of Carey dressed in the purple gown and white shirt are interspersed, the altar is displayed, where before being ordained by the minister, Carey looks into her ex-lover's eyes once more. She turns to Roberts, and begins running towards Miller, leaving the reception. As the song's climax is reached, Carey and Miller are shown running from the reception, as the guests stand up in awe, and watch the pair leave. Carey, dressed in the white shirt, is shown with growing anticipation, crying to the camera and moving her hands and hair.

500|$|In 2008, Akhtar {{made his}} acting and singing debut {{in a musical}} film titled Rock On!!, for which he wrote the dialogues and also produced. The film was {{directed}} by Abhishek Kapoor. Prachi Desai, Arjun Rampal and Purab Kohli co-starred along with him. As he had been learning guitar ever {{since the start of}} his directing career, he had been well-versed with it and used it for the film. The role played by him was that of Aditya, lead singer of the rock band [...] "Magik". He sang five songs for the soundtrack album. The film was acclaimed by critics and received positive reviews upon release. Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times wrote that the film seemed to be [...] "clearly designed by Farhan Akhar as his own acting debut and he doesn't let himself down. Lending voice to all his songs helps him to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> character with effortless ease. One could certainly overlook the lisp in his dialogue delivery." [...] Manish Gajjar of BBC wrote of his performance: [...] "Director-turned-actor, Farhan Aktar surprises all with his superb, flawless performance, transforming from a hippy-style lead-singer to a subdued, dismal workaholic banker." [...] Akhtar received several accolades for his debut performance. The film, in addition won the National Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. However, it did not create an impact at the box office and {{turned out to be an}} [...] "average" [...] grosser.|$|E

2500|$|Gene Roddenberry told Brent Spiner {{that over}} the course of the series, Data was to become [...] "more and more like a human until the end of the show, when he would be very close, but still not quite there. That was the idea and that's the way that the writers took it." [...] Spiner felt that Data {{exhibited}} the Chaplinesque characteristics of a sad, tragic clown. To <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> role as Data, Spiner used the character of Robby the Robot from the film Forbidden Planet as a role model.|$|E

2500|$|Pupils {{who pass}} are {{required}} to choose up to six secondary schools to which they would be posted by aggregate score. A computer will then allocate slots to each school's intake for the next year. In line with the ideals of meritocracy, all pupils who attempted the PSLE would be [...] "queued" [...] in order of merit, with the places in schools being filled up from the highest scorer to the lowest scorer. Thus the pupil with a higher aggregate score would <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> school of second choice (if he was not accepted into his school of first choice) over a pupil with a lower aggregate score who chose the same school as the first choice. The score of the last pupil who was allocated {{is known as the}} [...] "cut-off score" [...] for the school for that year.|$|E
