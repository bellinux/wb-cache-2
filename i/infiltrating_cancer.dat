Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and all participants provided informed consent. The study included 152 consecutive patients with 173 breast lesions diagnosed on MG or CESM. All MG examinations and consults were conducted in one oncology centre. Non-ionic contrast agent, at a total dose of 1. 5 mL/kg body weight, was injected intravenous. Subsequently, CESM exams were performed with a mammography device, allowing dual-energy acquisitions. The entire procedure was done within the oncology centre. Images from low and high energy exposures were processed together and the combination provided an “iodine ” image which outlined contrast up-take in the breast. Results: MG detected 157 lesions in 150 patients, including 92 <b>infiltrating</b> <b>cancers,</b> 12 non-infiltrating cancers, and 53 benign lesions.

This second report on prospectively diagnosed inherited breast cancer from the European collaborating centres supports the previous conclusions and adds information on genetic heterogeneity and the effect of oophorectomy. Of 249 patients, 20 % had carcinoma in situ (CIS), 54 % had <b>infiltrating</b> <b>cancer</b> without spread (CaNO) and 26 % had cancer with spread (CaN+). Five-year survival was 100 % for CIS, 94 % for CaNO and 72 % for CaN+ (p = 0. 007). Thirty-six patients had BRCA 1 mutations, and 8 had BRCA 2 mutations. Presence of BRCA 1 mutation was associated with <b>infiltrating</b> <b>cancer,</b> high grade and lack of oestrogen receptor (p < 0. 05 for all 3 characteristics). For BRCA 1 mutation carriers, 5 -year survival was 63 % vs. 91 % for noncarriers (p = 0. 04). For CaNO patients, mutation carriers had 75 % S-year disease-free survival vs. 96 % for noncarriers (p = 0. 01).

The "high ridk" group included patients with lesions greater than 1 cm or who had {{greater than or equal to}} 4 nodal metastases or who had macrometastases at Level II or III (apex). In the "intermediate risk" group were patients with <b>infiltrating</b> <b>cancer</b> less than 1 cm or with less than 4 nodal metastases at I only. Immune reactivity was assessed by skin tests, by measurement of absolute lymphocyte count, T and B cells, lymphocyte stimulation by mitogens and a battery of common antigens, serum immunoglobulins and complement levels. There were 134 patients with operable breast cancer and 63 patients with benign breast lesions. The breast cancer patients showed minimal or no impairment of DNCB skin test. Only patients with nodal metastases showed a slight but not significant impairment of DNCB responses (80 % were DNCB positive compared to 90 % in the controls.) The lymphocyte responses to mitogens were normal in the breast cancer patients, but there was a significant depression of lymphocyte responses to certain recall antigens such as Candida albicans and E coli. The absolute lymphocyte count and the T cell counts were normal, but B cells bearing complement receptors were decreased and B cells bearing sufface immunoglobulins were increased in the breast cancer patients. Analysis of immune function according to the pathologic stage of disease "risk of recurrence" categories showed no correlation with skin tests or lymphocyte levels. A striking and paradoxical finding was the demonstration that patients with "low risk" cancer overall had markedly lower responses to the battery of stimulating mitogens and antigens than found in patients with "high risk" or "intermediate risk" disease. Only the lymphocyte responses to PHA showed a significant linear correlation with increasing pathologic stage or "risk of recurrence.

From this data base, 777 patients treated and followed-up at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center were reviewed, and comparisons were made between the following three histologic subgroups: 661 infiltrating ductal (ID), 42 infiltrating ductal plus infiltrating lobular (ID + IL), and 74 infiltrating lobular (IL). RESULTS: Comparisons of the three histologic forms of breast cancer demonstrated the following: 1. At diagnosis tumors with IL components were larger than those with ID components (p < 0. 001); in addition, a greater percentage of IL cancers were T 3 lesions (14. 8 %), compared with ID cancers (4. 5 %). 2. Sizes of IL tumors were underestimated frequently by mammographic examinations when compared with pathologic measurements (p < 0. 001). 3. By comparison to ID tumors, increasing IL tumor size is less likely to be associated with an increased number of metastatic lymph nodes per patient (p = 0. 09). 4. <b>Infiltrating</b> lobular <b>cancers</b> treated by lumpectomy with cytologic surgical margin analysis more often gave false-negative results than did ID cancers (p < 0. 001). 5. <b>Infiltrating</b> lobular <b>cancers</b> treated by lumpectomy required conversion to mastectomy over 2 times more frequently than ID cancers treated by lumpectomy. 6.

This MT-MMP can activate gelatinase A, involved in the degradation of basement membranes. In situ hybridisation revealed MT-MMP transcripts distributed in both tumour and stromal cells in squamous cell lung cancers, whereas these mRNAs were principally detected in stromal cells in close contact to tumour clusters in breast carcinomas and in lung adenocarcinomas. Northern blot analysis showed a parallel expression of MT-MMP and gelatinase A transcripts in both lung and breast cancers.

The possibility that defects in T-cell signal transduction can be reversed, which would potentially permit successful vaccination or adoptive immunotherapy, motivates renewed interest in the field. Summarizing the literature concerning tumor-induced T-cell dysfunction, we focus on the end stage of immune response to human cancer, that of defective cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing function.

Only when we understand early pancreatic neoplasms will {{we be able to}} detect tumors that are curable with surgical resection. Two approaches have helped define incipient pancreatic neoplasia. First, the histologic examination of pancreata has helped identify the most common histologic lesions in pancreatic tissues adjacent to infiltrating carcinomas. The assumption is that some of these lesions represent the precursors to the infiltrating cancers. Second, advances in molecular genetics now make it possible to define the genetic alterations present in small lesions. The demonstration that a suspected precursor lesion and an infiltrating pancreatic carcinoma share the same genetic alterations would help establish that the lesion is indeed a precursor to infiltrating pancreatic carcinoma. A spectrum of intraductal proliferations in the pancreas has been found associated with infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the difference in}} survival after cystectomy between patients presenting with primary muscle infiltrating bladder cancer and patients with progression to muscle infiltration after treatment for initial non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the files of 188 patients who underwent cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma between 1987 and 2005. Two groups were defined: patients presenting with muscle-invasive tumours and those progressing to muscle invasion after initial treatment. This second group was further divided into low-intermediate and high risk according to the EAU grouping for NMIBC. RESULTS: The 5 -year disease specific survival (95 % confidence intervals) for all patients was 50 %(42 - 59 %); 49 %(40 - 60 %) in the primary muscle infiltrating group and 52 %(37 - 74 %) in the progressive group (p = ns). The 5 -year disease specific survival in the progressive group according to EAU risk groups was 75 %(58 - 97 %) for the initially diagnosed low-intermediate risk tumours and 35 %(17 - 71 %) for the initially diagnosed high-risk tumours (p = 0. 015). The percentage of patients with non-locally confined tumours (pT 3 / 4 -N 0 //any pT-N+) was 31 %// 45 % and 24 %// 46 % in the primary muscle infiltrating and progressive group, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), an {{attenuated}} strain of tuberculous bacillus, {{is the source}} of vaccines providing unclear and variable protection against tuberculosis (TB) and cancer. Thermostable macromolecular antigens (TMAs) are major mycobacterial complexes immunodominant in disease. A 60 (TMA complex of BCG) protects mice against TB development, via T lymphocyte (TL) -mediated macrophage (Mphi) activation, halting intracellular mycobacterial replication. In most A 60 -primed mice, cytolytic TLs and Mphi <b>infiltrate</b> <b>cancer</b> tissue, resulting in 80 - 100 % rejection. Adoptive TL transfer is indispensable for Mphi-dependent tumour cell inactivation via oxygen and nitrogen radicals. Neoplasm development induces immune anergy with depletion ofA 60 -specific TL and activated Mphi. A 60 protects mice against TB and cancer by inducing the synthesis of three lymphokines: interleukin 2 (IL- 2), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Tumour cells prevent A 60 -dependent synthesis of these lymphokines in vivo and in vitro.

In the cancer research field, the association of inflammatory infiltration with cancer has been known histologically for a long time. Recent studies have indicated that macrophages and other immune cells <b>infiltrate</b> <b>cancer</b> tissues, expressing cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, thereby constructing an inflammatory microenvironment. In such a microenvironment, nuclear factor (NF) -κB is activated, which contributes to the growth and survival of cancer cells. Moreover, it has also been shown that NF-κB activation is associated with the acquisition of stem cell properties by cancer cells. Using inflammation-associated gastric cancer model mice (Gan mice), we have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α signaling is activated in the inflammatory microenvironment and plays a tumor-promoting role by inducing Noxo 1 in tumor cells. Taken together, these results indicate that regulation of chronic inflammation in tumor tissues would be an effective preventive and/or therapeutic strategy against cancer development and malignant progression. © 2015, Springer Japan.

In particular, the microlocalization, polarization and prognostic impact of TAM {{in the immediate}} environment of invading CRC cells {{has not yet been}} established. To address this clinically relevant question, intraepithelial (iCD 68) and stromal macrophages (sCD 68), M 1 -macrophages (iNOS), M 2 -macrophages (CD 163), cytokeratin-positive cancer cells (tumor buds) and expression of the anti-phagocytic marker CD 47 were investigated in primary tumors of 205 well-characterized CRC patients. Cell-to-cell contacts between tumor buds and TAM were detected using high-resolution digital scans. The composition of the tumor microenvironment was analyzed with clinicopathological and molecular features. High CD 68 counts predicted long term overall survival independent of microlocalization (iCD 68 p= 0. 0016; sCD 68 p= 0. 03), pT, pN, pM and post-operative therapy. CD 68 infiltration correlated with significantly less tumor budding (iCD 68 p= 0. 0066; sCD 68 p= 0. 0091) and absence of lymph node metastasis (sCD 68 p= 0. 0286). Cell-to-cell contact of sCD 68 and invading cancer cells was frequent and ameliorated the detrimental prognostic effect of the tumor budding phenotype. Subgroup analysis identified long-term survival with CD 47 loss and predominance of CD 163 (+) M 2 macrophages (p = 0. 0366). CD 163 (+) macrophages represented 40 % of the total population, and positively correlated with total CD 68 macrophage numbers (r[CD 68 /CD 163] = 0. 32; p = 0. 0001). Strong CD 163 infiltration predicted lower tumor grade (p = 0. 0026) and less lymph node metastasis (p = 0. 0056). This study provides direct morphological evidence of an interaction between TAM and <b>infiltrating</b> <b>cancer</b> cells. The prognostic impact of TAM is modulated by phenotype, microlocalization and the expression of anti-phagocytic markers in CRC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background S 100 A 9 was {{originally}} discovered {{as a factor}} secreted by inflammatory cells. Recently, S 100 A 9 {{was found to be}} associated with several human malignancies. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate S 100 A 9 expression in gastric cancer and explore its role in cancer progression. Methods S 100 A 9 expression in gastric tissue samples from 177 gastric cancer patients was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The expression of its dimerization partner S 100 A 8 and the S 100 A 8 /A 9 heterodimer were also assessed by the same method. The effect of exogenous S 100 A 9 on motility of gastric cancer cells AGS and BGC- 823 was then investigated. Results S 100 A 9 was specifically expressed by inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils in human gastric cancer and gastritis tissues. Statistical analysis showed that a high S 100 A 9 cell count (>[*]=[*] 200) per 200 x magnification microscopic field in cancer tissues was predictive of early stage gastric cancer. High S 100 A 9 -positive cell count was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P [*]=[*] 0. 009) and tumor invasion (P [*]=[*] 0. 011). S 100 A 9 was identified as an independent prognostic predictor of overall survival of patients with gastric cancer (P [*]=[*] 0. 04). Patients with high S 100 A 9 cell count were with favorable prognosis (P [*]=[*] 0. 021). Further investigation found that S 100 A 8 distribution in human gastric cancer tissues was similar to S 100 A 9. However, the number of S 100 A 8 -positive cells did not positively correlate with patient survival. The inflammatory cells <b>infiltrating</b> <b>cancer</b> were S 100 A 8 /A 9 negative, while those in gastritis were positive. Furthermore, exogenous S 100 A 9 protein inhibited migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Conclusions Our results suggested S 100 A 9 -positive inflammatory cells in gastric cancer tissues are associated with early stage of gastric cancer and good prognosis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Immune cells {{actively}} {{take part}} to the tumor microenvironment, where they play several roles in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. Among the tumor-infiltrating immune cells, myeloid cells represent a "double-edged sword" for cancer. Indeed, they can both promote or inhibit cancer initiation and progression. Neutrophils have long been viewed as short-lived cells, pivotal {{for the elimination of}} extracellular pathogens, with a limited role in the orchestration of the immune response. However, recent lines of evidence have challenged this limited point of view, revealing a number of unexpected functions for neutrophils in several pathological contexts. Indeed, neutrophils were also found among inflammatory cells <b>infiltrating</b> <b>cancer</b> tissues, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). Today, the functional roles of neutrophils in cancer and the association between neutrophil infiltration, clinicopathological features and outcome of CRC patients remain to be clarified. Here, we found that neutrophils are recruited within CRC tissues through a spatiotemporal dynamism. Infiltration of neutrophils increased from stage I to stage III CRC and decreased at stage IV. In a large cohort of stage III CRC, neutrophil infiltration was preferentially found in the intratumoral compartment compared with the invasive margin. Higher density of neutrophils within the tumor was found to be an independent prognostic factor for better patients' outcome (n= 128, Stage I-Stage IV CRC) and a predictive factor for 5 -FluoroUracyle chemotherapy response in Stage III CRC patients (n= 178). Moreover, CRC cell lines released soluble factors, which promoted neutrophil chemotaxis and survival. In turn, neutrophils displayed a cytostatic activity towards CRC cell lines. Our data suggest that neutrophils are critical components of antitumor immunity and that neutrophil infiltration within tumors could be a useful predictive marker to identify patients with cancer who would likely benefit from chemotherapy. Therefore, neutrophils have to be considered as central participants in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses, with important roles in the resolution or exacerbation of various pathologies, including cancer...|$|E
40|$|Male {{breast cancer}} is an {{uncommon}} disease and accounts for only 0. 7 % of all breast cancer diagnoses. The incidence of male breast cancer increases with advancing patient age, climbing steadily until a plateau is reached around age 80 year. Hormonal factors have been implicated {{in the development of}} this disease but still the etiology of this rare entity is unclear. Similar to that of female breast <b>cancer</b> <b>infiltrating</b> ductal <b>cancer</b> is the most common tumor type reported. Since the male breast does not have lobules and acini, lobular carcinoma is seen infrequently. Male breast cancer patients presents as painless subareolar lump, nipple retraction, and bleed-ing from the nipple. Diagnostic and treatment strategies for the management of carcinoma of male breast are similar as in females. We present a rare case of carcinoma male breast.

40|$|In 500 {{consecutive}} modified radical mastectomies (MRM) {{performed for}} clinically early (T 1 N 0) breast carcinomas between 1975 and 1982, the interpectoral lymph nodes (IPN) were separately sampled {{at the end}} of the operative procedure. Among the patients consistently sampled (1979 - 1982), lymph nodes were found in 73 %. Interpectoral lymph node metastases were found in 2. 6 % of all patients, 3 % of patients with <b>infiltrating</b> <b>cancers,</b> and 4 % of patients sampled. A total of 8. 2 % of axillary node positive and 0. 5 % of axillary node negative patients had IPN disease. Among the 13 patients with positive IPN, there were no differences in tumor size or location from the entire group. The two patients whose only nodal metastases were to the IPN are currently disease-free without having received systemic adjuvant therapy. These data suggest that for early breast cancers treated by MRM, routine excision of the IPN is of potential therapeutic or prognostic benefit in very few cases. However, as MRM is increasingly applied to patients with more locally advanced disease (T 2 - 3, N 1 b-N 2), metastases in unexcised IPN may become a more significant source of local or systemic treatment failure...|$|R
