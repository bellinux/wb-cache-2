2500|$|In 1912 Hubbell rotated his tandem pins by 90 {{degrees to}} arrive at the {{parallel}} <b>flat</b> <b>pin</b> configuration still widely used today (NEMA 1-15). Despite Hubbel's objections, other manufacturers adopted the Hubbell pattern and by 1915 the use of Hubbell's configuration was widespread. In 1919 Hubbell unsuccessfully attempted to get an injunction to prevent other manufacturers from making receptacles and plugs to the dimensions used by Hubbell.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the lead}} {{set by the}} lamp {{manufacturers}} in standardising lamp bases, a conference of the plug and receptacle manufacturers, including Hubbell, was arranged {{with a view to}} agreeing a standard configuration. It was a time of great expansion in the use of electrical appliances such as fans, heaters, and cookers, as well as portable devices such as hair curlers and irons, and the public wanted interchangeability. Hubbell's parallel pin configuration was preferred, but Hubbell [...] "rebelled against standardization", and refused to agree, asserting that it had common law rights in the dimensions of its line. The other conference members pressed on regardless, and agreed to standardize on Hubbell's parallel <b>flat</b> <b>pin</b> configuration and dimensions. Hubbell's court action only served to confirm the legality of their activities, to the great benefit of the US public.|$|E
2500|$|The {{report of}} the court {{proceedings}} includes {{a comprehensive review of}} the development of the art in the US prior to 1919, based on evidence presented to the Court. Separable plugs had been available {{for more than a decade}} prior to Hubbell's 1904 design. [...] The earliest presented to the court was the [...] "Weston", (US patent 480,900 issued August 16, 1892, for which Hubbell had taken out a licence), another (unidentified) type following in 1897. Plugs per se with parallel flat pins, such as the [...] "Fort Wayne" [...] design were in common use by 1886, and flush receptacles, such as the [...] "Bryant Electrical Company" [...] design, by 1902. Hubbell had introduced its own parallel <b>flat</b> <b>pin</b> configuration in 1912. In 1915 there were [...] "...from 15 to 20 different types of blades and from 15 to 30 different types of receptacles. The line of each was not interchangeable with competing lines. ..." [...] The existence of both [...] "tandem" [...] and parallel pin configurations had led to the introduction in 1914 of some receptacles having both configurations of slots and others having [...] "T" [...] slots. By 1915, Hubbell had sold about 13 million receptacles and plug bases/caps with tandem slots/pins, and about 1.25 million with parallel slots/pins, most of which were then still in active use, meaning that Hubbell's configurations were by far the most widely used.|$|E
25|$|The plug {{defined in}} SI 32 (IS16A-R) is used only in Israel {{and in the}} territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. There are two versions: an older one with <b>flat</b> <b>pins,</b> and a newer one with round pins.|$|R
50|$|The 2-pin plugs (with round or <b>flat</b> <b>pins)</b> in {{mainland}} China {{are compatible with}} the British converter plugs sold in Hong Kong. For shavers and electric toothbrushes that take less than 1A of current, British shaver adaptors can be also used.|$|R
50|$|The 600 series plug has up {{to three}} <b>flat</b> <b>pins</b> plus a non-conducting spigot. Each pin carries up to two {{conductors}} by means of two contacts, {{one on each side}} of the pin. The pin bodies are of non-conductive material.|$|R
2500|$|Several early American {{electrical}} {{plug and socket}} arrangements were invented by Harvey Hubbell. On 26 February 1903 he filed two patent applications featuring 2-pin plugs and adaptors for using his plugs with existing designs of lamp sockets and wall receptacles. Hubbell's first plug design had two round pins which differed from those already in use in Europe in that {{the tips of the}} pins had annular detents similar to those of present-day jack plugs to positively retain a plug in its socket. [...] In one patent, US 774,250 a plug was used with a socket which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs). In the other patent US 776,326 [...] the same type of plug was used with various three-way adaptors that could be connected to lampholders or [...] "a receptacle of any ordinary type". Figures 2 and 4 of this patent show an adaptor plugged into {{what appears to be a}} [...] "Chapman" [...] receptacle. Hubbell evidently soon found the round pin design unsatisfactory as a subsequent patent US 774,251 filed on May 27, 1904 shows lampholder adaptors similar to those of his first patent for use with plugs having coplanar (tandem) flat pins. Hubbell's catalogue of 1906 includes various three-way adaptors similar to those shown in the US 776,326 patent, but modified for use with the coplanar <b>flat</b> <b>pin</b> plugs. The Chapman receptacle must have been in general use at the time, as it was the only type of non-lampholder receptacle for which adaptors were supplied. The 1906 catalogue says of the Chapman adaptor: [...] "The device avoids fastening the cords together as is necessary with the ordinary Chapman plug when used for more than one purpose." [...] This suggests that Hubbell's original invention was prompted by his observation of the problem that arose with the use of this sort of receptacle and plug. Gradually wall sockets were developed to supplement those that screwed into lampholders.|$|E

Pre-1989 sockets which accept only old-style plugs have become very rare in Israel.|$|R
50|$|Rack Pins - Rack pins, {{also called}} Open Edition (OE) or core pins, are pins {{introduced}} and sold {{until they are}} discontinued or retired. These pins are re-ordered for up to several consecutive years. The starting retail price for these pins is typically $6.95 (for a <b>flat</b> <b>pin).</b> Depending upon the number of features on the pin (such as pin-on-pin), the retail price will increase to either $8.95 or $10.95. Some OE pins have a high secondary value, such as the Soda Pop Series pins which each go in the $20 range.|$|E
5000|$|The Electrical Installations Committee {{which was}} convened in 1942 {{as part of}} the Post War Building Studies {{programme}} determined, amongst other things, that the ring final circuit offered a more efficient and lower cost system which would safely support a greater number of sockets. [...] The scheme was specified to use 13 A socket-outlets and fused plugs, several designs for the plugs and sockets were considered. The design chosen as the British Standard was the <b>flat</b> <b>pin</b> system now known as BS 1363. Other designs of 13 A fused plugs and socket-outlets, notably the Wylex and Dorman & Smith systems, which did not conform to the chosen standard were used into the 1950s, but by the 1960s BS 1363 had become the single standard for new installations.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to digital, some DVI connectors also have pins that pass an analog signal, {{which can be}} used to connect an analog monitor. The analog pins are the four that surround the flat blade on a DVI-I or DVI-A connector. A VGA monitor, for example, can be connected to a video source with DVI-I {{through the use of a}} passive adapter. Since the analog pins are directly compatible with VGA signaling, passive adapters are simple and cheap to produce, providing a cost-effective solution to support VGA on DVI. The long <b>flat</b> <b>pin</b> on a DVI-I connector is wider than the same pin on a DVI-D connector, so even if the four analog pins were manually removed, it still wouldn't be possible to connect a male DVI-I to a female DVI-D. It is possible, however, to join a male DVI-D connector with a female DVI-I connector.|$|E
5000|$|The Danish {{telephone}} plug is the special flat round {{telephone plug}} used in Denmark for POTS (analog) telephone lines and some [...] "raw copper" [...] (for ADSL etc.) telephone lines. The plug has 3 <b>flat</b> <b>pins</b> arranged {{at right angles}} to each other. This plug is used in few if any other places in the world, and most equipment now made uses the US/International RJ11 socket on the device end and includes either a cable with the Danish Telephone Plug at the wall end, or a standard RJ11 to RJ11 cable with a bundled Telephone Adapter.|$|R
5000|$|The plug {{pictured on}} the left, {{as used in}} Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and many Pacific Island countries, has two <b>flat</b> <b>pins</b> forming an {{inverted}} V-shape plus a vertical earthing <b>pin.</b> These <b>flat</b> blades measure 6.35 by 1.6 mm with the Active and Neutral pins 17.35 mm long set 30° to the vertical and the vertical Earth pin being 20 mm in length. [...] The pins are arranged at 120° angles around a common midpoint, with the Active and Neutral centred 7.92 mm from the midpoint, and the Earth pin centred 10.31 mm away.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} behind the {{adoption}} of that particular design {{was that it was}} cheap to make; the <b>flat</b> <b>pins</b> could be easily stamped out of sheet brass, in contrast to round pins or thicker rectangular ones used in other countries. This was also a consideration when the Chinese authorities officially adopted the design in relatively recent times, despite the considerable inroads the British plug had made, due to its use in Hong Kong. The Chinese socket is normally mounted with the earth pin at the top. This is considered to offer some protection should a conductive object fall between the plug and the socket ...|$|R
50|$|A polarised two-pin {{unshielded}} connector, {{designed for}} connecting a loudspeaker to a power amplifier (or other device; {{many of the}} earlier shoebox style tape recorders used them), {{is known as the}} DIN 41529 loudspeaker connector. It exists as a panel-mounting female version, and line-mounted male and female versions. The male version has a central <b>flat</b> <b>pin,</b> and circular pin mounted off-centre. The circular pin is connected to the positive line (red) while the spade is connected to the negative line (black). The panel-mounting female version is available with or without an auxiliary contact that disconnects the internal speaker of the device if an external speaker connector is inserted. Most common is a three-hole female connector with one circular hole {{on either side of the}} spade hole, one of them with an aux contact and one without, which provides the option to leave the internal speaker connected by inserting the plug twisted by 180°.|$|E
50|$|Badges {{were made}} of pressed steel, brass and zinc. All {{versions}} of the Wound Badge were worn on the lower left breast of the uniform or tunic. The badge was worn below all other awards on the left. It ranked lower than combat badges. There were 24 approved manufacturers of the Wound Badge. At first, the Wound Badge in Black was stamped from sheet brass, painted semi-matte black with a hollow reverse pin back attachment or of solid construction. From 1942, steel was {{used to make the}} badges. The Wound Badge in silver was made (before 1942) from silver-plated brass, and (after 1942) from lacquered zinc, and had a solid reverse with either a needle pin or a broad <b>flat</b> <b>pin</b> bar. The Wound Badge in Gold was a gilded version of the Wound Badge in Silver. In 1957, a revised version of the Wound Badge was authorised for wear; however, the previous type could still be worn if the swastika were removed (for example by grinding).|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} {{procedure is}} proposed, which basically refers to tribological variables {{commonly used in}} engineering screen tests and in principle allows extended use of experimental wear data from the ball on disc standard system when the reference configuration has different geometry (e. g. <b>flat</b> <b>pin</b> on disc pairs) or nominal sliding conditions. The method is approximated and has been conceived to simplify comparative analysis of wear behaviour, in particular at equal nominal pressure. Expressing the ratio of wear constants {{on the basis of}} geometrical experimental variables for sphere and disc, it also aims to reduce time consumption in profilometry sessions and to split real-time linear wear curves for mating members from the overall approach pattern.

40|$|Composites of nanometer-sized silica (SiO 2) filler {{incorporated}} in nylon- 6 polymer were prepared by compression molding.

The morphologies of the composites {{as well as}} of the wear track were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The addition of 2 wt % SiO 2 resulted in a friction reduction (µ) from 0. 5 to 0. 18 when compared with neat nylon- 6. This low silica loading led to a reduction in wear rate by a factor of 140, whereas the influence of higher silica loadings was less pronounced. The smooth morphology obtained after the wear test indicated the negligible contribution to friction of the pin to the nanocomposite...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{concerning a}} mechanism of fluid film lubrication of highly stressed contacts, controlled {{by both the}} initial wear and the elastic deformation of surfaces, is presented. This mechanism, designated non-conventional elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication, is {{likely to occur in}} point and line contacts with one surface at rest or in other types of contacts if the pressure is extremely high. The mechanism is similar to standard EHD lubrication, the main difference being due to the shape of the surfaces close to the contact zone (non-hertzian), which determines the actual value of film thickness and which may be modified by wear. The friction coefficient is of the same magnitude as in EHD lubrication and an excellent surface finish is achieved. Non-conventional EHD lubrication is sometimes observed in most oiltesting machines, so that care has to be taken when screening oil performance with such machines because the oil viscosity and the pressure coefficients may considerably influence test results.
