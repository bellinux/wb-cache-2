40|$|Fiscal {{rules are}} being {{increasingly}} used by both emerging and developed economies. This paper analyzes two alternative fiscal policy rules {{in terms of}} their impact on debt sustainability: a rule that fixes the ratio of primary surplus to GDP ("fixed surplus rule") and one that sets the primary surplus as a linear function of debt to GDP ratio ("variable surplus rule"). A simple debt dynamics equation, incorporating real shocks, is constructed, and the probability of exceeding the critical debt level is simulated using Monte Carlo techniques. The results show that the variable surplus rule performs better than the simple fixed surplus rule, by reducing debt sustainability concerns and the necessary medium-term primary surplus. This result hinges on the government''s ability to make a credible commitment to the variable surplus rule in the medium run.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} and analyzes crisis-related changes in government debt issuance {{practices in the}} 16 euro zone countries and Denmark. Using a newly constructed database on primary market debt issuance during 2007 - 09, we find evidence of a shift away from pre-crisis standards of best funding practices competitive auctions of debt instruments with a fixed coupon, long maturity and local currency denomination (DLTF). Exploiting the cross-country panel data dimension of the data, we conclude that the crisis and related changes in the macroeconomic environment and investor sentiment can account for {{a significant proportion of}} the deviation. The negative effect of the crisis on DLTF debt issuance was especially pronounced in high deficit and high debt euro area countries, and has forced governments to assume additional risk.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new index which provides early warning signals of fiscal sustainability problems for advanced and emerging economies. Unlike previous studies, the index assesses {{the determinants of}} fiscal stress periods, covering public debt default as well as near-default events. The fiscal stress index depends on a parsimonious set of fiscal indicators, aggregated using the approach proposed by Kaminsky, Lizondo and Reinhart (1998). The index is {{used to assess the}} build up of fiscal stress over time since the mid- 1990 s in advanced and emering economies. Fiscal stress has increased recently to record-high levels in advanced countries, reflecting raising solvency risks and financing needs. In emerging economies, risks are lower than in mature economies owing to sounder fiscal fundamentals, but fiscal stress remains higher than before the crisis.

40|$|The {{effects of}} debt relief on {{incentives}} to accumulate debt, consume, and invest {{are an important}} concern for donors and recipients. Using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of a small open economy with a minimum consumption requirement and an endogenous relief probability, we show that excessive debt accumulation is consistent with an anticipation of a future debt relief. Simulations of the calibrated model using 1982 - 2006 Ugandan data suggest that debt-relief episodes {{are likely to have}} only a temporary impact on the level of debt in low-income countries, while being associated with more consumption and less invesment. The long-run debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to be about twice as high with debt relief than without it.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the role of}} domestic debt markets in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) based on a new dataset covering 27 SSA countries during the 20 -year period 1980 - 2000. The study finds that domestic debt markets in these countries are generally small, highly short-term in nature, and often have a narrow investor base. Domestic interest payments present a significant burden to the budget, despite much smaller domestic than foreign indebtedness. The use of domestic debt is also found to have significantly crowded out private sector lending. Finally, the study identifies {{significant differences between the}} size, cost, and maturity structure of domestic debt markets in HIPCs and non-HIPCs.
