To do this, taxpayers will need to integrate their accounts with software in some way. HMRC's 2017 consultation response stated that spreadsheets can be used if they can meet with HMRC’s technical requirements. However, many taxpayers will use more comprehensive accounting software to avoid the complications of linking a spreadsheet to their <b>digital</b> <b>tax</b> account.|$|E

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThe {{digital economy}} has {{over the past}} years {{developed}} at a dramatic pace, generating substantial revenues for entities and individuals trading on this platform. This has fuelled vast interest and debate into whether such activity should be taxed. After the turn of the millennium, a lot of research on taxing the digital economy was done, but this was mostly in America and Europe. In South Africa, very little research has been done, most of which was conducted before the enactment of new pieces of legislation regulating <b>digital</b> <b>tax.</b> This study analyses how the South African <b>digital</b> <b>tax</b> framework interlinks with global tax principles. More specifically, the study seeks to clarify the legal and economic uncertainties surrounding the taxation of e-trade. The pertinent issues around this area will then be analysed in depth and potential solutions furnished. The Taxation Laws Amendment Act 21 of 2013 changed the position in South Africa in respect of the supply of electronic services. The definition of ‘enterprise’ was extended to include the supply of electronic services by a person or business outside South Africa, to a recipient in South Africa. Therefore, foreign enterprises could become liable to register as vendors in terms of s 23 of the Act, and become subject to VAT in terms of s 7 (1) (a) of the Value Added Tax Act 89 of 1991. Amongst other implications, the new regulations effectively shift the compliance burden from the local recipient to the foreign supplier in terms of the listed electronic services {{while at the same time}} creating compliance costs for the foreign supplier. The study builds on models adopted by other countries on the international scene. The United States and European countries have taken different paths on the matter compared to the one adopted by South Africa. The United States imposed a temporary moratorium on states levying certain taxes on Internet sales, while, on the other hand, the European Union levied different <b>digital</b> <b>tax</b> standards, which depend on whether or not the supplier is based in Europe. The research concludes that the majority of the problems surrounding the taxation of e-trade are not of a sovereign nature but rather of a multi-jurisdictional nature. The study recommends that at a global level, there is a need for the creation of: new e-tax rules in the WTO regime; a central registration portal; a third party collection and payment mechanism, an imbedded audit system in the portal; as well as built-in privacy mechanisms in order cure the existing shortcomings in taxing Internet transactions. For South Africa, the study suggests that the National Treasury create a timeline for the creation of a White Paper on the taxation of electronic commerce and the subsequent creation of more comprehensive Electronic Service Regulations within a reasonable period thereafter...|$|E
40|$|This polygon shapefile layer {{represents}} the tax and lot information for all parcels in Brooklyn. The data is a compilation from various government agencies throughout the City of New York. The underlying geography {{is derived from}} the Tax Lot Polygon feature class {{which is part of the}} Department of Finance's <b>Digital</b> <b>Tax</b> Map (DTM). The tax lots have been clipped to the shoreline, as defined by NYCMap planimetric features. The attribute information is from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO data. The attribute data pertains to tax lot and building characteristics and geographic, political and administrative information for each tax lot in New York City. The Tax Lot Polygon feature class and PLUTO are derived from different sources. As a result, some PLUTO records did not have a corresponding tax lot in the Tax Lot polygon feature class at the time of release. These records are included in a separate non-geographic PLUTO Only DBase (. dbf) table (available on the Bytes of the Big Apple website). There are a number of reasons why there can be a tax lot in PLUTO that does not match the DTM; the most common reason is that the various source files are maintained by different departments and divisions with varying update cycles and criteria for adding and removing records. The attribute definitions for the PLUTO Only table are the same as those for MapPLUTO. DCP Mapping Lots includes some features that are not on the tax maps. They have been added by DCP for cartographic purposes. They include street center 'malls', traffic islands and some built streets through parks. These features have very few associated attributes.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, Nesta and other {{strategic}} organisations have published research and delivered a range of resources to directly support hyperlocal media publishers to innovate their service. While there are {{a growing number of}} examples of innovative and dynamic practice, and an increasing relevance of hyperlocal media due to the shrinking footprint of traditional local print and broadcast media, our research highlights key challenges concerning sustainability (financial as well as human resource), growth and ‘findability’. As the sector continues to grow and becomes more diverse - in regards to the types of businesses and services that are producing content, the type of content being produced, the means through which content is being distributed {{and the ways in which}} local audiences are accessing and engaging with content - a more robust examination of how publishers are monetising their services is necessary. Therefore, this study undertakes an analysis of current and emerging revenue streams and the digital technologies facilitating these – the findings of which will help publishers implement positive changes to their own service. This research is aimed at online-first (but not necessarily online-exclusive) hyperlocal practitioners in the UK and in Europe, for them to use the findings and guidance to improve their ability to provide news and information to their local communities for the long term.

40|$|M. Com. (South African and International Taxation) The {{concept of}} {{permanent}} establishment (PE) {{is a fundamental}} concept in international tax law, as it establishes the right to tax business profits of non-resident entities {{in the country where}} business activities are carried out. This study was motivated by the challenges governments and business entities face in the allocation of taxing rights in the digital economy. This study considers the history and the meaning of the current Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) permanent establishment concept, and analyses its effectiveness in the digital economy. The digital economy and the event of e-commerce have changed the way in which business transactions are conducted and how multinational entities are structured. The digital economy has created different means of value creation for business entities, and new challenges are being confronted internationally regarding the taxation of such value created. This directly affects revenue collection by governments globally. A largely qualitative approach was undertaken in conducting the research. This included a detailed reading on the topic to support any inferences and conclusions. This study finds that the current OECD concept of permanent establishment is no longer an effective concept in the current digital economy. The event of e-commerce is challenging the core elements of “physical presence” and “fixed place of business”. Large multinational entities have low effective tax rates on their profits, and governments are being deprived of tax revenue that would normally have resulted from increased productivity. Data and data collection are important value creators in the digital economy, and there is an increasing need to <b>tax</b> <b>digital</b> company profits. The OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project announced in 2013, means to address resultant issues, such as tax-base erosion, tax abuse, and artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status. This study concludes that either the concept of permanent establishment needs to be redefined to ensure its effectiveness in the digital economy, or a completely new concept needs to be created...|$|R
