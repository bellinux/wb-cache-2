5|$|The {{earliest}} attested king <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> of Enna-Dagan is Ansud, who {{is mentioned}} as attacking Ebla, the traditional rival of Mari with whom {{it had a}} long war, and conquering many of Ebla's cities, including the land of Belan. The next king mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> is Saʿumu, who conquered the lands of Ra'ak and Nirum, but king Kun-Damu of Ebla defeated Mari {{in the middle of}} the 25th century BC. The war continued with Išhtup-Išar of Mari conquest of Emar, at a time of Eblaite weakness in the mid-24th century BC. King Igrish-Halam of Ebla had to pay tribute to Iblul-Il of Mari, who is mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> conquering many of Ebla's cities and campaigning in the Burman region.|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> is compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> it appears that Feuchtwanger was shocked that these men, whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were familiar with his work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is “Thematic Progression in Business Letters Written By AIESEC”. Based on the {{statement}} of the problem, {{the objectives of the}} study are to identify the theme and rheme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> and to describe thematic progression pattern <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters.</b> <b>The</b> researcher took some business <b>letters</b> of <b>The</b> Jakarta Post Newspaper as the source of data. The data were analyzed by using descriptive research design. The steps to analyze <b>the</b> data <b>in</b> this study are: identifying every clause <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters,</b> identifying <b>the</b> Theme and Rheme of every clause of <b>the</b> <b>letters,</b> describing <b>the</b> thematic development of <b>the</b> <b>letters,</b> figuring <b>the</b> Thematic Progression pattern of <b>the</b> <b>letters,</b> interpreting <b>the</b> data, and drawing the conclusion. As the result, there are 131 clauses found in 6 letters and there are three types of Thematic Progression pattern found in 119 clauses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters.</b> Those are constant Patterns, zig–zag pattern, and multiple patterns. Constant pattern dominates among the other patterns, that is 85 (64. 88 %). Then, it is followed by 33 (25. 19 %) of zig-zag pattern and 2 (1. 53 %) of multiple patterns. It was found that the highest frequency of Thematic Progression patterns is constant pattern. In 6 letters above, new themes were still found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> that are not expected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters.</b> An unexpected theme makes paragraph <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> less coherent, therefore this kind of development should be avoided. From 10 letters, there are 3 letters whose paragraphs are less coherent just under five unexpected themes and 3 letters whose paragraphs are coherent...|$|R

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces to {{the staff}} of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) that she is {{participating}} in a charity which provides gifts to underprivileged children who write letters to Santa. She buys far more than what is requested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> however, the door is answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity. She takes Kenneth back to the apartment to prove she was right, but two children answer the door and Liz accidentally reveals to them that Santa Claus is not real.|$|E

Wighard's death in Rome allowed Vitalian the opportunity to choose his successor, and Vitalian chose his friend Theodore of Tarsus to become the next archbishop.|$|E

5|$|A {{letter of}} Hadrian written from Egypt to his {{brother-in-law}} Servianus is quoted at length (and {{was accepted as}} genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century). Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136. The letter {{is said to have}} been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the History, in another suspect passage. A passage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> preference hierarchy. While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, when The Beatles had to {{pose for}} the {{photograph}} for the Sgt.

Although still upset at the way her son was dismissed from The Beatles, Mona agreed, and the medals were then returned, along with a Cash Box trophy that is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> 'L' of THE BEATLES flower-sign on the cover. Mona never opened another club, or engaged in another business venture, although she did have paying guests at her house, which she shared with her bed-ridden mother and her sons after she and Best parted.

5|$|In 1968, Tongan mission {{president}} John H. Groberg {{declared that}} a 50th Anniversary Golden Jubilee would be held. The concept for the celebration was confusing to church members {{as it was}} unclear what the 50th anniversary was honoring. Groberg was not quite sure himself. However, several years prior to his appointment as mission president, Groberg received inspiration that he would preside over the mission in Tonga and hold a 50th anniversary jubilee during his term. A {{few months before the}} celebration, which was scheduled for November, Groberg received a letter from the widow of Tonga's first mission president. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> she shared that the mission's first conference was held in November 1918. The anniversary of the Tonga's first mission-wide conference became the reason for the jubilee.|$|E

They also stated that the privacy policy was vague and needed to be clarified. They recommended that the privacy policy be rewritten so that it expressly mentions whether the Links' environmental sensors or cameras are being used by any NYPD or city systems.|$|E

The series is written by Rucka and Troutman, and each issue focuses on an individual supporting character from the main series. Lark is involved as a consultant, and each issue is drawn by a different artist. This {{decision was made to}} give Lark time to work on something unrelated to Lazarus, which had been his only project since the series began. He will return with the main series in 2018. A four-page preview of the first installment, drawn by Steve Lieber, was included with the book's solicitation in Image Plus #16.|$|E

5|$|Lord Stanley, {{who often}} {{attended}} Ottawa HC games, felt {{the loss of}} the title after holding it all season was an unsuitable way to determine the championship. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> announcing the Stanley Cup, Stanley suggested that the AHAC start a 'round-robin' type regular season format, which the AHAC implemented in the following season of 1892–93. The key match-up in that season for Ottawa was a loss in the opening game of the season against the Montreal Victorias on January 7, 1893, as Ottawa split its season series with eventual winner Montreal HC, both teams otherwise winning all of their games. This loss provided the one game margin in the standings that led to Lord Stanley awarding the initial Cup to Montreal HC.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 1864, Massachusetts Adjutant General William Schouler {{wrote to}} Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew about a {{discharge}} request {{sent to the}} governor by Otis Newhall, the father of five Union soldiers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> Schouler recalled how, two years prior, they had helped a poor widow named Lydia Bixby to visit a son who was a patient at an Army hospital. About ten days earlier, Bixby had come to Schouler's office claiming that five of her sons had died fighting for the Union. Governor Andrew forwarded Newhall's request to the U.S. War Department with a note requesting that the president honor Bixby with a letter.|$|E
5|$|Systematic {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> preference {{began in}} 1959 with brand-preference studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton.

In {{an extension of the}} studies, subjects were asked to rank the English alphabet by the pleasantness of the appearance of capital letters. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the coefficients of concordance were low), a strong positive correlation was found between a letter's average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of family names.|$|E

5|$|The {{council was}} first called on 11 October 1147 by Eugene, who ordered the bishops and others {{summoned to the}} council to {{assemble}} at Trier on 21 March 1148. This is from a letter sent to Henry Zdík, the Bishop of Olmuetz by the pope. However, a letter sent by the pope on the next day, 12 October 1147, to Eberhard, the Archbishop of Salzburg, named Troyes as the location for the council. It is likely that Troyes, however, was a scribal error, as a further letter of Eugene's, to Suger, Abbot of St Denis, dated 6 October 1147, named Trier as the location also, thus confirming the location given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> of 11 October.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{name for}} the town was 'Aberbrothock', {{a reference to the}} Brothock Burn which runs through the town, the prefix 'Aber' coming either from the Gaelic 'Obair', or the earlier Brythonic term 'Aber' for 'confluence' or 'river mouth'. The name 'Aberbrothock' can be found in numerous spelling variations. In the earliest manuscripts available, it is seen as 'Abirbrothoke' (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> to Edward I confirming the Treaty of Salisbury, which agreed that the Queen regnant, Margaret, Maid of Norway would marry Edward I) and 'Aberbrothok' (in the subsequent letter giving consent for the marriage). In the Declaration of Arbroath, it is seen as 'Abirbrothoc'. Early maps show a number of variants including Aberbrothock, Aberbrothik, Aberbrothick, and Aberbrothwick.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, this unwieldy {{and confusing}} system {{was replaced by}} the current system in which an actress is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year. One actress has been nominated posthumously, Jeanne Eagels. Only three film characters have been nominated more than once in this category: Elizabeth I of England (two times by Cate Blanchett), Leslie Crosbie <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Letter,</b> and Esther Blodgett in A Star Is Born.
