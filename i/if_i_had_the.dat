500|$|In 1848 Richard Cobden had written: [...] "Almost every {{crime and}} outrage in Ireland is {{connected}} with the occupation or ownership of land... <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> power, I would always make the proprietors of the soil resident, by breaking up the large properties. In other words, I would give Ireland to the Irish". Nevertheless, his views were held {{in the context of}} Unionism; he had condemned the 1848 [...] "Young Ireland" [...] rebellion as an act of insanity. Jane adopted her father's standpoint on Irish land reform, yet embraced the cause of Irish home rule—on which she lectured regularly—and was a strong supporter of the Land League. After visiting Ireland with the Women's Mission to Ireland in 1887, she subsequently used the pages of the English press to expose the mistreatment of evicted tenants. In a letter to The Times, Jane and her associates cited one particular case—that of the Ryan family of Cloughbready in County Tipperary—to illustrate the British government's harshness towards even the most vulnerable of individuals. Jane sent money and food to alleviate the Ryan family's distress.|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators. She {{had to go to}} Denmark to work on the film and there was nothing going on. She was lying on the beach whilst looking at the ocean, with a ghetto blaster listening to producer Thomas Knak's music. When she realised he was from Copenhagen, she called him up". [...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and woke him up. [...] "I didn't have any track of time so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She was explaining that she had this melody in her head and maybe, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used to thinking could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E

However, in 1989, in an article for Redbook magazine, he stated that [...] "circumcision of males is traumatic, painful, and of questionable value." [...] He received the first Human Rights Award from the International Symposium on Circumcision (ISC) in 1991 and was quoted saying, [...] "My own preference, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> good fortune to have another son, would be to leave his little penis alone".|$|E
2500|$|On May 24, 2006 Humala {{warned of}} {{possible}} voter {{fraud in the}} upcoming second round elections scheduled for June 4. He urged UPP supporters to register as poll watchers [...] "so votes are not stolen from us during the tabulation at the polling tables." [...] Humala went on to cite similar claims of voting fraud {{in the first round}} made by right-wing National Unity candidate Lourdes Flores when she told reporters that she felt she had [...] "lost at the tabulation tables, not at the ballot box". When asked if he had proof for his claims by CPN Radio Humala stated [...] "I do not have proof. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> proof, I would immediately denounce those responsible to the electoral system". Alan García responded by stating that Humala was [...] "crying fraud" [...] because the polls show him losing the second round.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{criticism}} of Amos Barton was mixed, with Blackwood's close friend W. G. Hamley [...] "dead against Amos" [...] and Thackeray diplomatically noncomittal. However, the complete Scenes of Clerical Life {{was met with}} 'just and discerning applause', and considerable speculation as to the identity of its author. Sales were no better than satisfactory, following a first printing of 1,500 copies, but Blackwood was none the less confident of Eliot's talent. Early reviewers deemed the writer [...] "religious, without cant or intolerance" [...] and [...] "strong in his [...] knowledge of the human heart". It was praised for its realism: one contemporary review noted approvingly that [...] "the fictitious element is securely based upon a broad groundwork of actual truth, truth as well in detail as in general". Due to its subject matter, it was widely assumed to {{be the work of}} a real-life country parson; one such even attempted to take the credit. Popular opinion in Eliot's home town attributed the work to a Mr Joseph Liggins, who attempted ineffectually to deny the rumours, and eventually accepted the undeserved celebrity. George Eliot's [...] "identity" [...] was revealed in a letter to The Times, but this claim was immediately refuted in a letter from Eliot herself. In 1858 Charles Dickens wrote to Eliot to express his approval of the book, and {{was among the first to}} suggest that Scenes of Clerical Life might have been written by a woman.I have been so strongly affected by the two first tales in the book you have had the kindness to send me, through Messrs. Blackwood, that I hope you will excuse my writing to you to express my admiration of their extraordinary merit. The exquisite truth and delicacy both of the humour and the pathos of these stories, I have never seen the like of; and they have impressed me in a manner that I should find it very difficult to describe to you. <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> impertinence to try. In addressing these few words of thankfulness to the creator of the Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton, and the sad love-story of Mr. Gilfil, I am (I presume) bound to adopt the name that it pleases that excellent writer to assume. I can suggest no better one: but I should have been strongly disposed, if I had been left to my own devices, to address the said writer as a woman. I have observed what seemed to me such womanly touches in those moving fictions, that the assurance on the title-page is insufficient to satisfy me even now. If they originated with no woman, I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself mentally so like a woman since the world began.|$|E
