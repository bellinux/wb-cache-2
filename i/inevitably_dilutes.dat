40|$|Postnatal {{skeletal}} {{stem cells}} are a subpopulation of the bone marrow stromal cell network. To date, the most straightforward way of assessing the activity of skeletal stem cells within the bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) population is via analysis of the rapidly adherent, colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F), and their progeny, BMSCs. Several in vitro methods are employed to determine the differentiation capacity of BMSCs, using osteogenic and adipogenic "cocktails" and staining protocols, and pellet cell culture for chondrogenic differentiation. However, true differentiation potential is best determined by in vivo transplantation in either closed or open systems. By in vivo transplantation, approximately 10 % of the clonal strains are able to form bone, stroma, and marrow adipocytes, and are true skeletal stem cells. Furthermore, when derived from patients or animal models with abnormalities in gene expression, they recapitulate the disease phenotype on in vivo transplantation. Although ex vivo expansion of BMSCs <b>inevitably</b> <b>dilutes</b> the skeletal stem cells, when used en masse, they are attractive candidates for reconstruction of segmental bone defects, and as targets for gene therapy...|$|E

40|$|In {{the bone}} marrow (BM) {{nucleated}} differential cell count (NDC), myeloblasts are enumerated {{as a percentage of}} total nucleated cells, which are <b>inevitably</b> <b>diluted</b> with peripheral blood nucleated cells (PBNC) during BM aspiration. We propose a partial NDC (PNDC) comprising only immature haemopoietic cells capable of division, i. e. myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes and erythroblasts. We show that the myeloid : erythroid (M : E) ratio of the PNDC remains approximately constant in progressively dilute aliquots of BM aspirates. We determined the PNDC in 22 healthy subjects and investigated the effect of peripheral blood dilution on disease stratification of 66 BM aspirates with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). NDC and PNDC myeloblast counts were compared and the equivalent PNDC myeloblast counts for NDC myeloblast threshold counts of 5, 10 and 20 % were derived. Reclassification of MDS samples with the PNDC resulted in a change in disease category in 33. 3 % of 51 MDS samples with NDC myeloblast counts ranging from 3 to 26 %. The PNDC is independent of PBNC dilution and can be determined in dilute BM samples. It alters the disease category in a significant proportion of BM aspirates with MDS and has the potential to better stratify MDS to improve clinical outcomes and treatment. S. -H. Lee, S. -J. Ho, D.

40|$|Chalk {{groundwater}} levels typically decline markedly {{in response}} to drought, and rebound strongly when the drought breaks. Chalk streams, largely groundwater-fed, are of ecological importance but {{little research has been}} conducted on possible water-quality effects accompanying fluctuations in groundwater level. This study monitored springs, boreholes and surface water in the Pang and Lambourn catchments in southern England during a major recovery in 2006 – 2008. Hydrochemistry, stable isotopes and age indicators were used to characterize the waters. Perennial springs showed little change in water quality over the monitoring period, and even seasonal springs soon became consistent in their hydrochemistry. A similar lack of change was observed in borehole waters and in the River Lambourn. Stable isotopes demonstrated the high degree of damping relative to rainfall inputs, and residence time indicators showed that Chalk groundwater is basically a mixture with an ‘old’ (pre- 1950 s) component of ≥ 50 %. This being the case, any water quality changes owing to water level fluctuations would <b>inevitably</b> become <b>diluted.</b> Therefore, although future climate predictions for southern Britain include greater extremes in rainfall and temperature, and consequently water level changes of greater amplitude, the buffering effect of the Chalk aquifer should protect the quality of Chalk springs and streams...|$|R
40|$|Alternative’ food systems (AFS), {{understood}} as assemblages of agri-food related production, exchange and consumption activities, often characterised by increased physically and/or cognitive proximity between producers and consumers, have experienced considerable academic and popular {{interest in the}} past decade and a half. Despite continued growth in the number and popularity of AFS manifestations like farmers’ markets, research suggests that these provisioning systems remain the preserve of relatively affluent consumers. Furthermore, the language and practices of alternative food system advocates has tended to create a divide between ‘alternative’ and ‘conventional’ food systems which is not always empirically supported and which has made attempts at improving AFS access equity susceptible to claims that their defining quality attributes are <b>inevitably</b> <b>diluted</b> as they enter the mass market. At the same time, the growing popularity of internet enabled e-commerce has resulted in fundamental changes to many markets, including claims that there is a structural shift by consumer away from mass marketed products towards niche markets, such as those which characterise AFS. This study examines this changing dynamic via a comparison of e-commerce mediated AFS and non e-commerce mediated AFS. The purpose of this comparison being to determine if the application of e-commerce to AFS has resulted in a relative increase in demand from resource constrained consumers and/or a significant change to the quality conventions associated with these systems and which currently mark them as ‘alternative’. This research goal required the development of a novel theoretical model capable of incorporating the language of firm level strategy, as it relates to e-commerce and niche markets, as well as providing a means of discussing AFS quality attributes which does not resort to a bifurcated theory of alternative and conventional food systems. To this end, a theoretical model is advanced within this study which incorporates Michael Porter’s theory of generic strategy, the product lifecycle theory and French conventions theory. The latter being particularly useful as a tool for highlighting differences in production systems based upon different consumer and producer quality conventions. Empirical data for this study was gathered using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative data was gathered via in-depth interviews with AFS business actors within both e-commerce and non e-commerce mediated AFS in Melbourne, Australia and Vancouver, Canada. Quantitative data was gathered via a survey of 375 consumers who regularly acquired food through either the e-commerce mediated or non e-commerce mediated AFS studied in Melbourne and Vancouver. Results from this study show that the application of e-commerce to AFS is indeed associated with significant changes in consumer demand for AFS products, including consumer demographics, order size and consumer motivation. The data gathered on consumer motivation is particularly useful in determining how the consumer’s understanding of quality varies between e-commerce mediated and non e-commerce mediated AFS. Together with the interview and case study data gathered from participating AFS firms this study is able to show that the application of e-commerce to AFS is associated with changes in access for resource constrained consumers, but also that these changes have {{come at the expense of}} specific quality attributes. These finding are relevant not only to AFS scholars and participants interested in improved access equity and a reduction in simplistic interpretations of AFS, but also to participants in niche markets more generally which rely on the production, exchange and consumption of diverse quality attributes...|$|R

H 577 P SO 2016 Shixxviii, 293 pages :color illustrationsMicrobial {{keratitis}} (MK) is a rare, but sight-threatening complication {{associated with}} contact lens wear. Various {{factors have been}} reported as being responsible for contact lens-related MK. Microbial contamination of the contact lens and lens accessories is frequently detected in contact lens wearers and is a known risk factor for MK. Staphylococcus species, which are not only commonly isolated from the periorbital region (including conjuctival sac, eye lids, and eyelashes), {{but also from the}} contact lenses and lens accessories, are the most common pathogens associated with MK. In published reports, the contamination rates of contact lenses, lens cases, and lens care solutions are high. Contact lenses are considered as vectors capable of transporting potential pathogens contaminating both the lens and lens accessories into the eyes. To reduce the incidence of ocular infections associated with contact lens wear, the use of contact lens disinfecting and cleaning systems are required. Multipurpose disinfecting solutions (MPS) are essential to inactivate microorganisms on the lenses and lens accessories. Some of the active ingredients of MPS, such as chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and benzalkonium chloride (BAK), which have been widely used in hospital and other clinical settings, can cause selective pressure on bacteria {{which is one of the}} main reasons for the development of resistance to disinfectants. There is an increased concern about the emergence of disinfectant-resistant microorganisms, notably in Staphylococcus. Antiseptic resistance in staphylococci is attributable to several genes that are mainly plasmid-borne and confer reduced susceptibility to cationic antiseptic agents including dyes, Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), and biguanides by coding for efflux pumps, which reduce disinfectant concentration in the cell. The distribution of QAC genes in staphylococci has been investigated not only in clinical isolates, but also in isolates from the general population. In addition, there is evidence that presence of QAC genes may contribute to the emergence of cross-resistance and co-resistance between widely used biocides and antibiotics. Currently, over 125 million people use contact lenses and lens accessories. More than 90 % contact lens wearers are using MPS to clean and disinfect their contact lens and lens accessories. In actual use, especially if not handled properly, MPS are <b>inevitably</b> <b>diluted</b> by water, saline, or other solutions, which will serve to decrease the effects of MPS. Some microorganisms may survive and be exposed to the selective pressure for a prolonged period. However, it is unknown whether long-term use of MPS can select for ocular pathogens harbouring QAC genes, having increased resistance to several antiseptics, antibiotics, and MPS. The purpose of this research was to provide significant and original contributions to the knowledge base of distribution of QAC genes in S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in selected orthokeratology (ortho-k) lens and spectacle wearers in Hong Kong and observe the trend of resistant organism acquisition over 6 months. It aimed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus and CNS harbouring QAC genes and their association with the presence of QAC genes. It also aimed to investigate the effectiveness of four MPSs for RGP lenses against S. aureus and CNS harbouring QAC genes isolated in this research. This is the first study of the prevalence of QAC gene in staphylococci isolated from ortho-k lens wearers. Samples were collected from several sites in the periorbital region of all subjects, as well as from the lenses and lens accessories of ortho-k lens wearers and from the spectacle frames of controls. Following isolation and identification of bacterial species, all staphylococci were investigated for the presence of QAC genes by polymerase chain reaction. The higher prevalence of QAC genes in staphylococci isolated from ortho-k lens wearers and the gradually increasing prevalence of QAC genes in staphylococci isolated from ortho-k wearers over a 6 -month period supported the hypothesis that use of MPS may cause selective pressure to staphylococci to acquire QAC genes. For all staphylococcal isolates harbouring QAC genes, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) to two disinfectants, CHX and BAK, and susceptibility to several antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution method and disc diffusion test, respectively. The results demonstrated that the presence of QAC genes in staphylococci commonly contributed to higher MIC and MBC to disinfectants and higher resistance rates to antibiotics. Four commonly used MPS for RGP lens were challenged with staphylococci harbouring QAC genes by the standalone test and MIC and MBC to each MPS were determined by broth microdilution method. The results demonstrated that the presence of QAC genes in staphylococci significantly decreased their susceptibility to MPS for rigid lenses and viability of some staphylococcal isolates, especially strains harbouring QAC genes, could not be reduced by the required 3 -logs after exposure to MPS. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that staphylococci harbouring QAC genes are widely distributed in both ortho-k lens and spectacle wearers in Hong Kong, and use of contact lenses increases the likelihood of colonization and contamination with such strains. Use of MPS may contribute to higher carriage rate of gene-positive staphylococci as a result of increased tolerance to disinfectants (including MPS) and antibiotics. Further investigation may be required to investigate the risk of reduced antiseptic and antibiotic susceptibility to MK and its association in the control of MK. School of OptometryPh.
