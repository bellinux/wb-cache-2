The screenless <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> uses air flow to separate small particles from larger ones, rather than a screen, and is thus more reliable which results in much more energy efficiency.

25|$|An old <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> site, at {{work from}} 1567 to 1786. One {{of the names}} {{indicates}} that the mill was a drawing mill at one time. In 1533, the effects of Thomas Gaynesford included a <b>hammer</b> <b>mill.</b> The property had been bough by Gaynesford from Sir John Gage in 1550. In 1559, Nicholas Norton was a miller grinding grain near lands called Shawnors, followed by John Myller in 1560 to 1563, when John Rodgers succeeded him. in 1567, Wiremill was being worked by John Thorpe. In the 1560s, there are several references to Woodcock Hammer or Forge being worked by Swanne.|$|E
25|$|The mill {{building}} survives in part, {{incorporated into a}} dwelling and retaining the waterwheel. The site {{may have been a}} <b>hammer</b> <b>mill,</b> witnessed by Ironmasters Cottage Wing mentioned in recent property sale particulars. The mill was known as Bishes Mill in 1598 John Awcock was the miller in 1841 and John Stanbridge was the miller in 1851, still there in 1867. The mill was then a corn mill.|$|E

2500|$|Oats {{are also}} {{commonly}} used as feed for horses when extra carbohydrates {{and the subsequent}} boost in energy are required. The oat hull may be crushed ("rolled" [...] or [...] "crimped") for the horse to more easily digest the grain, or may be fed whole. They may be given alone {{or as part of}} a blended food pellet. Cattle are also fed oats, either whole or ground into a coarse flour using a roller mill, burr mill, or <b>hammer</b> <b>mill.</b> Oat forage is commonly used to feed all kinds of ruminants, as pasture, straw, hay or silage.|$|E
2500|$|One or more trip hammers {{were set}} up in a forge, also known {{variously}} as a <b>hammer</b> <b>mill,</b> hammer forge or hammer works. The hammers were usually raised by a cam and then released to fall under the force of gravity. Historically, trip hammers were often powered by a water wheel, and are known to have been used in China as long ago as 40 BC or maybe even {{as far back as the}} Zhou Dynasty (1050 BC–221 BC) and in medieval Europe by the 12th century. During the Industrial Revolution the trip hammer fell out of favor and was replaced with the power hammer. [...] Often multiple hammers were powered via a set of line shafts, pulleys and belts from a centrally located power supply.|$|E
2500|$|Bofors was {{initially}} a general {{iron and steel}} use, and was to become an arms manufacturers in the late 1800s when technology developments within the field cannon meant that the new steel grades and manufacturing techniques were used. The Bofors 40mm gun is a famous anti-aircraft autocannon designed by the Swedish firm Bofors. It {{was one of the}} most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as various other forces. It is often referred to simply as the Bofors gun. The name Bofors has been associated with the iron industry for more than 350 years. It is located in Karlskoga, Sweden, and it originates from the <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> [...] "Boofors" [...] founded 1646. The company was founded in 1873.|$|E

2500|$|This {{was an old}} <b>hammer</b> <b>mill</b> site. The mill {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1562 when John Thorpe was listed as repairing buildings, the mill and banks {{to the value of}} £64. He was leasing the manor of Hedgecourt from the Gage family of Firle at the time. In 1567 John Thorpe took out a 21 year lease on the mill, the mills being described as [...] "newly erected" [...] and having an overshot waterwheel. In 1594, the mill was in the tenancy of Thomas Thorpe, son of John Thorpe. In 1652, the mill was in the tenance of Robert Filkes of Godstone. In 1663, John Finch took out an eleven-year lease on Hedgecourt Mill. A toll chest is mentioned in the lease, indicating that the mill was a corn mill, at least in part. He was still there in 1669, paying a half-yearly rent of £14 and tax of 2/-. By March 1670 Joseph Marchant had joined him, but he died in 1674. His widow Sarah took out a lease on the mill in October of that year. The mill passed to her son John in 1688. In 1701, Joseph Marchant (son of John) was at the mill. He built or extended a house in 1701, possibly an extension to the mill. In 1723, Joseph Marchant renewed his lease on the mill [...] and in 1739 James Marchant (son of Joseph) took a sixty-year lease with William Clayton of Marden on [...] of Hedgecourt Heath in Horne, on which to erect a windmill. The mill was an open trestle post mill. Joseph Marchant seems to have retired by 1742. An unexecuted lease of 1743 mentions that the miller has permission to take timber for the purpose of making charcoal (used in the smelting of iron). The site remained in the ownership of the Gage family until 1745, when Colonel Edward Evelyn bought it. It was a furnace mill at that time.|$|E
2500|$|Woodcock Forge is {{believed}} to have been built by Jack Dancy of Turners Hill. Hedgecourt Mill is thought to have been remodelled by him about the same time. The pond at Hedgecourt acted as a storage for the Woodcock forge. The tilt hammer was operated by an overshot waterwheel. Another overshot waterwheel worked bellows. In 1574, John Thorpe of Hedgecourt was working the forge in connection with the furnace at Myllwood. in 1586 Thorpe bought property from William Swanne Sr in the Woodcock Forge area. From 1598 to 1606 the rent was paid by Thomas Thorpe, son of John and in 1629 the forge was leased by John Gage to Richard Thorpe, the son of Thomas. His son, also Richard, held the forge until 1651, when it was forfeit in lieu of a debt. Thorpe's interest in the forge was sold to Simon Everenden of Cliffe near Lewes. In the 1650s the forge was in the occupation of John Newnham. In 1664, the forge was lease by Jeremy Johnson Jr of Charlwood. In 1672, woodland next to the pond was referred to as [...] "Hammerwood" [...] also known as [...] "Wire Wood" [...] thus indicating a drawing mill. John Newnham died in 1707, and his wife died in 1719, but the forge was known as [...] "Mr Johnson's Forge" [...] in 1717. At that time the output from the forge was some [...] per annum. [...] By 1729 the forge was in the occupation of Thomas Stanford, who was converting sows from Heathfield furnace at Woodcock Forge. Stanford does not seem to have had any connections with the Wealden iron industry after 1738. In 1742 Samuel Baker was in occupation, followed by Edward Raby and Alexander Master in 1758. They were supplying the Board of Ordnance with several gauges of bar iron, staff iron and rolled plate. Raby & Master were bankrupt in 1764. Edward Raby died in 1771, and the forge was taken over by his son Alexander until 1774, when the Government forced him to give up Woodcock furnace in a wrangle over the size of his moulds. Joseph Wright and Thomas Pickett took the business, but it is thought that the <b>Hammer</b> <b>Mill</b> ceased to be used c.1787. In 1800, the name Wire Mill is first used.|$|E
