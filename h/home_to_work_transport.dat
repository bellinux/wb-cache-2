40|$|This paper investigates <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> travel {{pattern in}} the Istanbul Metropolitan Area. Investigation explores {{commuting}} pattern in three steps. In the first step, the reasons for changing commuting time are explored initially in relationship to urban structure. Added explanation then considers the gender, tenure type, income, occupation and commuting type. The result related with gender {{is consistent with the}} previous studies however income is not. Occupation and commuting type appear to be strongly affected on differences on commuting time. In the second step, the <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> travel pattern is explored whether it reflects consistency with the standard urban economic theory. Results reflect that the behavioral assumption of cost minimization for the journey <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in the standard model is inadequate when explaining the relation between job and housing location. In the third step, the <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> travel pattern is investigated in local context in terms of spatial distribution of workers both on working and residential areas. While living and working at the same geographic part of the metropolitan area or the district decreases the commuting time, living and working at the different geographic part of the metropolitan area or the district significantly increases the commuting time. ...|$|R

40|$|Electric station {{cars have}} the {{potential}} of filling an important market niche [...] namely, providing on-call, door-to-door access to and from rail transit stations as well as midday automobility for those who patronize transit. They would make getting from <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> via rail transit virtually seamless. Their greatest promise is in the suburbs. In the San Francisco Bay Area, {{there are thousands of}} jobs beyond walking distance of suburban BART stations. Given the choice of driving from <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or taking BART and transferring to a bus to reach jobs, most suburban workers choose the former. The availability of free parking at the workplace and the generally poor quality of many suburban bus services reinforce this overwhelming preference for solo commuting...|$|R
