The constraints in the restoration process to be considered are: (a) maintain the radial structure of the network, (b) no overloaded equipment and (c) higher priority customers should always be supplied first. The result shows that inclusion of the transformer current limits has changed the ranking of plans. The system becomes more reliable with the minimization of unbalanced loading of transformer current as there is no scope for exceeding the limits during restoration plans. Feasible plans which consider more objective functions make the system more reliable. The reliability and stability of the restored network has increased by 1.09  %.

40|$|We {{use test}} {{particle}} simulations incorporating an MHD model of ULF wave propagation in the magnetosphere with realistic ionosphere boundary conditions to study electron energization in the dayside outer Van Allen radiation belt, referenced to in situ particle and wave observations. On 7 January 2011 the THEMIS spacecraft detected 3 and 4 - 5 mHz waves simultaneous with flux enhancement of > 10 keV electrons {{during the early}} recovery phase of a moderate geomagnetic storm. We find that internal energization of equatorially mirroring electrons via nonresonant ULF wave-particle interactions can explain these observations. The wave poloidal components cause radial drift of electrons, increasing (decreasing) their kinetic energy as they move inward (outward). Electrons with initial kinetic energies of a few keV can be energized to double these values within an hour by interaction with the 3 mHz waves. The energization rate is somewhat less for the 4 - 5 mHz waves. An increase in the ionospheric conductance decreases {{the power of the}} fast mode wave, reducing radial drift velocities and hence decreasing the rate of energization. The fast mode poloidal field varies with radial distance and longitude, and this also affects energization. Electrons which drift outward encounter a region where the toroidal field due to the field line resonance becomes dominant and produces strong azimuthal drift. These electrons become trapped in an L-shell range just outward of the resonance region and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>energized...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} compare reaction times to brake signals when they appear with red or yellow turn signals. The laboratory study simulated a daytime driving condition. The subject's task was to respond {{as quickly as possible}} to the onset of peripherally presented brake lamps (but not to turn signals), while engaged in a central tracking task. There were three lamp conditions: brake lamps alone, brake lamps while turn signal was on, and a turn-signal lamp alone. Thus, the subject's task required an immediate response in the first condition, a delayed response in the second (only after the brake lamps came on, not to the turn signal), and no response in the third condition. Turn signals were presented at two levels of luminous intensity. The results showed that reaction times to brake signals were significantly shorter when the brake signals were presented in the context of yellow turn signals than when they were presented in the context of red turn signals. Averaged over both levels of luminous intensity and conditions with and without turn signals, the difference between yellow and red was 110 ms. The colors of turn signals had an effect whether or not the turn signal was on, but the effect was greater when it was. Older subjects were affected more by the color of turn signals than were younger subjects. In conclusion, yellow turn signals are beneficial in situations simulated in this experiment. However, the present findings are directly applicable only to a situation where all vehicles have yellow turn signals and tail lamps <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>energized...</b>|$|R

Energizing the electromagnet attracts the mouse towards a ferromagnetic mouse pad, increasing the normal force, and thus the frictional force, between the mouse and the mouse pad. This allows a two-dimensional display of varying frictional forces.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common issues in {{permanent}} magnet motors for automotive applications is to improve their capability of operating over very wide speed ranges. For this purposes, various motor design techniques have been proposed in the literature. After a brief review of these techniques, the paper presents an idea for improving the flux weakening capability of permanent-magnet reluctance-assisted motors.

The field circuit is fed by a brushless permanent-magnet exciter and a diode rectifier. While at low speed the field <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>energized,</b> it automatically activates above the base speed by means of a centrifugal switch.

The primary component in grid connected PV system is the inverter. The inverter convert DC power produced by the PV array into AC power consistent with voltage, current and power quality requirement of utility grid, and the automatically stops supplying power to the grid when the utility grid <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>energized.</b> In voltage source inverter, input voltage is maintained constant and amplitude of output voltage {{does not depend on}} the load. However the waveform of load current as well as it's magnitude depends upon the nature of load impedance. In the current source inverter (CSI), input current is constant but adjustable. The amplitude of output current from CSI is independent of load. To enlarge the use of grid-connected PV systems, the cost, performance, and life expectancy of the power electronic interface needs to be improved. The current-source inverter (CSI) offers advantages over VSI in terms of inherent boosting and short circuit protection capabilities, direct output current controllability, and ac-side simpler filter structure. Research on CSI-based DG is still in its infancy. This paper focuses on transient performances of a PV system based on CSI during the rigorous LL and TPG (Three- phase- to-ground) faults. It also performs a comparative analysis of CSI-based PV systems for severe LL and TPG (Three-phase- to- ground) faults under transient conditions. The control structure consists of two current control loops. An MPPT provides the reference for the outer dc-side current control loop. The inner current control loop is designed to control the current that is injected into the grid.

40|$|Stanisław Brzozowski, one of {{the most}} {{brilliant}} Polish minds of the early nineteenth century, referred to Thoreau as to a "forest soul of houndred senses" which destroys the dirt of modern reality. In his native Concord, a small town, which in mid 1850 s was considered to be the Athens of the United States, he held the position of a Socrates because, as his ancient Greek predecessor, he wanted to act as a disturbing factor to the complacent conscience of polis. It is this untiring questioning of social actions and agencies that originated the famous defense of the moral integrity of the individual as rendered in the epoch making essays on Civil Disobedience. His philosophy and life practice, the two spheres which Thoreau always tried to unite, constituted a profound criticism of the direction taken by modern society, while a two year long existential experiment on the shores of Walden pond outside Concord is to be understood as a spiritual exercise aimed at helping man to live a life characterized, as he famously described it in Walden, by "simplicity, magnanimity, and trust". Extensive field trips, which took the philosopher to fields, woods, and rivers, were not only explorations of nature but, first of all, were meant to provide him with the appropriate and necessary distance o matters of human community. It is the non-human foundations of the human world that interest Thoreau. Reading through the fourteen volumes of his Journal, we realize that the philosopher does not suggest a simple dychotomic model {{of the world in which}} roles and values had been already determined. His thought <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>energized</b> by the nostalgic attempt to merely recreate the original wildness as opposed to superficial urbanity. Instead, Thoreau takes recourse to imagination, a force, as he notices, neglected by modern society, to propose a philosophy in which human community with its history and multiplicity of individual biographies redefines itself through the non-human. In Thoreau, ecological or biocentric reflection serves social functions, and his work meets the demands which Wright Mills sets before what he describes as the "sociological imagination". What is at stake is not a refutation of Western culture but reflexive rethinking of its institutions and traditions as well as principles of economic growth and property as a foundational concept of Western democracy.

40|$|Common to many {{bacteria}} is {{the ability}} to establish a symbiotic relationship or to evade innate immune responses of an animal, plant, fish or insect host. Most often this capacity is mediated by a type III secretion system (T 3 SS). The function of these complex molecular machines is likened to a syringe-needle injection device that is dedicated to the translocation of effector proteins directly into target eukaryotic cells. Each translocated effector tends to possess a distinct enzymatic activity that aids in subverting host cell signaling {{for the benefit of the}} bacterium. Their translocation requires another class of secreted protein – the translocator – which form pores in the target eukaryotic cell plasma membrane through which the effectors may transit to gain entry into the cell interior. Most often, each secreted substrate requires a dedicated small, non-secreted cytoplasmic chaperone for their efficient secretion. Unlike traditional molecular chaperones, these specialized type III chaperones do not assist in protein folding and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>energized</b> by ATP. Controversy still surrounds their primary role; as bodyguards to prevent premature aggregation or as pilots to direct substrate secretion through the correct T 3 SS. The later is supported by recent evidence that these chaperones can dock directly to the cytoplasmic face of the T 3 S machinery, possibly serving as a recognition motif for substrate secretion. Added to this functional complexity is their important contribution to system regulation, which can ultimately confer temporal order to substrate secretion. Moreover, some chaperones display a bewildering propensity to interact with several additional T 3 S-associated proteins – the relevance of which remains uncertain. Structural data has now appeared for several important type III chaperones, either alone or in complex with their cognate substrate. This is proving a fillip in our attempts to understand the mercurial ways in which these versatile proteins operate in nature. It is hoped that this article will provide information on type III chaperone function, as well as highlighting key recent advances in the field. May it also be a testament to the value of continued intense effort in unravelling the mysteries of type III chaperone biology...|$|R

The twenty-six nucleotides stem contains a defect consisting on a highly conserved G-rich 1 - 3 asymmetrical internal loop which is a major site for nucleocapsid protein binding. Several NMR attempts were undertaken to determine the internal loop structure in the SL 1 monomer. However the RNA constructs used in the different studies were largely mutated, in particular with replacement of the nine nucleotides apical loop by a tetraloop, and divergent results were obtained ranging from a rigid structure to a particularly large flexibility. In order to investigate the reasons for such discrepancies, we used molecular dynamics simulation of the SL 1 monomer to probe the effect of mutations on the conformational stability of the internal loop and of the whole stem. It is found that in the wild type sequence the internal loop displays conformational variability originating mainly from the nine nucleotides apical loop flexibility that causes large conformationnal fluctuations (without changing the average structure) in the seven base pairs duplex linking the apical and internal loops. The large amplitude atomic motions in the duplex are transmitted to the internal loop in which they induce conformational changes characterized by a labile hydrogen bond network such as G 5 successively H-bonded to A 29 and G 30. On the contrary, with a four nucleotides apical loop, conformational fluctuations in the duplex are reduced {{by a factor of}} 2 and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> sufficiently <b>energizing</b> for promoting changes in the internal loop structure at the time scale of the simulations...|$|R

The clustering criteria consists of commonly used distance measure {{with the addition of}} household information as basis for the ability to pay ATP value. The combination of these two parameters resulted to a more significant and realistic clusters since distance measure alone could not take the effect of the household characteristics in screening the most sensible groupings of households.

For his support, G Rap went for mostly lesser-known producers (with some exceptions like Alchemist and Marley Marl) who had a similar vision. Taking off with the throwback theme in place, each producer drops a soulful sample laden track, a Memory Lane for all who take this album for a spin.

In support of this hypothesis, the distribution of methylaminoisobutyrate between plasma membrane vesicles and their supporting media was influenced in the predictable way by NADH, quinacrine, and an uncoupling agent, proceeding on the assumption that more of the vesicles had the everted rather than the natural orientation...|$|R
