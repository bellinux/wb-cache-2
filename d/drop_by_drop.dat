They demonstrated their process {{in the summer of}} 1909 by producing ammonia from air, <b>drop</b> <b>by</b> <b>drop,</b> at the rate of about [...] per hour. The process was purchased by the German chemical company BASF, which assigned Carl Bosch the task of scaling up Haber's tabletop machine to industrial-level production. He succeeded in 1910. Haber and Bosch were later awarded Nobel prizes, in 1918 and 1931 respectively, for their work in overcoming the chemical and engineering problems of large-scale, continuous-flow, high-pressure technology.|$|E
2500|$|Acknowledging the audience's emotions, Kennedy {{referred}} to his own grief at {{the murder of his}} brother, President John F. Kennedy and, quoting a passage from the play Agamemnon (in translation), said: [...] "My favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote: 'Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls <b>drop</b> <b>by</b> <b>drop</b> upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.' What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness; but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black... Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world." [...] The quotation from Aeschylus was later inscribed on a memorial at the gravesite of Robert Kennedy following his own assassination.|$|E
2500|$|He was {{the first}} to tell the {{audience}} that King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: [...] "For {{those of you who are}} black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." [...] These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to [...] "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, [...] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls <b>drop</b> <b>by</b> <b>drop</b> upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." [...] In conclusion, Kennedy said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} hybrid microtextured surface with {{heterogeneous}} hydrophilic-hydrophobic regions for condensing water vapor while maintaining anti-wetting behavior. Fluid dynamics videos are shown demonstrating {{the difference between}} condensation on a homogeneous hydrophobic structure and the same structure with hybrid wetting regions. 1. Brief Explanation of Video Submission It is well-known that superhydrophobic surfaces are able to resist wetting, either <b>by</b> sessile <b>drops</b> or <b>by</b> <b>drops</b> impacting with an appreciable velocity. This anti-wetting behavior is possible due to the roughness features of the surface, which are able to support drops in a superhydrophobic Cassie state. In this state, the drops rest {{on the tops of}} the roughness features, with a vapor layer remaining between the drop and the surface. This superhydrophobic Cassie state is difficult to maintain during condensation. Water droplets will commonly nucleate and begin growing within the roughness features. As the condensation process proceeds, small, nucleated droplets grow and coalesce into neighbor-ing drops so that when the drop has grown to macroscopic size, it is in a highly-pinned Wenzel state. These drops are difficult to remove, and thus the anti-wetting propertie...|$|R
