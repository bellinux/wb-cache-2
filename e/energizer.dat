The next year Playtex Products acquired the Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen company for $83 million. Later that year Playtex Products {{was acquired by}} <b>Energizer</b> Holdings for $1.16 billion. Playtex Products was sued in 2008, when a mother accused the company of not adequately disclosing their baby bottles contained bisphenol A.

25|$|King Kong {{is often}} used in {{commercial}} culture, for example in advertisements for Coca-Cola and <b>Energizer</b> Batteries. A New York insurance company used clips from the film to persuade people of the hazards of city life. A two-part <b>Energizer</b> Battery commercial had the 1933 Kong himself contracted by a rival battery corporation (SuperVolt) {{to get rid of}} the <b>Energizer</b> Bunny for them. The commercials were done in black-and-white, and used cleverly edited 1933 Kong sequences (possibly combined with new computer-generated Kong shots). The concluding second-part had Kong cornering the Bunny on the roof of a New York City building, complete with biplanes flying in the sky. His foot in an open window interrupts a couple that resemble Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll having a romantic moment. The woman, extremely annoyed, slams the window on Kong's toes, making him lose his balance and grip, sending him falling. In 1990 Kongfrontation became one of the original rides at Universal Studios Florida.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a classroom-based physical activity program on children's in-school physical activity levels and on-task behavior during academic instruction. Physical activity of 243 students was assessed during school hours. Intervention-group students (N = 135) received a classroom-based program (i. e., <b>Energizers).</b> The control group (N = 108) did not receive <b>Energizers.</b> On-task behavior during academic instruction time was observed for 62 third-grade (N = 37) and fourth-grade students (N = 25) before and after <b>Energizers</b> activities. An independent groups t-test compared in-school physical activity levels between intervention and control classes. A multiple-baseline across-classrooms design was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the <b>Energizers</b> on on-task behavior. Additionally, a two-way (time [pre- vs postobservation] x period [baseline vs intervention]) repeated-measures analysis of variance compared on-task behavior between observation periods. Magnitudes of mean differences were evaluated with Cohen's delta (ES). Students in the intervention group took significantly (P < 0. 05) more in-school steps (5587 +/- 1633) than control-group students (4805 +/- 1543), and the size of this difference was moderate (ES = 0. 49). The intervention was effective in improving on-task behavior; after the <b>Energizers</b> were systematically implemented, on-task behavior systematically improved. The improvement in on-task behavior of 8 % between the pre-Energizers and post-Energizers observations was statistically significant (P < 0. 017), and the difference was moderate (ES = 0. 60). Likewise, the least on-task students improved on-task behavior by 20 % after <b>Energizers</b> activities. This improvement was statistically significant (P < 0. 001) and meaningful (ES = 2. 20). A classroom-based physical activity program was effective for increasing daily in-school physical activity and improving on-task behavior during academic instruction...|$|R

30|$|Regarding {{the studies}} {{in a school}} setting, there was no overall {{significant}} difference in attention after an active lesson and a classroom lesson. However, analyses of subgroups showed significant results. Caterino and Polak (1999) found a significant effect of PA only for 9 – 10 years old children and Budde et al. (2008) found a significant effect only after coordinative exercises (for example bouncing a ball, while balancing). Performing <b>energizers</b> led to a significant improvement of time on task (i.e. the time in verbal or motor behaviour that followed the class rules and was appropriate to the learning situation) after performing the <b>energizers</b> (Mahar et al. 2006), but when these <b>energizers</b> were performed during a classroom task, no improvement was found (Grieco et al. 2009).|$|R
