5|$|Written {{at a time}} of {{religious}} upheaval, and {{in the wake of the}} English Reformation, the play is alternately Catholic (or piously medieval) and Protestant (or consciously modern). The ghost <b>describes</b> <b>himself</b> as being in purgatory, and as dying without last rites. This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that revenge tragedies come from traditionally Catholic countries, such as Spain and Italy, where they present a contradiction of motives, since according to Catholic doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice. Hamlet's conundrum, then, is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires.|$|E
