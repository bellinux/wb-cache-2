5|$|The scandal {{proved an}} <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{reputation}} of the Royal Navy, then still the world's largest, and it was satirised {{at home and abroad}} through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio composed by Erwin Schulhoff. One consequence of the damaging affair was an undertaking from the Admiralty to review the means by which naval officers might bring complaints against the conduct of their superiors.|$|E
5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard. Members of both parties accused the union leaders of trying to prevent their voters from reaching the polls. The riots made national news and public leaders began to consider them an <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state. Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E
5|$|An {{event of}} grave <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union came in October 1981 {{when one of}} its {{submarines}} ran aground near the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona. As this was a militarily sensitive location, Sweden took an aggressive stance on the incident, detaining the Whiskey-class sub for two weeks as they awaited an official explanation from Moscow. Eventually it was released, but Stockholm refused to accept Soviet claims that this was merely an accident, especially since numerous unidentified submarines had been spotted near the Swedish coast. Sweden also announced that radiation had been detected emanating from the submarine and they believed it to be carrying nuclear missiles. Moscow would neither confirm nor deny this and instead merely accused the Swedes of espionage.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} meeting, {{chaired by}} the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Austen Chamberlain, {{decided it was}} not in the interests of <b>the</b> British government <b>to</b> prosecute Sempill. Firstly Sempill's father was then aide-de-camp to King George V; any public trial would be a grave <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> both <b>The</b> Crown and the British Establishment. Secondly a prosecution would have revealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Japanese that British Intelligence had cracked the cypher codes of its diplomatic service.|$|R
50|$|In February 2009 the Czech {{parliament}} amended {{criminal law}} with an explicit ban on publishing any account of police wiretapping, {{under penalty of}} a heavy fine and years of imprisonment. The law was criticised by the Czech media as an attempt by politicians <b>to</b> avoid future <b>embarrassment</b> akin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mrázek case.|$|R
40|$|This work aims {{to spell}} out clear the {{tensions}} manifested by the meeting between the project of a reflexive philosophy and psychoanalysis, from a very specific event: the publication, in 1965, of the thesis De l'interprétation: essai sur Freud by Paul Ricoeur. Our question arises {{from the fact that}} psychoanalysis has introduced one of <b>the</b> greatest <b>embarrassments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> philosophies of consciousness, as it established the unconscious psychic as foundation and array of subjectivity. In contrast, Paul Ricoeur strengthens its belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reflective tradition initiated by Husserl, but with a fundamental deviation: in your access to subjectivity, this reflexive philosophy must {{take the form of a}} hermeneutics that interprets the signs of man’s existence. Given this, the present study seeks to find out what difficulties, tensions and contributions the reading of Freud offers to hermeneutic project proposed by Ricoeur. <b>The</b> article aims <b>to</b> show how <b>the</b> philosophical reading of Freud allowed Ricoeur <b>to</b> arbitrate <b>the</b> different and sometimes conflicting hermeneutics approaches around the problem of symbol...|$|R
5|$|Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, RA Butler, the British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, {{announced}} that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government—Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula had formed a coalition to keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the Conservative government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia's minority government had already become something of an <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK and it hurt Britain's reputation to even {{maintain the status quo}} there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives' main parliamentary opposition, the Labour Party, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions.|$|E
25|$|This <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> army {{brought about}} a number of demotions and transfers. Morton, who had been {{slightly}} wounded while standing near Rosecrans during the battle, was not immediately relieved of his command. However, on October 10, he was relieved and General William Farrar Smith took his place.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Cardinal Hume {{nominated}} Jimmy Savile as {{a member}} of the Athenaeum, a gentlemen's club in London's Pall Mall. Following the posthumous revelation of Savile's repeated sexual abuse of minors, members of the club have criticised Hume's nomination of him for causing <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Quonset (Robert Morley), {{the head}} of NAWA, is {{concerned}} that the situation with Hoffman and Schmidlap threatens <b>to</b> become an <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> NAWA. Furthermore, <b>the</b> Soviets have taken a step forward in the space race by placing the first (unmarried) male/female couple on the Moon. Quonset decides the United States should place the first married couple in space.|$|R
2500|$|Former Jehovah's Witness Bill Bower, {{founder of}} Silentlambs, accuses Jehovah's Witnesses of {{employing}} organizational policies of not reporting sexual abuse cases to authorities <b>to</b> protect <b>the</b> organisation's reputation. The Religioustolerance site {{states that the}} consequence of keeping the cases secrets is that [...] "there is a very high probability that the abuse will continue." [...] Some victims of sexual abuse have asserted that when reporting abuse they were ordered to maintain silence by their local elders <b>to</b> avoid <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> accused and the organization.|$|R
50|$|After 1998, Austria {{began to}} decline. They failed {{to qualify for}} 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000, and {{suffered}} extreme <b>embarrassment</b> (similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Faroe Islands loss) when they lost 9-0 to Spain and 5-0 to Israel in 1999. In 2006, Josef Hickersberger became coach of the Austrian national team, which included some respectable results such as a 1-0 victory against Switzerland in 2006.|$|R
25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the incident his unit was posted to North Africa without him while he remained on a charge. He was subsequently invalided out of the RAF on medical grounds. This avoided a court martial and the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government of Pollock giving a reason for his stunt and garnering public support.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, {{tensions}} {{were high}} between the U.S. and Canada when the U.S. banned Canadians {{from engaging in}} the seal hunt in the Bering Sea {{as part of the}} ongoing Bering Sea Dispute between the U.S. and Britain. Tupper traveled to Washington, D.C. to represent Canadian interests during the negotiations and was something of an <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British diplomats.|$|E
25|$|French {{authority}} {{over most of}} Jabal al-Druze was lost {{as a result of}} the battle, although a French garrison remained in control of al-Suwayda for over a month. Short of supplies, the French withdrew from al-Suwayda by 24 September, leaving much of the town destroyed. Following his defeat, which had caused great <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mandate government, General Michaud was recalled to France in disgrace. He was replaced by General Maurice Gamelin.|$|E
50|$|In 1818, {{for a brief}} period, he was the {{operator}} of the Turk. At that time, he was not yet {{one of the best}} players in France. Furthermore, in the days when he was hidden inside the Automaton, he caught the flu and his performance was rather poor. While he was hiding inside <b>the</b> Turk, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flu, he was seized by coughing and the sound was perceived by the spectators, creating a certain <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> Mälzel (<b>the</b> Turk owner). For this reason, Mälzel, subsequently, added some noisy gears <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Turk, which had no other purpose but to cover any noise that could come from {{the operator}}.|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{understand}} {{the experience of}} women with cervical cancer precursor lesions. Method: phenomenological study, with the reduction, construction, and destruction steps. Data interpretation was performed through Heidegger's comprehensive analysis. Results: the phenomena unveiled were related to women's doubts, {{due to lack of}} diagnosis; changes in relationships with partners; difficulties in making friends; family importance; coping strategies; relationship with health professionals and distrust in care; shame and <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> undergo <b>the</b> Pap test; and fear of death. Conclusion: it was found that there is an urgent need <b>to</b> resize <b>the</b> care for a woman with cervical cancer precursor lesions, given the challenge of understanding the need that a health professional provides care from the Heideggerian perspective, establishing a relationship of being-with-the-other, appreciating her as a subject of possibilities...|$|R
50|$|Milam {{focused his}} efforts on areas of personnel, {{finances}} and fund raising, {{aid from the}} federal government, as well as public relations. Notably, he pushed for pensions and annuities for the staff and was generally successful in these areas. The end was bittersweet due to criticisms of his work {{toward the end of}} his ALA career. He was eventually nominated for president of the ALA in the year following his resignation, 1949, but the whole situation would prove <b>to</b> be an <b>embarrassment</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous criticisms and he was not elected.|$|R
25|$|The {{downfall}} of the Glastonbury Festivals was hastened when Boughton, sympathising with the miners' lockout and general strike of 1926, insisted on staging his very popular Nativity opera Bethlehem (1915) at Church House, Westminster, London, with Jesus {{born in a}} miner's cottage and Herod as a top-hatted capitalist, flanked by soldiers and police. The event caused much <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people of Glastonbury who withdrew their support from Boughton, causing the Festival Players to go into liquidation.|$|E
25|$|The Betancourt {{incident}} inflamed {{world opinion}} against Trujillo. Outraged OAS members {{voted unanimously to}} sever diplomatic relations with his government and impose economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic. The brutal murder on Friday, 25 November 1960, of the three Mirabal sisters, Patria, María Teresa and Minerva, who opposed Trujillo's dictatorship, further increased discontent with his repressive rule. The dictator had become an <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, and relations became especially strained after the Betancourt incident.|$|E
25|$|These {{eventually}} {{proved a}} considerable political <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Workers' Party, and in 1992 the leadership proposed {{amendments to the}} party constitution which would, inter alia, effectively allow it to purge members suspected {{of involvement in the}} Official IRA. This proposal failed to obtain the required two-thirds support at the party conference that year, and as a result the leadership, including six of the party's seven members of Dáil Éireann, left to establish a new party, later named Democratic Left.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} his {{appointment}} as Lord Advocate, he was Member of Parliament for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, England, from 1817 - 1818, for the Kilrenny district of Anstruther Burghs from 1818 to 1819. He made his Parliamentary debut {{during a period}} of considerable unrest in both Scotland and England in 1817, choosing to mark it by announcing the existence of a seditious conspiracy of weavers in the suburbs of Glasgow. The ensuing prosecutions were spectacularly unsuccessful, however, and caused considerable <b>embarrassment,</b> both <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government and <b>to</b> Maconochie himself, who, as Lord Advocate, was directly responsible.|$|R
50|$|In 1899, he {{organised}} and chaired {{a commission}} {{to draw up a}} petition to Queen Victoria, from anti-War politicians and intellectuals of Southern Africa, stressing the seriousness of the impending conflict. It included key information that was not disclosed <b>to</b> London by <b>the</b> British High Commissioner in South Africa, Sir Alfred Milner, who was intent on taking <b>the</b> Cape <b>to</b> war. Consequently Milner avoided delivering it. Molteno then used his family connections <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> petition - as well as Milner's private statements on his warlike intentions - <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British press and parliament, causing great <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> Milner and <b>the</b> Colonial establishment in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|Innumeracy, an {{inability}} to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance, plagues far too many otherwise knowledgeable citizens. The same people who cringe when words such as “imply” and “infer” are confused react {{without a trace of}} <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> even <b>the</b> most egregious of numerical solecisms. I remember once listening to someone at a party drone on about the difference between “continually” and “continuously.” Later that evening we were watching the news, and the TV weathercaster announced that there was a 50 percent chance of rain for Saturday and a 50 percent chance for Sunday, and concluded that there was therefore a 100 percent chance of rain that weekend. The remark went right by the self-styled grammarian, and even after I explained <b>the</b> mistake <b>to</b> him, he wasn’t nearly as indignant as he would have been had the weathercaster left a dangling participle.|$|R
25|$|Although he was {{frequently}} harassed and occasionally arrested for his dissidence, {{for a long}} time Gamsakhurdia avoided serious punishment, probably {{as a result of his}} family's prestige and political connections. His luck ran out in 1977 when the activities of the Helsinki Groups in the Soviet Union became a serious <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet government of Leonid Brezhnev. A nationwide crackdown on human rights activists was instigated across the Soviet Union and members of the Helsinki Groups in Moscow, Lithuania, Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia were arrested.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{despite some}} probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under Suleiman Baltoghlu could {{not enter the}} Golden Horn due to the chain the Byzantines had {{previously}} stretched across the entrance. Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened {{the morale of the}} defenders and caused <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sultan. Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Although {{corruption}} {{was hardly}} {{unknown in the}} Soviet Union, it became so widespread and blatant in Georgia that {{it came to be}} an <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authorities in Moscow. Eduard Shevardnadze, the country's interior minister between 1964 and 1972, gained a reputation as a fighter of corruption and engineered the removal of Vasil Mzhavanadze, the corrupt First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Shevardnadze ascended to the post of First Secretary with the blessings of Moscow. He was an effective and able ruler of Georgia from 1972 to 1985, improving the official economy and dismissing hundreds of corrupt officials.|$|E

2500|$|Flea {{has also}} {{appeared}} in television broadcasts with Red Hot Chili Peppers on several occasions. Several months before Frusciante's departure in 1992, the band performed two songs on Saturday Night Live– Kiedis felt the show was an <b>embarrassment</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> guitarist; he believed, that Frusciante purposely played the song out of tune and incorrectly. Later that year, the band appeared in the popular animated comedy The Simpsons on the episode [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled". At Woodstock 1994, Kiedis proposed the band perform the first few songs in metallic suits with giant light bulbs placed on their heads. Flea was initially reluctant but eventually agreed: [...] "...when we got <b>to</b> play, <b>the</b> energy {{of the whole thing}} took over." ...|$|R
25|$|Despite these {{crippling}} losses, the Tang recovered and, {{with considerable}} Uyghur assistance, held their frontiers. Tang dependence upon their northern allies was apparently {{a source of}} <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese, who surreptitiously encouraged the Kirghiz and the Karluks to attack the Uyghurs, driving them south into the Tarim Basin. As {{a result of the}} Kirghiz action, the Uyghur empire collapsed in 846. Some of the Uyghurs emigrated to the Turpan Depression, where they established the Kingdom of Qocho that freely submitted to Genghis Khan several centuries later. Ironically, this weakening of the Uyghurs undoubtedly hastened the decline and fall of the Tang Dynasty over the next fifty years.|$|E
25|$|He {{resigned}} {{when his}} home state of Virginia seceded to serve in the Confederate Army, first under Stonewall Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley, but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the Army of Northern Virginia, playing a role in all of that army's campaigns until his death. He established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions (during the Peninsula Campaign and the Maryland Campaign) circumnavigated the Union Army of the Potomac, bringing fame to himself and <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North. At the Battle of Chancellorsville, he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded Stonewall Jackson's infantry corps.|$|E
25|$|During May Day bank holiday, 2006, the Snowdown Colliery Welfare Band gave a free {{concert at}} the Bandstand. However {{only half of the}} {{building}} had been freshly painted by the Council, which was responsible for decorating the east side. This caused <b>embarrassment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> director of the Bandstand cafe bar, who had not been informed of the repainting plans or the concert. East London Brass gave a concert on 5 July 2009. Arcelia performed in the Bandstand for the 2012 Herne Bay Festival.

25|$|Khánh's deposal of {{the prime}} {{minister}} nullified a counter-plot involving Hương which developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to preempt his being deposed, Hương had backed a plot led by some Đại Việt-oriented Catholic officers reported to include Generals Có and Thiệu. They planned to remove Khánh and bring Khiệm back from Washington. The U.S. Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready <b>to</b> fully back <b>the</b> move as they regarded it as poorly thought out and potentially a political <b>embarrassment</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiệm, between Saigon and Washington.

40|$|One of {{the great}} public policy {{failures}} of the last 40 {{years has been the}} federal gov-ernment’s inability to prevent erosion of the corporate tax base through interna-tional transfer pricing.
