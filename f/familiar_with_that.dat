5|$|McGovern's wartime {{story was}} at the center of Ambrose's 2001 best-selling profile of the men who flew B‑24s over Germany in World WarII, The Wild Blue. It was the first time much of the public became <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> part of his life; {{throughout}} his political career, McGovern had rarely mentioned his war service or the medals he had won.|$|E
25|$|The passage makes {{reference}} to Dante's Commedia, which {{can serve to}} confuse readers not <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> work. It also anticipates aspects of Beckett's later work: the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the character's immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{agreeing on}} {{organisation}} and stewardship in general, disagreements arose upon {{the form of}} church government for the proposed national church. While the Swedish mission and the Tamil Lutherans was partial to an episcopal polity, it was not accepted by {{the representatives of the}} Administrative Council who felt that the local Chinese Lutherans would not be <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> form of government. There were also disagreements on the nature of apostolic succession as well as the significant differences in the culture, language and origins between the Tamils and Chinese who were ministered by the respective missions, the former consisting mainly of established Tamil Lutheran families while the latter consisted mainly of congregations of young individual Chinese who were first generation Christians.|$|E

500|$|Gosford Park screenwriter Julian Fellowes {{contacted}} King {{to present}} ideas for a script, {{and according to}} the producer, [...] " [...] seemed to have the whole movie planned out in his head so we told him to go ahead and write it. Three months later, this incredibly impressive screenplay showed up on our desks." [...] Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese. Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he was wary of copying [...] "the horror of biopics," [...] where there is simply an important event after important event. Believing it had been done before and that the audience was already <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> part of Victoria's history, {{he thought it would be}} better suited for a television series or for another film.|$|E
500|$|The score {{features}} some recordings by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, {{arranged by}} Yoshihisa Hirano, Toshiyuki Oomori and Kunihito Shiina. Hamauzu had previously {{worked with the}} orchestra on his album Vielen Dank, released in 2007. Four songs in the soundtrack include vocals by Mina Sakai, an artist whom Hamauzu works as a producer for. Two of the songs are in English rather than Japanese, and [...] "The Gapra Whitewood" [...] {{was intended to be}} as well, but during practice Sakai and Hamauzu changed it to use a fictitious language as they felt her focus on pronouncing the English words was detracting from the melody. The two English tracks were re-recorded for the English version of the game, as the localization team felt that they did not sound natural to native speakers. On three of the pieces from the soundtrack: [...] "Sazh's Theme," [...] "Daddy's Got the Blues", and [...] "Can't Catch a Break", described as jazzy pieces related to the character Sazh, Hamauzu's compositions were arranged by Toru Tabei, a friend of his, who Hamauzu describes as being more <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> style of music.|$|E

2500|$|TMEP § 1209.03(g) {{expresses the}} caveat that [...] "foreign words from dead or obscure {{languages}} {{may be so}} unfamiliar to the American buying public {{that they should not}} be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes." [...] Emphasis added. [...] "Descriptiveness is evaluated according to 'that segment of the purchasing public which is <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> language.'" [...] General Cigar Co. v. G.D.M. Inc., 988 F. Supp. 647, 660 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (quoting 1 McCarthy § 11.14, p.464-65). In that case, the court found that the strength of the Cohiba mark was not diminished by the fact that Cohiba is the Taino Indian word for tobacco, because the Taino language was an obscure language. The court noted: ...|$|E

However, [...] "foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public {{that they should not}} be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes."

60|$|Isaac hesitated. He {{realized}} that he had plunged far into the Black Forest. Here it was gloomy; a dreamy quiet prevailed, that deep calm of the wilderness, unbroken save for the distant note of the hermit-thrush, the strange bird whose lonely cry, given at long intervals, pierced the stillness. Although Isaac had never seen one of these birds, he was <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> cry which was never heard except in the deepest woods, far from the haunts of man.|$|E

60|$|It is said also, and I am apt {{to believe}} it, {{that he was}} very <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> holy father Pope Silvester II. and some charge him with personating Pope Hildebrand on an {{extraordinary}} occasion, and himself sitting in the chair apostolick, in a full congregation; and you may hear more of this hereafter: But as I do not meet with Pope Diabolus among the list; in all father Platina's lives of the Popes, so I am willing to leave it as I find it.|$|E
60|$|Professor Winchester {{also said}} {{something}} about there being no modern epics like Paradise Lost. I guess he's right. He talked {{as if he was}} pretty <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> piece of literary work, and nobody would suppose that he never had read it. I don't believe any of you have ever read Paradise Lost, and you don't want to. That's something that you just want to take on trust. It's a classic, just as Professor Winchester says, and it meets his definition of a classic--something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.|$|E

Although Mr. Wetherell had at one time been actually a resident of Boston, he received quite as many cautions from his neighbors as Monsieur Dumollet. Billets doux and pistols were, of course, not mentioned, but it certainly behooved him, when he should have arrived at that place of intrigues, {{to be on the}} lookout for cabals.|$|E
60|$|Thus it stands, plainly recorded, in {{the oldest}} {{tradition}} that, for any {{evidence to the}} contrary, the sepulchre may have been emptied {{at any time during}} the Friday or Saturday nights. If it is said that no Jew would have violated the Sabbath by taking the former course, it is to be recollected that Joseph of Arimathæa might well be <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> wise and liberal interpretation of the fourth commandment, which permitted works of mercy to men--nay, even the drawing of an ox or an ass out of a pit--on the Sabbath. At any rate, the Saturday night was free to the most scrupulous of observers of the Law.|$|E
