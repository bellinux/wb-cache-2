25|$|Poirot {{claims that}} he can solve the mystery within twenty-four hours simply by {{interviewing}} the suspects. During these interviews he establishes a timeline that seems impossible: Sarah King places {{the time of death}} considerably before the times at which various of the family members claim last to have seen the victim alive. Attention is focused on a hypodermic syringe that has seemingly been stolen from Dr. Gerard’s tent and later replaced. The poison administered to the victim is believed to be <b>digitoxin,</b> something that she already took medicinally.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} land plants {{evolved from}} aquatic plants around [...] (Ma) in the Ordovician period. Many plants {{have adapted to}} iodine-deficient terrestrial environment by removing iodine from their metabolism, in fact iodine is essential only for animal cells. An important antiparasitic action {{is caused by the}} block of the transport of iodide of animal cells inhibiting sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Many plant pesticides are glycosides (as the cardiac <b>digitoxin)</b> and cyanogenic glycosides which liberate cyanide, which, blocking cytochrome c oxidase and NIS, is poisonous only for a large part of parasites and herbivores and not for the plant cells in which it seems useful in seed dormancy phase. Iodide is not pesticide, but is oxidized, by vegetable peroxidase, to iodine, which is a strong oxidant, it is able to kill bacteria, fungi and protozoa.|$|E
2500|$|Altering {{the method}} {{in which the}} murder was committed. In the novel, Lady Westholme used a lethal dose of {{digitalis}} {{under the guise of}} an inconspicuous Arab servant to commit the murder. In the adaptation, the plan is much more elaborate. First, Dame Celia injects Lady Boynton with a drug that would slowly paralyse her, doing so under the pretense of swatting away a hornet. Dr Gerard drops a dead one and pretends to kill it to verify the fact that Lady Boynton had, indeed, been stung. While Lady Boynton sits atop her platform enjoying the sun, she slowly becomes immobile. Dr Gerard, who had injected himself with a drug that would simulate the symptoms of malaria beforehand, returns to the dig with Jinny to rest. Instead, he drugs Jinny and disguises himself as an Arab to plant a wax ball filled with the blood of a goat that he had killed under the clothes of Lady Boynton. That way, as the sun melted the wax, the blood would make it seem as if she were already dead. When Lord Boynton discovered his wife, Dame Celia went to [...] "check" [...] the body – in reality, she quickly stabbed the woman dead in front of everyone before Dr King could examine her. In this way, neither Dr Gerard nor Dame Celia could have been implicated in the crime as neither apparently would have been seen to {{have had the opportunity to}} commit it. Later, when Nanny Taylor has a mental breakdown, Dr Gerard gives her mind-altering drugs and drives her to suicide after forcing her to relive her past, making her feel guilty for delivering the beatings and punishments that Lady Boynton had ordered for her children. After Poirot explains the truth, Gerard injects Dame Celia and then himself with a fatal dose of <b>digitoxin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Digitoxin,</b> hypercalcaemia due to any cause can {{exacerbate}} the toxicity of <b>digitoxin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Digitoxin</b> {{exhibits}} similar toxic {{effects to}} the more commonly used digoxin, namely: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, visual disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias. Antidigoxin antibody fragments, the specific treatment for digoxin poisoning, are also effective in serious <b>digitoxin</b> toxicity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Digitoxin</b> {{and related}} cardenolides display potent anticancer {{activity}} against {{a range of}} human cancer cell lines in vitro but the clinical use of <b>digitoxin</b> to treat cancer has been restricted by its narrow therapeutic index. <b>Digitoxin</b> glycorandomization led {{to the discovery of}} novel digitoxigenin neoglycosides which displayed improved anticancer potency and reduced ionotropic activity (the perceived mechanism of general toxicity). Steroidal glycosides based upon this latter discovery served {{as the basis for the}} development of a new class of antibody-drug conjugate known as extracellular drug conjugates (EDCs) as first in class agents to treat cancer by the biotechnology company Centrose.|$|E

50|$|Acetyldigitoxin is {{a cardiac}} glycoside. It is an acetyl {{derivative}} of <b>digitoxin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Digitonin is {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} cardiac drug digoxin (sometimes also called digitalis or <b>digitoxin)</b> and both can be extracted from the same source.|$|E
5000|$|Scillitoxin or Scillaine is a {{chemical}} substance found in daffodils. It is a cardiac glucoside (a type of glycoside). with effects similar to <b>digitoxin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{presence}} of the cardiac glycoside <b>digitoxin,</b> the leaves, flowers and seeds of this plant are all poisonous to humans and some animals and can be fatal if ingested.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cardiac glycosides}} are {{powerful}} drugs from plants including foxglove and lily of the valley. They include digoxin and <b>digitoxin</b> which support {{the beating of}} the heart, and act as diuretics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Digitoxin</b> is {{a cardiac}} glycoside. It is a phytosteroid and {{is similar in}} {{structure}} and effects to digoxin (though the effects are longer-lasting). Unlike digoxin (which is eliminated from the body via the kidneys), it is eliminated via the liver, so {{could be used in}} patients with poor or erratic kidney function. However, it is now rarely used in current Western medical practice. While several controlled trials have shown digoxin to be effective in a proportion of patients treated for heart failure, the evidence base for <b>digitoxin</b> is not as strong, although it is presumed to be similarly effective.|$|E
50|$|Phytosteroids, {{also known}} as plant steroids, are {{naturally}} occurring steroids that are found in plants. Examples include digoxin, <b>digitoxin,</b> diosgenin, and guggulsterone, as well as phytosterols like β-sitosterol and other phytoestrogens like isoflavones.|$|E
50|$|Digoxin Immune Fab is the antigen binding {{fragment}} of polyclonal antibodies raised to digitalis derivative as a hapten bound to a protein {{and is used}} for the reversal of life-threatening digoxin or <b>digitoxin</b> toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Amobarbital {{has been}} known to {{decrease}} the effects of hormonal birth control, sometimes to the point of uselessness. Being chemically related to phenobarbital, it might also do the same thing to <b>digitoxin,</b> a cardiac glycoside.|$|E
50|$|The main toxins in Digitalis spp. {{are the two}} {{chemically}} similar cardiac glycosides: <b>digitoxin</b> and digoxin. Like other cardiac glycosides, these toxins exert {{their effects}} by inhibiting the ATPase activity of a complex of transmembrane proteins that form the sodium potassium ATPase pump, (Na+/K+-ATPase). Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in turn causes a rise not only in intracellular Na+, but also in calcium, which in turn results in increased force of myocardial muscle contractions. In other words, at precisely the right dosage, Digitalis toxin can cause the heart to beat more strongly. However, <b>digitoxin,</b> digoxin and several other cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, {{are known to have}} steep dose-response curves, i.e., minute increases in the dosage of these drugs can make the difference between an ineffective dose and a fatal one.|$|E
50|$|All foxgloves {{are highly}} toxic if eaten because they contain various cardiac glycosides such as <b>digitoxin,</b> digitalin, digitonin, digitalosmin, gitoxin and gitalonin. During digestion, aglycones and a sugar are {{released}} by the breakdown of these glycosides. The aglycones directly affect heart muscles and may slow the heart rate until cardiac arrest occurs.|$|E
50|$|Strophantidin is {{a cardiac}} {{glycoside}} which {{mechanism of action}} is similar to Digitalis, Ouabain and <b>digitoxin.</b> It specifically inhibits the membrane protein Na+/ K+ ATPase in muscle tissue (heart) {{which can lead to}} Ca2+ overload, diastolic dysfunction, arrythmias and ultimately to heart failure and death.Native African tribes used Strophantidin among other toxins as arrow poison.|$|E
50|$|Knowing this it is {{advisable}} to monitor those functions continuously using an EKG. As {{there is no}} antidote against bufotalin all occurring symptoms need to be treated separately or if possible in combination with others. To increase the clearance theoretically, due to the similarities with <b>digitoxin,</b> cholestyramine, a bile salt, might help. Recent animal {{studies have shown that}} taurine restores cardiac functions.|$|E
5000|$|Mairanovsky and {{his colleagues}} tested a number of deadly poisons on prisoners from the Gulags ("enemies of the people"), {{including}} mustard gas, ricin, <b>digitoxin,</b> curare, cyanide, and many others. The goal of the experiments {{was to find a}} tasteless, odourless chemical that could not be detected post-mortem. Candidate poisons were given to the victims, with a meal or drink, as [...] "medication".|$|E
50|$|Signature BioScience Inc. was {{the first}} {{biotechnology}} company based in San Francisco. It was formed in 1998 but closed in 2003 {{due to lack of}} funding. Before Signature was dissolved, it had just completed Phase II trials on <b>Digitoxin,</b> which the company was pursuing as an anti-cancer compound. However, the company's core competency was developing biotechnology tools that would be used to identify highly qualified pre-clinical leads.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} of cassaine and other alkaloids {{found within the}} Erythrophleum genus {{are similar to the}} {{structure of}} cardiac glycosides. The structure of Cassaine is shown below. This similarity to cardiac glycosides accounts for the similarity in cardiac activity between Cassaine and compounds such as <b>digitoxin.</b> [...] Generally, the structure of cassaine and other Erythrophleum derivatives are considered N-alkylaminoethyl esters of tricyclic diterpene acids containing a perhydrophenanthrene skeleton.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} {{pharmacologically}} active compounds are extracted {{mostly from the}} leaves of the second year's growth, and in pure form are referred to by common chemical names, such as <b>digitoxin</b> or digoxin, or by brand names such as Crystodigin and Lanoxin, respectively. The two drugs differ in that digoxin has an additional hydroxyl group at the C-3 position on the B-ring (adjacent to the pentane). Both molecules include a lactone and a triple-repeating sugar called a glycoside.|$|E
50|$|Digoxin {{elimination}} {{is mainly}} by renal excretion and involves P-glycoprotein, {{which leads to}} significant clinical interactions with P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs.

50|$|These {{research}} activities are continued within the DFG cluster of excellence REBIRTH („From Regenerative Biology to Reconstructive Therapy“) at Medical School Hannover with {{special emphasis on}} translation to clinical application. Bauersachs is chair of two clinical trials funded by the German Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF) in patients with heart failure: the study investigating the efficacy of Bromocriptine on left ventricular function in women with peripartal cardiomyopathy (PPCM) and the large endpoint trial DIGIT-HF (<b>DIGitoxin</b> to Improve ouTcomes in patients with advanced chronic systolic Heart Failure; EudraCT No: 2013-005326-38).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to advancing medical technology, Lown discovered new applications for two drugs that were widely used for cardiac problems: digitalis and lidocaine. Until the 1950s, digitalis poisoning {{was a major}} cause of fatality among patients with congestive heart failure. During a medical residency at the Montefiore Hospital in New York City, Lown demonstrated the critical role of potassium in determining the safe use of digitalis. His discovery led to abandonment of long acting digitalis drugs like <b>digitoxin.</b> Instead, the short acting digitalis glycoside gained universal acceptance. It also focused medical attention on potassium loss with the use of vavarious diuretics.|$|E
5000|$|Merck {{currently}} employs over 2500 {{people in}} its 4 R&D hubs via. Boston, Darmstadt, Beijing and Tokyo. In the year 2013, Merck invested over €1183 {{million in its}} R&D operations. [...] The focus of Merck's current pharmaceutical R&D is on oncology and cardio-metabolic care. In the former therapeutic area, its first marketed product is Erbitux (cetuximab), for which it has marketing rights worldwide, apart from North America. (Cetuximab was discovered by Imclone Systems, and is marketed in North America by Bristol-Myers Squibb.) Other products from Merck include Metformin, Bisoprolol, Levothyroxine and <b>Digitoxin.</b> Merck's clinical research strategy consists of a partnership with Quintiles in which the latter helps the former in the clinical development of all its compounds.|$|E
50|$|Neoglycorandomization is a chemoselective glycodiversification method {{inspired}} by the alkoxyamine-based ‘neoglycosylation’ reaction first described Peri and Dumy. This reaction proceeds via an oxy-iminium intermediate to ultimately provide the more thermodynamically-favored closed ring neoglycoside. The neoglycosylation reaction is compatible {{with a wide range}} of saccharide and aglycon functionality where neoglycoside anomeric stereospecificity is a thermodynamically-driven. Importantly, structural and functional studies reveal neoglycosides to serve as good mimics of their O-glycosidic comparators. The first neoglycorandomization proof of concept focused upon <b>digitoxin</b> where the rapid generation and cancer cell line cytotoxicity screening of 78 digitoxigenin neoglycosides revealed unique analogs with improved anticancer activity and reduced potential for cardiotoxicity. This platform has since been automated and used as an effective medicinal chemistry tool to modulate the properties of a range of natural products and pharmaceutical drugs.|$|E

50|$|Cardiac glycosides {{have long}} {{served as the}} main medical {{treatment}} to congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia, due to their effects of increasing the force of muscle contraction while reducing heart rate. Heart failure is characterized by an inability to pump enough blood to support the body, possibly due to {{a decrease in the}} volume of the heart or its contractile force. Treatments for the condition thus focus on lowering blood pressure, so that the heart does not have to exert as much force to pump the blood, or directly increasing the heart's contractile force, so that the heart can overcome the higher blood pressure. Cardiac glycosides, such as the commonly used digoxin and <b>digitoxin,</b> deal with the latter, due to their positive inotropic activity. On the other hand, cardiac arrhythmia are changes in heart rate, whether faster (tachycardia) or slower (bradycardia). Medicinal treatments for this condition work primarily to counteract tachycardia or atrial fibrillation by slowing down heart rate, as done by cardiac glycosides.|$|E
