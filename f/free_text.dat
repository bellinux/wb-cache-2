25|$|Walton {{looked to}} his {{predecessor}} Robertson for many ideas of his administration. Just as education {{had been a}} large part of Robertson’s programs, so it became with Walton. Walton passed through the Legislature Oklahoma’s first program to allow <b>free</b> <b>text</b> books to all students in Oklahoma’s schools and a grant of over $1,000,000 in state funds to aid weak schools. In true progressive manner, Walton instituted harsher penalties for breaking state laws and regulations, increased spending on welfare programs, and instituted a farm stabilization program {{under the supervision of the}} State Board of Agriculture.|$|E
500|$|The text centres on Psalm 74, with {{additional}} material {{drawn from the}} 2 Samuel, Genesis, and Deuteronomy. Unusual for Bach's early cantatas, some contemporary unknown poet added <b>free</b> <b>text</b> that makes reference to the [...] "new regiment" [...] of office bearers and the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany, Joseph I, as Mühlhausen was an Imperial free city, thus subject immediately to the emperor.|$|E
500|$|The text {{has been}} {{recently}} attributed to Christoph Birkmann (1703–1771), a theologian and student of Bach, by Christine Blanken of the Bach-Archiv Leipzig. He retells {{the topic of}} the gospel in the first recitative, and expands it to the journey, suffering and perils of the contemporary Christian, with a focus on the contrast between suffering on Earth and joy in Heaven. The two outer movements are unusually similar, both duets of the Soul and Jesus, using a hymn stanza and <b>free</b> <b>text.</b> The first movements includes the first stanza of [...] "Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid", published by Martin Moller in 1587; the last movement includes the second stanza of Martin Behm's [...] "", published in 1610 in the second volume of the collection [...] The melody is the same for both hymns and first appeared in Wolflein Lochamer's Lochamer-Liederbuch (around 1455). The poet's own verse for the two movements is also similar, as if the author expected the composer to repeat the music, but Bach set them differently, even contrasting.|$|E

2500|$|The Finnish {{government}} decided in 2005 that {{the fastest way}} to warn citizens of disasters was the mobile phone network. In Japan, mobile phone companies provide immediate notification of earthquakes and other natural disasters to their customers free of charge. [...] In the event of an emergency, disaster response crews can locate trapped or injured people using the signals from their mobile phones. An interactive menu accessible through the phone's Internet browser notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress. In Finland rescue services suggest hikers carry mobile phones in case of emergency even when deep in the forests beyond cellular coverage, as the radio signal of a cellphone attempting to connect to a base station can be detected by overflying rescue aircraft with special detection gear. Also, users in the United States can sign up through their provider for <b>free</b> <b>text</b> messages when an AMBER Alert goes out for a missing person in their area.|$|E
2500|$|From the 19 sites examined, {{four were}} found to be {{specific}} to certain diseases only and were therefore excluded from the study. Another four were excluded for reasons such as recurrent technical problems or connections to a specific hospital’s information system. [...] The remaining 11 sites did not provide patients with sufficient guidance as to how they should enter personal data. [...] Some of the sites allowed patients to select medical conditions from categorized lists which did not cover the patients’ complete health condition while others allowed <b>free</b> <b>text</b> entry. To formulate medication history, sites that required patients to choose medication from lists requested them to enter a wide range of descriptive information for each medication such as prescribed dose, administration frequency, start date, name of pharmacy that issued the medication and name of provider that prescribed the medication. With respect to laboratory tests, only two allowed patients to import results from outside sources. From these two sites, only one was functional. Not every site allowed patients to enter insurance coverage information. Majority of the sites required patients to enter date and results of diagnostic tests.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Information {{contained}} in medical <b>free</b> <b>texts</b> (such as patient reports or discharge summaries) {{is relevant to}} a variety of different retrieval, coding and inference purposes. It should, for instance, provide support for medical decision making, for mapping data into medical coding systems or for quality assurance of medical treatment. With the growing availability of medical documents in machinereadable form, procedures for automatically analyzing and formatting textual data gain more and more importance, because hand-coding and manual indexing are time-consuming and usually error-prone. Therefore, automatic knowledge acquisition from medical <b>free</b> <b>texts</b> is highly desirable for hospital data management. We currently port a German language text understanding system originally developed for the domain of information technology to the medical domain. In this paper, we will outline the basic methodological principles of our approach and illustrate them briefly with an...|$|R
