50|$|Cryogenic <b>deflashing</b> is a <b>deflashing</b> {{process that}} uses {{cryogenic}} temperatures {{to aid in}} the removal of flash on cast or molded workpieces. These temperatures cause the flash to become stiff or brittle and to break away cleanly. Cryogenic <b>deflashing</b> is the preferred process when removing excess material from oddly shaped, custom molded products.|$|E

40|$|A gasket or seal {{resistant}} to ionizing radiation and liquid hydrogen temperatures {{is made up}} of a laminated polyquinoxaline resin-fiberglass cloth body portion and a molded polyquinoxaline encapsulating film. The laminated body is prepared by stacking thin sheets of the resin alternately with fiberglass cloth and heating the assembly under pressure with the temperature, pressure and resin film thickness being controlled so that only partial impregnation of the fiberglass cloth is produced. The encapsulating resin film is preheated at about 300 f and applied to the laminate body by molding at a temperature of about 625 F. The molded gasket is then <b>deflashed</b> and post-cured by heating at 675 to 700 F...|$|R
50|$|Cryogenic {{deburring}} is a {{cryogenic process}} used to remove burrs and flash from plastic and die cast workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately -195 C) are achieved using liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry ice. This low temperature brings the material below its embrittlement temperature, which causes the flash or burrs {{to be easily}} removed via tumbling or media blasting. This process {{has been around since}} the 1960s to <b>deflash</b> plastic and rubber. Common materials that are typically cryogenically deburred with blast media include PEEK, nylon, Teflon, Delrin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acetal, PTFE, PET, HDPE, PVC, ABS and many others.|$|R
40|$|A {{foresight}} {{study has}} been successful conducted on minimizing leadless package leakage current to prolong the battery standby time. Nowadays, smart phone industry is booming in global marketplace and the latest metrics data shows a continuous rising. It can foresee {{that the market is}} looking for a longer and longer battery life. Package leakage current plays important roles for this need, especially for the minimization package with smaller lead pitch. A novel leadless package leakage current mechanism is built and concluded by an extensive analysis and process mapping etc [...] It is found that the backside thermoplastic leadframe tape composes of poly-amide-imide layer could be activated by die bonding & wire bonding process with a high temperature and a long duration. During the molding process, the activated tape reacts with the catalysis in biphenyl epoxy based molding compound (EMC) and result a slightly conductive surface with amide group on the EMC. It is well known that amide can be hydrolyzed in acid or base with the formation of carboxylic acid or carboxylate anions. With the considerations of the facts that the chemicals used for <b>deflash</b> is mainly composed of sodium hydroxide with a high pH value and the chemical used for plating contains Solderon acid which is very acidic, it was believed that the polymer chains containing amide group on the molding compound surface was hydrolyzed in proceed processes. After hydrolysis, the carboxylic acid would attract the Sn ions in the plating bath. The existence of these ions on the molding compound surface would cause the current leakage. Based on this novel leakage mechanism, three independent remarkable industrial solutions are suggested and proven. 1) Use non-PAI adhesive layer leadframe tape. 2) Use EMC without the catalysis which can activate tape & EMC. 3) Skip the plating process...|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} {{removing}} flash, known as <b>deflashing,</b> is commonly performed via cutting, breaking, grinding, or tumbling. Some foundries use robot autogrinders to remove this unwanted material. It is very typical for molders {{to have their}} operators trim flash with hand tools at the molding machine between cycles. Many molders and OEMs seek out the use of batch processes including vibratory tumbling, cryogenic <b>deflashing</b> or media blasting to remove unwanted flash from large batches of parts.|$|E
50|$|In other cases, {{cryogenic}} <b>deflashing</b> {{has proven}} to be an enabling technology, permitting the economical manufacture of high quality, high precision parts fabricated with cutting edge materials and compounds.|$|E
5000|$|Cryogenic <b>deflashing</b> extends mold life. Rather than replace or {{repair a}} mold (which {{typically}} involves downtime and high cost), the parts can be deflashed. This {{is typical of}} parts molded {{at the end of}} their product lifetime.|$|E
50|$|Parts {{are loaded}} into a parts basket. A cryogen, such as liquid nitrogen, {{is used to}} cool the workpieces; once cooled they are tumbled and blasted with media pellets, ranging size from 0.006 to 0.080 in. In some instances, {{cryogenic}} <b>deflashing</b> does not utilize a blasting action, relying instead only on the tumbling of the parts to remove flash on the outer edges.|$|E
50|$|Today, many molding {{operations}} are using cryogenic <b>deflashing</b> instead of rebuilding or repairing molds on {{products that are}} approaching their end-of-life. It is often more prudent and economical to add a few cents of production cost for a part than invest in a new molding tool that can cost {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars and has a limited service life due to declining production forecasts.|$|E
50|$|The {{parting line}} must occur {{along the line}} round the {{position}} of maximum dimension when viewed in the draw direction.pyeMany applications (seals, tight running molded parts) that require precision for shape control, call for removal of flashes. Secondary operations are thus employed, in addition to high precision molding dies to remove these flashes. Many molders will repair or even replace the mold tooling so that the flash is reduced to an acceptable tolerance or eliminated altogether. Secondary operations to remove parting line flash include hand trimming, vibratory tumbling, media blasting and cryogenic <b>deflashing.</b>|$|E
50|$|In wheel blasting, a {{spinning}} wheel propels the abrasive against an object. It is typically categorized as an airless blasting operation {{because there is}} no propellant (gas or liquid) used. A wheel machine is a high-power, high-efficiency blasting operation with recyclable abrasive (typically steel or stainless steel shot, cut wire, grit, or similarly sized pellets). Specialized wheel blast machines propel plastic abrasive in a cryogenic chamber, and is usually used for <b>deflashing</b> plastic and rubber components. The size of the wheel blast machine, and the number and power of the wheels vary considerably depending on the parts to be blasted {{as well as on the}} expected result and efficiency. The first blast wheel was patented by Wheelabrator in 1932.|$|E
40|$|<b>Deflashing</b> is {{the process}} of removal of excess flashes from the rubber products. Initially <b>deflashing</b> was a manual {{operation}} where dozen of workers, seated at small work stations would take each part and trim the excess rubber off with scissors, knives or by grinding. Still the same method is employed in most of the rubber industry. The drawbacks of this method are demand inconsistent and repeatable quality. Work done by hand is often inconsistent. There are commercially available cryogenic <b>deflashing</b> machine but they are too expensive hence cost effectiveness is also a prime factor. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a technique, to identify the media through which the flashes can be removed easily and effectively. Based on the test results obtained from testing of five different types of media, ABCUT Steel media gave best results. The testing of the ABCUT Steel media on rubber samples like O-rings, grommet tail door, bottom bush etc. shows good results...|$|E
40|$|Dam-bar cutting is a {{mechanical}} trimming {{process in which}} the dam-bar between the leads of an integrated circuit (IC) package after post-molding process and <b>deflashing</b> is pieced out. Premature wear of the dam-bar cutting tool leads to higher operating costs and loss of production. In this paper, an investigation has been made to study the effects of punch-die clearance, leadframe materials, tool materials, tool coatings, punch shear and cutting speed on the wear of dam-bar cutting tools. The relationships between the punch flank wear, burr height and the dam-bar cutting force are also explored. Hence, critical factors are determined to optimize the tool life and improve the quality of the dam-bar cutting process. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Blow {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important polymer processing method for producing plastic automotive parts. Yet, there are still several problems that affect the overall success of forming these parts. Among them, are thermally induced stresses, relevant shrinkage and part warpage caused by inappropriate solidification conditions. This work presents a finite element model that allows for predicting residual stresses and subsequent deformations that arise during the cooling stage of finished parts. It is expected that the virtual presence of the flash zone has an influence on the development of residual stresses in the numerical model. <b>Deflashing</b> is usually performed immediately after part removal from the mould, therefore, the numerical model is adapted to take this into account. Numerical results obtained with and without flash for a simple part, as well as a complex automotive part, are compared to determine accuracy and limitations of the model.

40|$|Dam-bar cutting is an {{essential}} trimming {{process in which the}} dam-bars in between the leads of Integrated Circuit (IC) packages are removed after encapsulation and <b>deflashing.</b> There are stringent requirements imposed {{on the quality of the}} sheared dam-bar edges so as to avoid the post-process failure of the package during assembly on to printed circuit boards. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the wear characteristics of the dam-bar cutting tools and their effects on the force and quality of dam-bar cutting process is reported. The correlation between the peak dam-bar cutting force and the tool wear was also studied under various combinations of wear states of the punch and die. Based on the experimental findings, relationships have been built to correlate the states of wear of the punch and die to the protrusion and burr height of the dam-bar sheared edge. Hence, revised tool life criteria were proposed for the quality control of dam-bar cutting process. The results of the analysis provide an important means for the on-line monitoring of tool wear and edge quality of dam-bar cutting process in the IC packaging industry.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{multi-stage}} forming process of a sling shackle, investigated {{with the use of}} finite element simulation. Used as a lifting connector during Floating Production Unit assembly and provision of supplies for petroleum platforms, Wide Body (WB) shackles endure severe working conditions in hostile environment. Providing high level of strength and toughness as well as outstanding fatigue behavior, hot forming {{is one of the main}} production method of shackles. Aiming towards process improvement and stronger shackles development, the main purpose of this study is, with the help of numerical simulation, to understand, predict and control all aspects that can be involved in the manufacturing of a WB 125 tons shackle. In close collaboration with forging industry Le Béon Manufacturing in Lorient area, forging experiments were carried out on a 0. 3 MJ friction drive screw press and at temperatures higher than 900 °C. In order to form both jaws, two successive sequences of closed-die forging and <b>deflashing</b> are performed. It follows an open-die forging stage to form the body. Finally, the crown is obtained using a ram bending process. The numerical model presented herein is developed using a fully coupled 3 D thermomechanical analysis and is conducted on Abaqus software. Tools are made of AISI H 13 with constant thermophysical properties. Mechanical properties of the 34 CrNiMo 6 used for the workpiece at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200 °C and strain rates ranging from 0. 1 to 1 /s were extracted from the literature. To describe the compression behavior, the Johnson-Cook flow stress model has been used. Temperatures, duration and kinematic movements have been recorded over the production of 80 shackles, and forging loads were evaluated by instrumenting strain gauges directly on the mechanical press. A particular methodology has been developed to perform successively the numerical simulation of the various forming operations with a unique workpiece. It combines a sequence of Abaqus/Implicit-HT, Abaqus/Dynamic-Explicit and Abaqus/Static-Implicit. In all simulations, convective and radiative cooling is taken into account and heat transfer between the tools and the workpiece is considered. As in the industrial process, workpiece stability and forging accuracy are obtained with the use of a manipulator modeled as an analytical rigid surface and a combination of springs to account for the recoil and shock absorption. A remeshing method has also been developed to thwart excessive distortion in the flash and the body...|$|E
