It commemorates more than 50 men associated with St James' who were killed in the First World War, throughout which the roll of honour was regularly read during the Eucharist. In 2014, St James' was part of a series of commemorations of the bicentenary of the death of the colony's first Governor, Arthur Phillip. On 31 August, a memorial plaque, similar in form to one placed in the nave of Westminster Abbey on 9 July, was unveiled by the 37th Governor, Marie Bashir.|$|E

BPI was a males-only mathematics, technical and science-oriented public high school, founded in 1883, which was then located on old Courtland Street just north of East Saratoga Street. It became coeducational in 1974. Its location since 1967 is at 1400 West Cold Spring Lane, a fifty-three acre tract of land bordering Falls Road, which is shared with the females-only Western High School.|$|E

[...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories {{about what is going on}} on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to what is happening in the news media. I just thought that this needed to go into a song." ...|$|E

[...] Wells himself used the phrase in an ironic way in the novel The Bulpington of Blup (1932).

2500|$|After Germany's {{diplomatic}} {{defeat in}} the Second Moroccan Crisis in 1911, Wilhelm II became the Schattenkaiser (the [...] "Shadow Emperor"), an increasingly reclusive figure who was seen less and less in public. The war further reinforced Wilhelm's tendency to avoid the public spotlight as much as possible. In private, Chamberlain grew disillusioned with his friend, complaining that instead of being the [...] "Aryan soldier king" [...] leading the Reich to victory as he wanted and expected him to be, the Kaiser was a weak leader as the [...] "Shadow Emperor" [...] was hiding himself away in deep seclusion {{from the rest of}} Germany at his hunting lodges. Wilhelm's hiding himself away from his own people during the war did immense damage to the prestige of the monarchy, and if the Kaiser's seclusion did not make the November Revolution of 1918 inevitable, it at least made it possible. As a monarchist, Chamberlain was worried about how Wilhelm was hurting his own reputation, and often urged to no avail for the Kaiser to appear in public more often. Chamberlain wrote in 1916 that Wilhelm had an [...] "absolute incapability for judging character" [...] and was now being [...] "forced to obey a Frankfurt pimp", the last being a disparaging reference to Bethmann Hollweg. Chamberlain was always very careful to avoid attacking Wilhelm in public, but his violent press attacks against Bethmann Hollweg caused something of a rift with the Kaiser who felt Chamberlain's very public criticism of the Chancellor was also an indirect attack on himself. Nonetheless, despite the strains the war imposed on their friendship, Chamberlain and Wilhelm continued to write throughout the war, but pointedly did not meet in person anymore, though Chamberlain's increasing paralysis also played a part. Wilhelm wrote to Chamberlain on 15 January 1917, stating: The war is a struggle between two Weltanschauugen, the Teutonic-German for morality, right, loyalty and faith, genuine humanity, truth and real freedom, against...the worship of Mammon, the power of money, pleasure, land-hunger, lies, betrayal, deceit and-last but not least-treacherous assassination! These two Weltanschauugen cannot be reconciled or tolerate one another, one must be victorious, the other must go under! In response, Chamberlain wrote back to Wilhelm on 20 January 1917, where he declared: England has fallen totally {{into the hands of the}} Jews and the Americans. A person does not understand this war unless he realizes that it is in the deepest sense the war of Judentum and its near relative Americanism for the control of the world-a war against Christianity, against Bildung, moral strength, uncommercial art, against every idealist perspective on life, and for the benefit of a world that would include only industry, finance, and trade-in short, unrestricted plutocracy. All the other additional factors – Russian greed, French vanity, Italian bombast, the envious and cowardly spirit of the neutrals – are whipped up, made crazy; the Jew and the Yankee are the driving forces that operate consciously and in a certain sense have hitherto been victorious or at all events successful...It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> of modern mechanized [...] "civilization" [...] against the ancient, holy and continually reborn culture of chosen races. Machines will crush both spirit and soul in their clutches.|$|E
