40|$|Registration is a {{fundamental}} task in image processing and quite a few registration techniques have been developed in various fields.

The image matching is performed by minimizing the length of the minimum spanning tree (MST) which spans the graph generated from the overlapped images. Our method also takes advantage of the minimum k-point spanning tree (k-MST) approach to robustify the registration against spurious discrepancies in the images.

Optical <b>image</b> <b>correlators</b> can play an essential role in applications such as machine vision, target detection, and pattern recognition. They have the advantages of processing a large amount of information in a parallel fashion. The joint-transform correlator {{is one of the most}} widely studied architectures that perform optical image correlation. 1 - 2 It is especially suitable for real-time applications when used in con-junction with photorefractive crystals. Over the past few years, a variety of real-time optical image correla-tors have been demonstrated by using either a spatial light modulator or a photorefractive crystal in the Fourier domain. 3 - 9 Although the technology of spa-tial light modulators has advanced rapidly, the de-vices still have poor resolutions compared with pho-torefractive crystals. Photorefractive crystals have the capability of real-time operation and an extremely high sensitivity for certain materials such as sillen-ites and compound semiconductors. On the other hand, owing to the nature of Bragg diffraction from the volume hologram, the photorefractive-crystal-based optical correlators have a narrow field of view, which is responsible for the lack of shift invariance.

Experimental demonstrations of several optical disk-based architectures are included {{to aid in the}} understanding of system limitations and performance issues. First we discuss correlation-based pattern recognition and {{describe the}} relationship between this approach and the neural paradigm. The need for invariances in image recognition leads to the notion of the reference image library. This approach is shown to be attractive in the case of limited processor and spatial light modulator dynamic range. We characterize the optical disk as a parallel readout device. An overview of optical storage media is included. Parallel readout of data from Sony sampled format media is characterized. We identify a match between the characteristics of the optical disk and the requirements for pattern recognition systems. Four optical disk-based <b>image</b> <b>correlators</b> which may serve as building blocks in disk-based pattern recognition systems are introduced. These <b>image</b> <b>correlators</b> are experimentally demonstrated and compared in terms of speed, efficiency, and sensitivity to noise sources and disk imperfections. We discuss advantages and limitations of these systems. We include a discussion of learning and generalization in neural networks. We present a new learning algorithm and discuss its generalization characteristics. Three disk-based systems for pattern recognition are proposed. The first is a correlation-based architecture. The performance of this system as compared with theoretical expectations is encouraging; however, data rate constraints suggest the investigation of an alternate approach. The next two systems are more neurally inspired and realize the k-nearest neighbor and radial basis function algorithms. An evaluation of the performance of these two systems is presented with respect to the handwritten digit recognition problem. Lastly, we present two candidates for future optoelectronic computing and pattern recognition systems.

40|$|The {{displacement}} (velocity) precision {{achieved with}} digital particle image velocimetry (PIV) was measured. The {{purpose of this}} work {{was to determine the}} precision and sensitivity of digital PIV using real rather than theoretical images atÂ  1 andÂ  2 Â mm spatial resolution. The displacement measurement precision was determined by measuring the RMS noise fromÂ  60 identical displacement distributions. This work is unique in that it uses <b>electro-optical</b> <b>image</b> shifting to create a repeatable image displacement distribution of random particle fields. The displacement variance between images is caused by the shot-to-shot variation in: (1) Â the particle-image fields, (2) Â the camera noise and (3) Â the variance in the correlation peak detection. In addition to magnification variations, the particle-number density, imaging-lens f-stop and image-plane position errors were varied to determine the best configuration. The results indicate that both the ensemble-mean and the RMS fluctuations of the image displacements are affected by these parameters and comparisons with results found in the literature are presented. The extents of these variations are quantified. This variance does not, of course, include errors due to random gradients and out-of-plane pairing losses, which exist in real turbulent flows...|$|R

Only over some Martian dune fields, such as Kaiser crater, meaningful migration speeds (>â€‰ 1 m/year) considering photogrammetric error residual have been detected.

40|$|Extraction {{of ground}} points using a basic stereo pair of {{commercial}} satellite <b>electro-optical</b> <b>images</b> typically yields vertical errors {{much smaller than}} expected. In particular, the magnitude of vertical errors relative to horizontal errors is significantly smaller than expected based on imaging geometry (convergence angle, etc.) alone. This paper suggests that temporal correlation or similarity of metadata (sensor position, attitude) errors between two same-pass images is the major cause of this phenomenon. It discusses the sources of temporal correlation, {{how it can be}} represented, and how an optimal ground point extraction algorithm detailed in the paper uses this representation in order to provide the best possible 3 D location and corresponding 3 x 3 error covariance for reliable predicted solution accuracy. This paper also provides an estimate for temporal correlation, approximately 0. 70 (70 %), and explains how this value was derived based on the ratio of measured 0. 9 p vertical errors to measured 0. 9 p horizontal errors compiled over many stereo pairs and ground truth points as described in various papers in the literature. As demonstrated in this paper, based on simulation and error propagation for typical stereo geometry, if this correlation is not accounted for, predicted 0. 9 p vertical error is approximately 60 % too large. Knowledge of temporal correlation is essential for reliable stereo accuracy prediction as well as proper modeling of a priori metadata uncertainty in the support of metadata adjustment in a value-added process, such as registration to sparse control or a block adjustment...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{radio telescopes}} are favouring densely packed array layouts {{with large numbers}} of antennas (N_Aâ‰³ 1000). Since the {{complexity}} of traditional correlators scales as O(N_A^ 2), there will be a steep cost for realizing the full imaging potential of these powerful instruments. Through our generic and efficient E-field Parallel <b>Imaging</b> <b>Correlator</b> (EPIC), we present the first software demonstration of a generalized direct imaging algorithm, namely, the Modular Optimal Frequency Fourier (MOFF) imager. Not only does it bring down the cost for dense layouts to O(N_A_ 2 N_A) but can also image from irregular layouts and heterogeneous arrays of antennas. EPIC is highly modular, parallelizable, implemented in object-oriented Python, and publicly available. We have verified the images produced to be equivalent to those from traditional techniques to within a precision set by gridding coarseness. We have also validated our implementation on data observed with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA 1). We provide a detailed framework for imaging with heterogeneous arrays and show that EPIC robustly estimates the input sky model for such arrays. Antenna layouts with dense filling factors consisting {{of a large number of}} antennas such as LWA, the Square Kilometre Array, Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, and Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment will gain significant computational advantage by deploying an optimized version of EPIC. The algorithm is a strong candidate for instruments targeting transient searches of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) as well as planetary and exoplanetary phenomena due to the availability of high-speed calibrated time-domain images and low output bandwidth relative to visibility-based systems.
