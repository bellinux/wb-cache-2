That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock {{the way in which they}} had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>way.</b> Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E
5|$|During the war years, {{restrictions}} on {{style and the}} demand that composers write in a 'socialist realist' style were slackened, and Prokofiev was generally able to compose <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>way.</b> The Violin Sonata No. 1, Op. 80, The Year 1941, Op. 90, and the Ballade for the Boy Who Remained Unknown, Op. 93 all came from this period. In 1943 Prokofiev joined Eisenstein in Alma-Ata, the largest city in Kazakhstan, to compose more film music (Ivan the Terrible), and the ballet Cinderella (Op. 87), {{one of his most}} melodious and celebrated compositions. Early that year he also played excerpts from War and Peace to members of the Bolshoi Theatre collective, but the Soviet government had opinions about the opera that resulted in many revisions. In 1944, Prokofiev composed his Fifth Symphony (Op. 100) at a composer's colony outside Moscow. He conducted its first performance on 13 January 1945, just a fortnight after the triumphant premieres on 30 December 1944 of his Eighth Piano Sonata and, on the same day, the first part of Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible. With the premiere of his Fifth Symphony, which was programmed alongside Peter and the Wolf and the Classical Symphony (conducted by Nikolai Anosov), Prokofiev appeared to reach the peak of his celebrity as a leading composer of the Soviet Union. Shortly afterward, he suffered a concussion after a fall due to chronic high blood pressure. He never fully recovered from the injury, and he was forced on medical advice to restrict his composing activity.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Bavinck, deeply {{concerned}} {{with the problem of}} objectivism and subjectivism in the doctrine of revelation, employs Schleiermacher’s doctrine of revelation <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>way</b> and regards the Bible as the objective standard for his theological work. Bavinck also stresses the importance of the church, which forms the Christian consciousness and experience. In so doing, he attempts to overcome the latent weakness of Schleiermacher’s doctrine of revelation through his emphasis on the ecclesiological doctrine of revelation.|$|E

25|$|Marie de France's lai was {{composed}} {{at a time}} when the story of King Arthur was not fully developed, and probably before the story of the love between Lancelot and Queen Guinevere had been added to it by Chrétien de Troyes in his Knight of the Cart. Thomas Chestre describes a 10-year period during which Launfal prospers at Arthur's bachelor court, followed by Arthur's marriage to Guinevere. In the 13th-century French Arthurian romances, Merlin warns against this marriage; in Chestre's poem, he arranges it, betraying Chestre's willingness to adapt an established legend <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
25|$|Klee {{has been}} {{variously}} associated with Expressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism, and Abstraction, but his pictures {{are difficult to}} classify. He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>way.</b> He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media—oil paint, watercolor, ink, pastel, etching, and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal foils, fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint. Klee employed spray paint, knife application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and mixed media such as oil with watercolor, watercolor with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.|$|E

25|$|After a {{prolonged}} absence, Stalin sent a telegram expressing {{the concern that}} Eisenstein had become a deserter. Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along {{to act as a}} line producer, for the film's problems. Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the film <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>way.</b> The furious Sinclairs shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to see what they could do with the film already shot, estimates ranging from 170,000 lineal feet with Soldadera unfilmed, to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet.|$|E
25|$|Mydland {{died of a}} {{speedball}} overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, {{leading him}} {{to believe that the}} band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists Vince Welnick and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's keys musically drove Garcia to new heights on stage. As the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a methadone clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> and return to making music.|$|E

The Sistine Chapel is precisely – if one may say so – the sanctuary of the theology of the human body.

[...] Unlike the Joker, however, Gordon emerges from his ordeal with his sanity and moral code intact. The story is also famous for changing how the Modern Age of Comics perceived Batman comics by bringing it back to its darker roots. The comic book, however, delves deeper in order to present Batman's own psychology - that he is, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> just as insane as the Joker, and that he and the Joker perceive the world according to differing points of view, with the Joker's interpreted through a joke.|$|E
