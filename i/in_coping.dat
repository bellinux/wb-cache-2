5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need <b>in</b> <b>coping</b> with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E

25|$|Crisis {{intervention}} {{is an integral}} part of school psychology. School administrators view school psychologists as the school’s crisis intervention “experts”.

These interesting kibbutz techniques are controversial with or without these studies.|$|E

25|$|Colorado Springs {{has many}} {{features}} of a modern urban area, such as parks, bike trails, and urban open-area spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities that experience tremendous growth, such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budget issues.

25|$|Dein and Littlewood (2008) {{suggest that}} an individual’s prayer {{life can be}} viewed on a {{spectrum}} ranging from immature to mature.

Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance <b>in</b> <b>coping</b> with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective {{has been shown to be}} associated with an individual’s passage through adolescence.|$|E

25|$|According to Percival Serle, Denison {{was a man}} of high {{character}} and a good administrator. In his early days in Tasmania he spoke too frankly about the colonists in communications which he regarded as confidential, and this accentuated the feeling against him {{as a representative of the}} colonial office during the anti-transportation and responsible government movements. He showed great interest in the life of the colony, and helped to foster education, science and trade, during the period when Tasmania was developing into a prosperous colony. In New South Wales his task was easier, and he had no difficulty <b>in</b> <b>coping</b> adequately with the problems that arose during the early days of responsible government in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} by Geraerts, Merckelbach, Jelicic, & Smeets (2006) {{found that for}} individuals with low anxiety and high desirability traits (repressors), suppressed anxious autobiographical events initially intruded fewer times than in other groups (low, high, and high defensive anxious groups), but intruded more often after one week. This difference <b>in</b> <b>coping</b> style {{may account for the}} disparities within the literature. That said, the problem remains that the cause of the paradoxical effect may be in the thought tapping measures used (e.g. bell ringing). Evidence from Brown (1990) that showed participants were very sensitive to frequency information prompted Clarke, Ball and Pape (1991) to obtain participants' aposterio {{estimates of the number of}} intrusive target thoughts and found the same pattern of paradoxical results. However, even though such a method appears to overcome the problem, it and all the other methodologies use self-report as the primary form of data-collection. This may be problematic because of response distortion or inaccuracy in self-reporting.|$|E
25|$|Creativity {{is viewed}} {{differently}} in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity {{more in terms}} of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity {{more in terms of}} the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being Arabic). The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps <b>in</b> <b>coping</b> with life's challenges, while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.|$|E
