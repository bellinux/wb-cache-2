The smart objects will automatically provide all the data related to it: geometry, materials, specifications, price, as well as manufacturers and theoretically any related data. Creating new objects {{is not an easy}} straightforward job, and requires more programming skills than previously needed. Taking into consideration the relative difficulties in learning to modify and create new CAD objects, this might lead to a new branch of learning, as the architecture students might not only {{need to learn how to}} use the CAD packages but also how to program it in a way that makes them capable of doing what they want rather than doing what the package allow them to do...|$|R

40|$|Many {{real world}} complex {{systems such as}} infrastructure, {{communication}} and transportation networks are embedded in space, where entities of one system may <b>depend</b> on <b>entities</b> of other systems. These systems are subject to geographically localized failures due to malicious attacks or natural disasters. Here we study the resilience of a system composed of two interdependent spatially embedded networks to localized geographical attacks. We find that if an attack is larger than a finite (zero fraction of the system) critical size, it will spread through the entire system and lead to its complete collapse. If the attack is below the critical size, it will remain localized. In contrast, under random attack a finite fraction of the system needs to be removed to initiate system collapse. We present both numerical simulations and a theoretical approach to analyze and predict the effect of local attacks and the critical attack size. Our results demonstrate the high risk of local attacks on interdependent spatially embedded infrastructures and can be useful for designing more resilient systems...|$|R

These entities only represented the geometrical properties of the architectural elements. With the present emerging generation of CAD systems, a new concept shifts a drawing-based model into a Building Information Model with the potential of modelling true architectural objects. Theoretically, these CAD objects will provide all related data to the designer describing the geometry, {{as well as any}} related data associated with how the object is actually used. The knowledge required to support an object should have structure to it. Different levels of knowledge need to be included, such as the geometrical information, which should be flexible enough to accommodate any type of shape and modification while keeping the objectis integrity as a unit and maintaining its relations to other objects. The CAD object concept, as remarkable as it is, might also have potential problems. It has some implications over the design process, as well as the architectural profession itself...|$|R
