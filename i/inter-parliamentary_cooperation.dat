In addition, the volume includes some cross-sectional entries on key issues such as parliamentary administration and <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>cooperation.</b> By covering a large number of aspects and cases, this collection provides a unique source for assessing the degree of actual parliamentary and democratic control of the European governance at the domestic level...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} note, we propose studying {{a new trend}} of Europeanisation in national parliaments within the European Union (EU). We argue that further integration, combined with the opportunities and challenges presented by the Lisbon Treaty and the financial crisis, created pressure on national parliaments to expand the scrutiny process beyond European Affairs Committees. In this new phase of Europeanisation, parliaments are increasingly ‘mainstreaming’ EU affairs scrutiny, blurring the distinction between national and European policies and involving larger numbers of MPs. Following {{a review of existing}} research on the Europeanisation of national parliaments in the post-Lisbon era, we propose studying four dimensions of mainstreaming: the rising involvement of sectoral committees in European affairs; the adaptation of parliamentary staff to EU policy-making; the growing salience of European affairs in plenary debates; and increasing <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>cooperation</b> beyond European affairs specialists. We argue that this trend has significant implications for research that studies the roles of national parliaments in the democratic functioning of the EU...|$|E
40|$|The parliaments in the EU {{are facing}} a choice. They may exploit the {{existing}} possibilities, continue business as usual (possibly with declining participation in <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>cooperation,</b> so no change), or bypass existing interparliamentary structures. The last and most extreme scenario would mean that some national parliaments, for example the six founding members or the Member States that have adopted the euro, create their own conference, with serious repercussions to “pre-in” countries, to the EU institutions, and to the inclusiveness of economic and financial governance. The second option (business as usual) does not help building a genuine Economic and Monetary Union either. Only the first scenario would help reduce the existing weakness in democratic accountability and legitimacy, both in general, and especially {{in connection with the}} genuine EMU in the making. An inter-parliamentary conference as a place to discuss these policies could have the positive effect of gradually becoming an arena in which the future direction of the Union’s economic policy is shaped...|$|E
40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon has {{strengthened}} the territorial {{dimension of the}} European Union by calling for respect of the regional and local self-government and by recognizing, for the first time, the role of regional parliaments in the subsidiarity control mechanism. Regional chambers with legislative competences {{have been given the}} possibility to participate in the so called ‘early warning system’ (EWS) in which national parliaments scrutinize EU legislative proposals in terms of their compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. This article takes stock of the recent experience of regional parliaments under the EWS in order to determine to what extent, if at all, the new subsidiarity provisions have enhanced the regional involvement in EU policy-making. It analyzes two opportunity structures through which regions can participate in EU policy-control, i. e. the national parliamentary channel and the Subsidiarity Monitoring Network of the Committee of the Regions. The findings reveal that regional participation in the EWS is considerably limited and disproportionate both between and within the Member States, thus bringing to light new challenges for the implementation of a multilevel <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>cooperation</b> in European affairs.

40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon has {{strengthened}} {{the rights of}} both the European Parliament (EP) and national parliaments in the European Union (EU) decision-making process. The EP has benefited from greater legislative rights and extended veto powers, which ultimately has implications for EU citizens, since most legislative decisions affect them directly. EU citizens are also represented by their national parliaments. The Lisbon Treaty acknowledges {{for the first time}} that national parliaments ‘contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union’ (Article 12, TEU). The Treaty provides them with the right to information directly from EU institutions and has established the Early Warning Mechanism (EWM) through which national parliaments can formally raise their concerns over subsidiarity infringements. Another important stipulation is that the Lisbon Treaty formally recognizes interparliamentary cooperation ‘between national Parliaments and with the European Parliament, in accordance with the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union’ (Article 12 TEU), which allows them to determine ‘the organisation and promotion of effective and regular <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>cooperation</b> within the Union’ (Article 9 of Protocol 1 on the Role of National Parliaments in the European Union) ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} the blossoming of {{the initiatives}} for <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>cooperation</b> currently observable in the European Union from a democratic legitimacy perspective. It {{shows that there}} exists numerous forms and settings for the cooperation among national parliaments (NPs) and with the European Parliament (EP) outside of the best-known and formalized inter-parliamentary conferences (Speakers’ Conference, Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union (COSAC), Common Foreign and Security Policy/Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) Conference and Article 13 Conference). There is, indeed, a rapidly growing number of formal and informal forums in which not necessarily all Member States parliaments, or the EP, are invited to participate. It is argued on this basis that while an increased participation of NPs especially to the European integration process can be positive and contribute to bringing ‘Brussels’ closer to the citizens, this evolution is not free of risk. If the number of inter-parliamentary initiatives continues to grow without order or control, their representativeness, legitimacy and in fine their impact {{is likely to become}} insignificant. Therefore, a re-recentralization and a strong reinforcement of their visibility and their clarity for the public in general are in order so that the benefits of such an increased parliamentary participation can be preserved...|$|E
40|$|Study for the European Parliament, Sub-Committee on Human Rights, EXPO/B/DROI/ 2013 / 20 The Lisbon Treaty has rung {{in a new}} era of {{democratic}} and human rights governance. In an attempt to redress concerns about the EU’s alleged democratic deficit and inability to speak with one voice on cross-cutting issues of human rights, both the empowered European Parliament (EP) and national parliaments (NPs) are meant to ‘contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union’ through <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>cooperation</b> (IPC). At the same time, the EU’s action is also poised to systematically ‘put human rights at the heart of all its policies’. Given the role of parliaments as ‘guardians and promoters of human rights’ at a time when their ability to influence the EU legislative process has significantly been enhanced, the question arises whether the EU’s ‘human rights turn’ may act as a catalyst for IPC, and whether this collaboration may, in turn, strengthen the effectiveness and legitimacy of EU human rights policies. To that end, this study maps the increasingly complex network of formal and informal IPC channels in the realm of human rights, assesses their respective strengths and weaknesses, and formulates recommendations to enhance IPC in this regard. nrpages: 58 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{national}} parliaments in the EU {{has been at}} the centre of a long debate. Since the Maastricht treaty, new powers to the EU level have been accompanied not only by an increasing role of the European Parliament (EP) in the legislative process, but also by a number of declarations and protocols to ensure that national parliaments received the information and documents required to effectively monitor their governments in EU affairs. The Lisbon Treaty extended the guarantees and also included new modes of direct participation. The proper use of the mechanisms in place, namely, the subsidiarity checks, the political dialogue with the Commission and the <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>cooperation</b> with the European Parliament, has become of vital importance in view of recent developments in EU economic policy and beyond. The choice for increasing inter-governmentalism in decision-making and the centralisation of the implementing and supervisory powers in the Commission and the Central Bank have raised questions about political accountability and the appropriate involvement of parliaments. However, the extent to which national parliaments should be more involved is also rather controversial. This essay examines the difficulty of defining and addressing the question of the democratic legitimacy in the EU. It examines the role of the national parliaments in the treaties and explores ways in which they can contribute to improving that legitimacy...|$|E
40|$|The more {{important}} governmental cooperation and bureaucratic involvement become in ESDP, the more pressing becomes {{the issue of}} democratic control of executive cooperation. This article starts from the argument that parliamentary involvement in decision-making is of central importance for ensuring the democratic quality of ESDP. It uses {{the notion of a}} multilevel parliamentary field to examine how parliaments at different levels are currently involved in ESDP. It turns out that {{during the past two decades}} or so no clear-cut privileged channel of parliamentary involvement has evolved in this field. Although national parliaments are of central importance due to the intergovernmental nature of decision-making, even they face severe problems in controlling executive decisions as their powers vary widely and both international cooperation among executive actors and military integration pose severe problems to control procedures at the national level. The European Parliament and various forms of <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>cooperation</b> complement the work of member state parliaments. While they provide opportunities for public scrutiny of European security policies and for information sharing, working relations among parliaments in the field are not without frictions. The more executive decision-making departs from the purely intergovernmental model, the more problematic the existing arrangements for parliamentary involvement will become. There will be no easy remedy as adjustments in parliamentary control will require careful attention to the relations of the different elements in the parliamentary field. democracy; accountability; institutionalisation; public administration; CFSP/ESDP; CFSP/ESDP; European officials; political science...|$|E
