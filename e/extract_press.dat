40|$|Automatic music transcription, {{in spite}} of decades of research, remains a {{challenging}} research problem. The traditional audio-only approach has yet to achieve a satisfactory performance for any computer-aided pedagogical system. Inspired by the high correlation between violin playing techniques (fingering, bowing) and the played acoustic notes, this paper presents a first attempt in visual analysis of violin fingering {{to compensate for the}} difficulties in audio-only music transcription. This is achieved by a robust multiple finger tracking algorithm and a string detection method that <b>extract</b> <b>press,</b> release, and fingertip position from the fingering video and automatically translate the fingering information into the played acoustic note, i. e., onset, offset, and pitches. Experimental results reveal high correctness in multiple finger tracking and string detection, thus paving the way for an improved audio-visual violin transcription system...|$|E
40|$|Some species like herring (Clupea harengus) are {{currently}} under-utilized {{due to their}} small size, dark colour and susceptibility to lipid oxidation. Our hypothesis {{has been that the}} high susceptibility of herring to oxidation makes it well equipped with natural antioxidants, both fat and water soluble ones. The aim of this thesis has been to isolate the water soluble antioxidants in terms of a herring light muscle <b>extract</b> (<b>press</b> juice, PJ) and to test the capacity of this PJ to inhibit oxidation in different model systems ranging from food to in vivo conditions. Attempts were also made to identify the tentative compounds responsible for the antioxidative properties. Herring PJ was fractionated into low molecular weight (LMW; 1, 3. 5, 50 kDa) fractions. Some samples were also heat treated (100 degree C, 10 min). The antioxidaitve properties of the PJ samples were tested and compared with pure antioxidants using a hemoglobin (Hb) containing washed cod mince during ice storage, in the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, in a Cu induced low density lipoprotein (LDL) assay and in a human monocyte model. The herring PJs were also exposed to simulated in vitro gastrointestinal (GI) digestion to evaluate possible changes in the ORAC and LDL oxidation assay responses. During optimization of the washed cod mince model, {{it was found that the}} starting cod mince should not contain > 20 mg alpha-tocopherol/kg and that cold setting (i. e pre-gelation) as well as too low moisture ( HMW-PJ > LMW-PJ. These results indicate a major contribution of the PJ protein fraction to peroxyl radical scavenging. All the PJs except the LMW-PJ also extended the Cu induced LDL oxidation lag phase and decreased the rate of LDL oxidation. Herring PJs also showed a capacity to prevent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in a human monocyte model. The results here ranked the PJs as PJ > HMW-PJ >LMW-PJ. In vitro GI digestion of herring PJs for 165 min, increased the ORAC values of the protein containing PJs up to approx 12. 5 fold and extended the LDL oxidation lag phase approx 1. 3 fold. Along with this there was a significant increase in formation of peptides that were < 10 kDa. When comparing all analytical data of non-digested PJs with those of PJ’s digested for 165 min, the peptide content, ORAC values and LDL oxidation had increased by 64 - 69 %, 121 - 161 %, and 112 - 115 %, respectively. This work revealed a strong antioxidative activity of herring PJ, however antioxidative properties of the PJ fractions are very different in different model systems. Non-protein compounds like ascorbic acid efficiently protected the washed cod mince against Hb-mediated oxidation during cold storage. However, such compounds had little effect in in vitro and in vivo models where instead the PJ proteins had activity. Using the ORAC and LDL-models, it was also seen that the antioxidative properties of the PJ-proteins increased after a simulated GI digestion...|$|E

For removing phospholipids following methods were used: water, acid, and TOP degumming process (TOP is a Dutch acronym derived from “Totaal Ontslijmings Process ” meanining total degumming process). After the water degumming, the amount of phosphorus was reduced to 70. 4 mg kg- 1 in extracted rapeseed oil and to 60. 9 mg kg- 1 in pressed one. The residual amount of phosphorus in <b>extracted</b> and <b>pressed</b> sunflower oils was 56. 9 mg kg- 1 and 50. 1 mg kg- 1 respectively. However, acid degumming process reduced the amount of phosphorus below to 11. 8 mg kg- 1 in <b>extracted</b> and <b>pressed</b> sunflower oils and below to 21. 4 mg kg- 1 in <b>extracted</b> and <b>pressed</b> rapeseed oils. The most effective degumming process was TOP degumming, that allowed to decrease the amount of phosphorus in pressed rapeseed oil to 9. 6 mg kg- 1 and in pressed sunflower oil to 4. 5 mg kg- 1.

40|$|Abstract: Oil from brebra (Millettia ferruginea) is the {{potential}} raw material for biodiesel production. The refining of crude oil requires a series of purification steps to produce quality biodiesel. The objective {{of the study was}} to produce refined oil from brebra seed for biodiesel production. Crude oil extraction was carried out using mechanical press and solvent extraction methods. Impurities of the oil were determined by standard assay methods. Solubility characteristics of precipitates were determined. The data generated from nature of solubility were used to design refining technique. The appropriate method was found to be hexane-ethanol refining techniques. From crude oil extract using solvents, 84. 66 % and 15. 34 % were pure oil and residue, respectively. From crude oil <b>extract</b> by mechanical <b>press,</b> 86. 83 % and 13. 17 % were refined oil and residue, respectively. The quantity of refined oil <b>extract</b> by mechanical <b>press</b> was significantly (p < 0. 05) increased than extracted by hexane. Crude oil contained 4. 4 % protein and 7. 2 % phospholipid. These impurities were responsible for the inferior quality of the biodiesel from crude oil.

5000|$|Breaking {{it down to}} its {{simplest}} formulation, {{the process}} that oilseed presses carry out appears is quite simple. Oilseed presses essentially extrude or ‘press’ vegetable oil from oil-bearing seeds, which include soybean, sunflower, peanut, safflower, canola, sesame, niger, castor bean, linseed, mustard, coconut, olive, and oil palm. The simplicity of this procedure is shadowed by the diversity of oilseed press designs that perform it. As seen in Table 1, oilseed press designs can be placed into the three major classes of traditional, manual, and mechanical presses. [...] Traditional presses include ghanis, water extraction systems, and other methods. Aside from the ghani, these designs are generally low yielding and particularly labour intensive. Moreover, all the traditional forms mentioned operate on a batch system. This entails that only a given amount of oilseed can be processed {{at a given time}} and, when the oil has been <b>extracted,</b> the <b>pressed</b> oilseed must be cleaned out of the machine.

This does not usually involve a thermophilic stage, and temperature is strictly regulated to avoid {{death of the}} earthworms (Karmegam 2012). In contrast, thermophilic or thermogenic composts have lower concentrations of plant-available nutrients (NO 3 −, exchangeable Ca, P, and soluble K) and significantly smaller and less diverse microbial populations (Edwards et al. 2006). Transplant media amended with 20  % (v/v) VC increased tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum L.) biomass but did not impact the growth or yield of field-grown plants (Paul and Metzger 2005). In contrast, the use of composted sewage sludge improved the growth parameters of tomato, cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and pepper (Capsicum frutescens L.) seedlings (Cai et al. 2010). Danaher et al.

40|$|Olive mill {{wastewater}} {{is produced}} in large quantities during the production of olive oil and olive production effluents are produced during the processing of olives. This project was planned to find a use for constituents found in olive production wastewater. The task {{was carried out by}} first characterizing the olive effluents, then screening microorganisms for growth in the effluents and reduction of the pollutant properties of the effluents. An investigation into the biotransformation of aromatic compounds present in the effluents into useful chemicals, was carried out. The olive production effluents were collected from different stages in the process for treating olive wastewater, viz, a fermentation tank (FB), the surface of a digester (LV) and an evaporation pond (SO). The three effluents were characterized by investigating their phenolic composition. Protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, coumaric acid and ferulic acid were identified in an olive effluent, FB, using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and High perfomance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Hydroxyphenyl acetic acid constitutes almost 60 % of the organics in olive effluent FB. Five bacteria, namely RU-LV 1; RU-FBI and RU-FB 2; RU-SOI and RU-S 02, were isolated from the olive effluents LV, FB and SO respectively. These isolates were found to be halotolerant and were able to grow over a broad temperature and pH range, with the maximum temperature and pH for growth being 28 °C and pH 7 respectively. A range of microorganisms were evaluated for their ability to grow and reduce the total phenolic content of the olive effluents. Among these Neurospora crassa showed the highest potential for the biological reduction of total phenolics in olive effluents. Approximately 70 % of the total phenolic content was removed by N. crassa. Trametes verscilor, Pseudomonas putida strains, RU-KMI and RU-KM 3 s, and the bacteria isolated from olive effluents could also degrade the total phenolic content of olive effluents, but to a lesser extent. The ability of the five bacterial isolates to grow and degrade aromatic compounds was assessed by growing them in medium with standard aromatic compounds. RU-L V 1 degraded 96 %, 100 %, 73 % and 100 % of caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-coumaric acid and vanillic acid respectively. The other isolates degraded caffeic acid and protocatechuic acid, but their ability to degraded p-coumaric acid and vanillic acid was found to be lesser than the ability of RU-LV 1 to degrade the same aromatic compounds. Whole cells of RU-LV 1 degraded vanillic acid but no metabolic products were observed on HPLC analysis. Resting cells, French <b>pressed</b> <b>extract,</b> cell free extracts and cell debris from RU-LV 1 cells induced with vanillic acid degraded vanillic acid, ferulic acid and vanillin at rates higher than those obtained from non-induced cultures. No products were observed during the degradation of vanillic acid. Ferulic acid was converted into vanillic acid by French <b>pressed</b> <b>extract,</b> cell free extract and cell debris of RU-LV 1. The maximum yield of vanillic acid as a product (0. 23 mM, 50 %yield) was obtained when cell free extracts of RU-LVI, grown in glucose and induced by vanillic acid, were used for the degradation of 0. 4 mM ferulic acid. Vanillin was rapidly converted into vanillic acid by resting cells, cell free <b>extracts</b> and French <b>pressed</b> <b>extract</b> of RU-LVI. Using molecular techniques, the similarity ranking of the RU-LVI 16 S rRNA gene and its clone showed a high similarity to Corynebacterium glutamicum and Corynebacterium acedopltilum. The rapid degradation of vanillin to vanillic acid suggests that extracts from RU-LV 1 degrade ferulic acid into vanillin which is immediately oxidized to vanillic acid. Vanillic acid is also considered as a high value chemical. This project has a potential of producing useful chemicals from cheap substrates that can be found in olive effluents. KMBT_ 36...|$|R

The column now often includes a sub-section called Pseuds Corporate, which prints unnecessarily prolix <b>extracts</b> from corporate <b>press</b> releases and statements.|$|R
40|$|Greater celandine (Chelidonium majus L.) is used {{internally}} as a herbal remedy besides external applications. It {{was supposed}} that the elements besides organic compounds in greater celandine also have favourable effect as adjuvants, therefore, {{the aim of}} the study was to evaluate the bioavailability of the elements. The element transfer through the gastrointestinal system was measured by in vitro model from the <b>pressed</b> <b>extract</b> into buffer solutions with different pH (stomach pH= 1. 1, intestine pH= 2. 8, plasma pH= 7. 5). It was stated that the elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, S, Zn) were able to be absorbed through the stomach-bowel system, since they passed through the membrane. The transfer of the elements from the latex into the different buffer solutions greatly depends on the element and the pH of applied buffer solution. The transfer of the elements from the latex ranged between 0. 9...|$|R
5000|$|In non-recirculating systems, the {{discharged}} hot liquid (usually water) {{is treated}} as a waste stream. In this case fresh cool water is used {{to make up the}} loss. Environmental considerations are making such [...] "once-through" [...] systems increasingly rare.These simple, but highly reliable pumps have a variety of industrial applications. They are used to maintain condenser vacuum on large steam-turbine generator sets by removing incondensable gasses, where vacuum levels are typically 30-50 mbar. They are used on paper machines to dewater the pulp slurry and to <b>extract</b> water from <b>press</b> felts. Another application is the vacuum forming of molded paper-pulp products (egg cartons and other packaging). Other applications include soil remediation, where contaminated ground water is drawn from wells by vacuum. In petroleum refining, vacuum distillation also makes use of liquid-ring vacuum pumps to provide the process vacuum. Liquid-ring compressors are often used in vapor recovery systems.|$|R
40|$|Pectin {{is used in}} {{a number}} of foods as a gelling agent, thickener, texturizer, {{emulsifier}} and stabilizer. Sugar-beet pulp, the residue left from sugar extraction, is a rich source of pectin. It was {{the purpose of this study}} to develop a procedure for the extraction of pectin from sugar-beet pulp and to improve the functional properties of this pectin for more potential uses. To <b>extract</b> pectin, <b>pressed</b> beet pulp was dried and powdered. Then, it was extracted under various conditions (pH 1 and 1. 5, temperatures of 80 oC and 90 oC and extraction periods of 1, 2, 3 and 4 hr). The highest yield (22. 35 %) was obtained at 90 oC after 4 hr at pH 1. Chemical composition of the extracted pectin and that of commercial citrus pectin were determined and compared. Also, the beet pulp pectin was used in certain foods and its functional properties were compared with those of the commercial citrus pectin. The effects of ammonium persulfate and high pH levels on the above mentioned properties were investigated. Finally, the effects of the beet pulp pectin and the commercial citrus pectin on the flavor of certain foods were evaluated. The results indicate that the extracted beet pulp pectin can be used in certain foods such as ketchup sauce as a thickener or as an agent increasing the viscosity; however, it does not have the ability to form firm gels in food...|$|R
