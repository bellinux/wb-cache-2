But these <b>disposable</b> <b>batteries</b> {{can only}} <b>be</b> used once. If they are recharged, the Zinc in the battery develops filaments called dendrites that grow haphazardly and disrupt battery performance, while the Manganese quickly loses {{its ability to}} store energy. CUNY Energy Institute is working to tame dendrite formation and to enhance the lifetime of Manganese {{in order to create}} a long-lasting, fully rechargeable battery for grid-scale energy storage. CUNY Energy Institute is also working to reduce dendrite formation by pumping fluid through the battery, enabling researchers to fix the dendrites as they’re forming. The team has already tested its Zinc battery through 3, 000 recharge cycles (and counting).

5000|$|A <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> {{a device}} {{consisting}} {{of one or}} more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy. Since the invention of the first battery (or [...] "voltaic pile") in 1800 by Alessandro Volta and especially since the technically improved Daniell cell in 1836, batteries have become a common power source for many household and industrial applications. According to a 2005 estimate, the worldwide battery industry generates US$48 billion in sales each year, with 6% annual growth. There are two types of batteries: primary <b>batteries</b> (<b>disposable</b> <b>batteries),</b> which <b>are</b> designed to be used once and discarded, and secondary batteries (rechargeable <b>batteries),</b> which <b>are</b> designed to be recharged and used multiple times. Batteries come in many sizes, from miniature cells used to power hearing aids and wristwatches to battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers.|$|R
50|$|An early {{example of}} regular use of human-powered {{electrical}} equipment is in early telephone systems; current {{to ring the}} remote bell was provided by a subscriber cranking {{a handle on the}} telephone, which turned a small magneto generator. Human-powered devices are useful as emergency equipment, when natural disaster, war, or civil disturbance make regular power supplies unavailable. They have also been seen as economical for use in poor countries, where <b>batteries</b> may <b>be</b> expensive and mains power unreliable or unavailable. They are also an environmentally preferable alternative to the use of <b>disposable</b> <b>batteries,</b> which <b>are</b> wasteful source of energy and may introduce heavy metals into the environment. Communications is a common application for the relatively small amount of electric power that can be generated by a human turning a generator.|$|R

The most up-to-date power density of available battery technology cannot match the needs of most WSN for long lifetime and small form factor, which limits the use of WSN due {{to the need for}} large batteries. It also has a slight possibility that the better batteries for small devices will become available in the next few years.

30|$|Electric power {{generation}} using renewable energy such as sunlight and wind is increasing.

Lithium ion batteries with high energy densities are expected to be used in large-scale power storage systems. Safety and reliability are strongly required for large storage systems, while lithium ion batteries present the risk of burning because of their flammable liquid electrolytes. All-solid-state batteries using non-flammable solid electrolytes are expected to improve the safety and reliability of lithium ion batteries.

40|$|AbstractCondition {{monitoring}} (CM) of {{wind turbine}} blades has significant benefits for wind farm operators and insurers alike.

40|$|Purpose: The {{demand for}} {{household}} <b>batteries</b> <b>is</b> considerable in the European context with just over five billion {{placed on the}} market every year. Although <b>disposable</b> <b>batteries</b> account for the largest market share in Europe, the use of rechargeable <b>batteries</b> <b>is</b> promoted as a less waste generating and a more environmentally friendly practice. A comparative life cycle assessment was therefore carried out to verify this assertion. Methods: The study compared, with a life cycle perspective, the use of <b>disposable</b> alkaline <b>batteries</b> to that of rechargeable NiMH batteries, considering the AA and AAA sizes. The comparison focused on the factors that were expected to have an higher influence on the results: consumer choices during the purchase for disposable devices (typology of battery pack, selected brand, which affects the production country, and mode of transport of batteries for the purchasing round trip) and during the use phase for rechargeable batteries (number of charge cycles and source of the electricity used for the recharge). The waste generation indicator, 13 midpoint impact indicators {{on the environment and}} the human health, and the Cumulative energy demand indicator were calculated in support of the assessment. Results and discussion: For waste generation, the choice of NiMH rechargeable <b>batteries</b> <b>is</b> highly convenient also with a reduced number of uses. On the contrary, for the environmental indicators and the energy consumption, the picture is less straightforward, being heavily dependent on the number of charge cycles. For the impact categories Acidification, Human toxicity (cancer effects), and Particulate matter, an “inefficient” use of the rechargeable devices (for only 20 charge cycles or less) could cause higher impacts than the employment of <b>disposable</b> <b>batteries.</b> Moreover, for the Ozone depletion, NiMH <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> hardly environmentally better than alkaline batteries even with 150 recharges. Conclusions and recommendations: The number of uses of rechargeable batteries plays a key role on their environmental and energy performances. When compared to <b>disposable</b> <b>batteries,</b> a minimum number of 50 charge cycles permits a robust reduction of the potential impacts for all the analyzed indicators excluding the Ozone depletion. Hence, the use of rechargeable <b>batteries</b> should <b>be</b> mostly encouraged for high consumption devices such as cameras, torches, and electronic toys...|$|R
