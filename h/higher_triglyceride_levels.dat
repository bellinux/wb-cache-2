40|$|Introduction: In {{cross-sectional}} studies, {{patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) than controls. However, their rate of progression of CAC and the predictors of CAC progression have heretofore remained unknown. Methods: Incidence and progression of CAC were compared in 155 patients with RA and 835 control participants. The association of demographic characteristics, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, RA disease characteristics and selected inflammatory markers with incidence and progression of CAC were evaluated. Results: The incidence rate of newly detected CAC was 8. 2 / 100 person-years in RA and 7. 3 / 100 person-years in non-RA control subjects [IRR 1. 1 (0. 7 - 1. 8) ]. RA patients who developed newly detectable CAC were older (59 ± 7 vs. 55 ± 6 years old, p= 0. 03), had <b>higher</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels</b> (137 ± 86 vs. 97 ± 60 mg/dL, p= 0. 03), and higher {{systolic blood pressure}} (129 ± 17 vs. 117 ± 15 mm Hg, p= 0. 01) {{compared to those who}} did not develop incident CAC. Differences in blood pressure and triglyceride levels remained significant after adjustment for age (p<= 0. 05). RA patients with any CAC at baseline had a median rate of yearly progression of 21 (7 – 62) compared to 21 (5 – 70) Agatston units in controls. No statistical differences between RA progressors and RA non-progressors were observed for inflammatory markers or for RA disease characteristics.

There were significant differences in the mean of waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride and fasting blood glucose in subjects with metabolic syndrome in different body mass index when compared with subjects without metabolic syndrome (p< 0. 05). The prevalence of high fasting glucose, low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, <b>high</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels,</b> <b>high</b> waist circumference and high blood pressure were 14. 23, 38. 57, 41. 57, 32. 96 and 5. 24, respectively.

40|$|Background: Metabolic {{syndrome}} is highly prevalent among adults in Chile and represents a health risk. Aim: To determine {{the relationship between}} metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, with C reactive protein levels (CRP) as an inflammation marker. Material and Methods: The population studied consisted of 736 individuals born in a hospital from Valparaiso Region, aged between 32 - 38 years {{at the time of}} the study. MetS was identified according to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines and inflammation was measured using ultra-sensitive CRP. This parameter was classified as normal for values from 0 to 3 mg/L, high for values from 3. 01 to 10 mg/L and very high for values > 10 mg/L. Results: Median CRP was in the normal range (1. 9 mg/L, interquartile range 0. 7 - 5. 2) and was higher among women than men (2. 2 and 1. 4 mg/L respectively, p < 0. 01). Twenty seven percent of participants had MetS. One-fourth had high blood glucose values, one-third had <b>high</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels</b> and 28 % had blood pressure values over those established as normal in MetS. Elevated waist circumference (WC) and low HDL cholesterol were found among almost 50 % of participants. A relationship between MetS and high CRP was only found among men with an Odds ratio (OR) of 2. 04 (95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 1. 11 - 3. 73).

40|$|Triglyceride {{levels are}} a {{component}} of plasma lipids that {{are thought to be}} an important risk factor for coronary heart disease and are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), alcohol intake, and smoking. This study used longitudinal data from the Bogalusa Heart Study, a biracial community-based survey of cardiovascular disease risk factors. A sample of 1191 individuals, 4 to 38 years of age, was measured multiple times from 1973 to 2000. The study sample consisted of 730 white and 461 African American participants. Individual growth models were developed in order to assess gene-environment interactions affecting plasma triglycerides over time. After testing for inclusion of significant covariates and interactions, final models, each accounting for the effects of a different SNP, were assessed for fit and normality. After adjustment for all other covariates and interactions, LIPC - 514 C/T was found to interact with age 3, age 2, and age and a non-significant interaction of CETP - 971 G/A genotype with smoking status was found (p = 0. 0812). Ever-smokers had <b>higher</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels</b> than never smokers, but persons heterozygous at this locus, about half of both races, had <b>higher</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels</b> after smoking cessation compared to current smokers. Since tobacco products increase free fatty acids circulating in the bloodstream, smoking cessation programs have the potential to ultimately reduce triglyceride levels for many persons. However, due to the effect of smoking cessation on the triglyceride levels of CETP - 971 G/A heterozygotes, the need for smoking prevention programs is also demonstrated. Both smoking cessation and prevention programs would have a great public health impact on minimizing triglyceride levels and ultimately reducing heart disease. ...|$|E

Total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apoproteins. A 1 and B were measured in imbilical cord blood samples. Results: No differences in total, HDL, LDL cholesterol, apoproteins A 1 and B were observed between the study groups. Triglycerides were higher in newborns with intrauterine growth retardation, compared to normal term newborns (45 ± 27 and 36 ± 19 mg/dl respectively, p< 0, 001). Differences in serum triglyceride levels respect to controls were observed in {{both male and female}} newborns with asymmetrical growth retardation. Likewise the differences respect to controls were observed in newborns with mild or severe but not with moderate growth retardation. Conclusions: Newborns with intrauterine growth retardation have <b>higher</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels</b> than normal term newborns. (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 741 - 8) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of smoking on platelets function, coagulation and lipid profiles in young males. Sixty young males (20 Cigarette smokers, 20 Shisha smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were enrolled in this study. Blood pressure, body mass index, serum lipid profile, means platelet volume, platelet count, clusters of differentiation and coaggulability were investigated. Results: There is {{no significant difference between}} the three groups as regard platelet count, mean platelet volume, Hemoglobin concentration, White Blood Cells count and Red Blood Cells count. High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower in Shisha smokers group compared with nonsmokers group. Triglyceride levels were higher in Shisha smokers group compared with nonsmokers group. Fibrinogen was significantly increased for the Cigarette smokers group and Shisha group compared to non-smokers (P<. 01). However, the Prothrombin Time was not changed significantly in the smokers groups. There was a significant difference in alteration of CDs markers expression in both Cigarette and Shisha smokers. The results of the current study revealed <b>higher</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels</b> and lower high density lipids-cholesterol levels in Shisha smokers group and significant alteration of CDs expression in both Cigarette and Shisha smokers compared to nonsmokers healthy male subjects...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Low plasma {{levels of}} cholesteryl ester {{transfer}} protein (CETP) {{are associated with}} elevated levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), but it remains unclear whether this translates into a concomitant reduction {{in the risk of}} coronary artery disease (CAD). Evidence exists that the effect of CETP depends on metabolic context, in particular on <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: A nested case-control study was performed in the prospective EPIC-Norfolk cohort study. Cases were apparently healthy men and women aged 45 to 79 years who developed fatal or nonfatal CAD during follow-up. Control subjects were matched by age, sex, and enrollment time. CETP levels were not significantly different between cases and controls (4. 0 +/- 2. 2 versus 3. 8 +/- 2. 1 mg/L, P= 0. 07). CETP levels were significantly related to plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL-C. The risk of CAD increased with increasing CETP quintiles (P for linearity= 0. 02), such that subjects in the highest quintile had an adjusted OR of 1. 43 (95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 99, P= 0. 03) versus those in the lowest. Among individuals with <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels</b> below the median (1. 7 mmol/L), no relationship between CETP levels and CAD risk was observed (P for linearity= 0. 5), but this relationship was strong among those with <b>high</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels</b> (P for linearity= 0. 02), such that those in the highest CETP quintile had an OR of 1. 87 (95 % CI 1. 06 to 3. 30, P= 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CETP levels are associated with an increasing risk of future CAD in apparently healthy individuals, but only in those with <b>high</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>level...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the metabolic syndrome may predict cardiovascular disease and the occurrence of sudden death, independent of the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the metabolic syndrome among Turkmen women in this area. Material and Methods: The present study consisted of 160 Turkmen women. Baseline data and prevalence of metabolic syndrome and the components of metabolic syndrome in Turkmen women were determined. Observations and Results: The prevalence of high levels of fasting glucose, low levels of high density lipoproteincholesterol, <b>high</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels,</b> <b>high</b> waist circumference and high blood pressure were shown to be 29. 37 %, 70. 62 %, 35. 62 %, 75 % and 26. 25 %, respectively. It was shown that high waist circumference (75 %) and Low HDL-cholesterol levels (70. 62 %) were the most frequent characteristics in comparison to other metabolic components. The prevalence of high waist circumference, <b>high</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels,</b> <b>high</b> levels of fasting glucose, high blood pressure and BMIs which were â�¥ 25 were higher in subjects with metabolic syndrome (92. 85 %, 73. 21 %, 73. 21 %, 57. 14 % and 83. 92 %, respectively). Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome is more prevalent among Turkmen women. Our data has shown that the prevalence of abnormal waist circumference in this ethnic group was highest. The waist circumference can be used as a predictor for cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome {{is present in}} approximately 20 % of general populations in developed countries and in approximately 80 % of people with type 2 diabetes. <b>High</b> <b>triglyceride</b> <b>levels,</b> low high-density cholesterol levels and central obesity are {{three of the five}} features of the {{metabolic syndrome}} and contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among people with the metabolic syndrome.
