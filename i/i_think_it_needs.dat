40|$|Background: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aims {{to expand}} {{coverage}} to the uninsured, improve quality, and contain costs. The {{goal of this}} study was to ascertain how plastic surgeons perceive the ACA. Methods: An electronic questionnaire was e-mailed to members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons between May and June 2014. The survey was anonymous and voluntary and included questions to assess understanding and opinions of the ACA. Results: The survey was sent to 3070 members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, and the response rate was 17 %. Sixty-eight percent agree or strongly agree that they understand the basic concepts of the ACA. The majority of respondents disagree (38 % strongly disagree, 31 % disagree) with the notion that the ACA will positively affect their practice, and 51 % agree with the statement, “I do not support the ACA, and I believe it did too much. ” Two thirds (66 %) believe that the ACA deserves a grade of D or F. When answers were analyzed across demographics, 42 % of respondents with “Academic” practice background identify with the statement, “I support the ACA but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> more work,” compared to 15 % of those who selected “Solo Practice” (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: The ACA will affect all specialties, including plastic surgery. The results of this survey suggest that many plastic surgeons believe that they have a baseline understanding of current health-care reform. The majority of surveyed surgeons do not support the Act. It is imperative that plastic surgeons possess the knowledge of the ACA; its changes, both current and impending, will likely affect patient mix, coverage of procedures, and reimbursement...|$|E
40|$|In postwar Japan {{the studies}} on {{personnel}} administration have developed considerably and many books concerning this field have been issued. However <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> {{the historical and}} comparative studies on the theories of it in every countries to intensify the study. This essay intents to generalize the theories in U. S. A., England and Germany, and find the characteristics of them. It contains the follow-(1) preface (the intents of this essay), (2) the reviewing of the principal opinions of personnel administration in U. S. A., (3) the reviewing of the principal opinions of personnel administration in England, (4) the reviewing of the principal opinions of personnel administration in Germany, (5) the temporary conclusions. I picked up the following books as the principal books in U. S. A.; O. Tead and H. C. Metcalf, Personnel Administration, its Principles and Practice, 1920, Dale Yoder, Personnel Management and Industrial Relations, 1938, P. Pigors and C. A. Myers, Personnel Administration -a Point of View and a Method, 1947, and W. H. Knowles, Personnel Management - a Human Relations Approach, 1955. In Ensgland; - O. Sheldon, The Philosophy of Management, 1924, K. G. Fenelon, Management and Labour, 1939, and C. H. Northcott, Personnel Management. Principles and Practice, 1955. In Germany; - K. Mellerowicz, Allgemeine Betriebswirtschaftslehre (zweite, verbesserte auflage) 1932, K. C. Thalheim, Sozialpolitik und Sozialreform bei Abbe, Rathenau und Ford, 1929, F. Baumgarten, Psychologie der Menschenbehandlung in Betriebe, Erich Gutenberg, Grundlagen der Betriebswirtschaftslehre, Bd. I, Die Produktion, Zweite Auflage, 1955, E. Bramesfeld u. a., Betrieb und Arbeitswissenschaften, 1954, and Erich Potthoff, Personalwesen, in: Hdb. D. Wirtschaftswisseiischaft, Bd. I, Betriebswirtschaft, 1958. After reviewing these books, I have attained to the temporary conclusions as follow : (1) the essential purpose of Personnel Administ ration is the efficiency of indivisual worker, groups of employees, or business. (2) However it has not presented itself always directly or clearly. Before the 2 nd World War, it had set forth itself, but after the war the building of work-team or the achieving cooperation has become {{to the purpose of}} Personnel Administration. But ultimately the achieving cooperation attributs to the efficiency of business. (3) The elemental contents of personnel administrations systems are similar in every countries; employment management, education and training, workingtime, safty and health, wage administration, human relations management and labor relations. But the significance of every plans is different in each country, for instance in U. S. A., employment management and human relations management are attached great importance, however in England working-conditions and joint consultation plan, in Germany welfare facilities and joint management plan. (4) I think it shall be very difficult to find the reasons why these differences have grown, however it is our important theme hereafter to make them clear...|$|E
40|$|Twentieth century (western) {{societies}} are increasingly individualised. This {{is not only}} reflected in general politics, opinions and lifestyles but also in healthcare. Partly this {{is a result of}} an increased knowledge about the human genome, allowing for more individualised treatment plans (‘personalised or precision medicine’), and partly because of scarce healthcare resources resulting in increased self‐management and more patient responsibility for their own health. A welcome side effect of this individualisation is an increased attention to the person behind the patient and, related to this, more attention to individual needs and preferences in treatment and care. This person‐centred movement is not new, but has so far been captured through discourses of patient‐centredness (in contrast to doctor‐ or disease‐centredness) and patients’ rights, which already represent important paradigm shifts in healthcare. Person‐centredness has, however, continued to develop and also incorporates concepts like positive health, wellbeing and individualised care planning as well as the inclusion of the person of the healthcare provider. Person‐centredness can thus be summarised as promoting care of the person (of the totality of the person’s health, including its ill and positive aspects), for the person (promoting the fulfilment of the person’s life project), by the person (with clinicians extending themselves as full human beings with high ethical aspirations) and with the person (working respectfully, in collaboration and in an empowering manner) (Mezzich et al., 2009). Person‐centredness implies recognition of the broad biological, social, psychological, cultural and spiritual dimensions of each person, their families and communities. The person‐centred approach is closely linked to Carl Rogers’ humanistic psychology and person‐centred therapy (Rogers, 1961) with a focus on the fulfilment of personal potentials including sociability, the need to be with other human beings and a desire to know and be known by other people (the origins of personcentredness will be further explored in Chapter 2). It also includes being open to experience, being trusting and trustworthy, being curious about the world, being creative and compassionate. This perspective has been particularly influential in the field of dementia care. Person‐centredness has permeated all fields in healthcare. For example, person‐centred nursing has been defined as an approach to practice that is established through the formation and fostering of healthful relationships between all care providers, patients/clients/families and significant others (McCormack and McCance, 2017). It is underpinned by values of respect for persons, individual right to self‐determination, and mutual respect and understanding. Person‐centred nursing practice is about developing, coordinating and providing healthcare services that respect the uniqueness of individuals by focusing on their beliefs, values, desires and wishes, independent of age, gender, social status, economy, faith, ethnicity and cultural background and in a context that includes collaborative and inclusive practices. In addition, person‐centred nursing practice aims to plan and deliver care that takes account of the person’s context including their social context, community networks, cultural norms and material supports. Person‐centred medicine is anchored in a broad and holistic approach that is critical of the modern development of medicine, which has been dominated by reductionism, attention to disease, super‐specialisation, commoditisation and commercialism (Mezzich et al., 2009). These authors argue that this has resulted in less attention being paid to ‘whole‐person needs’ and reduced focus on the ethical imperatives connected to promoting the autonomy, responsibility and dignity of every person involved. Changes in the delivery of healthcare services have been significant over the past 25 years. The increasing demands on emergency services, {{reduction in the number of}} available hospital beds, shorter lengths of stay, increased throughput and the erosion of Health Services’ commitment to the provision of continuing healthcare have all impacted on the way healthcare services are provided and the practice of healthcare professionals. In addition, the prevailing culture of consumerism has enabled a shift away from society’s collective responsibility for the provision of an equitable and just healthcare system to one that is based on individual responsibility, increasingly more complex models of insurance‐based services and a growth in healthcare as a private for‐profit business. The combined effects of these strategic changes to healthcare globally, major changes to the organisation of services, a dominant focus on standardisation and risk reduction with associated limits on the potential for creative practice have all had an impact on the ability of healthcare practitioners to develop person‐centred approaches. McCormack (2001) suggested that there was a need for ‘a cultural shift in philosophical values’ in healthcare if authentic person‐centred healthcare is to be realised for all persons. The following quote from one of the participants in McCormack’s research highlighted the need for this shift: …people need to be able to take on a different view of things and able to see a different kind of potential when the whole system is kind of set up in a particular way and how do you change it? Because you’ve got teachers and educators and you’ve got role models and supervisors and people in clinical settings who have all been socialised in this system and what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> is actually a complete culture shift, a shift in philosophical values, to see people as people who have responsibility for their own health and come into a system that should not totally remove that, that kind of ownership… Since then there have been significant developments globally in advancing person‐centred healthcare within a dominant philosophy of people as persons who have responsibility for their own health.
