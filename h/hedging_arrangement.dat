5000|$|In March 2000, Enron {{decided to}} {{terminate}} the <b>hedging</b> <b>arrangement</b> with Swap Sub. Fastow managed to persuade Enron to pay Swap Sub a $30 million fee {{to terminate the}} option and recover the Enron stock it owned, even though, because of {{a decline in the}} price of the Rhythms stock, [...] "Swap Sub owed Enron a ton of money". $10 million of the payment went to Credit Suisse First Boston; Fastow falsely claimed to Enron that the other $20 million would go to NatWest, but in fact only $1 million did so. The payment, which was formally agreed on 22 March 2000, resulted in large profits for Swap Sub, enriching several Enron employees who had acquired ownership interests in the partnership.|$|E

It is five minutes by car from Warrington town centre. There is ongoing active management of the hedgerows which include thinning and laying of the various edges. Hawthorns also grow in an orchard area rather than the more useful <b>hedge</b> <b>arrangement.</b> There are various paths around the perimeter and crossing the meadows that are open and closed at various times dependent on conservation projects.|$|R
