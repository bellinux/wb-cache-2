Various research topics as data acquisition, fusion, diagnostics, prognostics and decision {{are involved in}} this domain. This paper presents an approach to <b>estimate</b> the Remaining <b>Useful</b> <b>Life</b> of equipment based on shapelet extraction. This approach makes use, in an offline step, of a history of run-to-failure data to extract discriminative rul-shapelets, i. e. patterns that are correlated with the RUL of the considered equipment. A library of rul-shapelets is hence extracted at this step. Then, in an online step, these rul-shapelets are compared to testing units and the ones that match these units are used to estimate their RULs. Therefore, the RUL estimation of a testing unit is based on patterns that have been selected for their high correlation with the RUL. This approach is hence different from classical similaritybased approaches that attempt to match complete testing units (or only late instants of testing units) with training ones to estimate the RUL.

40|$|Compared to the {{traditional}} light sources, applications of LED lights are continuously increasing as they have many advantages including high reliability, greater energy efficiency, long life time, small in size, and faster switching speed. Even though LEDs have high reliability and long life time, manufacturers and lighting systems designers still need to assess the reliability of LED lighting systems and the failures in the LED. This is very important {{with respect to the}} maintainability of the LED lighting systems after the deployment. In particular assessing the reliability of the LED lighting systems which are used for safety critical and emergency applications is a requirement to ensure the light output meets the standards all the time.

The new vehicles were also to be capable of being used on main lines, which required an increase in their top speed, stronger brake systems and greater comfort compared with the railbuses, but which were not to be more expensive to run than a railbus. In 1974, only 2 years later, Waggonfabrik Uerdingen and MaK demonstrated the prototypes of the two-unit Class 628.0 and also a single-coach variant, the Class 627, for use on routes with lower numbers of passengers. The vehicles were tested and proved themselves exceptionally well, even though the lack of the power from the engines was already apparent on occasions. Initially it did not go into production, because for political reasons local passenger rail services were just being reorganised and it was not yet clear, which and how many vehicles would be needed. So the Class 628 project stalled for almost four years.|$|E
