25|$|Earlier in {{the same}} year, 71 BC, Marcus Lucullus also played a minor role in the defeat of Spartacus' slave army. He was prematurely {{recalled}} from his post in Macedonia in order {{to assist with the}} suppression of the rebellious slaves. At the time, Spartacus had just managed to force his way through Crassus' troops that had him cornered near Rhegium, across from Sicily, and made his way to Brundisium, across from Greece, presumably to sail from there to Greece or Illyrium. Yet when he received the news that Marcus Lucullus and his troops had already landed in Brundisium, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> faced Crassus' pursuing army for the final and decisive battle of the war.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and Jameses {{went into the}} living room before {{traveling}} to Platte City for a robbery. From the newspaper, James had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords had not told him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized they were there to betray him. Instead of confronting them, James walked across the living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom {{planned to}} launch a two-pronged attack on Madrid {{in the fall of}} 1809. In the west, Del Parque's Army of the Left enjoyed some success against Marchand's weak VI Corps. When the Spanish general learned that the other {{offensive}} prong had been crushed at Ocaña, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> began retreating rapidly to the south. At the same time, Marchand was reinforced by a dragoon division under Kellermann. Taking command, Kellermann raced in pursuit of the Army of the Left, catching up with it at Alba de Tormes. Not waiting for their own foot soldiers, the French dragoons and light cavalry fell upon the Spanish infantry and defeated it. Marchand's infantry arrived in time to mop up, but the cavalry had done most of the fighting. Del Parque's men retreated into the mountains where they spent a miserable few months.|$|E

500|$|When Selman returned, Scully scolded him {{and told}} him that he had to {{apologize}} to the mayor of East St. Louis, who, unbeknownst to Selman, was portrayed by Marc Wilmore. Wilmore, a former writer on the television comedy The PJ's, had been asked by Scully to participate in a practical joke, in which he would play the mayor of East St. Louis and confront Selman about his controversial statement. According to Selman, Wilmore gave an [...] "Oscar-worthy performance". [...] "I was terrified", he stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, [...] " [...] a twenty-minute discussion in which [...] said that [...] children were teased at school , and that the Fox affiliate were gonna be thrown off the air..." [...] According to Wilmore, Selman immediately blamed the other writers. Said Selman, [...] "Well, everyone participates, you know [...] Have you never heard of the word 'collaboration'?" [...] Selman realized the joke when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> saw [...] "all the other writers laughing". [...] "I was so relieved", he said, [...] "I was soaked with sweat [...] I had betrayed my fellow writers, tried to get them in trouble, and they all knew me for the turn-coat that I was." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in early 1998. In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> {{said he wanted to}} do his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
500|$|In First Test at Brisbane Tallon {{took two}} catches but scored only 14 in a victory. Tallon {{was worried that}} his poor batting might lead to him being replaced, but he was {{retained}} as Australia secured an innings victory in Sydney. He put in a polished performance with the gloves, with four catches and two stumpings, in addition to 30runs. The only negative aspect of the match for Tallon was that he dislocated his finger. Beyond the raw statistics, two of the catches that Tallon made in the first innings were regarded as among his finest ever and turned the tide of the match. Len Hutton and Bill Edrichtwo of England's leading batsmenhad seen their team to lunch with only the loss of one wicket. Tallon declared to Bradman {{that he intended to}} dismiss Hutton down the leg side, so Bradman brought off spinner Ian Johnson into the attack immediately after lunch. Johnson was instructed to bowl at Hutton's legs to give him an opportunity to glance the ball. Hutton obliged and struck the ball from the middle of his bat, expecting a boundary. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> was shocked to see that Tallon had intercepted the ball from a blind position at a range of just one metre. The score was 2/88 as Hutton, who held the Test world record score was dismissed and replaced at the batting crease by Denis Compton. Bradman introduced McCool and Compton misjudged a cut shot which went wide of Tallon and struck Johnson, fielding at slip, in the chest. The ball rebounded past Tallon's shoulder and was heading for the ground when he spun and dived backwards to catch it just before it landed. According to Roland Perry, it was [...] "an acrobatic feat that would put any trapeze artist in the shade, taking one of the most brilliant catches in Test history". Tallon took another difficult catch from McCool to dismiss Hammond as England fell to 4/99, with three specialist batsmen to improbable catches. This restricted England and allowed Australia to set up a match-winning lead.|$|E

2500|$|In the video, it {{is clear}} that several Millsaps {{defenders}} stopped playing before the play was over. On the thirteenth lateral, Tomlin was taken down but tossed a no-look pitch over his shoulder to Hooten just before his knee hit the ground. Many Millsaps fans believed the play to be over and fireworks were shot off from behind the endzone in celebration. Maddux's final lateral hit the ground and bounced into Curry's hands. It appeared as though two defenders near Curry believed the play was over at that point, and Curry scampered into the endzone untouched. [...] Millsaps safety Michael Sims, the closest player to Curry when Curry caught the last lateral, later admitted that <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> started walking away, believing the game to be over.|$|E
