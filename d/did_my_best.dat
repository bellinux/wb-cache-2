I am confident that I have nothing to hide... no suicide missions or secret rendezvous with terrorist organizations." [...] He had been travelling to visit friends in the West Bank and stated he {{had no interest in}} visiting Israel. Sfard said banning Finkelstein from entering the country [...] "recalls the behavior of the Soviet bloc countries".|$|E

Over 450 Carnegie Mellon students, staff members, {{and friends of}} Pausch attended the lecture, leaving only standing room as {{this was more than}} the auditorium could hold. Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying [...] "A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding– hopefully at the appropriate times– that gives a lot of validation to my kids {{that a lot of people}} believe in this, and a lot of people who knew me believe that I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to try to live this way." [...] The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon. Nair first explained the university's aforementioned lecture series called [...] "Journeys", in which eight more professors from Carnegie Mellon would share their insights on their professional and personal experiences over the years.|$|E
500|$|In Gorgona, Seacole briefly ran a woman-only hotel. In late 1852, she {{travelled}} home to Jamaica. The {{journey was}} delayed and difficult when she encountered racial discrimination {{while trying to}} book passage on an American ship. She was forced {{to wait for a}} later British boat. [...] In 1853, soon after arriving home, Seacole was asked by the Jamaican medical authorities to minister to victims of a severe outbreak of yellow fever. [...] She found that she could do little, because the epidemic was so severe. Her memoirs state that her own boarding house was full of sufferers and she saw many of them die. Although she wrote, [...] "I was sent for by the medical authorities to provide nurses for the sick at Up-Park Camp," [...] she did not claim to bring nurses with her when she went. She left her sister with some nurses at her house, went to the camp (about a mile, or 1.6km, from Kingston), [...] "and <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best,</b> but it was little we could do to mitigate the severity of the epidemic." ...|$|E

Kamegai gave a good effort but fell short every time he would connect with a punch, Cotto would counter {{with a combination of}} his own. Cotto spent the early rounds backed against the ropes on the back foot and still managed to do some damage landing hooks to the head of Kamegai. After round 10, Cotto started boxing on the outside and decided to settle for a decision win, he explained in the post-fight, [...] "I think I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> and I'm happy with my performance.

2500|$|Among the {{hundreds}} of graduate-students supervised by Prof. Corey was Jason Altom. [...] Altom's suicide caused controversy because he explicitly blamed Corey, his research advisor, for his suicide. Corey was devastated and bewildered by Altom's death. Altom cited in his 1998 farewell note [...] "abusive research supervisors" [...] as one reason for taking his life. Altom's suicide note also contained explicit {{instructions on how to}} reform the relationship between students and their supervisors. [...] Corey is quoted as stating: [...] "hat letter doesn't make sense. At the end, Jason must have been delusional or irrational in the extreme."

2500|$|Known for her {{remarkable}} {{dedication to}} her work, Tani would perform {{even the most}} extreme of S scenes without complaint. During the twelve years she worked as an actress, she never went to the beach or allowed herself to get a suntan, feeling {{that it was important}} to keep her skin very white, so that it could be seen turning red during some of the scenes involving such things as whippings or melting candle wax tortures. Tani wrote in 1998 [...] "The woman's naked body must not only be seen as a sensual object, but must also be able to express emotion; so, I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to keep Naomi Tani's body as close as possible to perfect condition." ...|$|E

His comment at the ceremony was: [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to bring new and innovative elements to this work. I'm very happy that something like this, {{which was one of the}} more challenging games to create in the Final Fantasy series, has received this award. To return the favor to the users who've played this game and who regard it so highly, I'm determined to continue creating by always reminding myself of the need to rise to new challenges." [...] Tetsuya Nomura considers Ito one of his four [...] "seniors" [...] at the company and a likely influence on his battle planning.

2500|$|In {{promoting}} the album, frontman and lead vocalist Stephan Jenkins recounted a pleasant experience in recording the album, referring {{to it as}} [...] "too much fun and feeling like...a complete recording group for the first time...We had these jam sessions that were fun". He also commented {{that it had been}} more collaborative than their prior album; bassist Arion Salazar became more involved in the writing and production, while drummer Brad Hargreaves was involved in the creative process for the first time, as he had joined the band late into their sessions for the first album. However, in retrospect, Jenkins painted a much more grim picture, citing time constraints, label pressure from Elektra Records, and isolation between members, stating: [...] "We did the last album in six months, we just whipped it out, and there's some things on that album, on the second album, that I'm so proud of...but the second album suffered from a kind of coldness almost. That's done in part because we were never in the studio at the same time, never rehearsed the songs together, never played them together. I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to, to produce that record and {{it was very hard to}} do. Then we succumbed to the time pressures from Elektra to get the album out in six months which we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Choro Club and Takeshi Senoo {{composed}} 30 {{works of}} {{music for the}} first season of the anime and 15 for the second. [...] Jun'ichi Satō and sound designer Yasuno Satō assigned Choro Club and Takeshi Senoo abstract themes instead of plot points, which was an unfamiliar method for the composers, {{who did not have}} much experience working for anime shows. Takeshi Senoo and the three members of Choro Club make a cameo appearance as musicians in episode 23 of Aria the Natural. Jun'ichi Satō has commented that the lyrics for the songs [...] "Barracole" [...] and [...] "Coccolo", sung by Eri Kawai as the voice of Athena Glory, were gibberish. The lyrics for the first two seasons' theme songs were also initially meant to be gibberish, but after reading the manga Eri Kawai decided to write Japanese lyrics: [...] "I read the original manga and wrote the lyrics, using my image of Neo-Venezia as a starting point. Then <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to match words that flowed with the melody." [...] Kawai made demo recordings for Yui Makino as a guide for her performance of the theme songs. Takeshi Senoo has described [...] "Smile Again," [...] the second ending theme song of Aria the Natural, as a song about the end of summer, and envisioned it being sung by Erino Hazuki as Akari.|$|E

2500|$|Brooke {{recorded}} in his war diary on 3 October 1941, that a messenger {{had arrived at}} midnight with orders to prepare a plan to attack Trondheim in one week {{and that he was}} to go to Chequers, the prime minister's country house, that evening to discuss the idea over dinner. Accordingly, Brooke together with General Sir John Dill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord and Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff and Clement Attlee, the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the Labour Party were also in attendance. Brooke recorded that [...] "We sat up til 2.15 pm discussing the problem and I <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> to put the PM off the plan" [...] and that they [...] "Resumed discussion at 11 am and went on till 1 pm, I think PM is beginning to weaken on the plan". Brooke was mistaken and later wrote: [...] "From then on, we would continually be in trouble riding him [...] off mad plans to go back to Norway. Why he wanted to go back and {{what he was going to}} do there, even if he did succeed in capturing Trondheim, we never found out". On 12 October, Brooke was required to present a detailed plan for the Norway invasion, now code named Operation Ajax, which he had compiled with Admiral Sir John Tovey, Air Chief Marshall Sir William Sholto Douglas and General Sir Bernard Paget (who was to command it). Churchill complained that it was not a plan but a [...] "masterly treatise" [...] on the difficulties of the venture. Churchill avoided the main reason (lack of air support) during two hours of interrogation; raising details such as why he forsaw frosts (as stated in the Climate Book) and why would it take 24 hours to go from A to B (because of enemy resistance and removing road blocks). According to one account (but not mentioned by Brooke) Brooke suddenly relented and agreed to mount the expedition on the condition that the navy could take the fleet into Trondheim Fjord in support, but the elderly Pound merely shook his head and ended the discussion. [...] Churchill again asked the Joint Planning Staff to reconsider Ajax without reference to Brooke or Paget, but the JPS, and the Chiefs of Staff, supported Brooke's conclusions, citing the lack of air superiority or any hope of achieving it.|$|E
