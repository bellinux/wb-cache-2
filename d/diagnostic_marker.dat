25|$|Canine {{transmissible}} venereal {{tumors are}} histiocytic tumors {{that may be}} transmitted among dogs through coitus, licking, biting and sniffing tumor affected areas. The concept that the tumor is naturally transmissible as an allograft came from three important observations. First, CTVTs can only be experimentally induced by transplanting living tumor cells, and not by killed cells or cell filtrates. Second, the tumor karyotype is aneuploid but has characteristic marker chromosomes in all tumors collected in different geographic regions. Third, a {{long interspersed nuclear element}} (LINE-1) insertion near c-myc has been found in all tumors examined so far and {{can be used as a}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>marker</b> to confirm that a tumor is a CTVT.|$|E

40|$|Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) {{curves and}} in {{particular}} the area under the curve (AUC), are widely used to examine the effectiveness of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers.</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> and their corresponding ROC curves can be strongly influenced by covariate variables. When several <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> are available, they can be combined by a best linear combination such that the area under the ROC curve of the combination is maximized among all possible linear combinations. In this paper we discuss covariate effects on this linear combination assuming that the multiple markers, possibly transformed, follow a multivariate normal distribution. The ROC curve of this linear combination when markers are adjusted for covariates is estimated and approximate confidence intervals for the corresponding AUC are derived. An example of two biomarkers of coronary heart disease for which covariate information on age and gender is available is used to illustrate this methodology.

25|$|The pRb {{protein is}} inactivated by E7 in HPV+OPC, but in HPV-OPC {{it is the}} p16 tumour {{suppressor}} part of the pRb tumour suppressor network that is inactivated. Also the pRb pathway is inactivated by E7 instead of Cyclin D1 amplification. CDKN2A is a tumour suppressor gene that encodes a tumor suppressor protein, p16 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) and inhibits the kinase activity of the cyclin-dependant kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest. p16 expression is cell cycle dependent and is expressed focally in only about 5–10% of normal squamous epithelium. Like most HPV+ cancers, HPV+OPC express p16 but the latter does not function as a tumour-suppressor, because the mechanism by which this is achieved, pRb, has been inactivated by E7. p16 is upregulated (over-expressed) due to E7-related loss of pRB with reduced negative feedback, whereas it is downregulated in up to 90% of HPV-OPC. This diffuse over-expression in the tumour cells provides a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>marker</b> for HPV involvement. Although HPV E6 and E7 reduce tumour suppressor activity, they do so less than genetic and epigenetic processes do in HPV-OPC.|$|E

40|$|In {{this review}} article, {{conventional}} brain MRI and advanced MRI techniques in Parkinson`s disease (PD) are discussed, {{with emphasis on}} clinical relevance. Conventional brain MRI sequences generally demonstrate limited abnormalities specific for PD and in clinical practice brain MRI is mainly used to exclude other pathology. Possibly, brain MRI at higher magnetic field strengths could provide new <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers.</b> In recent years, new imaging techniques such as susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), diffusion (tensor) MRI, magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), and functional MRI (f-MRI) have been applied to patient cohorts with PD to improve understanding of pathophysiologic changes, including functional connectivity. These advanced MRI techniques hold promise to provide additional <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> for early stage PD, as demonstrated by diffusional changes in the orbital-frontal region in the pre-motor phase of PD. Whether these advanced MRI techniques provide new <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> for early stage PD, remains a debate. Standardization of scanning protocols and post-processing methods, and validation of diagnostic criteria is crucial for these advanced MRI techniques. For this, well designed prospective clinical cohort studies are needed...|$|R

40|$|Background Molecular marker-assisted {{breeding}} {{provides an}} efficient tool to develop improved crop varieties. A major {{challenge for the}} broad application of markers in marker-assisted selection is that the marker phenotypes must match plant phenotypes {{in a wide range}} of breeding germplasm. In this study, we used the legume crop species Lupinus angustifolius (lupin) to demonstrate the utility of whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing on the development of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> for molecular plant breeding. Results Nine lupin cultivars released in Australia from 1973 to 2007 were subjected to whole genome re-sequencing. The re-sequencing data together with the reference genome sequence data were used in marker development, which revealed 180, 596 to 795, 735 SNP markers from pairwise comparisons among the cultivars. A total of 207, 887 markers were anchored on the lupin genetic linkage map. Marker mining obtained an average of 387 SNP markers and 87 InDel markers for each of the 24 genome sequence assembly scaffolds bearing markers linked to 11 genes of agronomic interest. Using the R gene PhtjR conferring resistance to phomopsis stem blight disease as a test case, we discovered 17 candidate <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> by genotyping and selecting markers on a genetic linkage map. A further 243 candidate <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> were discovered by marker mining on a scaffold bearing non-diagnostic markers linked to the PhtjR gene. Nine out from the ten tested candidate <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> were confirmed as truly diagnostic on a broad range of commercial cultivars. Markers developed using these strategies meet the requirements for broad application in molecular plant breeding. Conclusions We demonstrated that low-cost genome sequencing and re-sequencing data were sufficient and very effective in the development of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> for marker-assisted selection. The strategies used in this study may be applied to any trait or plant species. Whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing provides a powerful tool to overcome current limitations in molecular plant breeding, which will enable plant breeders to precisely pyramid favourable genes to develop super crop varieties to meet future food demands...|$|R

40|$|Brown rust, {{caused by}} the fungus Puccinia melanocephala, is {{responsible}} for important yield losses in sugarcane production globally and it is therefore an important objective to introduce resistance to this disease in breeding programs. A major gene, Bru 1, {{has been shown to}} confer resistance to P. melanocephala strains from {{different parts of the world}} and two molecular markers, R 12 H 16 and 9 O 20 - F 4, closely associated to this gene have been previously reported. The usefulness of these molecular <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> in order to predict a rust resistant phenotype under natural high pressure inoculums conditions was analyzed. A total of 129 sugarcane accessions were evaluated under field infection for resistance or susceptibility to brown rust and subsequently screened for presence or absence of the two Bru 1 <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers.</b> A total of 49 genotypes (38 %) were phenotyped as resistant to brown rust but only eight (16. 3 %) of them were harboring the Bru 1 gene. To determine overall frequency of the Bru 1 in the local sugarcane germplasm collection, 190 additional genotypes were examined. Presence of Bru 1, as determined by the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers,</b> was detected in only 7 % of the genotypes evaluated. In conclusion, Bru 1 <b>diagnostic</b> <b>markers</b> enable positive selection for brown rust resistance in sugarcane and moreover allowed detecting at least one additional source(s) of resistance. Interestingly, whilst only little genetic variability of rust resistance independent of Bru 1 has been reported previously, this alternative genetic resource(s) found in our local germplasm constitutes the predominant one and should be helpful in order to amplify the narrow genetic basis for brown rust resistance in sugarcane.
