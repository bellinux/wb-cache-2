5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It {{ended up in the}} possession of General George S. Patton, who <b>kept</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> violation of orders that such finds should {{be turned over to the}} government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E
5|$|Impressed, Johnson reveals to Homer that in 1945, President Harry S. Truman {{printed a}} one trillion-dollar bill to help {{reconstruct}} post-war Europe and enlisted Montgomery Burns {{to transport the}} bill. However, it never arrived and the FBI suspects Burns still has it with him. Homer is sent in to investigate. At the Burns estate, Homer searches for the bill before Burns, who believes Homer is a reporter from Collier's magazine, reveals that he <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his wallet. Johnson and Agent Miller burst in and arrest Burns. Burns shouts how the government oppresses the average American. Moved by Burns's speech, Homer knocks out the FBI agents and frees Burns.|$|E
5|$|The title Project X was {{initially}} a placeholder {{for a final}} title, but interest generated by the secretive title <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. A nationwide open casting call was employed to find fresh faces. The majority of the cast were sourced from this casting call, but a few with prior acting credits, such as Mann, were accepted after multiple auditions. Filming took place on sets in Los Angeles over five weeks on a US$12 million budget. The film {{is presented as a}} found footage home video from the perspective of an attendee using a camera to document the night's events.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, {{he finally}} sailed into Piraeus where {{the crowd had}} gathered, {{desiring}} to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear till he saw his cousin and others {{of his friends and}} acquaintance, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero's welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen in {{the fact that he had}} returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> mind for a future occasion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the design}} process, the A318 {{encountered}} several problems. The {{first one was}} the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the same class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.|$|E

25|$|The 21cm Kanone 39 (K 39) was a Czech-designed heavy gun {{used by the}} Germans in the Second World War.

25|$|The Norden {{saw some}} {{use in the}} post-World War II era, {{especially}} during the Korean War.

25|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was originally}} commissioned by Cardinal Peretti Montalto, {{serving as a}} fountain to decorate the pond {{in the garden of}} his Villa Peretti Montalto on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. It was purchased by the Englishman Thomas Jenkins in 1786, from whom it was purchased later that year by the painter Joshua Reynolds. After Reynolds's death in 1792 it was sold to Charles Pelham, who <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the garden of his home in Chelsea, London, Walpole House. His descendants moved it in 1906 to their country house, Brocklesby Park, Lincolnshire. It was bought from the family by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1950, although had appeared at an exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The P-40's {{lack of a}} {{two-speed}} supercharger made it {{inferior to}} Luftwaffe fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109 or the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 in high-altitude combat and it was rarely used in operations in Northwest Europe. However, between 1941 and 1944, the P-40 {{played a critical role}} with Allied air forces in three major theaters: North Africa, the Southwest Pacific, and China. It also had {{a significant role in the}} Middle East, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Alaska and Italy. The P-40's performance at high altitudes was not as important in those theaters, where it served as an air superiority fighter, bomber escort and fighter-bomber. Although it gained a postwar reputation as a mediocre design, suitable only for close air support, recent research including scrutiny of the records of individual Allied squadrons indicates that this was not the case: the P-40 performed surprisingly well as an air superiority fighter, at times suffering severe losses but also taking a very heavy toll of enemy aircraft. The P-40 offered the additional advantage of low cost, which <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> production as a ground-attack aircraft long after it was obsolete as a fighter.|$|E

500|$|Heisman {{was hired}} by Tech for $2,250 a year and 30% of the home ticket sales. Heisman would not {{disappoint}} the Tech faithful as his first season was an 8–1–1 performance, the first winning season since 1893. One source relates: [...] "The real feature of the season was the marvelus advance made by the Georgia School of Technology which burst from fetters that <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the lowest class for ten years." [...] His team posted victories over Georgia, Tennessee, University of Florida at Lake City, and Cumberland, and a tie with his last employer, Clemson.

The central front compartment holding the relic is protected by a thin pane of rock crystal, which has <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> perfect condition. The enamel is mostly in ronde bosse technique, applied to three-dimensional figures, with white as the dominant colour. White enamel using lead was only recently developed, and very fashionable, dominating many contemporary ronde bosse works. There is also red, green, blue, pink and black enamel. Pure gold is used throughout, which is rare even in royal commissions of such pieces at this period; most use cheaper silver-gilt for the structural framework.|$|E

500|$|In 1984, {{shortly before}} its opening day, the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, California, housed its first {{great white shark}} which had died after 10 days.

Although others in the room knew that Haig's statement was constitutionally incorrect, they did not object at the time to avoid a confrontation.|$|E
500|$|In 1875, British ornithologist Alfred Newton {{attempted}} {{to identify a}} black-and-white bird mentioned in an 18th-century manuscript describing a marooned sailor's stay on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues in 1726–27, hypothesising that it {{was related to the}} hoopoe starling. Subfossil bones later found on Rodrigues were correlated with the bird in the manuscript; in 1879, these bones became the basis for a new species, Necropsar rodericanus (the Rodrigues starling), named by ornithologists Albert Günther and Edward Newton. Although they found the Rodrigues bird closely related to the hoopoe starling, Günther and Newton <b>kept</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a separate genus due to [...] "present ornithological practice". American ornithologist James Greenway suggested in 1967 that the Rodrigues starling belonged in the same genus as the hoopoe starling, due to their close similarity. Subfossils found in 1974 confirmed that the Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling; primarily, its stouter bill warrants generic separation from Fregilupus. In 2014, British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species, the Mauritius starling (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus), based on subfossils from Mauritius, which was closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling in its skull, sternal, and humeral features.|$|E
