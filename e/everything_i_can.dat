Shearer stated [...] "It's a club I love and I don't want them to go down. I'll do <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to stop that." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, Gore {{also had}} to contend with the Lewinsky scandal, {{involving}} an affair between President Clinton and an intern, Monica Lewinsky. Gore initially defended Clinton, whom he believed to be innocent, stating, [...] "He {{is the president of the}} country! He is my friend [...] I want to ask you now, every single one of you, to join me in supporting him." [...] After Clinton was impeached, Gore continued to defend him stating, [...] "I've defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now [...] to do <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to help him be the best president possible." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{statement}} to The New York Times on August 21, 2015, Dre again addressed his abusive past, stating, [...] "Twenty-five years ago I {{was a young man}} drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I've been married for 19 years and every day I'm working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way.

500|$|The {{next morning}} Tarwater boarded {{a plane and}} headed home. Later that day, Phelps, facing the {{prospect}} of competing in eight events at the Olympics, elected to drop the 200-meter freestyle from his program. Phelps' decision allowed Tarwater to move up into the sixth spot in the 200-meter freestyle and {{be added to the}} relay team. Tarwater said he was [...] "shocked" [...] by the news and called it a [...] "storybook ending" [...] to his career. [...] "I was really content in walking away last night. [...] I was in peace and left with my faith intact. [...] To have this extra bout of joy is... surreal", he said. He immediately boarded another plane and flew back to Omaha, where the Trials were held, for a team meeting and practice. He told Olympic swim coach Gregg Troy, [...] "you won't see anyone show up with more focus and fire.... I will do <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to bolster the U.S. team." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{returned}} for the 1993 season enticed by {{the chance to}} play with a new coach (Dan Reeves), and determined not to end his career due to an injury. The Giants had a resurgent season in 1993. They finished 11–5, and competed for the top NFC playoff seed. Taylor finished with 6 sacks, and the Giants defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed. They defeated the Vikings 17–10 in the opening round of the playoffs. The next week on January 15, 1994 in what would be Taylor's final game, the Giants were beaten 44–3 by the 49ers. As the game came to a conclusion, television cameras drew in close on Taylor who was crying. He announced his retirement at the post-game press conference saying, [...] "I think it's time for me to retire. I've done <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do. I've been to Super Bowls. I've been to playoffs. I've done things that other people haven't been able to do in this game before. After 13 years, it's time for me to go." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 7, {{the recall}} {{election}} was held, and voters decisively voted to recall Davis and to elect Schwarzenegger as his replacement. At 10 p.m. local time, Davis conceded {{that he had}} lost to Schwarzenegger, saying, [...] "We've had a lot of good nights over the last 20 years, but tonight the people did decide that it's time for someone else to serve, and I accept their judgment." [...] About 40 minutes later, in his acceptance speech, Schwarzenegger said, [...] "Today California has given me the greatest gift of all: You've given me your trust by voting for me.

2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} all along has been the {{automatic}} assumption {{on the part of}} many that Rowling has the right to completely control anything written about the Harry Potter world. That's quite a huge power grab on her part and from <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell, not legal. You and I are part of a subculture that lives off the creative work of others. We always try to do that in a legal and respectful way. However, if Rowling manages to extend her reach that far into our subculture, she will choke us off very quickly. And if she doesn't, what's to stop the next person from taking this legal precedent to even more dangerous places? ...|$|E
5000|$|In April 2010, as a {{majority}} stock holder, Kroenke said: [...] "I'm going {{to attempt to}} do <b>everything</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to keep the Rams in St. Louis.

2500|$|Cisneros {{successfully}} resisted {{efforts to}} substantially reduce or wholly eliminate the Department. [...] He spent countless hours during his four-year tenure pleading the agency's case while Congressional appropriators cut its budget. He presented {{a plan in}} 1995 to trim the department's budget by $13 billion over five years. [...] Cisneros told the San Antonio Express-News: [...] "There are efforts under way to eliminate important national efforts which provide shelter and assistance to millions of low-income Americans.

2500|$|Senator Harry Reid (Majority Leader of the 2007/2008 U.S. Senate) {{told the}} 2007 Clean Energy Summit {{that he will}} do {{everything}} he can to stop construction of proposed new IGCC coal-fired electric power plants in Nevada. Reid wants Nevada utility companies to invest in solar energy, wind energy and geothermal energy instead of coal technologies. Reid stated that global warming is a reality, and just one proposed coal-fired plant would contribute to it by burning seven million tons of coal a year. [...] The long-term healthcare costs would be far too high, he claimed (no source attributed). [...] "I'm going to do <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to stop these plants.", he said. [...] "There is no clean coal technology. There is cleaner coal technology, but there is no clean coal technology." ...|$|E
2500|$|As at her {{previous}} trial in 1973, Dugdale once again used the courtroom {{as a political}} platform, shouting [...] "The British have an army of occupation in {{a small part of}} Ireland—but not for long!" [...] during her arraignment in Dublin. Dugdale's father issued a statement saying [...] "I don't want to appear hardhearted, but I've done <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> for her. She knows perfectly well she could turn to me if she wanted to". In Dugdale's submission to the court during her trial she denounced Britain as [...] "a filthy enemy" [...] and stated the Dublin government was guilty of [...] "treacherous collaboration" [...] with England. On 25 June 1974 she was sentenced to nine years imprisonment after pleading [...] "proudly and incorruptibly guilty", and she gave a clenched fist salute to supporters in the public gallery.|$|E

2500|$|CNN also {{profiled}} Emily. University of Pennsylvania Physiology professor Kevin Foskett {{said in the}} article, [...] "Emily and {{her family}} want research focused on her mutation to be as focused and accelerated as possible. At one level, that sounds a little selfish, until you realize that her type of mutation, a 'nonsense' mutation ... is responsible for disease in many other genetically inherited forms of disease... Emily's story is compelling. [...] If you've met Emily... you cant help but become engaged and energized." [...] Emily said in that piece, [...] "Obviously our prayer and dream {{is to have a}} breakthrough. [...] But we also realize that it might not happen, or it might not happen in time for me.

2500|$|Ewa Podleś {{likewise}} {{stated that}} [...] "It's {{enough to hear}} her, I'm positive! Because she could say everything only with her voice! I can imagine <b>everything,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see everything {{in front of my}} eye." [...] Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, [...] "For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms... She was wasted in verismo roles, even Tosca, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles." [...] Scott adds, [...] "Early nineteenth-century opera... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, {{while giving}} his final leader's report, T.C. [...] "Tommy" [...] Douglas {{launched}} the party establishment's opening salvo against the Waffle and their Quebec resolution. He told the almost 2000 convention attendees that {{he rejected the}} principle that Quebec {{has the right to}} self-determination through unilateral separation from Canada. He further rejected the notion that non-Quebecers could not partake in that province's internal debates and stated that he would [...] "do <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> to better the conditions of those people in Quebec who have been betrayed by successive governments." [...] He reiterated the intent of the compromise motion by stating that if [...] "the overwhelming majority of the people of Quebec want out of Confederation, it will be time enough to call in the lawyers." [...] To further support Douglas' call for dialogue between English and French-speaking Canadians, towards an equal partnership based on common goals, Ontario NDP leader, Stephen Lewis announced his section's support for national unity.|$|E

2500|$|Williams stated {{his love}} for Toronto and {{mentioned}} the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career.

[...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it.
