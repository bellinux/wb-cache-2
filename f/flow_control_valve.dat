25|$|The larger pipe was glass so the {{behaviour}} of {{the layer}} of the dyed stream could be observed, {{and at the end}} of this pipe there was a <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> used to vary the water velocity inside the tube. When the velocity was low, the dyed layer remained distinct through the entire length of the large tube.

25|$|In constant-flow {{regulators}} {{the first}} stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant reduced pressure, and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set flow control. The diver must open and close the supply valve to regulate flow. Constant flow valves in an open circuit breathing set consume gas less economically than demand valve regulators because gas flows {{even when it is}} not needed. Before 1939, diving and industrial open circuit breathing sets with constant-flow regulators were designed by Le Prieur, but did not get into general use due to very short dive duration. Design complications resulted from the need to put the second-stage <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> where it could be easily operated by the diver.|$|E

40|$|Decreasing the Reynolds {{number of}} {{microfluidic}} no-moving-part <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> considerably below the usual operating range {{leads to a}} distinct “subdynamic” regime of viscosity- dominated flow, usually entered through a clearly defined transition. In this regime, the dynamic effects on which the operation of large-scale no-moving-part fluidic valves is based, cease to be useful, but fluid may be driven through the valve (and any connected load) by an applied pressure difference, maintained by an external pressure regulator. Reynolds number ceases to characterize the valve operation, but the driving pressure effect is usefully characterized by a newly introduced dimensionless number {{and it is this}} parameter which determines the valve behavior. This summary paper presents information about the subdynamic regime using data (otherwise difficult to access) obtained for several recently developed <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> The purely subdynamic regime is an extreme. Most present-day microfluidic valves are operated at higher Re, but the paper shows that the laws governing subdynamic flows provide relations useful as an asymptotic reference. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> may {{experience}} localized cavitation {{when the local}} static pressure drops to the liquid vapor pressure. Localized damage to the valve and surrounding area can occur when the vapor cavity collapses. Valve designs that reduce cavitation are based on empirical evidence and accumulated experience, {{but there are still}} considerable cavitation problems in industry. Valve designers may use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate cavitation in <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> but model validation is challenging because there are limited data of local cavitation from the valve surface. Typically, the intensity of cavitation in a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is inferred from measurements of observable side effects of cavitation such as valve noise, vibration, or damage to the valve assembly. Such an indirect approach to characterizing cavitation yields little information about the location, degree, and extent of the cavitation flow field {{that can be used in}} CFD validation studies. This study uses 3 D X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to visualize cavitation from a 5. 1 cm diameter butterfly valve and compares the resulting vapor cloud to that predicted by CFD simulations. Qualitative comparisons reveal that the resulting cavitation structures are captured by the simulations when a small amount of non-condensable gas is introduced into the fluid and the simulations are completed in a transient mode...|$|R

30|$|The {{principle}} that underlies {{the use of}} <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> in horizontal wells is the imposition of an additional pressure drop, usually proportional to flowrate squared (Addagio-Guevera and Jackson 2008), that equalizes the uneven drawdown along the lateral to promote a more uniform fluid front movement.
