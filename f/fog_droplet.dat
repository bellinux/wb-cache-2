Our research indicates that the oxidation of SO 2 to sulfate has {{a significant effect on}} <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> growth especially when hygroscopic trace gases, for example HNO 3 and NH 3 are present. The increased sulfate production by dissolution of hygroscopic gases results from increased pH (caused by absorption of ammonia) and from the increased size of the fog/smog droplets.

40|$|Both {{the similar}} and {{different}} effects of freezing drizzle, sleet and snow on microphysical properties of supercooled fog were analyzed for fourteen events during a comprehensive wire icing, fog, and precipitation observation experiment conducted at Enshi radar station (30 ° 17 ′N, 109 ° 16 ′E; 1722 m a. s. l.) on a hilltop in Shibanling, Hubei, China. Liquid precipitation is {{in a relatively}} stable form in mountainous areas. Short-term precipitation (1 – 3 h) is dominant with temperature below 0 °C. The wet scavenging effect of freezing drizzle on small fog droplets with a size range less than 6 – 12 μm is weak but is stronger for fog droplets with a larger size, which is opposite {{to the effects of}} solid precipitation, broadening the <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> spectra significantly. As the <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> diameter increases, the distributions of droplet spectra change from leptokurtosis to platykurtosis and from positive skewness to negative skewness. Occurrence of freezing drizzle would improve the positive correlation of N-r in dissipation and oscillation periods, resulting in the N-r relationship having a weak negative correlation in the maturity period, and resulting in the transition of the N-L and N-r relationships into positive correlations in the development period. Meanwhile, the emergence of solid precipitation particles would result in negative values for the correlation coefficients of N-L and N-r. The change in relationships among the microphysical properties was caused by the occurrence of different phase precipitation, showing the influence on the main microphysical mechanisms of supercooled fog...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{cloud and}} <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> {{formation}} was studied in three joint field experiments. The instrument, the droplet aerosol analyser (DAA), {{has also been}} further developed and verified {{as part of this}} work. The DAA is an instrument especially developed for studies of cloud and <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> formation and growth. It measures the ambient size of individual droplets and interstitial particles in a fog or a cloud. It then measures the size of the individual dry residual particles after evaporation of the water. It also counts the number of dry particles of each size, which gives a unique three-parameter data set that connects ambient size to dry size and to the number of particles. Having access to these parameters, a number of related aerosol/cloud parameters can be determined, whereof the microstructure, i. e. the size and number of droplets and their size distribution, characterisation of the droplet activation, as defined by the Köhler equation, and the size-dependent cloud droplet nucleation scavenging of particles due to activation, are the most important. The results from one fog experiment showed that, most of the time fog consisted of unactivated droplets with a continuous size distribution in the size region 1 - 47 µm in diameter. There were no gaps generated by the droplet activation process, as has been observed in clouds. In the two ground-based cloud experiments, cloud droplet number concentrations increased almost linearly with particle number concentration. Droplet concentrations of up to 2000 per cubic centimetre in an experiment in northern England and up to almost 3000 per cubic centimetre in an experiment on Tenerife, Spain, were observed, thus demonstrating the influence of air pollution on cloud microstructure...|$|E

This work focuses {{on the development of}} bi-directional fluxes of <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> above a forest canopy in north-eastern Taiwan. Bi-directional fluxes occurred regularly, start from the smallest droplet class (< 2. 66 μm diameter), and subsequently extend to larger droplets up to 7. 41 μm diameter. The development of the bi-directional fluxes with positive (upward) fluxes of smaller droplets and downward fluxes of larger fluxes is associated with a temperature gradient and with the activation of <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> according to the Köhler-Theory. Small <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> develop close to the canopy as result of evapotranspiration and subsequent condensation. The rapid growth of small <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> and the accelerated growth of activated droplets, a process which is more likely to occur at higher levels of the fog layer, lead to a sink of small droplets and a source of larger <b>droplets</b> within the <b>fog.</b> This is in accordance with the observation that positive droplet number fluxes of small <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> outnumber the negative fluxes from the larger <b>fog</b> <b>droplets.</b> For liquid water, the net flux is negative...|$|R

Therefore there is a large demand for an improved understanding of fog formation and thus improved forecasts. Improved fog forecasts require {{a better understanding of the}} numerous complex mechanisms during the fog life cycle. During winter 2012 / 13 a field campaign called ParisFog aiming at fog research took place at SIRTA (Instrumented Site for Atmospheric Remote Sensing Research). SIRTA is located about 20 km southwest of the Paris city center, France, in a semi-urban environment. In situ activation properties of the prevailing fog were investigated by measuring (1) total and interstitial (non-activated) dry particle number size distributions behind two different inlet systems; (2) interstitial hydrated aerosol and <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> size distributions at ambient conditions; and (3) cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentration at different supersaturations (SS) with a CCN counter. The aerosol particles were characterized regarding their hygroscopic properties, <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> activation behavior and contribution to light scattering for 17 developed fog events. Low particle hygroscopicity with an overall median of the hygroscopicity parameter, κ, of 0. 14 was found, likely caused by substantial influence from local traffic and wood burning emissions. Measurements of the aerosol size distribution at ambient RH revealed that the critical wet diameter, above which the hydrated aerosols activate to fog droplets, is rather large (with a median value of 2. 6 μm) and is highly variable (ranging from 1 to 5 μm) between the different fog events. Thus, the number of activated fog droplets was very small and the non-activated hydrated particles were found to contribute significantly to the observed light scattering and thus to the reduction in visibility. Combining all experimental data, the effective peak supersaturation, SS peak, a measure of the peak supersaturation during the fog formation, was determined. The median SS peak value was estimated to be in the range from 0. 031 to 0. 046 % (upper and lower limit estimations), which is in good agreement with previous experimental and modeling studies of fog...|$|E

The evaluation of a millimeter-wave radar's performance as a weather remote sensing tool must rely on assessment of the physical conditions governing scattering and absorption of millimeter waves which {{are determined by the}} wavelength, ambient temperature and particle properties (size, shape, dielectric properties etc.). Scattering and absorption characteristics of <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> are first investigated over a wide frequency range and temperature scale using Mie scattering theory. An assumption of modified gamma distribution represented as <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> size distribution is applied to retrieve radar reflectivity factor (often referred as reflectivity) and visibility respectively. A modeling relationship between radar reflectivity and visibility is then derived. A fog event at the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research during 17 - 18 February 2012 was observed with a synergy of ground-based in situ and remote sensing instruments, and radar reflectivity and visibility were measured with a 35 GHz cloud radar and in situ sensors respectively. Meanwhile, the information of <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> size distribution on those days was also given by a FSSP (Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe), which is used to retrieve radar reflectivity and visibility as well.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 64 - 66) The paper {{investigates the}} possibility of developing an automatic vehicle collision avoidance system for autos traveling on a freeway in dense fog. The collision avoidance system is comprised of two major components: 1. Speed Cruise Control, and 2. A Laser Tracker. With {{the use of the}} value of "driver selected speed" from the Speed Cruise Control, and range and range-rate data from the laser tracker, the system will automatically maintain a safe separation distance between following vehicles. First, a mathematical model was developed to describe the empirical observation that a form of ???wave phenomenon??? exists {{in a long line of}} vehicles traveling on a highway. The theory derived to analyze highway traffic movement was a car-following model based on modern mathematical techniques. A model for the collision avoidance system was then postulated using-the above-method. The necessary general requirements for the overall system, sensor, reflector, and tracking distance criteria were then determined. Then an examination of automatic versus the semiautomatic system was made. Based on the above requirements a general description of the vehicle collision avoidance system is presented along with a detailed discussion of the basic tracking plan. The reflector-sensor tracking problem is evaluated from which self test requirements are then determined. Next, a study was performed to determine if it was possible to propagate laser light through fog. The results of the study were: 1. Light is scattered at a constant value and is independent of wavelength until <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> radius equals the laser wavelength, and 2.

40|$|As a {{significant}} phenomenon in meteorology, fog has attracted {{more and more}} concern from the scientific community, because of its impacts on visibility in air- and road-transportation. E. g., at airports, the frequency of aircrafts taking off and landing has to be reduced during heavy fogs, because in conditions of low visibility the pilots need to have more space between the aircrafts during landing and taxying. In this context, many approaches have been proposed to detect fog with various types of instruments. Among the active remote sensing instruments, radars are well suited for continuous fog observations, and they can satisfy the need for high spatial resolution and sensitivity. Compared to traditional centimeter-wave radars, millimeter-wave radars are more sensitive to minute <b>fog</b> <b>droplets,</b> whereas the gaseous attenuation from oxygen and water vapor is still very small.

In this study the transport of cloud and <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> towards terrestrial surfaces is parameterised and the “occult” deposition (mediated by both clouds and fog) is calculated by a new approach, implemented in “Sverigemodellen” (MATCH-Sverige), a 3 D Eulerian transport and dispersion model employed for making environmental assessments in Sweden. The model scheme is taking into account the mesoscale analysis (MESAN) of low-cloud coverage and cloud-base height, the visibility analysis, detailed topography information, land use, modelled atmospheric concentrations and the instantaneous deposition parameters for the investigated species (acidifying air pollutants: sulphate and oxidised/reduced nitrogen). The model scheme is validated by comparing with throughfall monitoring of sulphate deposition to coniferous forests at elevated sites in the Swedish mountains. It shows a rather good fit to the measurements, generally within 25 %, which is deemed as encouraging. Discrepancies exist though and are subject of discussion. The percentage of occult deposition can be up to 115 % of the sum of dry and wet deposition. Therefore we cannot ignore this contribution in the assessments of deposition of acidifying pollutants.

The chemical and microphysical properties of the aerosols during foggy and nonfoggy episodes and chemical composition of the fogwater are presented. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) {{as a tool for}} the source apportionment was employed to understand the sources of pollution. Four major sources viz. biomass burning, refractory, secondary and mineral dust were identified. Aerosols properties during foggy episodes were heavily influenced by almost all the sources and they caused considerable loading of almost all the organic and inorganic species during the period. The biomass generated aerosols were removed from the atmosphere by scavenging during foggy episodes. The wet removal of almost all the species by the <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> was observed. The K +, water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), water soluble inorganic carbon (WSIC) and NO 3 - were most heavily scavenged among the species and their concentrations consequently became lower than the nonfoggy episode concentrations.

We develop a theoretical approach to assess the importance of aqueous photolysis {{for a series of}} carbonyls that possess carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups by comparison with rates of other atmospheric processes. We use computationally and experimentally derived Henry's law parameters, hydration equilibrium parameters, aqueous hydroxyl radical (OH) rate constants, and optical extinction coefficients to identify types of compounds that will not have competitive aqueous photolysis rates. We also present molecular dynamics simulations of atmospherically relevant carbonyl compounds designed to estimate gas and aqueous phase extinction coefficients. In addition, experiments designed to measure the photolysis rate of glyceraldehyde, an atmospherically relevant water soluble organic compound, reveal that aqueous quantum yields are highly molecule-specific and cannot be extrapolated from measurements of structurally similar compounds. We find that only three out of the 92 carbonyl compounds investigated, pyruvic acid, 3 -oxobutanoic acid, and 3 -oxopropanoic acid, may have aqueous photolysis rates that exceed the rate of oxidation by dissolved OH. For almost all carbonyl compounds lacking α, β conjugation, atmospheric removal by direct photolysis in cloud and <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> can be neglected...|$|R
40|$|The Luquillo Mountains {{of northeastern}} Puerto Rico {{harbours}} important fractions of tropical montane cloud forests. Although {{it is well}} known that the frequent occurrence of dense fog is a common climatic characteristic of cloud forests around the world, it is poorly understood how fog processes shape and influence these ecosystems. Our study focuses on the physical character-istics of fog and quantifies the fogwater input to elfin cloud forest using direct eddy covariance net flux measurements during a 43 -day period in 2002. We used an ultrasonic anemometer-thermometer in combination with a size-resolving cloud droplet spectrometer capable of provid-ing number counts in 40 droplet size classes at a rate of 12. 5 times per second. Fog occurred during 85 % of the time, and dense fog with a visibility < 200 m persisted during 74 % of the period. <b>Fog</b> <b>droplet</b> size depended linearly on liquid water content (r 2 = 0. 89) with a volume-weighted mean diameter of 13. 8 µm. Due to the high frequency of occurrence of fog the total fogwater deposition measured with the eddy covariance method and corrected for condensation and advection effects in the persistent up-slope air flow, averaged 4. 36 mm d− 1, rainfall during the same period was 28 mm d− 1. Thus, our estimates of the contribution of fogwater to th...|$|E
40|$|A {{microclimate}} {{exposure model}} {{was developed to}} simulate the neutral salt spray test (NSS) environment which was used to estimate the pitting corrosion inside an artificial defect of a coating system, when it is exposed to a virtual microclimate. The model uses a dynamic process to simulate salt <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> formation, subsequent coalescence, and movement on a coated surface, to determine wet-dry cycles on realistic test samples. While the presented model is formulated to comply with standardised NSS tests, e. g. ASTM B 117, the developed method can be tuned to simulate a variety of common cyclic environmental testing conditions, and has wide applicability for the virtual assessment of functional coatings. We will show that when validated against empirical data obtained from inhibitor and pitting studies, the developed model is able to predict the pit growth rate of an AA 2024 ‐T 3 aluminium alloy panel placed in a NSS test chamber. We will also explore the adaptation of the model to encompass the virtual assessment of functional coatings such as corrosion inhibiting coatings, {{and their impact on}} reducing pitting events and pit growth. This work demonstrates an effective approach for building models and establishing interrelationships with other corrosion models or empirical data to produce a predictive system that could ultimately lead to a rapid methodology for virtually screening new functional coatings and formulations, reducing labour costs and freeing up testing infrastructure for materials validation tasks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract OnlyConsumers {{all over}} the world have a strong {{preference}} for fresh newly harvested fish, which is reflected in a higher market value compared to most other preserved and processed fish products. The perishability of the fresh fish and the distribution distance drive in contrary the fish value chains into preservation like freezing, salting, drying, canning etc. This paper reports findings from a research project where a new Coolnova just-in time (JIT) marketing concept has been unveiled. This concept opens a new window of opportunity for marketing fresh quality previous frozen thawed fish on daily basis just-in -time for consumption with a quality appearance like fresh fish. The fresh appearance is protected in a humid atmosphere consisting of small <b>fog</b> <b>droplet</b> which is speeding up the freezing and thawing process without any risk of dehydration or microbe degradation of the product and without any loss of drip and weight which is normal for fish frozen and thawed in traditional ways. Application of the Coolnova JIT logistic concept has the potential to revolutionize the way we are marketing fresh quality seafood, satisfying the consumer preferences for fresh fish and food welfare. The fishers’ opportunities to add value of fresh caught fish may thus be increased when the fresh quality is protected in a value chain and when the barriers that today exist in the fresh seafood distribution chains are removed by the Coolnova JIT system...|$|E
40|$|Free space optics (FSO) channel {{availability}} {{is affected}} by atmospheric water particles, which may introduce severe path attenuation. A unified microphysically oriented atmospheric particle scattering (MAPS) model is proposed and described to simulate particle scattering effects on FSO links. Atmospheric particles, such as raindrops, graupel particles, and snowflakes, together with <b>fog</b> <b>droplets,</b> are considered. Input data to characterize liquid and frozen water particle size distribution, density, and refractivity are derived from available literature data and measurements. Scattering, absorption, and extinction coefficients {{as well as the}} asymmetry factor are numerically simulated for each particle class and then parametrized with respect to particle water content, fall rate, and visibility, spanning from visible to infrared wavelengths. Both single- and multiple-scattering effects are discussed and quantified by using a radiative transfer model for small-angle approximation. MAPS simulations confirm that fog layers are those causing the largest power extinction on FSO links, but also several decibels of attenuation can be attributed to snow and rain conditions. Multiple-scattering effects, especially due to <b>fog</b> <b>droplets,</b> heavy rain, and dry snowflakes, typically tend to reduce the total attenuation by increasing the received power. An estimate of these effects, parameterized to single-scattering extinction, is proposed for near-infrared FSO link design...|$|R

The collection {{efficiency of the}} {{instrument is}} determined {{as a function of}} droplet size, and it is shown that <b>fog</b> <b>droplets</b> in the range 3 – 100 -µm diameter are efficiently collected. No significant evaporation or condensation occurs at any stage of the collection process. Field testing indicates that samples collected are representative of the ambient fogwater.
