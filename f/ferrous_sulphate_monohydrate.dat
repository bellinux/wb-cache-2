Because of insufficient data, the FEEDAP Panel {{is not in a}} position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish; as a provisional measure, the current value (750 mg/kg) could be maintained. The values for total dietary iron for pigs, ovines, horses, fish and other species/categories (except poultry, bovines and pets) are in line with those currently authorised. Iron from <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> heptahydrate is unlikely to modify the iron concentration in edible tissues and products of animal origin.

The grown crystals {{were subjected to}} powder X-ray diffraction study that confirms {{the change in the}} lattice parameters and quality of the crystal, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ensures the functional groups, UV-Visible analysis which reveals the optical transmittance, lower cutoff wavelength and band gap, and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis gives chemical composition and confirms the inclusion of the dopant into the grown pure LSMH single crystal. Introduction. The investigation of NLO materials have gained predominant attention in current research owing to their applications in the technology of information transmission and processing. It is evident that the NLO crystals have exceptional technological requirements such as wide transparency range, fast response and high damage threshold. Due to such distinct optical properties, synthesis and growth of unique materials are in progress. The most widely used materials in photonic technologies are mainly inorganic crystals based on Borates and Phosphates. Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> Li 2 So 4 H 2 o (LSMH) is also one such inorganic highly NLO active materials [1 - 4]. The crystal structure and space group of Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> were originally determined as monoclinic point group P 21 by G. E. Ziegler (1934) [5]. A detailed study on the redetermination, further refinement and inclusion of hydrogen's position of Li 2 So 4 H 2 o structure were reported [6 - 8]. It is explored from the literature that the Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> has remarkable piezoelectric and electro-optic properties. Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> has highest pyroelectric effects among the non-ferroelectric polar crystals [9]. Earlier researches show that Lithium found to be effective NLO material on its combination with Selenate, Glycine and Bromide [10 - 12]. Since there is large demand for crystal in electronic industries, it is required to synthesize NLO material and to improve the properties of existing materials. Considering the facts, ethylene diamine tetra acetate and Cu II doped Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> single crystals have been synthesized and shown as promising candidate for optical second harmonic generation [13 - 14]. In the present work {{attempts have been made to}} enhance the physical properties of single crystals by incorporating bivalent metal dopant. The presence of very low concentration of suitable additives enhances crystalline perfection [14]. Therefore, we present the Synthesis of grown Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>monohydrate</b> single crystals containing 0. 1 mole percentage of Zinc Sulphate by slow evaporation method.

Blood samples were taken from 29 PD patients at baseline, as well as 2, 4 and 8 hours after oral intake of 4 <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> tablets (containing 105 mg elemental iron per tablet). The test was repeated using 8 ferrous gluconate drinkable ampoules (containing 50 mg elemental iron per ampoule). Results. The maximal increase in serum iron level during the test with iron sulphate was 113. 51 ± 103. 37 % versus the initial values of 183. 87 ± 37. 38 % during the ferrous gluconate test. The maximal values of serum iron after the intake of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> were 26. 23 ± 9. 95 µmol/l versus 30. 97 ± 8. 65 µmol/l after the intake of ferrous gluconate.

Secondly by adding <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> to the L J media that contained the anti-tuberculosis drugs, then comparing resistance of the isolates to the anti-tuberculous drugs beforeand after the addition of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Among the first twenty isolates that were subjected to the susceptibility tests, it was found that, the resistance to INH had increased insignificantly(p-value = 0. 25) whenferrous sulphate was added to the media containing INH;It was increased from 20 % before the addition of iron to 40 % after adding the iron. Moreover, the resistance against EMB had increased from 10 % to 15 % after the addition of iron, this increase was also found to be statistically insignificant (p-value= 1. 00). However for SM there was an insignificant decrease in the resistance from 35 % before adding iron to 30 % after adding iron (p-value= 1. 00). RIF susceptibility was not affected before and after adding <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> where the percentage of isolate resistance remained as it is 20 %. The effect of iron on nitratase enzyme and catalase activity at 68 o C, was not affected in the presence orabsence of iron on the medium. At the molecular level, there was no any effect of iron on the identification capacity of these molecular tools...|$|R
50|$|Green {{forms of}} Russula cyanoxantha can be distinguished, because {{they give a}} greenish {{reaction}}, or no reaction when rubbed with <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> (iron salts), and have the flexible, 'greasy' feeling gills characteristic of that species.|$|R
50|$|A {{record by}} William Herschel (1738-1822), shows he {{observed}} dichromatism {{with a solution}} of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> and tincture of nutgall in 1801 when working on an early solar telescope, {{but he did not}} recognise the effect.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{in case of}} henna leaves dyed fabric, good {{levelness}} {{was found}} when no mordant was used, as the average ΔE value was found 0.21. But except the <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> mordanted dyed sample, all the mordanted dyed samples showed the average ΔE value within 0.21 – 0.50 range i.e., good levelness. For <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> mordanted dyed sample the average ΔE value was found highest (0.53). It {{can be interpreted as}} sample of poor levelness quality i.e., showing some kind of apparent unlevelness. Thus among the mordanted samples dyed with henna leaves extracts, the order of levelness found was: alum (0.27) > tin (0.28) > alum–tin (0.31) > ferrous sulphate–alum (0.33) > ferrous sulphate–alum–tin (0.38) > ferrous sulphate (0.53).|$|R
40|$|Black {{iron oxide}} pigment has been {{successfully}} prepared by traditional method. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{was used as the}} starting iron source. The effect of amount of acid, type and amount of alkali and oxidizing agent on colour and yield were also studied. It was found that, the conversion of insitu produced fer-rous chloride to ferrosoferric oxide yielded brilliant colour hue than that produced directly from <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The produced ferrosoferric oxide were analyzed for purity and characterized for physical properties {{to be used as a}} pigment. The prepared samples were found to be comparable with BAYER bayferrox 318. Statistical evaluation also confirmed the experimental result...|$|R
