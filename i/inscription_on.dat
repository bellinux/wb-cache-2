5|$|In April–May 2012, {{a team of}} archaeologists {{unearthed}} {{a previously}} unknown <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> a stairway at the La Corona site in Guatemala. The <b>inscription,</b> <b>on</b> {{what is known as}} Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in Calakmul in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.|$|E
5|$|These Nishidhis {{detail the}} names, dates, the {{duration}} of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, Nishidhis are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in mandapas (pillared pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> the door frame or pillars of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey {{died while}} still in exile at Grandmont in Normandy on 12 December 1212. He was buried at a Grandmontine monastery near Rouen, {{where he had been}} living for a few years. His tomb was still extant in 1767, when the <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> it was {{recorded}} by an antiquary. He may have become a monk before his death.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The similartity {{of pattern}} {{recognition}} between <b>inscriptions</b> <b>on</b> oracle bones and cuneiform {{have been studied}} in the paper. Samples of <b>inscriptions</b> <b>on</b> oracle bones and cuneiform were taken into computer images. By analysis of <b>inscriptions</b> <b>on</b> oracle bones, and cuneiform,a new arithmetic was chosed and a standard inflexion curve of word can be gotten. There are curves by the arithmetic in images. The standard inflexion curve of <b>inscriptions</b> <b>on</b> oracle bones and curves in cuneiform were compared. If both of curves look very similar,there is an arithmetic {{which can be used}} in pattern recognition of <b>inscriptions</b> <b>on</b> oracle bones and cuneiform. this work was supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities(xdjk 2010 c 053...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>inscriptions</b> <b>on</b> idols, {{most of them}} are not clear due to {{deterioration}} with time. Many idol installed in 595 CE(V.S. 651) are here. Many <b>inscriptions</b> <b>on</b> rocks of the Adinatha and Shantinatha caves here are in Sanskrit Language.|$|R

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1799, with the Napoleonic {{discovery}} of a trilingual (i.e. hieroglyphic, Demotic, Greek) stela <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> the Rosetta Stone, that modern scholars were able to decipher ancient Egyptian literature. The first major effort to translate the hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone was made by Jean-François Champollion (1790–1832) in 1822. The earliest translation efforts of Egyptian literature during the 19th century were attempts to confirm Biblical events.|$|E
5|$|The Heilongjiang hand cannon is 34 centimeters (13.4 inches) {{long without}} a handle and weighs 3.55kg (7.83 pounds). The {{diameter}} of the interior {{at the end of}} the barrel is 2.6cm (1.0 inches). The barrel is the lengthiest part of the hand cannon and is 6.9 inches long. There is no <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> the hand cannon.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the Byzantine-era church in Jifna testifies to the {{existence}} of a Christian community prior to the Muslim conquest. It continued to exist during the Middle Ages and the village is still inhabited mainly by Christians. The names of Christian inhabitants from Jifna appeared in a 10th-century <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> a stone above the gate of St. George's Monastery in the Wadi Qelt.|$|E

5|$|Þorgerðr {{probably}} had the stone made {{as soon as}} she had learnt that Özurr, the last of her uncles, had died in Greece, and she likely did this to ensure her right of inheritance.

5|$|Excluding these, {{surprisingly}} few documents {{dating to}} Unas' reign have survived to this day, considering the 30-year length that later records give for his reign. Excavations at Abusir, the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty, have produced only four dated inscriptions safely attributable to Unas. They explicitly mention his third, fourth, sixth and eighth {{years on the}} throne. Unas also left a rock <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> the island of Elephantine, next to the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia.|$|E

5|$|In 1574, Queen Elizabeth I {{promoted}} {{the restoration of}} the church, to serve as the grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work, and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath. James Montague, the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608–1616, paid £1,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> his tomb, this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during a thunderstorm. He is buried in an alabaster tomb in the north aisle.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture began {{a search}} in China for ancient buildings. In the seventh {{year of the}} society's search in 1937, an {{architectural}} team led by Liang Sicheng discovered that Foguang Temple was {{a relic of the}} Tang Dynasty. Liang was able to date the building after his wife found an <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> one of the rafters. The date's accuracy was confirmed by Liang's study of the building which matched with known information about Tang buildings.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Schreck {{developed}} meningitis {{and died}} on 16 May in Munich. He was a well-liked man and Hitler was distraught when Schreck died. His final rank was SS-Oberführer, a rank between colonel and general. Schreck was accorded a Nazi state funeral with Hitler delivering his eulogy. Schreck's funeral {{was attended by}} many senior Nazi officials, including Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, Rudolf Hess, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Konstantin von Neurath, Emil Maurice, Hans Baur, Heinrich Hoffmann and Baldur von Schirach. As with many other buried Nazi Party members, Schreck's grave marker was removed after World War II {{and there is a}} stone without <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> the spot where he was buried.|$|E

5|$|On {{the five}} pendentives along each {{side and the}} two at either end, Michelangelo painted the largest figures on the ceiling: twelve people who prophesied or {{represented}} {{some aspect of the}} Coming of Christ. Of those twelve, seven were Prophets of Israel and were male. The remaining five were prophets of the Classical World, called Sibyls and were female. The prophet Jonah is placed above the altar and Zechariah at the further end. The other male and female figures alternate down each side, each being identified by an <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> a painted marble panel supported by a putto.|$|E
5|$|One of Johor's main rivals at {{the time}} was the Sultanate of Aceh, a {{cosmopolitan}} entrepòt and centre for religious and ideological learning. Aceh's rise to power began in the early 1500s: during the following decades the sultanate expanded its territories in Sumatra and sought military assistance from Suleiman the Magnificent in a quest to banish the Portuguese from Malacca. In 1613 Aceh launched an attack of Johor, destroying its capital and taking as prisoners the sultan, his family and entourage. The Seri Rambai was captured during the assault: a Javi <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> the gun's barrel records the event and the senior Acehnese officers involved.|$|E
5|$|Stela 21 {{is located}} inside the chamber {{at the top}} of StructureA-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber {{collapsed}} on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand hands a shield with the face of the sun god. The <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> the monument is largely illegible.|$|E

5|$|The Turin {{panel has}} {{suffered}} heavy overpainting and cracking along the vertical join. The marbleized reddish-brown paint on its reverse is heavily worn. In the 20th century the panel underwent three restorations and extensive technical analyses. The earliest, in 1952, removed overpainting and repaired pigment loss to Francis's tonsure, Leo's cowl {{and areas of}} vegetation between the two figures. Restorers discovered an irretrievably lost <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> a rock adjacent to the seraph-Christ, and evidence of earlier overpainting of one of Leo's feet. Continued paint loss and cracking along the join required further restoration in 1970, when a fixing agent was applied to prevent cracking, and Francis's tonsure was repainted.|$|E
5|$|The arch is {{constructed}} from local stone and was originally {{topped by a}} bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins {{at the foot of}} the arch. Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts, though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930–34. However, the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy. The <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on the ground in front of the arch.|$|E
5|$|The second {{movement}} is in E-flat major and strophic form, {{with a statement}} of a theme followed by three variations (the second of which is in E-flat minor) and a coda. Haydn used a similar design for the slow movement of the Opus 20, No. 4 quartet. In 1793 the poet Gabriele von Baumberg set the movement's theme to words, for <b>inscription</b> <b>on</b> a monument honouring Haydn in the composer's home town of Rohrau, Austria.|$|E
