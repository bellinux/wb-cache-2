500|$|In March 1897 {{as members}} of the Household {{prepared}} to depart for Cimiez for the Queen's annual visit, they insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party, and decided to resign if he did so. When Harriet Phipps, one of the Queen's maids of honour, informed her of the collective decision, the Queen swept the contents of her desk onto the floor in a fury. The Household backed down, but the holiday was marred by increased resentment and rows between the Household and Victoria. She thought their distrust and dislike of Karim was motivated by [...] "race prejudice" [...] and jealousy. When Rafiuddin Ahmed joined Karim in Cimiez, the Household forced him to leave, which Victoria thought [...] "disgraceful", and she asked the prime minister to issue an apology to Ahmed, explaining he was only excluded because he had written articles in newspapers and pressmen were not permitted. Ponsonby wrote in late April, [...] " [...] happens to be a thoroughly stupid and uneducated man, and his one idea in life seems to be to do nothing and to eat as much as he can." [...] Reid warned the Queen that her attachment to Karim had led to questions about her sanity, and Hamilton telegraphed to Elgin requesting information on the Munshi and his family in an effort to discredit him. On receiving Elgin's reply that they were [...] "Respectable and trustworthy... but position of family humble", Hamilton concluded [...] "the Munshi <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> my knowledge which is reprehensible or deserving of official stricture... enquiries wd not be right, unless they were in connection with some definite statement or accusation." [...] He did, however, authorise further investigation of the [...] "Mohamedan intriguer named Rafiuddin". Nothing was ever proven against Ahmed, who later became a Bombay government official and was knighted in 1932. The effect of the row, in Hamilton's words, was [...] "to put him [...] more into his humble place, and his influence will not be the same in the future".|$|E
2500|$|Poland: Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski {{has accused}} his compatriot European Council President Donald Tusk {{for not doing}} enough to help further Polish {{interests}} within the EU: “We are a country that wants to be really active in discussions over the future of the EU, Brexit and the U.K.’s relations with Europe, but on these issues Mr. Tusk <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> help us,”. Witold Waszczykowski labelled Mr.Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, as an “icon of evil and stupidity,” and hoped that he [...] "would stay far away from Poland,".|$|E

He <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> make himself a powerful person and is not competing with anyone. Although {{he does not have}} any military or political power, and even though he does not have access to funds his opinions have carried and shaped policies across not just Iraq but beyond. For the past 37 years Ayatollah Sistani has lived in the same modest rented house. Although he is well renowned his has no fortune to his name. A good listener and a curious mind still, Ayatollah Sistani epitomises good manners, and kindness of the heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Duterte, who {{has been}} dubbed [...] "The Punisher" [...] by Time magazine, has been linked by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to extrajudicial killings of over 1,400 alleged criminals and street {{children}} by vigilante death squads. In the April 2009 UN General Assembly of the Human Rights Council, the UN report (Eleventh Session Agenda item 3, par 21) said, [...] "The Mayor of Davao City <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> prevent these killings, and his public comments suggest that he is, in fact, supportive." [...] Human Rights Watch reported that in 2001–2002, Duterte appeared on local television and radio and announced the names of [...] "criminals", {{some of whom were}} later executed. In July 2005 at a crime summit at the Manila Hotel, Duterte said, [...] "Summary execution of criminals remains {{the most effective way to}} crush kidnapping and illegal drugs".|$|E

(The German bedstead, be it remembered, is built in the form of a shallow, open box, and the victim is thus completely surrounded by solid pieces of wood with sharp edges. I do not know what species of wood it is that is employed. It is extremely hard, and gives forth a curious musical sound when struck sharply with a bone.) ...|$|E
