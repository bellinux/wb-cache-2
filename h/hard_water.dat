5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the Ca2+ ion, high {{coordination}} numbers are common, up to 24 in some intermetallic compounds such as CaZn13. Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as EDTA and polyphosphates, which are useful in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from <b>hard</b> <b>water.</b> In the absence of steric hindrance, smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed.|$|E
5|$|Regional geology accords that Dublin's <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> is well-suited {{to making}} stout, such as Guinness, while the Plzeň Region's soft water {{is ideal for}} brewing Pilsner (pale lager), such as Pilsner Urquell. The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which {{benefits}} making pale ale {{to such a degree}} that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as Burtonisation.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758. In 1845 Jane Hartley mortgaged {{the brewery}} to David Backhouse and John Hartley. In 1847, Samuel Smith of Leeds {{arranged}} {{for his son}} John to enter the business. Jane Hartley died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to help him. The timing was to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> proved to be well-suited for brewing the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together {{with the arrival of}} the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and by 1861 John Smith employed eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise.|$|E
50|$|Prionobrama filigera will breed {{successfully}} in harder and more alkaline water than most tetra species. A pH of 7.3 and 10 degrees of hardness is suitable, {{but not the}} much <b>harder</b> <b>water</b> the adults can live in.It is an egg scattering species that will eat its own eggs.|$|R
30|$|Again, {{the high}} TH in tap waters can be {{attributed}} to long residence time of groundwater in the deep fractured aquifer, leading to extended chemical weathering of dolomitic limestones (Frape et al. 1984). With hardness values largely exceeding the WHO guideline value for drinking water, the tap waters were categorized as very hard, while those of dug wells as soft to moderately <b>hard.</b> Soft <b>waters,</b> with low alkalinity and buffering capacity, may favor the mobility of potentially toxic heavy metals in the aquifer (De Schamphelaere and Janssen 2004; Kirby and Cravotta 2005). In contrast, <b>hard</b> <b>waters</b> require more soap to produce lather, and thus, it is unsuitable for domestic use (Srinivasa Rao and Jugran 2003). Some evidence has also indicated the role played by <b>hard</b> <b>waters</b> in heart diseases and prenatal mortality (Schroeder 1960; Agarwal and Jagetai 1997). Although such cases have not been reported in the present study area, the desirability of softer drinking water is evident among the local population. As a result, the water provided by the public water supply system should be treated before it gets to the consumers.|$|R
50|$|Colouring of {{this species}} can vary from a creamy white to an almost rusty brown, and also a deep blue. It is {{believed}} that the water conditions will affect colouring and <b>harder</b> <b>water</b> causes the blue morph. These shrimp {{have been known to}} change colouring several times in the same year.|$|R
5|$|Stony Creek's {{water is}} the hardest water in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, with a {{concentration}} of over 100 milligrams per liter of dissolved minerals. Other streams in the watershed with <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> are Reilly Creek (28 milligrams per liter) and Long Run (21 milligrams per liter). Some of the least hard waters in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are those of Little Nescopeck Creek A (3 to 8 milligrams per liter), Conety Run (5 milligrams per liter), and Oley Creek (7 milligrams per liter). However, the largest source of pollution in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is acid mine drainage (AMD).|$|E
5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. <b>Hard</b> <b>water</b> forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved {{carbon dioxide in the}} carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E

25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is important in}} the erosion of carbonate rock, forming caverns, and leads to <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> in many regions.|$|E
25|$|Another example {{involves}} {{the addition of}} water softeners to washing powders to inhibit the precipitation of salts of magnesium and calcium ions, which are present in <b>hard</b> <b>water,</b> by forming complexes with them.|$|E
25|$|Bog {{pondweed}} is not {{in general}} cultivation, although {{it is easy to}} grow. Its preference for shallow water makes it very suitable for a garden pond, but it would probably be difficult to establish in high nutrient, <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> areas.|$|E
50|$|The water {{should be}} soft to {{slightly}} hard, d°GH of 6° to 15°, {{with a slightly}} acidic pH of 6.8, in the range 6.0 - 7.5. It prefers a temperature of 25 °C in the range 22° - 28° °C (72° - 82 °F). The hardiness of this fish allows it easily to adapt to <b>harder</b> <b>water,</b> though soft water is essential for captive breeding.|$|R
50|$|All {{waters in}} contact with the {{atmosphere}} absorb carbon dioxide, and as these waters come into contact with rocks and sediments they acquire metal ions, most commonly calcium and magnesium, so most natural waters that come from streams, lakes, and especially wells, can be regarded as dilute solutions of these bicarbonates. These <b>hard</b> <b>waters</b> tend to form carbonate scale in pipes and boilers and they react with soaps to form an undesirable scum.|$|R
30|$|The {{percolating}} rainwater {{into the}} ground is acidic due {{to the presence of}} CO 2 in atmosphere and roots of the plants in soil. This low pH solution dissolves the insoluble carbonates and its impurities such as sulfates, chlorides, silicates, etc. {{into the ground}}water making the groundwater <b>harder.</b> <b>Water</b> with higher hardness are not suitable for domestic and industrial purposes (Sarath Prasanth et al. 2012); (Gopinath et al. 2015); (Tahlawi et al. 2016); (Nag and Lahiri 2012).|$|R
25|$|Citric acid is an {{excellent}} chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It {{can be used to}} treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. By chelating the metals in <b>hard</b> <b>water,</b> it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for water softening. Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> stains from glass without scrubbing. In industry, it is used to dissolve rust from steel. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to wash out wax and coloring from the hair.|$|E

50|$|Acentrogobius therezieni is {{a species}} of goby endemic to <b>hard,</b> fresh <b>waters</b> of Madagascar. This species can reach a length of 10 cm TL.|$|R
50|$|Extremely {{frequent}} as an emergent plant, broadleaf arrowhead forms dense colonies on very wet soils {{that become}} more open as the species mixes with {{other species of}} deeper water levels. These colonies forms long bands following the curves of rivers, ponds and lakes, well-marked by the dark green color of the leaves. The plant has strong roots and can survive through wide variations of the water level, slow currents and waves. It displays an affinity for high levels of phosphates and <b>hard</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} unique amongst the Aponogetons in having an {{elongated}} rhizome {{rather than a}} tuber which creeps along the surface and from which new leaves sprout. This rhizome can be divided. It needs no rest period but is slow growing, though tough once established. It needs only a moderate light, tropical temperatures, and will tolerate <b>harder</b> <b>water</b> than most other Aponogetons. It is not commonly available but a good plant for the middle to background of an aquarium. It flowers rarely in aquariums.|$|R
25|$|Saltwater is {{typically}} alkaline, while the pH (alkalinity or acidicity) {{of fresh water}} varies more. Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; hard or soft water may be preferred. <b>Hard</b> <b>water</b> is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic. Dissolved organic content and dissolved gases content are also important factors.|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{available}} aqueous blends of 5–30% {{nitric acid}} and 15–40% phosphoric acid {{are commonly used}} for cleaning food and dairy equipment primarily to remove precipitated calcium and magnesium compounds (either deposited from the process stream or resulting {{from the use of}} <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> during production and cleaning). The phosphoric acid content helps to passivate ferrous alloys against corrosion by the dilute nitric acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>water</b> {{contains}} calcium and magnesium ions {{that interfere with}} action of soap {{and contribute to the}} buildup of a scale or film of alkaline mineral deposits in household and industrial equipment and pipes. Commercial and residential water-softening units use ion-exchange resins to remove the offending ions that cause the hardness. These resins are generated and regenerated using sodium chloride.|$|E
50|$|Copper tubes {{have been}} used to {{distribute}} potable water within building for many years and hundreds of miles are installed throughout Europe every year. The long life of copper when exposed to natural waters is a result of its thermodynamic stability, its high resistance to reacting with the environment, and the formation of insoluble corrosion products that insulate the metal from the environment. The corrosion rate of copper in most potable waters is less than 2.5 µm/year, at this rate a 15 mm tube with a wall thickness of 0.7 mm would last for about 280 years. In some soft waters the general corrosion rate may increase to 12.5 µm/year, but even at this rate it would take over 50 years to perforate the same tube. Despite the reliability of copper and copper alloys, in some cold <b>hard</b> <b>waters</b> pits may form in the bore of a tube. If these pits form, failure times can be expected between 6 months and 2 years from initiation. The mechanism that leads to the pitting of copper in cold <b>hard</b> <b>waters</b> is complex, it requires a water with a specific chemistry that is capable of supporting pit growth and a mechanism for the initiation of the pits.|$|R

5000|$|Fluoride accumulates in {{the bone}} tissues of fish and in the {{exoskeleton}} of aquatic invertebrates. The mechanism of fluoride toxicity in aquatic organisms is believed to involve the action of fluoride ions as enzymatic poisons. In soft waters with low ionic content, invertebrates and fishes may suffer adverse effects from fluoride concentration as low as 0.5 mg/L. Negative affects are less in <b>hard</b> <b>waters</b> and seawaters, as the bioavailability of fluoride ions is reduced with increasing water hardness [...] Seawater contains fluoride at a concentration of 1.3 mg/L.|$|R
25|$|Pet stores market zeolites {{for use as}} filter {{additives}} in aquaria. In aquaria, zeolites {{can be used to}} adsorb ammonia {{and other}} nitrogenous compounds. However, due to the high affinity of some zeolites for calcium, they may be less effective in <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> and may deplete calcium. Zeolite filtration is used in some marine aquaria to keep nutrient concentrations low for the benefit of corals adapted to nutrient-depleted waters.|$|E
25|$|In Connecticut, Elimia virginica is at {{the edge}} of its range, and is most likely limited to <b>hard</b> <b>water</b> {{habitats}} only. During collections made in the Connecticut River, the snail was found to inhabit regions with water temperatures up to 27.5°C, dissolved oxygen between 7 and 14 ppm, CaCO3 concentration from 42-160 ppm, pH from 7.6-9.0 and CO2 concentration from 0-10 ppm. However, at some of these sites, population abundance was very low and/or decreasing, especially in conditions of high water temperature and alkalinity.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula CaCO3.
