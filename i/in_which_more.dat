5|$|As {{the matches}} were often played {{consecutively}} without a day between fixtures, Australia employed a rotation policy, {{and as a}} result, Hassett captained the team in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than half the playing time was lost. Hassett had two close encounters, both on damp pitches before the First Test. Against Yorkshire, Australia scraped home by four wickets in a low-scoring match with ten men after Sam Loxton succumbed to injury. In a later match against Hampshire, Australia ceded a first innings lead {{for the first time}} on tour, but recovered to win by eight wickets.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{also very}} well {{regarded}} by other industry professionals, placing in the top 100 on Sight & Sound's directors poll, run in tandem with their critics poll. A survey of 1000 people who work across the film and television industry, undertaken by the British Film Institute in 1999, saw the film ranked eighth on their list of top 100 British films of the 20th century. It also topped a similar list organised by Time Out London in 2011, in which 150 film industry professionals were polled. In 2012 Time Out also undertook a poll of the horror industry, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than 100 professionals who work within or have connections to the genre selected their favourite horror films, which saw Don't Look Now finish in twelfth position.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{years after}} his first tour of England, Hassett was {{included}} in the 1948 team as Bradman's deputy. Hassett was one of three on-tour selectors along with Bradman and Arthur Morris. Considered one of the strongest Australia teams to tour England, the team became known as The Invincibles because it went undefeated through 34 matches, an unprecedented feat. As matches often started the day after the previous fixture, Australia employed a rotation policy and Hassett led the tourists in nine of the 34 matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than half the playing time was lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they get sick.

5|$|Aside {{from being}} the vice-captain, Hassett {{was one of three}} on-tour {{selectors}} along with Bradman and Morris.

Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than half the playing time was lost. Hassett had two close encounters as captain, both on damp pitches before the First Test. Against Yorkshire, Australia scraped home by four wickets with ten men after Sam Loxton was injured in a low-scoring match. In a later game against Hampshire, Australia ceded a first innings lead {{for the first time on}} tour after a middle-order collapse, but recovered to win by eight wickets. The matches against Cambridge University, Oxford University, Northamptonshire, Gloucestershire and Somerset were won by an innings. The wins over the latter two were particularly convincing; Australia amassed its largest score for the tour against Gloucestershire, making 7/774 declared before winning by an innings and 363 runs. After the Tests, Australia compiled 5/560 against Somerset and won by an innings and 374 runs in less than two days. The matches against Durham and Glamorgan were washed out, with at least half the playing time lost.|$|E

Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the city was rocked by the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1992–93 <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than 1,000people were killed. On 12 March 1993, a series of 13 co-ordinated bombings at several city landmarks by Islamic extremists and the Bombay underworld resulted in 257 deaths and over 700 injuries. In 2006, 209 people were killed and over 700 injured when seven bombs exploded on the city's commuter trains. In 2008, a series of ten coordinated attacks by armed terrorists for three days resulted in 173 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several heritage landmarks and prestigious hotels. The blasts that occurred at the Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar, and Dadar on 13 July 2011 were the latest in the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|In June1990, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy and the Carmel Valley Coalition {{sued the}} San Diego City Council to {{require them to}} move the western {{terminus}} of SR56 closer to Sorrento Valley. On August1, the City of San Diego received a petition <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than 45,000people requested that the City Council overturn their decision or refer it to a public referendum. The City Council backed down and rescinded the appropriate zoning changes on August7, in efforts to keep the city from having to run a special election. They also approved {{the plans for the}} eastern portion between Black Mountain Road and I-15. Meanwhile, the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the city as well. The California Coastal Commission approved the construction on September13, and several local residents representing both sides of the debate attended the meeting in Marina del Rey.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Zulu War (also {{known as}} the Zulu War) was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom (Zululand; part of modern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa). Although British and colonial forces under General Lord Chelmsford entered Zululand unopposed, on 11 January 1879, the Zulu army soon inflicted a heavy defeat on them at the Battle of Isandlwana, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than 1,300 British and colonial forces were killed. Immediately after the battle, Zulu troops moved onto the small {{garrison}} at Rorke's Drift. Here, just over 150 British and colonial soldiers defended the outpost against 4,000 Zulu warriors. The action was later made famous by the film Zulu. The defence of Rorke's Drift is considered by historians as a masterly defensive action and an example of heroism against overwhelming numbers. Eleven VC recipients received their awards for deeds performed during the defence of the small garrison — {{one of the largest}} number awarded for a single action, and the largest number (7) awarded to a single unit (the 2nd/24th Foot) for a single action. The severe losses at Isandlwana resulted in Lord Chelmsford having to abandon his initial invasion plan and to request significant reinforcements before another could be attempted. After these reinforcements arrived, a second invasion was launched in May. The second invasion culminated in the defeat of the Zulu army at the Battle of Ulundi, on 4 July 1879. The war saw the end of the Zulu nation's independence as it became a protectorate of the British.|$|E

5|$|The ICC World ODI XI {{was a team}} {{chosen by}} the International Cricket Council (ICC), {{representing}} the most talented One Day International cricketers playing international cricket at the time. A One Day International (ODI) is an international cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} ICC. An ODI differs from a Test match in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. The ICC World XI has played four matches, one for the 2005 World Cricket Tsunami Appeal (where the World XI was made up of the best non-Asian players), and three in the 2005 ICC Super Series (where the World XI was made up of the best non-Australian players). The list is arranged in the order in which each player won his first ODI cap. In cases <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than one player won his first ODI cap in the same match, these players are listed alphabetically by surname. All these players have represented their respective national teams too, but only the records of their games for the ICC World XI are given.|$|E
5|$|The Main Stand of Edgeley Park, {{which in}} 1935 {{was made of}} wood, burned down in a fire, {{destroying}} all of Stockport County's records before 1935. Besides having to rebuild a significant section of the ground, the club had to piece together historical information. The current Main Stand, was built a year later in 1936 and officially opened by Charles Sutcliffe, then President of the Football League. In 1936–37 County won the Third Division North, gaining 60 points and 23 wins. Towards {{the end of this}} season, Stockport had a ten-game unbeaten run that included seven victories before a last-day title decider against Lincoln City <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than 27,000 fans watched. The following season, Stockport finished 22nd out of 22 in the Second Division and were relegated to Division 3 (North) after only earning 31 points.|$|E
5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>more</b> and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E
