25|$|A {{total of}} 34 {{people were arrested}} and {{questioned}} with 26 Liverpool fans being charged with manslaughter – the only <b>extraditable</b> <b>offence</b> applicable to events at Heysel. An extradition hearing in London in February–March 1987 ruled all 26 were to be extradited to stand trial in Belgium {{for the death of}} Juventus fan Mario Ronchi. In September 1987 they were extradited and formally charged with manslaughter applying to all 39 deaths and further charges of assault. Initially, all were held at a Belgian prison but over the subsequent months judges permitted their release as the start of the trial became ever more delayed.|$|E
50|$|This {{requirement}} {{is referred to}} as the principle of 'specialty' and is intended to ensure that a state cannot seek the surrender of a person for an <b>extraditable</b> <b>offence</b> whilst intending to prosecute that person for a non-extraditable offence once surrendered, or extradite the surrendered person to a third state for an offence which would not have been <b>extraditable</b> <b>offence</b> from the original executing state.|$|E
50|$|The Anderson case {{took place}} in Canada West from 1860 to 1861. The case dealt with {{whether or not to}} {{extradite}} an escaped slave to the United States on the charge of murder. The majority of the presiding judges who handled the case agreed that there was sufficient evidence to prove criminality of the <b>extraditable</b> <b>offence.</b> The decision was based upon the terms laid out in Article X of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842. Anderson was released, however, on a technicality.|$|E
50|$|Section 4 made minor {{amendments}} to other legislation. Section 5 {{was to have}} implemented Article 11 of the Convention, which required State Parties to make the offences described in Article 7 <b>extraditable</b> <b>offences.</b> However, before the 1983 Act came into force in 1991, section 5 {{was replaced by the}} Extradition Act 1989.|$|R

40|$|The law of {{extradition}} {{was changed}} following the 2001 {{terrorist attacks in}} the United States. Subsequent practice has seen the range of <b>extraditable</b> <b>offences</b> expand to include acts not traditionally regarded as terrorist crimes. The case of Gary McKinnon provides one such example. This article describes and analyses the facts and law surrounding the extradition of McKinnon, and concludes that those involved in cyberspace in the United Kingdom should be very conscious of the long arm of United States criminal law...|$|R
50|$|States that {{ratify the}} Convention agree to criminalise the creation, use, and {{exportation}} or importation of counterfeit currency. Under the agreement, no distinction {{is to be}} made as to what currency {{is the subject of}} the crime. Under the treaty, currency counterfeiting is an <b>extraditable</b> <b>offence.</b> States also agree to establish a central office that will forward to all other state parties cancelled specimens of their state's currency and notify the other states when changes to their currency are implemented.|$|E

50|$|David McMillan {{returned}} to London in 1999. He {{was arrested in}} 2000 in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was arrested at Heathrow airport in 2002 for smuggling 500 grams of class A drugs. For this crime he served a sentence of two years. As of 2007, the warrant for Macmillan's arrest in Thailand for heroin trafficking is still active and he is still wanted in Australia for breaching parole. However, the UK government does not extradite anyone to a country which carries out the death penalty, and breaching parole is not an <b>extraditable</b> <b>offence.</b> In June 2009, McMillan appeared as a guest in a 50-minute episode of Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men 2: Living Dangerously, which aired on Bravo TV.|$|E
50|$|In June 1984, Florida Special Prosecutor Larry Nixon {{disclosed}} {{that the state}} government was preparing an extradition request for Jaffe on those perjury charges. In October 1984, Jaffe was also sentenced to 180 days in jail for contempt of court, but this misdemeanor charge was not an <b>extraditable</b> <b>offence.</b> Florida State Governor Bob Graham reviewed the request personally due to {{the high level of}} international attention to Jaffe's case, and signed and submitted the paperwork to the Justice Department's Office for International Affairs in November 1984. By February 1985, the Canadian government had not yet responded to the extradition request; The Gainesville Sun speculated that their failure to respond was an expression of their anger over Jaffe's earlier kidnapping.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews key {{findings}} of the Detailed Assessment of Observance of Standards and Codes in the Financial Sector of Palau. The assessment reveals {{that there is a}} relatively low level of compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. Palau is compliant with one of the Core Principles, largely compliant with six and materially noncompliant with seven Core Principles. The status of legal protection for supervisors has been assessed as compliant, but is subject to an amendment to be passed by the Congress shortly.

40|$|This paper reviews key {{findings}} of the detailed assessment of the Observance of Standards and Codes in the Financial Sector of the Cayman Islands. Banks in the Cayman Islands operate within a well-defined prudential regulatory framework, generally in accordance with Basel standards, that is, largely modeled after the framework currently in use in the United Kingdom. The two-tiered required minimum risk capital standards are significantly above those required by the Basel Capital Accord and are applied in practice based primarily on the perceived differences in risk related to bank ownership.
