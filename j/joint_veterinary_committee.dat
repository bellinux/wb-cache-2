5000|$|The Scientific <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Committee</b> of the European Commission {{stated that}} [...] "enriched cages and well {{designed}} non-cage systems {{have already been}} shown to have a number of welfare advantages over battery systems in their present form". Supporters of battery husbandry contend that alternative systems such as free range also have welfare problems, such as increases in cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking. A recent review of welfare in battery cages made the point that such welfare issues are problems of management, unlike the issues of behavioural deprivation, which are inherent in a system that keeps hens in such cramped and barren conditions. [...] Free range egg producers can limit or eliminate injurious pecking, particularly feather pecking, through such strategies as providing environmental enrichment, feeding mash instead of pellets, keeping roosters in with the hens, and arranging nest boxes so hens are not exposed to each other's vents; similar strategies are more restricted or impossible in battery cages.|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a novel orthobunyavirus, in ruminants in Europe triggered a <b>joint</b> <b>veterinary</b> {{and public health}} response to address the possible consequences to human health. Use of a risk profi ling algorithm enabled {{the conclusion that the}} risk for zoonotic transmission of SBV could not be excluded completely. Self-reported health problems were monitored, and a serologic study was initiated among persons living and/or working on SBV-affected farms. In the study set-up, we addressed the vector and direct transmission routes for putative zoonotic transfer. In total, 69 sheep farms, 4 goat farms, and 50 cattle farms were included. No evidence for SBV-neutralizing antibodies was found in serum of 301 participants. The lack of evidence for zoonotic transmission from either syndromic illness monitoring or serologic testing of presumably highly exposed persons suggests that the public health risk for SBV, given the current situation, is absent or extremely low.

30|$|The {{limitations}} {{of our study}} are the rather small numbers of animals per group. Our data are therefore underpowered to exclude that the observed beneficial effect of nalbuphine on the wellbeing of Wistar rats had an adverse effect on mortality. No repeated blood sampling was performed in long-term experiments. However, repetitive blood sampling (e.g., via tail vein under brief sedation) likely would have influenced the outcome during the 48 -h mortality study. Premature termination of experiments affected the outcome. A clinical score of six had been defined as a humane endpoint by our <b>veterinary</b> <b>committee.</b> There is however scarce evidence in septic rats that this threshold corresponds to imminent death. Within the short-term experiments, {{the order of the}} low and high nalbuphine dose was always the same; therefore, a bias due to the order of the experiment cannot be excluded. Finally, we cannot provide data on possible immune system changes in sepsis due to nalbuphine. However, interactions of the immune system with opioids have mainly been reported for morphine [26, 27]. In CLP mice, buprenorphine or tramadol had some effects on white blood cells and cytokines [28, 29].|$|R

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Animal Machines (Harrison, 1964), there has been wide-spread public pressure in Europe—supported by European institutions—to “ban the battery cage. ” The European Union (EU) and national governments (particularly in Northern Europe) funded research on noncage systems for egg production and en-riched cages. In 1986, the EU passed a Directive specifying a minimum size for cages, but public opinion—again particularly in the North—continued to require more. A market sector emerged that would pay more for noncage eggs. Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland passed more stringent legislation {{than the rest of}} Europe. A 1999 Direc-tive with details based on advice from the EU’s Scientific <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Committee</b> will phase out conventional laying cages but allow enriched cages. Implementation de-pends on various factors, including negotiations in the World Trade Organization. In the next 10 years, however, major changes to the housing of most laying hens in Eu-rope almost certainly will occur. Similar changes in other countries will follow. As in Europe, change probably will be piecemeal, affected both by public pressure and by all sectors of society: producers, retailers, consumers, legislators, and the media. On June 15, 1999, the new European Union (EU) Directive on welfare of laying hens was passed, which requires conventional laying cages to be phased out by 2012. Enriched laying cages will still be allowed. In this article, I outline how this came about and the scientific, social, economic, and political issues in-volved.

40|$|<b>Veterinary</b> {{admission}} <b>committees</b> {{are asked}} to create and implement a fair, reliable, and valid system to select the candidates {{most likely to succeed}} in veterinary school from a large pool of applicants. Although numerous studies have explored grade point average (GPA) as a predictive value of later academic success, there has been little attention paid to how and where an applicant acquires his/her undergraduate coursework. Quality of academic program is an important component of applicant files, and it is suggested that the source of a candidate’s coursework might influence admissions committee decisions, perhaps even outside of the committee’s immediate awareness. Options for undergraduate education include taking classes at a traditional four-year institution, a community college, or online. This study provides an overview of the current state of online courses and community colleges in the US as a foundation to explore the views of <b>veterinary</b> admissions <b>committee</b> members pertaining to coursework completed at traditional residential 4 -year schools or at community colleges and whether they are delivered on campus or online (at either type of institution). Survey participants reported a pattern of preference for traditional four-year residential coursework compared to online or community college courses. These results are interesting given the exponential growth of students taking online courses and data showing community colleges are providing a successful gateway to obtaining a four-year degree. This also points to the need for admission committees to discuss potential biases since the information about type of school and/or course may not be consistently available for all applicants. Finally, at a time when admitting a diverse class of students is a goal of many programs, it is of special concern that there are potential biases against courses taken online or from community colleges - venues that tend to draw a more diverse population than traditional 4 -year universities...|$|R
40|$|Title of the paper: Weifare {{assessment}} of segregated early weaning (SEW) in pigs – a review The technology of segregated early weaning (SEW) {{has been established}} primarily in large pig farm enterprises across North America. SEW is characterised by weaning piglets at days 7 to 21 of age (mostly between days 12 to 16) and isolated housing in nurseries and growing / finishing units (multi-site production with all-in all-out pig flow). The goal of this technology is to break the infection chain by utilising acquired maternal (passive) immunity from the dam before piglets develop their own active immunity in response to pathogens. A high Standard of feeding and hygiene management facilitates a superior health Status resulting in improved growth rates. The EU-Report on the welfare Status of intensively housed pigs (SCIENTIFIC <b>VETERINARY</b> <b>COMMITTEE,</b> 1997) suggests that the technology of SEW should be allowed {{only if it is}} demonstrated that any welfare advantages to sows and piglets outweigh the disadvantages. Recent research on the behaviour of piglets showed that piglets weaned before days 21 of age develop higher levels of nosing and chewing each other which persist into the grow/ftnish period. Longer-term consequences of SEW for the reproduetive Performance of sows are not yet sufficiently evaluated, although reduced nursing periods result into reduced litter sizes and piglet weights. That does, however, not exciude that the total number of litters/sow/year increases, resulting in greater number of piglets produced. Considering the EU legislation laying down a minimum weaning age of 21 days, it is recommended that SEW technology could be implemented by utilising the appropriate health management features (multi-site production, all-in all-out). The benefits of isolated housing on health Status and Performance of pigs seem to outweigh the additional advantages of weaning piglets {{at a very early age}} (< 21 days of age) ...|$|R
