50|$|Instead of {{producing}} <b>generic</b> <b>goods,</b> firms now found it more profitable to produce diverse product lines targeted at {{different groups of}} consumers, appealing to their sense of taste and fashion. Instead of investing {{huge amounts of money}} on the mass production of a single product, firms now needed to build intelligent systems of labor and machines that were flexible and could quickly respond to the whims of the market. The technology originally associated with flexible production was the numerical control technology, which was developed in the United States in the 1950s; however, the CNC, developed in Japan, later replaced it. The development of the computer was very important to the technology of flexible specialization. Not only could the computer change characteristics of the goods being produced, but it could also analyze data to order supplies and produce goods in accordance with current demand. These types of technology made adjustments simple and inexpensive, making smaller specialized production runs economically feasible. Flexibility and skill in the labor was also important. The workforce was now divided into a skill-flexible core and a time-flexible periphery. Flexibility and variety in the skills and knowledge of the core workers and the machines used for production allowed for the specialized production of goods. Modern just in time manufacturing is one example of a flexible approach to production.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{internationalisation}} process in a representative sample of 786 firms operating in the Italian automotive industry, a paradigmatic example of a producer driven global value chain.

After performing a probit regression analysis, we find that being located in a high-density industrial district and producing more research-intensive automotive-specific goods, increase the probability of internationalisation of the supplier firm.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three self-contained essays. The first two essays address the consumption of culture and are closely related {{in terms of the}} theoretical framework used. The third essay is a separate analysis of international trade and competition. The studies of culture are motivated by the special treatment of culture consumption in most modern societies: there are usually large, government-provided subsidies, the aim of which is to stimulate both the production and the consumption of culture. The purpose of the present work is to explore reasons for this special treatment. Using a stylized theoretical framework, the essays contrast culture with another, <b>generic,</b> <b>good</b> or activity. Culture is thus regarded as an "experience good": previous consumption of the good enhances the current appreciation of the <b>good.</b> The <b>generic</b> <b>good</b> is one where experience is assumed not to be at all relevant for the appreciation of the good. For experience goods, decisions made today will influence future utility and future choices. This makes the intertemporal preferences essential. If, in particular, consumers have time-inconsistent preferences of the type that can be characterized as a present-bias [...] -modeled with "multiple selves" using quasi-geometric discounting [...] -as opposed to standard, time-consistent preferences, there will be a case for government subsidies. The first essay explores this possibility in detail in a framework where experience is mainly of importance in the short run. The second essay then studies cases where experience is more potent and can cause persistent diversity in culture consumption across individuals. "Culture and Control: Should There Be Large Subsidies to Culture?" studies the circumstances under which public support for culture is warranted. A policy example is designed to illustrate important aspects of public support systems currently in place, and is calibrated to Swedish data. The essay concludes that, given present-biased agents with self-control problems, public support of culture can work as a commitment device and improve long-run welfare. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that welfare-maximizing subsidies to culture can be substantial if the present-bias is profound and the taste-cultivation property of culture consumption is pronounced. "Origins of the Diversity of Culture Consumption" analyzes the diversity of culture consumption among individuals. If the culture <b>good</b> and the <b>generic</b> <b>good</b> are sufficiently close substitutes in a static sense, very large and persistent differences in the consumption of highbrow culture across consumers can be explained by differences in initial experience levels alone. Moreover, slight differences in preferences and time endowments can cause significant diversity between individuals, both in the long- and short-run levels of culture consumption. In addition, if consumers have time-inconsistent preferences, further diversity can be rationalized. If there is a present-bias, there may also be Pareto-ranked multiple equilibria with "optimism" and "pessimism": high (low) culture consumption of the current self is rationalized, {{based on the belief that}} future culture consumption will be high (low). "Has international competition increased? Estimates of residual demand elasticities in export markets" studies the impact of the last decades of intense economic integration on the competitive conduct of Swedish export industries. The functional relationship between the inverted residual demand elasticity and the Lerner index is used to estimate markups in eight industries. The econometric evidence suggests a deviation from competitive behavior in all industries. Moreover, the results demonstrate a trend of decreasing market power...|$|R

40|$|The {{shortage}} of critical medical supplies in healthcare facilities is of obvious concern to both medical professionals and patients. Speci cally, the growing concern {{in this area}} is motivated, at least in part, by our dependence on generic pharmaceuticals. In the absence of FDA restrictions on the production of critical <b>generic</b> <b>goods</b> (e. g. morphine), manufacturers possess little financial incentive to produce numerous products whose patents have expired, but remain critical to patient care. Therefore, faced with crippling shortages, hospitals are left seeking ad-hoc solutions for meeting patient demand of these items. This work considers quantitative response strategies to mitigate the impact of these shortages. Speci cally, lateral transshipments of supplies amongst cooperative hospitals are analyzed to assess their impact and utility with respect to the amount of met demand and the quality of service. In addition, a multi-objective optimization model is considered that off ers insight about how intelligently structured collaboration between hospitals can improve service levels and reduce unmet demand across the system while considering transportation costs. The combination of these analyses provides medical decision-makers with a fundamental level of intuition necessary to guide hospitals in their reaction to supply shortages...|$|E
