When Sam returns, it is clear he knows these two strangers. It soon transpires that the three of them were all part of a sting: Joanna Rupelford does not actually exist, the flat has been set up for six months, there are cameras all over the flat (including the bedroom, which is some consolation to Rosie for earlier), and the operation to entrap a <b>drugs</b> <b>courier</b> is due to take place that night. Maurice is angry with Sam, who evidently does this sort of thing all the time, for disrupting the plan.|$|E

40|$|Internationally, {{laws and}} {{sentencing}} practices tend to treat drug supply offences very harshly, {{often with the}} stated aim of deterrence. International drug trafficking {{is subject to the}} longest penalties, from 8 - 30 years, and up to the death penalty.
