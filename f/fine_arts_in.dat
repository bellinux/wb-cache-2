5|$|The government's {{creation}} of the Imperial Academy of the <b>Fine</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>in</b> the 1820s {{played a pivotal role}} in influencing and expanding the visual arts in Brazil, mainly by educating generations of artists but also by serving as a stylistic guideline. The Academy's origins lay in the foundation of the Escola Real das Ciências, Artes e Ofícios (Royal School of the Sciences, Arts and Crafts) in 1816 by the Portuguese King JoãoVI. Its members—of whom the most famous was Jean-Baptiste Debret—were French émigrées who worked as painters, sculptors, musicians and engineers. The school's main goal was to encourage French aesthetics and the Neoclassical style to replace the prevalent baroque style. Plagued by a lack of funds since its inception, the school was later renamed as the Academy of <b>Fine</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>in</b> 1820, and in 1824 received its final name under the Empire: Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts.|$|E
