5|$|October 9-10, 2016 - Hurricane Matthew {{interacts with}} a <b>frontal</b> <b>system,</b> {{bringing}} heavy rain and minor flooding to the state.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area previously associated with a <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> developed into a tropical depression near Bermuda on September22. The depression had sustained winds of 30mph (45km/h) and failed to strengthen further. It became extratropical on September23.|$|E
5|$|Arlene made {{landfall}} {{just west}} of Pensacola, Florida with 60mph (95km/h) winds on June 11. After moving inland, Arlene persisted as a dissipating tropical depression for two days, passing into Indiana and Michigan before being absorbed by a <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> over southeastern Canada on June 14.|$|E

50|$|On August 3, {{several areas}} of low {{pressure}} developed. <b>Frontal</b> <b>systems</b> extended {{from one of}} the lows, stretching from the Azores to the Germany coastline.|$|R
5|$|As an extratropical low {{combined}} with a <b>frontal</b> <b>system,</b> Bonnie continued to produce moderate rainfall in Canada, peaking at 3.5inches (90mm) in Edmundston, New Brunswick. The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts; slick roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston.|$|E
5|$|Around 06:00 UTC on the {{following}} day, the cyclone reached maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Only six hours later, the system lost tropical characteristics while located about , after the vortex became elongated while a <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> approached the area. The remnants continued northwestward and moved ashore in North Carolina early on October 12, before dissipating early {{the following}} day.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Arlene {{originated}} {{out of an}} area of {{low pressure}} associated with a decaying <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> along the North Carolina coastline on August8. Tracking towards the southeast in a gradual anticyclonic loop, the system slowly increased in organization and intensity. By August10, the low neared the Bahamas but remained disorganized. The following day, while located over Andros Island, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical depression, the third of the season, based on its appearance on satellite imagery.|$|E
50|$|Strong south-easterly {{winds and}} {{rainfall}} {{are associated with}} the passage of <b>frontal</b> <b>systems,</b> which would push warm surface waters shoreward resulting in warmer sea surface temperatures.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} Amazon Basin {{convection}} and cold fronts on {{the formation and}} maintenance of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) is studied using aqua-planet simulations with a general circulation model. In the model, a circular patch of warm sea-surface temperature (SST) is used to mimic {{the effect of the}} Amazon Basin on South American monsoon convection. The aqua-planet simulations were designed to study the effect of the strength and latitude of Amazon Basin convection on the formation of the SACZ. The simulations indicate that the strength of the SACZ increases as the Amazon convection intensifies and is moved away from the equator. Of the two controls studied here, the latitude of the Amazon convection exerts the strongest effect on the strength of the SACZ. An analysis of the synoptic-scale variability in the simulations shows the importance of <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the formation of the}} aqua-planet SACZ. Composite time series of <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> that occurred in the simulations show that a robust SACZ occurs when fronts penetrate into the subtropics and become stationary there as they cross eastward of the longitude of the Amazon Basin. Moisture convergence associated with these <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> produces rainfall not along the model SACZ region and along a large portion of the northern model Amazon Basin. Simulations in which the warm SST patch was too weak or too close to the equator did not produce <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> that extended into the tropics and became stationary, and did not form a SACZ. In the model, the SACZ forms as Amazon Basin convection strengthens and migrates far enough southward to allow <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> to penetrate into the tropics and stall over South America. This result is in agreement with observations that the SACZ tends to form after the onset of the monsoon season in the Amazon Basin...|$|R
50|$|Frontal {{precipitation}} {{is caused}} by <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> surrounding extratropical cyclones or lows, which form when warm and often tropical air meets cooler air. Frontal precipitation typically falls out of nimbostratus clouds.|$|R
5|$|Overnight, all {{convection}} in Chantal dissipated, and its {{forward speed}} decreased as it {{headed to the}} north. A weak wave caused Chantal to speed up and the system was absorbed in the <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> by the night of September 14. Effects on Bermuda were minimal, with the island getting winds of up to 20mph (25km/h) and few thundershowers. Chantal generated swells of 30–40ft (9–12m) offshore.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{north of}} the Hawaiian Islands, the {{remnants}} of the hurricane later began to revive, and had re-developed into a tropical depression on August30. Additional re-intensification was not significant, although Fausto managed to become a tropical storm again on September1. Remaining a minimal tropical storm, no further intensification occurred, and by September3, Fausto was absorbed by a <b>frontal</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|An upper-level tropospheric trough {{persisted in}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{developing}} a circulation by October 26 which quickly organized. On October 27, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about 860miles (1380kilometers) south-southwest of the western Azores. Moving westward, the depression was forecast to attain winds of at least 60mph (95km/h), although it failed to reach that intensity. Banding features developed over the storm, and on October 30 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lorenzo. By early on October 31, convection had begun to separate from the circulation, {{and later in the}} day Lorenzo became extratropical; shortly thereafter, its remnants merged with a <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> about 690mi (1,110km) west of the Azores.|$|E
5000|$|On average, wintertime lows dip down to [...] in July, while daytime highs {{range from}} [...] in July up to [...] in August. Winter is {{typically}} {{the season with}} {{the least amount of}} wind, although the increased occurrence of cold <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> during the cooler months have helped cause wind gusts of up to 113 km/h - in the winters of 1949 and 1984 at Launceston Airport, 14.8 km away from Ti Tree Bend. This passage of cold <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> are responsible for winter being Launceston’s and the rest of northern and western Tasmania’s wettest season.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cool season {{rainfall}} {{variability in}} southeastern Australia is investigated via classification and {{characterization of the}} predominant types of synoptic systems occurring in the region. These types are <b>frontal</b> <b>systems,</b> cut-off low systems, and other systems. Rainfall {{in the region is}} dominated by cut-off systems and these systems are the main influence on the interannual variability of rainfall. Both cut-off <b>systems</b> and <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> display an enhancement of thermal (thickness) gradient as rainfall increases, but the mechanisms for intensification differ. Cut-off systems intensify in the region in association with local increases in baroclinicity and the subtropical jet, whereas <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> tend to intensify via a confluence of subtropical and polar jets. Interannual rainfall variability is examined for groupings of years based on both clustering of continental rainfall patterns and on El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) /Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) years. Cut-off systems exhibit consistent enhancements of thermal gradients for groupings of years in which they produce more rainfall. For ENSO/IOD groupings, the cut-off thermal gradients are consistent with the underlying sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Wet years in southeastern Australia are usually produced by cut-off systems, but can also be produced by <b>frontal</b> <b>systems.</b> In those cases the mid-tropospheric flow pattern is reminiscent of the negative Southern Annular Mode (SAM) pattern. The positive SAM pattern is also associated with enhanced rainfall in the southeast via local intensification of blocking and cut-off systems. Copyright 2008 Royal Meteorological Societ...|$|R
40|$|A {{reliable}} {{weather forecast}} using mathematical models {{is already a}} reality since the last decade. However, the degree of reliability of such models when predicting {{the position of a}} synoptic system, with time evolution, still deserves attention. <b>Frontal</b> <b>Systems</b> are part of this contexto An observational study using <b>Frontal</b> <b>Systems</b> that occurred {{in the first three months}} of 2002 were carried out (summer season). This work consists in evaluating the performance of operational models of the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (CPTEC) in the context of prediction of <b>Frontal</b> <b>Systems</b> positioning. The main objective is to inform meteorologists who work with weather forecasting and the society as a whole about the model's reliability for certain forecast times. The preliminary results show that in general, for the time period studied, the model which is initialized with the 12 Z analysis has a greater accuracy when compared with the model initialized with the OOZ analysis. AIso it is concluded that the regional model provides a better performance than the global model, in the context ofprediction ofFrontal Systems positioning. Pages: 4035 - 403...|$|R
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{depression}} turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly {{as it moved}} to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October8.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Florence was a strong, late season {{hurricane}} {{that remained}} {{out over the}} open waters of the Central Atlantic for nearly a week, before being absorbed into a large extratropical cyclone. With peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) and a minimum pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), Florence was the strongest storm of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season. Florence developed out of an {{area of low pressure}} associated with a stalled <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> located 1,150mi (1,850km) east-southeast of Bermuda in late October. The system gradually became better organized and was classified a subtropical depression on November 2. The storm intensified into a subtropical storm shortly thereafter before weakening to a depression the next day.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Naomi was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane that made landfall in Mexico's Pacific coast during the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. After rapidly intensifying before its landfall in Sinaloa, Naomi caused rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas {{in association with}} a <b>frontal</b> <b>system,</b> with the highest measurement occurring in Corpus Christi. Four people perished in Mexico due to Naomi's effects with ten more missing, all in Sinaloa. The only reported injury in Texas due to the remnants was a factory worker who was injured when {{the roof of the}} plant they were working in collapsed due to rainfall.|$|E
50|$|In {{southern}} Australia (which includes Tasmania), most rain falls {{during the}} winter months and is normally associated with <b>frontal</b> <b>systems.</b> Elevation also has an important influence on rainfall, with the mountain areas of western Tasmania receiving higher rainfall totals.|$|R
5000|$|Severe local windstorms in Europe {{that develop}} from winds off the North Atlantic. These windstorms are {{commonly}} associated with the destructive extratropical cyclones and their low pressure <b>frontal</b> <b>systems.</b> [...] European windstorms occur mainly in the seasons of autumn and winter.|$|R
50|$|Sonora's {{climate is}} subhumid and subtropical, though periods of long drought are not {{uncommon}} due to the proximity of deserts and steppes nearby, to the west. The upland location allows some of the periodic Gulf of Mexico moisture to interact with <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> and elevated terrain to create more clouds and precipitation than locations in the brush country to the south, or the steppes and deserts {{to the west and}} northwest. Thunderstorms with heavy rainfall are most frequent during spring and fall months, though some lighter, steady precipitation and low clouds can occur during the winter, {{due in large part to}} <b>frontal</b> <b>systems</b> originating on the plains and prairies to the north.|$|R
5|$|In Texas, the {{remnants}} of Naomi coupled with a <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> resulted in prolonged rains over the state. The hardest hit city was Corpus Christi, which reported over 8inches (200mm) of rain {{in relation to the}} disturbance as well as funnel clouds to the south and west of the city, resulting in many roads being stopped to traffic. Accumulated rainfall caused the roof of a tortilla plant to collapse, slightly injuring a worker. Although the range of heavy rains was large, only minor rains were reported in Andrews, Crane, Monahans, Kermit, Wink, Stanton, and Pecos. Despite the totals, the rain proved beneficial as well, helping saturate areas of grassland in need of water.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, the {{hurricane}} was not classified {{due to lack}} of ship confirmation; by the time it became a hurricane, the strongest winds reported by a ship was 40 mph (65 km/h) about 80 miles (130 km) southeast of the center. Additionally, upon developing a closed eyewall, the cyclone was beginning to interact with the <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> to its west. However, late on September 3, a ship reported a pressure of 1003 mbar with a 3-hour tendency increase of 13.5 mb, suggesting a minimum pressure of under 990 mbar. At the time, the storm maintained a T-number of 4.0, resulting in estimated winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and an estimated pressure of 987 mbar. Maintaining hurricane status for about 18 hours, the storm continued rapidly northeastward and weakened, due to strong wind shear from the approaching cold front. Early on September 5, it is estimated the cyclone became extratropical in the Gulf of Alaska, while located about 315 miles (510 km) southwest of Juneau, Alaska. On the same day, the circulation was rapidly absorbed by the <b>frontal</b> <b>system,</b> and the remnants quickly reached the coast of British Columbia. The remnants of the storm turned southeastward, and was last tracked definitively to a point north of Montana.|$|E
5|$|Slight {{weakening}} {{took place}} late on September22 and early on September23 as the hurricane neared landfall. Around 0300UTC, {{the eye of}} Emily tracked onshore between Barahona and Bani, Dominican Republic as a strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110mph (175km/h). Within 12 hours of landfall, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and had emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Haiti with winds of 65mph (100km/h). The storm significantly slowed while tracking through the eastern Bahamas as a quasi-stationary <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> influenced Emily. Moving generally towards the north, the center of circulation passed very close to Inagua and Mayaguana on September24.|$|E

5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over the central United States drifted east {{and added a}} westward component to Gordon's southward motion, pulling the storm southwest towards Florida. The persistent shear and a continued lack of deep convection eventually reduced the storm's winds to below tropical storm force, and on the morning on November 20 Gordon became a tropical depression. The {{high pressure}} system over the continent continued pulling the depression towards the west until it made its final landfall near Cape Canaveral that night with winds of 30 mph (45 km/h). Between its three Floridian landfalls, Hurricane Gordon dumped 5–10 in (13–25 cm) of rain on Florida, with a station at Cooperstown recording 16.1 in (40.9 cm). The storm moved northward across Florida, northeastward across Georgia, and finally merged with a <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> over South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{surface area}} of low {{pressure}} detached from a <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> on August 8 while 1,150miles (1,850km) to the east of Bermuda. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. The surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a trough while 440miles (700km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained {{near the center of the}} upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} the southwestern {{periphery of the}} subtropical ridge, Maria turned to the north as its forward motion slowed considerably. Strong vertical wind shear over the system began to relax by September14, allowing Maria to slowly restrengthen as the convection redeveloped near its center. At 1800UTC on September15, Maria reached Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale while located roughly 135mi (215km) northwest of Bermuda. Embedded within increasing atmospheric flow, the hurricane's forward motion accelerated towards the northeast. At 0000UTC on September16, Maria attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983mbar (29.03inHg). Continuing on a northeastward course, Maria began to move over an area with cooler sea surface temperatures and higher vertical wind shear. Around 1800UTC, Maria weakened to a tropical storm and made landfall near Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland at 1830UTC with winds of 70mph (110km/h). Shortly thereafter, the cyclone's circulation was absorbed by a <b>frontal</b> <b>system</b> over the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, on September 18.|$|E
