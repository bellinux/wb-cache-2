5|$|The CQC-6 (Close Quarters Combat— Six) or Viper Six is a {{handmade}} tactical <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> with a tantō blade {{manufactured by}} knifemaker Ernest Emerson. Although initially reported as the sixth design in an evolution of fighting knives {{and the first}} model in the lineup of Emerson's Specwar Custom Knives, Emerson later revealed that the knife was named for SEAL Team Six. It has a chisel-ground blade of ATS-34 or 154CM stainless steel and a handle made of titanium and linen micarta. The CQC-6 is credited as the knife that popularized {{the concept of the}} tactical <b>folding</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 {{individual}} Navy SEALs from a West Coast {{team had}} been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker Phill Hartsfield. Hartsfield's knives were hard ground from differentially heat-treated A2 tool steel and {{are known for their}} distinctive chisel-ground blades. More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary bevel, minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a <b>folding</b> <b>knife,</b> he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.|$|E

5|$|Suqami's {{passport}} {{survived the}} crash {{and landed in}} the street below. Soaked in jet fuel, it {{was picked up by}} a passerby who gave it to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective shortly before the South Tower collapsed. Investigators retrieved Mohamed Atta's luggage, which had not been loaded onto the flight. In it they found Omari's passport and driver's license, a videocassette for a Boeing757 flight simulator, a <b>folding</b> <b>knife,</b> and pepper spray. In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The attack on the World Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: he had expected only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The flight recorders for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E
25|$|Folding Knife: A <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> is a {{knife with}} one or more blades that fit inside the handle that can still fit in a pocket. It is also known as a {{jackknife}} or jack-knife.|$|E
25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{feature on}} many <b>folding</b> <b>knives</b> is the opening mechanism. Traditional pocket knives and Swiss Army knives commonly employ the nail nick, while modern <b>folding</b> <b>knives</b> more often use a stud, hole, disk, or flipper {{located on the}} blade, all which {{have the benefit of}} allowing the user to open the knife with one hand.|$|R

25|$|A <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> {{connects the}} blade to the handle through a pivot, {{allowing}} the blade to fold into the handle. To prevent {{injury to the}} knife user through the blade accidentally closing on the user's hand, folding knives typically have a locking mechanism. Different locking mechanisms are favored by various individuals for reasons such as perceived strength (lock safety), legality, and ease of use.|$|E

25|$|The Linerlock is a locking {{mechanism}} for folding pocket knives. A Linerlock is a <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> with a side-spring lock {{that can be}} opened and closed with one hand without repositioning the knife in the hand. The lock is self-adjusting for wear. The modern Linerlock traces its lineage to the late 19th century, but in the 1980s the design was improved by American custom knifemaker Michael Walker.|$|E
25|$|The SARK (Search and Rescue Knife) or NSAR (Navy Search and Rescue) is a <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> {{designed}} by knifemaker Ernest Emerson {{for use as}} a search and rescue knife by the US military. It has a hawkbill with a blunt tip in order to cut free trapped victims without cutting them in the process. There is a variant with a pointed-tip designed for police, known as the P-SARK (Police Search and Rescue Knife).|$|E
25|$|The knife also {{features}} a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip {{is part of the}} blade itself which protrudes from the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> to incorporate a lanyard pivot joint, which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord lanyards. It also allows easy swapping of lanyards without a need to cut and retie if the owner has multiple lanyard pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The lanyard pivot joint has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2011 in the Netherlands {{a new law}} prohibits {{ownership}} or {{possession of}} the following knives, whether kept at home or not: Stilettos, switchblades, <b>folding</b> <b>knives</b> {{with more than one}} cutting edge, throwing <b>knives,</b> <b>folding</b> <b>knives</b> with an overall length of more than 28 cm when open, butterfly (balisong) or gravity knives, disguised knives (belt knife, sword cane, etc.) and push daggers.

25|$|A {{search of}} Chikatilo's {{belongings}} revealed {{he had been}} in possession of a <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> and two lengths of rope. A sample of Chikatilo's blood was taken, and he was placed in a cell inside the KGB headquarters in Rostov with a police informer, who was instructed to engage Chikatilo in conversation and elicit any information he could from him. The next day, 21 November, formal questioning of Chikatilo began. The interrogation was performed by Issa Kostoyev. The strategy chosen by the police to elicit a confession was to lead Chikatilo to believe that he was a very sick man in need of medical help. The intention was to give Chikatilo hope that if he confessed, he would not be prosecuted by reason of insanity. Police knew their case against Chikatilo was largely circumstantial, and under Soviet law, they had 10 days in which they could legally hold a suspect before either charging or releasing him.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Emerson {{branched}} {{out in a}} new direction, announcing he would manufacture twelve custom electric guitars per year. His first guitar debuted at Blade Magazines Blade Show in Atlanta in June 2007. [...] In 2008, Emerson opened a clothing company called [...] "Emerson Brand Apparel" [...] specializing in MMA and casual clothing. In 2009 at the annual NRA Convention, Emerson announced a collaboration with custom pistol manufacturer Les Baer to produce a custom M1911 pistol built to Emerson's specifications with a semi-custom (handground blade) <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> named the [...] "CQC-45"(out of sequence from the CQC series as the number relates to the caliber of the pistol). In late 2009, Emerson announced a collaboration with Spike's Tactical to produce an M-4 Carbine based upon his specifications for training, chambered in [...]22 long rifle and in 5.56 NATO; with a matching <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> designated the [...] "CQC-22" [...] (out of sequence from the CQC series as the number relates to the caliber of the rifle).|$|E
500|$|While not {{the first}} knifemaker to build {{what is known as}} a {{tactical}} <b>folding</b> <b>knife,</b> Emerson was one of several makers who popularized the concept of the handmade tactical folder in the 1980s. [...] Emerson's knives began appearing in the Rogue Warrior series of novels written by the founder of the US Navy's SEAL Team Six, Richard Marcinko, at this time which helped fuel interest among collectors.|$|E
50|$|Most knives {{produced}} by Spyderco are <b>folding</b> <b>knives</b> of various designs, blade steels, handle materials, and locking mechanisms (including two patented proprietary locks); however, {{they have also}} produced fixed-blade knives for various purposes.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{products}} include {{fixed blade}} <b>knives,</b> <b>folding</b> <b>knives,</b> swords, machetes, tomahawks, kukris, blowguns, walking sticks, and other martial arts items and training equipment. Their knives {{are used by}} military and law-enforcement personnel worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} mass {{production}} methods enabled <b>folding</b> <b>knives</b> with multiple components {{to be produced}} in large numbers at lower cost. By 1890, U.S. knife sales of all types were on the increase, buoyed by catalog mail order sales as well as mass marketing campaigns utilizing advertisements in periodicals and newspapers. In consequence, knife manufacturers began marketing new and much more affordable automatic knives to the general public. In Europe {{as well as the}} United States, automatic knife sales were never more than a fraction of sales generated by conventional <b>folding</b> <b>knives,</b> yet the type enjoyed consistent if modest sales from year to year.|$|R
500|$|Other models {{followed}} in the Specwar line bearing the CQC Series moniker, including the CQC-7 which is another chisel-ground tantō-bladed folder similar to the CQC-6 but with a saber-type handle shape. The CQC-8 ("Banana Knife") was a folder inspired by Bob Taylor's Warrior knife and [...] William F. Moran's ST-23 is used by British SAS troops. The knife has {{the distinction of being}} the first <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> that was designed to be ergonomically correct in both forward and reverse grip. Its users refer to it as [...] "the finest fighting knife ever developed". The CQC-9 ("Eagle Knife") is a reverse-curved hawkbill blade developed as a backup weapon for an American law enforcement agency; it has an opening hole in the blade licensed from knife manufacturer Spyderco. Although Emerson has standard models for these custom knives which progress in order to CQC16, each one is made individually by hand.|$|E
500|$|The Navy went to Emerson, who {{designed}} and fabricated a working prototype within 24hours. They {{found that it}} met their needs, and the model was dubbed the [...] "SARK" [...] (Search and Rescue Knife). The SARK is a <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> with a wharncliffe-style blade and a blunt tip designed so a rescuer could cut trapped victims free without stabbing them. The knife features Emerson's Wave. Seeing another need in the police community, Emerson replaced the blunt end of the SARK with a pointed end and named it the [...] "P-SARK", or Police Search And Rescue Knife. [...] In 2005, the Navy changed the requirements on the SARK to incorporate a guthook {{on the back of}} the blade for use as a line-cutter. [...] Emerson made the change on this model which is only available to the US Navy and the model designation is the NSAR (Navy Search And Rescue) Knife.|$|E
500|$|When {{he started}} classes with this [...] "homemade" [...] knife, his {{instructors}} and fellow students {{were impressed with}} his handiwork {{and asked him to}} make knives for them. Emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just the cost of materials, but he soon raised the price to $50 each, as demand for his knives increased. Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but upon seeing a Michael Walker handmade <b>folding</b> <b>knife</b> at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided {{he was going to make}} folding pocketknives from that point on. Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the Walker Linerlock mechanism on his own knives. [...] According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch, Emerson said of Walker, [...] "Here was a guy who put everything I was looking for into a knife. It was then I decided to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular".|$|E
50|$|After World War II, Camillus {{was quick}} to shift back to {{civilian}} production. It introduced many new products, and in 1947, Camillus began manufacturing a full line of official <b>folding</b> <b>knives</b> for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).|$|R
