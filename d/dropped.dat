40|$|Deformation and {{breakup of}} a {{three-dimensional}} viscous <b>drop</b> in isotropic turbulence has been mod-eled by direct numerical simulation. A pseudospec-tral {{representation of the}} turbulent outer flow field is rigorously connected to a detailed three-dimen-sional description of the <b>drop</b> microphysics using boundary integral calculations. The <b>drop</b> {{is assumed to be}} smaller than the Kolmogorov scale. <b>Drop</b> dynamics depend on the <b>drop</b> viscosity and a capil-lary number. In weaker flows, our simulations indi-cate that <b>drops</b> break at modest length into two large daughter <b>drops</b> with only a small volume of satellite <b>drops.</b> In stronger flows, <b>drops</b> become highly elongated before breaking and produce many smaller <b>drops.</b> <b>Drops</b> with higher viscosity are stabi-lized against breakup. Under the same conditions, our simulations show that on some trajectories <b>drops</b> may become highly elongated and recover to modest length without breaking while <b>drops</b> on other trajectories may break at only modest length.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of mixing and satellite <b>drop</b> formation following the coalescence of initially stationary low-viscosity <b>drops</b> {{of the same}} liquid has been investigated using immiscible systems. The main parameters of interest are the <b>drop</b> sizes, the <b>drop</b> viscosity and the host viscosity. For <b>drops</b> of equal sizes there is no mixing following coalescence, {{which is consistent with}} that first demonstrated on the Skylab. However, for <b>drops</b> of unequal sizes there is considerable mixing with the smaller <b>drop</b> penetrating the larger <b>drop</b> as a vortex. In the extreme case of coalescence of a small <b>drop</b> with the bulk of the same liquid at a flat interface, the measured penetration depth is found to be proportional to the 5 / 4 th power of the <b>drop</b> diameter and inversely proportional to the square root of <b>drop</b> viscosity. When the <b>drop</b> and host viscosities are comparable, <b>drop</b> penetration is prematurely terminated by the formation of a satellite <b>drop.</b> However, when the <b>drop</b> diameter ratio (large to small) is below a critical number, satellite <b>drop</b> formation is inhibited and coalescence goes to completion. The influence of drop-host viscosity ratio on this critical diameter ratio has been examined...|$|R

It is believed that the bomb <b>dropped</b> from Tait's aircraft struck the battleship, and the other bombs <b>dropped</b> by this group landed in the water nearby. All the other Force A aircraft aimed their Tallboys at the anti-aircraft gunfire rising from the ship; 17 of the weapons were <b>dropped.</b> Several Lancasters made more than one pass over the target area as their bomb aimers sought to locate Tirpitz or technical problems prevented their Tallboy from being <b>dropped</b> on the initial pass.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Cooling tower {{rain zone}} {{performance}} {{characteristics such as}} the loss coefficient and the Merkel number are evaluated and simulated.

Using the experimental <b>drop</b> size data and CFD, the performance uncertainty produced by using the Rosin-Rammler <b>drop</b> distribution function as opposed to the discrete <b>drop</b> distribution data is investigated.
