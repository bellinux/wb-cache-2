40|$|A primary {{function}} in today's Internet router {{is to determine}} the next hop to which a packet should be forwarded. The algorithm used by each router to obtain the next-hop information for a packet should always result in a loop-free routing path to the packet's destination. An example of such an algorithm is the link-state protocol OSPF. In an OSPF-based router, all packets with the same destination are forwarded to a next hop that lies on a path of shortest distance to the destination. Given a set of link states, all packets between the same source and destination are forwarded along one or more paths of the same (shortest) distance. This paper presents a novel Multiple Path Algorithm (MPA) that enables a packet to be forwarded to its destination along multiple alternate loop-free paths, which are not necessarily of shortest distance. The key idea of MPA is to maintain an efficient data structure in a router that helps compute for each <b>destination,</b> <b>alternate</b> viable next hops from the r [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{importance}} of hub-and-spoke operations in the trucking industry, crossdocking has become an important and effective tool to transfer freight. Companies like Wal-Mart, Costco and Home Depot are using this kind of facility in their logistics operations. In these crossdocks, efficiently operating them, thereby reducing unnecessary waiting and staging congestion for freight and workers {{is an important issue}} for managers. This dissertation uses real-time information about the contents of inbound and outbound trailers and the locations of pallets to schedule unloading for waiting trailers or assign destinations for unloading pallets: we choose a waiting trailer that will need the least time for its pallets and existing pallets; and we may assign an <b>alternate</b> <b>destination</b> for a pallet if its primary destination is expected to encounter congestion. Two dynamic trailer scheduling and four <b>alternate</b> <b>destination</b> strategies are proposed and compared with baseline scenarios. Our simulation results suggest that: 1. Our strategies are effective. The two time-based trailer scheduling algorithms can save cycle times as much as 64 %, 57 % and 30 % in the 4 -to- 4, 4 -to- 8 and 8 -to- 8 crossdock scenarios, respectively; the four <b>alternate</b> <b>destination</b> strategies can save cycle times as much as 34 % in the 8 -to- 8 staging crossdock scenarios. In addition, these strategies can raise throughputs for crossdocks. These effects should result in noticeable improvements in supply chain networks, including shorter transportation lead-times, more reliable on-time deliveries and lower inventory costs. 2. In our <b>alternate</b> <b>destination</b> strategies, even if a destination-change results in extra time for value-added services for freight, the strategies are still worth adopting. 3. The combination models of our trailer scheduling algorithms and <b>alternate</b> <b>destination</b> strategies work better than solely implementing an <b>alternate</b> <b>destination</b> strategy when trailer arrivals are dense. 4. A higher flexibility in choosing <b>alternate</b> <b>destinations</b> can bring higher performance for crossdocks...|$|R
