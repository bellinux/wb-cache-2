5|$|Powerful vested {{interests}} and corrupt commanders were, as of February 2011, the largest obstacle to reforming the army. Some newly delivered weaponry was sold by officers. The <b>International</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>Group</b> {{also said that}} AMISOM's efforts at assisting in formalizing the military's structure and providing training to the estimated 8,000 SNA soldiers were problematic. Resistance continued {{to the establishment of}} an effective chain of command, logical military formations and a credible troop roster. Although General Mohamed Gelle Kahiye, the respected former army chief, attempted to instill reforms, he was marginalized and eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>Group</b> {{writes that}} the AFL was reduced {{practically}} {{to the point of}} non-existence by Fall 2001, by which time a total of 4,000 personnel had been retired. The Second Liberian Civil War, originated in clashes in April 1999 but was not a major threat to Taylor until 2000–01. However, on the government side the AFL played only a minor role; irregular ex National Patriotic Front of Liberia militias backed by more privileged Taylor partisans such as the Anti-Terrorist Unit saw most of the fighting.|$|E

5000|$|The loss of {{pensions}} {{contributed to}} the poverty of many of those affected by the de-Ba'athification policy. [...] Few sources have commented on this particular aspect of the policy, {{and its impact on}} the lives of affected Iraqis. An NPR interview with several Iraqi directors who were recently removed from their positions within the banking industry, shows how devastating not only the prospect of unemployment, but the interviewee bemoans his loss of a pension after all his years of work. [...] The point noted by <b>International</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>Group’s</b> assessment of thousands of young unemployed Iraqis, without the possibility of employment or a future pension is a dangerous factor within an occupation scenario.|$|R

As an émigré in South Africa (2003-2008), Kagwanja was senior researcher at Safer Africa, a Pretoria-based think tank centrally involved in the processes {{that led to the}} establishment of the African Union Peace and Security Architecture. He became the Director of the <b>International</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>Group's</b> Southern Africa Project (2004-2007).

Kagwanja also started the Africa in Focus series, a publication of HSRC dedicated to key developments in Africa.|$|R
40|$|Violence in the Middle East {{has been}} {{increasingly}} discussed in sectarian terms {{over the past}} few years. In Lebanon, academics and experts alike have been quick to cite the rise in sectarian violence plaguing the country as spillover from the civil war in neighboring Syria. In this thesis, I reevaluated this assumption by looking at the role of domestic stability, proxy intervention, and conflict spillover as causes for the rise in sectarian violence in Lebanon. A comparative case study approach is used to divide the country's post-Syrian occupation history into three distinct time periods in order to better isolate each of the three categories of analysis. Through the use of <b>International</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>Group’s</b> <b>Crisis</b> Watch Database, I quantitatively analyzed the number of violence incidences, the type of violence, the frequency of incidences, and the number of fatalities to determine that violence had indeed increased in frequency and that the nature of the violence had evolved over time. By using this approach, I was able to deduce that the relationship between the rise in violence and conflict spillover is not as clear-cut as many scholars have made it out to be. Instead, the rise in sectarian violence {{can be attributed to the}} rise of Hezbollah as a major political player since 2005 and its decision to enter into the Syrian conflict on the side of President Bashar al-Assad...|$|R

25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the conflict, Gaddafi called for a rally against the {{government}} that was to be held on 17 February.

25|$|In May 2010 the <b>International</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>Group</b> {{published}} a detailed report on war crimes {{during the final}} months of the civil war.

25|$|The {{main cause}} for the {{continued}} weakness of the Transitional Government is the refusal by the former warring parties to give up power to a centralised and neutral national administration. Some belligerents maintained administrative and military command-and-control structures separate {{from that of the}} Transitional Government, but as the <b>International</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>Group</b> has reported, these have gradually been reduced. A high level of official corruption siphoning money away from civil servants, soldiers and infrastructure projects causes further instability.|$|E

25|$|The exact size of Abkhazia's {{population}} was unclear. According to the census {{carried out in}} 2003 it measured 215,972 people, but this is contested by Georgian authorities.
