The effects of the release time on the liquid pool volume and radius are investigated for the continuous release.

To assess the influence of a noise shield, a full scale test was conducted on an already constructed part of the Betuweline. A rail tanker was filled with 50 m 3 red-colored environmentally safe liquid. The liquid was instantaneously released. A very peculiar pool shape actually results due to the presence of a noise shield. A zone between the rails and the noise shield (2 m wide and 90 m long) is within 2 - 3 min filled with 15 cm of liquid. The total pool size area was about 750 m 2.

40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to {{understand}} effluent dispersion in shallow tidal waters, a two-dimensional analysis of advection and diffusion in a reversing flow has been carried out. The flow speed varies linearly with time, passing through zero at time t = 0. A point source discharges contaminant into this flow at a steady rate, so that water which is close. to the source around the time of flow reversal will become highly contaminated. Thus a peak in the contaminant concentration field will appear, moving downstream after the reversal at a speed close to that of the flow. This concentration peak has certain characteristics similar to a cloud of contaminant from an instantaneous discharge at t = 0. The solution of the advection-diffusion equation {{is in the form of}} an integral of concentration fields due to <b>instantaneous</b> <b>releases</b> of contaminant at all previous times. At large times after the flow reversal, asymptotic analysis yields good approximations to this integral. The use of Laplace's method is equivalent to ignoring longitudinal diffusion (the boundary-layer approximation); however, the expansion obtained in this way is not uniformly valid near the concentration peak, indicating that longitudinal diffusion plays an important role in the development of this peak. Uniformly valid expansions are obtained for the concentration around the peak, and also around the source where the boundary-layer approximation always breaks down. Numerical integration has also been carried out, the results being used to produce contour plots of concentration for various times either side of the flow reversal. 1...|$|R

The possible leakage of radionuclides from these aging tanks and their migration to the aquifer was studied using <b>instantaneous</b> <b>release.</b> This study was done based on the geological and hydrological characteristics of the site, which were obtained from the hydrogeological data of 25 wells previously drilled {{at the site of the}} reactor[1]. These data were used to calculate the trend of water levels, hydraulic gradient, and formulation of water table maps from 1993 – 2002. This information was utilized to determine water velocity in the unsaturated zone. Radionuclides released from the settling tank to the aquifer were screened according to the radionuclides that have high migration ability and high activity. The amount of fission and activation products of the burned fuels that contaminated the water content of the reactor pool were considered as 10 % of the original spent fuel. The radionuclides considered in this case were H- 3, Sr- 90, Zr- 93, Tc- 99, Cd- 113, Cs- 135, Cs- 137, Sm- 151, Pu- 238, Pu- 240, Pu- 241, and Am- 241.

40|$|Introduction: In scuba-diving practice, {{instantaneous}} {{gas consumption}} is generally {{calculated from the}} fall in cylinder pressure without considering the effects of water temperature (heat transfer) and adiabatic processes. We aimed to develop a simple but precise method for calculating the instantaneous gas consumption during a dive. Methods: With gas thermodynamics and water/gas heat transfer, the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>released</b> gas mass was modelled. In addition, five subjects made an open-water, air, open-circuit scuba dive to 32 metres' sea water. Depth, cylinder pressure and water temperature were recorded with a dive computer and gas consumption was calculated and compared using different methods. Results: After descent in open-water dives, the calculated gas mass in the cylinder {{was the same as}} calculated from cylinder data, suggesting that the model is adequate. Modelled dives showed that adiabatic effects can result in considerable overestimate of the gas consumption, depending on the dive profile, exercise-dependent pulmonary ventilation and the cylinder volume. On descending, gas thermodynamics are predominantly adiabatic, and the adiabatic correction of ventilation is substantial. During the dive, the adiabatic process (at the start 100 %) decreases steadily {{until the end of the}} dive. Adiabatic phenomena are substantially different between square and saw-tooth profiles. In the emergency situation of a nearly empty cylinder after a square-wave dive involving heavy physical exertion, the adiabatic effect on the cylinder pressure is generally > 20 %. Then, with a strongly reduced consumption at the start of the ascent, heat inflow produces an increase of cylinder pressure and so more gas becomes available for an emergency ascent. Conclusion: Adiabatic effects, being indirectly dependent on exercise, the profile and other conditions, can be substantial. The developed method seems sufficiently accurate for research and possibly for reconstruction of fatalities and is implementable in dive computer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFault-slip {{taking place}} in {{underground}} mines occasionally causes severe damage to mine openings {{as a result of}} strong ground motion induced by seismic waves arising from fault-slip. It is indicated from previous studies that intense seismic waves could be generated with the shock unloading of fault surface asperities during fault-slip. This study investigates the shock unloading with numerical simulation. A three-dimensional (3 D) numerical model with idealized asperities is constructed with the help of discrete element code 3 DEC. The idealization is conducted to particularly focus on simulating the shock unloading that previous numerical models, which replicate asperity degradation and crack development during the shear behavior of a joint surface in previous studies, fail to capture and simulate. With the numerical model, static and dynamic analyses are carried out to simulate unloading of asperities in the course of fault-slip. The results obtained from the dynamic analysis show that gradual stress release takes place around the center of the asperity tip at a rate of 45  MPa/ms for the base case, while an <b>instantaneous</b> stress <b>release</b> greater than 80  MPa occurs near the periphery of the asperity tip when the contact between the upper and lower asperities is lost. The <b>instantaneous</b> stress <b>release</b> becomes more intense {{in the vicinity of the}} asperity tip, causing tensile stress more than 20  MPa. It is deduced that the tensile stress could further increase if the numerical model is discretized more densely and analysis is carried out under stress conditions at a great depth. A model parametric study shows that in-situ stress state has a significant influence on the magnitude of the generated tensile stress. The results imply that the rapid stress release generating extremely high tensile stress on the asperity tip can cause intense seismic waves when it occurs at a great depth...|$|R
