50|$|The new Kenya Forests Act (2005) also {{provided}} {{for the establishment of}} Community Forest Associations (CFA). In 2009 an initiative was thus formed under the name 'Friends of Karura Forest Community Forest Association'. Recognising the growing threats to Karura from uncontrolled development the neighbouring Muthaiga and Gigiri Residents Associations begin discussions in early 2009 to form a Community Forest Association for Karura. A letter of intent circulated to northern Nairobi neighbourhoods residents, <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>agencies</b> and VIPs under joint signature of KFS and the Muthaiga Residents’ Association (MRA). A stakeholders’ Working Committee was formed to steer the process, and, in order to raise awareness, it organised a media event {{in the form of the}} opening of Karura’s ‘Family Trail’ on 16 May 2009 with the Hon. Noah Wekesa, Minister for Forestry and Wildlife, presiding. Hundreds of stakeholders participated in walking the length of the trail. On 25 May 2009 KFS wrote a letter to the Registrar of Societies expressing No Objection to the registration of the new CFA. Between April and July 2009 FKF-CFA office-bearers completed the required vetting processes with the Criminal Investigation Division and Registrar of Societies. The FKF-KFS joint management plans were drafted by the Working Committee. On 1 October 2009 the Registrar of Societies signed the Certificate of Registration for the Friends of Karura Community Forest Association.

5000|$|During 1985 and 1986, the National Security Advisor {{and certain}} staff members took a {{particularly}} activist {{role in the}} formulation and execution of policy in the Caribbean, Central America, and the Middle East. It was an activism run amok in the [...] "Iran-Contra affair" [...] that brought the NSC to a nadir of public trust and brought upon it Congressional investigation {{and the threat of}} prison for those involved. The Iran-Contra matter resulted from NSC-led efforts to develop a policy to befriend Iran and provide arms to that nation in exchange for its resistance to the Soviet Union and, more particularly to assist in the freeing of American hostages held by Muslim extremist groups in the Middle East. National Security Advisor McFarlane and Admiral Poindexter, who succeeded him in December 1985, played major roles in these matters. The efforts to provide arms for hostages eventually became connected, through the transfer of funds made with arms sales, with the NSC staff's ardent support for the Nicaraguan [...] "Contras" [...] in their civil war against the left-wing government of Nicaragua. Investigations in 1987 and thereafter by a Presidential Review Board (the Tower Commission), Congress (Congressional Committees Investigating The Iran-Contra Affair), and a Special Prosecutor (Lawrence Walsh) examined in great detail the activities of the NSC staff, as well as the actions and responsibilities of the President, the National Security Advisor, and the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>agencies.</b>|$|E

Ali opened the conference with a briefing of his administration's development goals {{for the next five}} years, which would be centered on economic growth, health, education and security. Ambassador Mahamet Saleh Annadif, the Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission (SRCC) for Somalia, also commended Puntland on its democratization process and emphasized the importance of the region's stability as well as its position as a role model for other federal states in Somalia. The roundtable meeting concluded with a joint press conference including EU Envoy to Somalia Ambassador Michele Cervone D'urso, during which President Ali announced that the international representatives had agreed to support the Puntland administration's five-year development plan.Between 27-29 December 2014, Ali, Puntland cabinet members, director generals, <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>agencies</b> and departments, and senior government officials held a follow-up three-day retreat in Garowe to review the 2014 Government Action Plan.

40|$|Although {{decentralization}} {{is often}} modeled as {{an outcome of}} bargaining over rents and poli-cies, intuitively it seems possible that public statements, symbols and status often have {{a great impact on}} this process. The paper studies the relative importance of the “real” political actions versus the changes of symbolic nature in the bargaining over devolution and secession, using the unique laboratory of the personnel recentralization in the Russian security agencies in 2000 - 2007. While in the 1990 s regional branches of federal ministries were mostly captured by regional governors, in 2000 s Putin replaced the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>agencies</b> by new bureaucrats, cut-ting the connections to the region. The paper finds a robust influence of symbolic gestures made by regional governments in the earlier bargaining process on appointments, even if the actual devolution policies did not matter.
