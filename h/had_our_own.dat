That all changed when Crow Dog killed Spotted Tail. Of course, our method of dealing with that was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe. But that was considered too barbaric, and thought perhaps we should hang him like civilized people do, so they passed the Major Crimes Act that said we don't {{know how to handle}} murderers {{and they were going to}} show us." ...|$|E
500|$|After Lennon became famous, she berated him for {{speaking}} in a Liverpudlian accent, but Lennon replied: [...] "That's showbusiness, {{they want me to}} speak more Liverpool". Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, [...] "I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, <b>had</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> garden. They didn't have anything like that".|$|E

Although Reyes would later become Doggett's partner, the series attempted to differentiate the Doggett/Reyes relationship from the Mulder/Scully relationship. Robert Patrick later noted, [...] "We're {{not going to try}} to duplicate , we're {{not going to try to}} regenerate the magic chemistry." [...] However, he later did say [...] "that Gillian and I <b>had</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> chemistry that was unique unto itself, and likewise with the addition of Annabeth.

By December, Mostert distanced the league from the ailing governing body and explicitly said that the Strongman Champions League {{had nothing to do with}} IFSA. He told IronMind [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> logo, we <b>have</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> brand, we do <b>our</b> <b>own</b> competitions."

500|$|Similar {{to other}} Sleater-Kinney albums, {{the lyrics of}} All Hands on the Bad One feature personal, political, and social themes. The first song, [...] "The Ballad of the Ladyman", is a {{deliberate}} attempt to mock those who misunderstand the band. Tucker said that the song is [...] "almost making fun of how people see us, how people see what you're supposed to be when you're a woman in rock." [...] The song was inspired when the band was invited to the Bowlie Weekender music festival in England in 1999. Tucker explained, [...] "We were all staying in little chalets or whatever and we <b>had</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> cabin and we were cabin 216. Someone wrote this message to us that was like, 'Cabin 216 ladymen.' And we were like, 'What?' It {{was meant to be}} a funny thing, but in this other way, it was really this naming of us. It was a subtle way of saying, 'Oh, you're different because you're a woman band and because you're in some ways political.' It's still seen as threatening to people. It's not like we had this weekend where we just relaxed with everyone and just hung out." [...] Kat Iudicello, writing for PopMatters, stated that the song [...] "sports sweet harmonies, a slow anger and soft, low bitterness, and driving steady guitars and drums." ...|$|E

[...] "I made my decision two-and-a-half hours after the Georgian army began the active fighting. Not earlier, because this was wrong, since this was {{the decision to use}} the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation on foreign soil, I underline, the foreign territory. But not later too," [...] he said. He also said that he contacted Putin on 8 August.|$|E
2500|$|After {{examining}} {{their past}} in retrospect, Jung {{took the opportunity}} to write [...] "Young Forever" [...] in midst of a bout of insomnia. Jung explained that, [...] "we <b>had</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> hard times", but he desired to [...] "overcome them with our passion". [...] "Stay Sober" [...] was initially included on the band's Japanese single [...] "White". Jung attempted to translate the lyrics in Korean, but he [...] "loved" [...] the original lyrics and believed that they [...] "felt the best". The track was one of several omitted from previous releases; Jung re-arranged the song in order to add it to an album afterwards. He felt that the inclusion of the song brought balance to the record by each track bearing a specific [...] "element".|$|E

2500|$|The {{price of}} rubber {{declined}} in the 1900s, prompting a revolt in 1902. The uprising, the last attempt by the Ovimbundu peoples to resist Portuguese colonization, pitted rival traders against one another. However, while the Portuguese maintained ethnic and national solidarity, the Ovimbundu continued to engage in slave raids. The Portuguese suppressed the rebellion and annexed the Central Highlands. Degredado settlers and Boer farmers stole natives' lands, impressing and deporting workers to plantations. Portuguese authorities arrested the king of Bailundo after an Ovimbundu celebration in which natives consumed Portuguese rum, allegedly without paying. The king's advisor, Mutu ya Kevela, allied with Bailundo's neighboring kingdoms and launched a liberation war. He told his council, rallying them to fight, [...] "Before the traders came we <b>had</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> home-brewed beer, we lived long lives and were strong." [...] Kevela's troops killed Portuguese colonists and burned down their trading posts. Native victories spread towards Bié, but Portuguese troops stationed in Benguela and Moçâmedes put down the revolt. The war ended in 1903, almost two years later, with the Portuguese victorious and Kevela dead.|$|E

60|$|When I had {{the fortune}} {{to meet him}} first, I suppose that in the employ of the kindly house we were both so eager to serve, our dignities were about the same; for if the 'Atlantic Monthly' was a {{somewhat}} prouder affair than an eclectic weekly like 'Every Saturday', he was supreme in his place, and I was subordinate in mine. The house was careful, in the attitude of its senior partner, not to distinguish between us, and we were not slow to perceive the tact used in managing us; we <b>had</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> joke of it; we compared notes to find whether we were equally used in this thing or that; and we promptly shared the fun of our discovery with Fields himself.|$|E
6000|$|We {{smiled at}} him--a sickly, propitiatory smile. We said, [...] "Good dog--poor fellow!"

We <b>had</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> private opinion concerning him, and it was unfavorable. But we did not express it. We would not have hurt his feelings for the world. He was a visitor, our guest, so to speak--and, as well-brought-up young men, we felt that {{the right thing to do}} was for us to prevent his gaining any hint that we were not glad to see him, and to make him feel as little as possible the awkwardness of his position.|$|E
60|$|That settled our position. We were {{instantly}} regarded, {{not only}} as Buddhists, but as mighty magicians from a far country. The monks made haste to show us rooms destined for our use in the monastery. They were not unbearably filthy, and we <b>had</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> bedding. We had {{to spend the night}} there, that was certain. We had, at least, escaped the worst and most pressing danger. I may add that I believe our cook to have been a most arrant liar--which was a lucky circumstance. Once the wretched creature saw the tide turn, I have reason to infer that he supported our cause by telling the chief Lama the most incredible stories about our holiness and power. At any rate, it is certain that we were regarded with the utmost respect, and treated thenceforth with the affectionate deference due to acknowledged and certified sainthood.|$|E

60|$|Mexico, in her various revolutions, {{had been}} unable to give that {{protection}} to the subjects of foreign nations which she would have liked to give, and some of her revolutionary leaders had forced loans from them. Under pretence of protecting their citizens, these nations seized upon Mexico as a foothold for establishing a European monarchy upon our continent, thus threatening our peace at home. I, myself, regarded this as a direct act of war against the United States by the powers engaged, and supposed {{as a matter of course}} that the United States would treat it as such when their hands were free to strike. I often spoke of the matter to Mr. Lincoln and the Secretary of War, but never heard any special views from them to enable me to judge what they thought or felt about it. I inferred that they felt a good deal as I did, but were unwilling to commit themselves while we <b>had</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> troubles upon our hands.|$|E

These stupid and vulgar accidents of human contrivance cannot befall us; but I shall not {{be able to tell you}} just how or why, or to detail the process of eliminating chance. I may say, however, that it began with the nationalization of telegraphs, expresses, railroads, mines, and all large industries operated by stock companies.
