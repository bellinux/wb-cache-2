Whether the atrocities committed are acts <b>of</b> <b>discrimination,</b> acts <b>of</b> human <b>trafficking</b> such as the forced labor or sexual exploitation of individuals, the denial of access to food and water, acts of genocide, or other violations of fundamental human rights, those who commit these inhumane acts should be held accountable and brought to justice.

40|$|A {{barrier to}} the {{widespread}} adoption of learning-based net-work intrusion detection tools is the in-situ training require-ments for effective <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> malicious <b>traffic.</b> Su-pervised learning techniques necessitate a quantity of la-beled examples that is often intractable, and at best cost-prohibitive. Recent advances in semi-supervised techniques have demonstrated the ability to generalize knowledge based on a significantly smaller number of provided examples. In network intrusion detection, placing reasonable requirements {{on the number of}} training examples provides realistic expec-tations that a learning-based system can be trained in the environment where it will be deployed. This in-situ train-ing is necessary to ensure that the assumptions associated with the learning process hold, and thereby support a rea-sonable belief in the generalization ability of the resulting model. In this paper, we describe the application of a care-fully selected nonparametric, semi-supervised learning algo-rithm to the network intrusion problem, and compare the performance to other model types using feature-based data derived from an operational network. We demonstrate dra-matic performance improvements over supervised learning and anomaly detection in discriminating real, previously un-seen, malicious network traffic while generating an order of magnitude fewer false alerts than any alternative, including a signature IDS tool deployed on the same network...|$|R

Emergency traffic in the 802. 15. 6 standard for a wireless body area network (WBAN). This standard {{is one of the}} choices available for the so-called wearable Internet or wireless connection between electronic devices worn on or implanted in the human body. The features for positive <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> emergency <b>traffic</b> are identified at three different components in the 802. 15. 6 standard in order to emphasize the importance of its prioritized delivery that must be always preserved due to potential applications in the field of monitoring of health variables. However, prioritization could be compromised by the anomaly in the medium access under contention algorithms in standard 802. 15. 6. That is the reason that we find it appropriate to address the anomaly, i. e. to describe a sequence of packets that can bring a station into the state in which it sends highest-priority data frames with the parameters of the back-off algorithm used for traffic with a significantly lower priority and thus reduces the station’s chances to access the medium. The main contribution of this work is to identify the set of five conditions that must be met {{at the same time in}} order to make the anomaly to appear, and explain that the scene for anomaly manifestation would be set up periodically in secured communication. We provide a simulation study and discussion on the available solutions for preventing this anomaly including a minor change to the algorithm at the level of the standard...|$|R

We show that ancilla-assisted discrimination procedures provide a nontrivial advantage over simple (ancilla-free) schemes for perfect distinguishability and we prove that inevitably m <= n. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions of perfect distinguishability of general binary measurements. We show that the optimization <b>of</b> the <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> projective qubit measurements and their mixtures with white noise {{is equivalent to the}} <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> specific quantum states. In particular, the optimal protocol for <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> projective qubit measurements with fixed failure rate (exploiting maximally entangled test state) is described. While minimum error <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> two projective qubit measurements can be realized without any need of entanglement, we show that <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> three projective qubit measurements requires a bipartite probe state. Moreover, when the measurements are not projective, the non-maximally entangled test states can outperform the maximally entangled ones. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Drinking {{driving is}} {{responsible}} for a high proportion <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> accidents. To {{study the effects of}} alcohol on drivers and driving performance, 25 drivers’ subjective feelings and driving performance data in different blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) levels were collected with simulated driving experiment. The investigation results revealed that alcohol affected drivers in many aspects, including attitude, judgment, vigilance, perception, reaction, and controlling. The analysis of accident rate showed that higher BAC level would lead to higher accident rate. The statistical analysis results of driving performance indicated that average speed, speed standard deviation, and lane position standard deviation were significantly higher under the influence of alcohol. They also had a statistically significant linear trend as the function of BAC level. The <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> drinking driving based on driving performance was performed with Fisher discrimination method. The results showed that drinking driving with higher BAC level was easier to discriminate from normal driving. Also, the results indicated that the three significant indicators on straight roadway could be used in the <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> drinking driving state. The conclusions can provide references for the study of drinking driving and the identification of driving state and then contribute to traffic safety...|$|R

40|$|Background Detecting genetic factors {{involved}} in {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is complicated because of their small effect sizes and complex interactions. The endophenotype approach eases this by coming closer to the relevant genes. Different aspects of temporal information processing are known to be affected in ADHD. Thus, some of these aspects could represent candidate endophenotypes for ADHD. Method Fifty-four sib-pairs with at least one child with ADHD and 40 control children aged 6 - 18 years were recruited and asked to perform two duration discrimination tasks, one with a base duration of 50 ms on automatic timing and one with a base duration of 1000 ms on cognitively controlled timing. Results Whereas children with ADHD, but not their unaffected siblings, were impaired in <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> longer intervals, both groups were impaired in discriminating brief intervals. Furthermore, a significant within-family correlation was found for <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> brief intervals. Task performances of subjects of the control group correlated with individual levels <b>of</b> hyperactivity/impulsivity for <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> brief intervals, but not of longer intervals. Conclusions Cognitively controlled and also automatic processes of temporal information processing are impaired in children with ADHD. <b>Discrimination</b> <b>of</b> longer intervals appears as a typical ‘disease marker' whereas <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> brief intervals shows up as a ‘vulnerability marker'. <b>Discrimination</b> <b>of</b> brief intervals was found to be familial and linked to levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity.
