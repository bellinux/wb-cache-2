And holding a white opake Chart, or a Quire of Paper {{at the center of the}} Spheres to which the Speculum was ground, that is, at the {{distance}} of about five Feet and eleven Inches from the Speculum, in such manner, that the beam of Light might pass through a little hole made in the middle of the Chart to the Speculum, and thence be reflected back to the same hole: I observed upon the Chart four or five concentric Irises or Rings of Colours, like Rain-bows, encompassing the hole much after the manner that those, which in the fourth and following Observations of the first part of this Book appear'd between the Object-glasses, encompassed the black Spot, but yet larger and fainter than those. These Rings as they grew larger and larger became <b>diluter</b> and fainter, so that the fifth was scarce visible. Yet sometimes, when the Sun shone very clear, there appear'd faint Lineaments of a sixth and seventh. If the distance of the Chart from the Speculum was much greater or much less than that of six Feet, the Rings became dilute and vanish'd. And if the distance of the Speculum from the Window was much greater than that of six Feet, the reflected beam of Light would be so broad at the distance of six Feet from the Speculum where the Rings appear'd, as to obscure one or two of the innermost Rings. And therefore I usually placed the Speculum at about six Feet from the Window; so that its Focus might there fall in with the center of its concavity at the Rings upon the Chart.

The semen samples were collected from three Ghezel rams. Samples were diluted in seminal plasma (SP), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Bioexcell. The motility parameters that computed and recorded by CASA include curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight line velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), straightness (STR), linearity (LIN), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), and beat cross frequency (BCF). In all <b>diluters,</b> there was a decrease in the average of all three parameters of sperms movement velocity as the time passed, but density of this decrease was more intensive in SP. The average of ALH between <b>diluters</b> indicated a significant difference, as it was more in Bioexcell in comparison with the similar amount in SP and PBS. The average of LIN in the diluted sperms in Bioexcell was less than two other <b>diluters</b> in all three times. The motility parameters of the diluted sperms in Bioexcell and PBS indicated an important and considerable difference with the diluted sperms in SP. According to the gained results, the Bioexcell has greater ability in preserving motility of sperm in comparison with the other <b>diluters</b> but as SP is considered as physiological environment for sperm.

Measurements of high concentration aerosols typically require some method {{to reduce the}} concentration of the aerosol to a measureable method. One common method is to use an aerosol <b>diluter</b> to reduce the aerosol concentration by a known value. Particle loss within the aerosol diluters can result in values of dilution that are particle size dependent and vary from the idealized volumetric dilution value. Experiments were performed to measure the sub- 100 nm particle loss within aerosol diluters. The diluters tested include the TSI 3302, MSP 1100, a “leaky filter” laboratory diluters and a newly developed Orifice <b>Diluter.</b> Particle loss within aerosol diluters {{was found to be}} a significant effect, with up to 50 % of the dilution being due to particle loss. Particle loss within the aerosol diluters was found to be primarily diffusion driven and loss within the diluters increased with decreasing particle diameter. A new terms was derived to describe particle loss within the aerosol diluters where <b>diluter</b> penetration describes the percentage of particle loss within an aerosol <b>diluter.</b> Further investigation into particle charge found a significant reduction in particle penetration when the aerosol was singly charged. This can result as much as a 40 % enhancement in particle loss. <b>Diluter</b> penetration curves for the TSI 3302,MSP 1100, “leaky filter” and Orifice Diluters were then used to correct measurements of high concentration diesel aerosol.

CASA systems offer an accurate, rapid, objective and simultaneous assessment of different semen parameters allowing the visualization of subtle changes in sperm characteristics, which cannot be identified by conventional semen analysis. The main problems of these computerized measuring devices are the relatively high investment costs and the need for standardization and validation before any practical use is possible.

To minimise the risks inherent in a fully unswept beam, a sacrificial graphite mandrel will be placed on the core axis, surrounded by a thick high strength carbon-carbon composite tube. With this arrangement, structural damage will be avoided in the event of total sweep failure, during LHC commissioning and probably up to nominal beam intensity. However, severe damage may still occur at the ultimate beam intensity; in this respect, further analyses of mass-transport phenomena is required. Potential long term improvements are considered. The next and last part of this study will be devoted to the structural analysis of the main aluminium-graphite dump under normal operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} ways to improve the technology of bull semen cryoconservation in order to decrease the total sperm number per straw. The other objective was to investigate the relationship between spermatological parameters and the fertility of AI-bulls in the form of NRR as well as to present a combination and weighting of these parameters which facilitate the forecast of the NRR. For these purposes four large-scale trials were carried out. In the first section of this study a control of the insemination portions homogeneity with regard to sperm number and sperm quality was done. First a preliminary test to determine the sedimentation behaviour of the bull sperms was examined and this was followed by a main attempt for the actual control of the homogeneity. During this process a total of 30 ejaculates from six bulls were collected and two <b>diluters</b> and two dilution degrees were investigated. By a sperm investigation it could be proved that with a careful preparation of the semen the quality of the insemination portions of an ejaculate is homogeneous with regard to sperm number and vitality of the frozen-thawed sperm. In the second section of the study the effect of different temperatures and cooling rates during the routine course of the bull semen production with regard to the sperm quality after thawing was examined. Further tests determined the influences of the packing and equilibration time at 4 °C on the vitality of the sperms after the thawing. In the three experiments carried out in this section a total of 56 ejaculates were evaluated. The different temperature regimes had on average no considerable influence on the motility of the frozen sperm after thawing. It could be shown that a packing of the diluted semen after the equilibration showed better sperm motility after thawing than when packing occurs already at room temperature before equilibration. The third attempt of this section showed that the duration of the equilibration period influences the sperm motility as well as other vitality parameters of the sperm after thawing. The values increased between 1 and 48 hours. To avoid a possible increase of the lipids peroxidation during the cryopreservation of bull semen, the addition of Oxyfree® Premix (IMV, France) was tested with two commercial <b>diluters</b> using three dilution degrees in two experiments (using 37 ejaculates) with respective field trials. Although the addition of Oxyfree® brought an increase of the motility and speed values of the sperms after thawing, no improvement at the NRR 90 could be observed. The fourth section aimed to find possible relationships between sperm quality parameters and the fertility of the bulls quantified by NRR and to consider a suitable combination and weighting of these parameters which allow a forecast of the NRR. From the parameters of the fresh semen only one parameter showed a relation to NRR. Regarding the parameters of the frozen sperm after thawing, ten parameters of the CASA-system and one parameter, which describes “the oxidative stress” showed a correlation to NRR. A forecast level of the NRR of 93 % was achieved by combination and weighting of 14 parameters...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{the amount of}} dilution applied can be extended while maintaining normal engine operation in a GDI engine. Adding exhaust gases or air to a stoichiometric air/fuel mixture yields several advantages regarding fuel consumption and engine out emissions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to reduce fuel consumption by means of diluted combustion, an advanced ignition system and adjusted valve timing. Tests were performed on a Volvo four-cylinder engine equipped with a dual coil ignition system. This system made it possible to extend the ignition duration and current. Furthermore, a sweep was performed in valve timing and type of dilution, i. e., air or exhaust gases. While maintaining a CoV in IMEP x. Using air as a <b>diluter</b> resulted in a 6 % fuel consumption benefit over exhaust gas dilution, mainly due to the enhanced combustion efficiency arising from higher oxygen concentrations. However, the lower oxygen concentration when using exhaust gases as a <b>diluter</b> led to 50 % lower engine out NO x levels at the dilution limit...|$|E
40|$|Post thawed {{frozen semen}} {{viability}} {{is one of}} the most important keys in artificial inseminationdepended on two major cell death mechanism, apoptosis and necrosis. It has been known that good fertilitydiary bull’s seminal plasma contains high concentration of osteopontin (OPN). Osteopontin also known ascell survival protein via inhibition to apoptotic cell death, and B-cell CLL/Lymphoma- 2 (Bcl- 2) expressionmostly related to the ability of cell survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence ofadditional OPN into frozen semen <b>diluter</b> on post thawed sperm Bcl- 2 expression. Fresh semen collectedfrom ± 4 year Friesian Holstein bull. Treatment group divided into four groups i. e. : control group (P 0 :without OPN supplementation), (P 1 : fresh semen with OPN supplementation 5 ?g/ 5. 107 spermatozoa), (P 2 :fresh semen with OPN supplementation 10 ?g/ 5. 107 spermatozoa), (P 3 : fresh semen with OPNsupplementation 20 ?g/ 5. 107 spermatozoa). Bcl- 2 sperm expression was determined usingimunocytochemistry. The result of this study showed that there was no significant difference betweengroup P 0 and P 1 (p> 0, 05), but both group P 2 and group P 3 showed a significant difference with P 0 (p 0, 05).

30|$|Influences of {{temperature}} and Sn-Cu droplet’s composition on reactive wettings of Cu(100), Cu(110), and Cu(111) surfaces were analyzed, by using molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. As a result, the spreading on Cu(110)(Cu(100)) has the fastest (slowest) wetting kinetics. A higher temperature or a <b>diluter</b> Cu {{content in the}} Sn-Cu alloy droplet results in a higher wettability. Moreover, this work has addressed a theory for positioning the interface separating the liquidus and solidus alloys in the spreading film to confirm {{the hypothesis that the}} reactive wetting will come to the end when the interface saturates with the temperature-dependent solidus weight fraction of Cu.|$|E
40|$|A solid {{particle}} number limit {{was applied to}} the European legislation for diesel vehicles in 2011. Extension to gasoline direct injection vehicles raised concerns because many studies found particles below the lower size limit of the method (23 nm). Here we investigated experimentally the feasibility of lowering this size. A nano condensation nucleus counter system (nCNC) (d 50 % = 1. 3 nm) was used in parallel with condensation particle counters (CPCs) (d 50 % = 3 nm, 10 nm and 23 nm) at various sampling systems based on ejector or rotating disk <b>diluters</b> and having thermal pre-treatment systems consisting of evaporation tubes or catalytic strippers. An engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS) measured the particle size distributions. Depending on the losses and thermal pre-treatment of the sampling system, differences of up to 150 % could be seen on the final detected particle concentrations when including the particles smaller than 23 nm in diameter. A volatile artefact as particles with diameters below 10 nm was at times observed during the cold start measurements of a 2 -stroke moped. The diesel vehicles equipped with the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) had a low solid sub- 23 nm particles fraction (< 20 %), the gasoline with direct injection vehicles had higher (35 – 50 %), the gasoline vehicles with port fuel injection and the two mopeds (two and four-stroke) had the majority of particles below 23 nm. The size distributions peaked at 60 – 80 nm for the DPF equipped vehicles, at 40 – 90 nm for the gasoline vehicles with a separate nucleation mode peak at approximately 10 nm sometimes. Mopeds peaked at sizes below 50 nm when their aerosol was thermally pre-treated. JRC. C. 4 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R

The semen of 18 boars was diluted with all extenders at the same time. The samples of diluted semen- dilution rate 1 + 4 and I + 8, were stored at a temperature 16 ± 1 °C for 7 days after the semen collection. A thermo- resistance test was performed on 4 ml samples kept at 37 ± 1 °C in water bath each day ofthe storage and microscopic evaluation ofthe spermatozoa survival rate was performed at the Ist, 3 rd and 5 th hours during incubation. The survival rate decreased parallelly with the storage length. Besides the extender Androhep and BTS we ascertained significant differences in the sperm survival rate aecording to the dilution rate. The extenders Androhep and BTS appear to be successful media for a higher boar sperm dilution rate. Further to this, the extra cellular sperm aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) activity was evaluated on the 3 rd and 7 th. day of storage. The AAT activity was measured reagent Set for determination of catalytic concentration of AAT in serum- produced by Lachema Brno. The correlation between sperm survival rate and the AAT activity was greater at a higher proportion of <b>diluters</b> used. The differences in the values among the tested extenders were on Statistical significant levels (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 01) when the survival rate of boar sperm and AAT activity were tested. In this experiment the best sperm survival rate ofthe boar spermatozoa was detected in Androhep extender (P< 0, 05 and P< 0, 0 l) ...|$|R
40|$|Pigs are {{frequently}} facing environmental perturbations with subsequent {{short and long-term}} effects on their health and performance. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the consequences of an acute dietary challenge on growth performance and feeding behavior in finishing pigs. A total of 160 pigs (average initial BW of 69. 1 kg, 115 d of age) were used in two successive replicates of 80 animals with 4 treatments. In the control group (CC), pigs were fed a standard diet (7. 6 g digestible Lys/kg and 9. 6 MJ NE/kg) during the whole experimental period (55 days). The DC, CD, and DD groups were challenged with a ‘diluted’ diet for a 7 -d period at 130 d, at 153 d, and at 130 and 153 d of age, respectively. Digestible Lys and NE contents were reduced by 20 % in the diluted diet in comparison to the control diet, using wheat bran and sunflower meal as <b>diluters.</b> In both diets, essential amino acids were kept constant relative to Lys. Within each replicate, all pigs were equipped with a RFID ear-tag and housed in a same room. The room consisted of a resting area and 2 feeding areas separated by a weighing-sorting station, which allowed for continuous measurements of individual BW. The 2 feeding areas were equipped with 4 feeding stations each. These electronic feeder systems automatically distributed the chosen diet to each pig and recorded the visits to the feeder, with their time and the amount of feed consumed. The average daily BW gain and the BW at slaughter were significantly reduced in the CD and DD groups when compared to the CC group (1, 052 g/d and 125. 5 kg on average vs 1, 119 g/d and 129. 5 kg, respectively; P 0. 05) by treatments. Carcass traits were similar in the 4 experimental groups. This study demonstrates an age-of-exposure effect of a dietary challenge on growth performance in finishing pigs.
