40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a class of}} two-parameter discrete dispersion models, obtained by combining convolution with a factorial tilting operation, similar to exponential dispersion models which combine convolution and exponential tilting. The equidispersed Poisson model has {{a special place in}} this approach, whereas several overdispersed discrete distributions, such as the Neyman Type A, Pólya-Aeppli, negative binomial and Poisson-inverse Gaussian, turn out to be Poisson-Tweedie factorial dispersion models with power dispersion functions, analogous to ordinary Tweedie exponential dispersion models with power variance functions. Using the <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulant</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> as tool, we {{introduce a}} dilation operation as a discrete analogue of scaling, generalizing binomial thinning. The Poisson-Tweedie factorial dispersion models are closed under dilation, which in turn leads to a Poisson-Tweedie asymptotic framework where Poisson-Tweedie models appear as dilation limits. This unifies many discrete convergence results and leads to Poisson and Hermite convergence results, similar to the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, respectively. The dilation operator also leads to a duality transformation which in some cases transforms overdispersion into underdispersion and vice-versa. Many of the results have multivariate analogues, and in particular we consider a class of multivariate Poisson-Tweedie models, a multivariate notion of over- and underdispersion, and a multivariate zero-inflation index.

40|$|In great generality, {{the basic}} {{steady-state}} distributions in the BMAP/G/ 1 queue have asymptotically exponential tails. Here we develop asymptotic expansions for the asymptotic decay rates of these tail probabilities in powers of one minus the traffic intensity. The first term {{coincides with the}} decay rate of the exponential distribution arising in the standard heavy-traffic limit. The coefficients of these heavy-traffic expansions depend on the moments of the service-time distribution and the derivatives of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue d(z) of the BMAP matrix generating function D(z) at z = 1. We give recursive formulas for the derivatives d (k) (1). The asymptotic expansions {{provide the basis for}} efficiently computing the asymptotic decay rates as functions of the traffic intensity, i. e., the caudal characteristic curves. The asymptotic expansions also reveal what features of the model the asymptotic decay rates primarily depend upon. In particular, d(z) coincides with the limiting time-average of the <b>factorial</b> <b>cumulant</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> (the logarithm of the generating function) of the arrival counting process, and the derivatives d (k) (1) coincide with the asymptotic factorial cumulants of the arrival counting process. This insight is important for admission control schemes in multi-service networks based in part on asymptotic decay rates. The interpretation helps identify appropriate statistics to compute from network traffic data in order to predict performance. 1...|$|E
