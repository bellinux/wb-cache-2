40|$|Formulations of alginate-encapsulated mycelia {{are used}} to {{generate}} spores for mycoherhicidal application to weed-infested fields and for bulk production of spore-based products. Spore yield of such formulations is a primary determinant of product efficacy. A number of parameters of the alginate process were studied to develop an optimal alginate formulation for field appli-cation of Alternaria cassiae, a mycoherbicide for sickle-pod (Cassia obtusifolia). The composition of the fermen-tation medium and of the filler used in formulation and the fermentation time were important variables. The addition of nutrients to the mycelial homogenate after fermentation increased sporulation but the amount and ratio of nutrients in the fermentation medium had a greater influence on spore yield from pellets. Optimal sporulation resulted from mycelia produced during a 60 - to 70 -h fermentation in 2. 4 % <b>dehydrated</b> <b>potato</b> dextrose broth and 14 % V-S vegetable juice and en-trapped in pellets containing corn cob grits as the filler.

40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of mashed <b>potatoes</b> made from <b>dehydrated</b> <b>potato</b> flakes was studied using helical ribbon geometry, which enabled {{changes in the}} dynamic mechanical properties, {{as a function of}} ingredients concentration, to be followed. Mashed potatoes were also frozen {{in order to determine the}} changes that occurred in the cell structure. Response surface analysis was used to establish the empirical models for expressing the effects of significant ingredients on rheological properties. Results showed that both dynamic moduli (G′, and G>) were significantly influenced by potato flake concentration (α < 0. 01) and the butter concentration (α < 0. 05 for G′ and a < 0. 10 for G″), while the salt concentration had a significant quadratic effect (α< 0. 05) on the storage modulus (G′). Significant interactions occurred between potato flakes and milk concentrations, and potato flakes and salt concentrations, and these were detected by the dynamic moduli. Breakdown of the cell wall by freezing decreased G′,G″ and η* values, showing that the frozen/thawed mashed potatoes consisted of dilute dispersions of swollen and disrupted intracellular starch granules. © Springer-Verlag 1999.
