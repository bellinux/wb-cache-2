5|$|From 1941, forward, the Leibstandarte became four {{distinct}} entities, the Waffen-SS division (unconnected to Hitler's {{personal protection}} but a {{formation of the}} Waffen-SS), the Berlin Chancellory Guard, the SS security regiment assigned to the Obersalzberg, and a Munich-based bodyguard unit which protected Hitler when he visited his personal apartment and the Brown House NSDAP headquarters in Munich. Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled <b>day-to-day</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{respected}} the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial governors, and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign. Although the queen did not interfere in <b>day-to-day</b> <b>administration,</b> she probably {{had the power}} to command the governors in the organization of border security. During the rebellion, Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration, but appointed the governors herself (most notably in Egypt, where Julius Marcellinus took office in 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).|$|E
5|$|The Committee {{hoped to}} avoid the Germans {{becoming}} involved in the <b>day-to-day</b> <b>administration</b> of the territory as they had during World War I, while also allowing Belgium to maintain a degree of national autonomy and independence. The Committee also hoped {{to be able to}} prevent the implementation of more radical German policies, like forced labor and deportation. The legal basis of the Committee was a law of 7 September 1939, through which in times of crisis, a Secretary-General could exert full control over his own department, but without having the full status of being a minister.|$|E

5|$|Grand Duchess Marguerite Louise and Dowager Grand Duchess Vittoria vied {{with each}} other for power. The Dowager, after a {{protracted}} battle, triumphed: The Grand Duke assigned his mother the <b>day-to-day</b> <b>administration</b> of the state. Cosimo III commenced his reign with the utmost fervour, attempting to salvage the sinking exchequer and allowing his subjects to petition him for arbitration in disputes. The novelty soon wore off, however. Vittoria, Cosimo having lost his taste for administration, was further empowered by admission to the Grand Duke's Consulta (Privy Council). Marguerite Louise, deprived of any political influence, went about arranging Prince Ferdinando's education and aruing with Vittoria over precedence, which only further encamped Cosimo on his mother's side. In the midst of this, on the first anniversary of Ferdinando II's death, Gian Gastone was born to the grand ducal couple.|$|E
5|$|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ("Life Guards SS Adolf Hitler"; LSSAH) was {{an elite}} SS {{protection}} unit founded in 1933 as a palace guard to provide protection for Hitler's residences and offices. The LSSAH {{had some of}} the strictest entry requirements. The commander, Sepp Dietrich insisted that the men be in good physical condition, between the ages of 23 to 35, and have a confirmed ancestry record without Jewish lineage. The LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division of the Waffen-SS. Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled <b>day-to-day</b> <b>administration.</b> By 1945, while the LSSAH fought on the Eastern Front during World War II, a core group of 800 men stayed in Berlin and made up the Leibstandarte Guard Battalion (Wache Reichskanzlei), assigned to guard the Führer.|$|E
5|$|During the Becket controversy, {{which began}} in October 1163, de Broc {{supported}} King Henry II of England and was appointed to oversee the lands and income of the see of Canterbury while Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was in exile after fleeing England in October 1164. The estates were given into de Broc's custody at Christmas 1164, although the grant was back-dated to Michaelmas (29 September) 1164. De Broc was to pay the king 1562 pounds 5 shillings and 5.5 pence annually from the revenues of the estate. Ranulf entrusted the <b>day-to-day</b> <b>administration</b> of Canterbury to his kinsman Robert de Broc. The de Brocs continued to administer the estates until Michaelmas 1170. Soon after de Broc took up the administration of Canterbury, Becket accused de Broc of despoiling the Canterbury estates. Historians are not clear on whether Becket's charges were just propaganda or if the estates were actually damaged. De Broc managed to secure the support {{of some of the}} monks of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury, as some monks were willing to inform de Broc of any proceedings of the chapter that were favourable to Becket.|$|E
5|$|After the Belgian {{surrender}} on 28 May 1940, the Germans {{formed a}} Militärverwaltung (Military Administration) in the country; commanded by the German aristocrat and career soldier, General Alexander von Falkenhausen. A {{section of the}} administration called the Militärverwaltungsstab (Military Administrative Staff), commanded by SS-Gruppenführer Eggert Reeder, was reponsable for the <b>day-to-day</b> civil <b>administration</b> of the territory. The Militärverwaltungsstab would present its demands to the Secretaries-General, even though the Committee was separate, {{in order to have}} them carried out.|$|R

[...] He also added that the majority's decision regarding the contempt charge undercut the authority of [...] "already beleaguered district judges" [...] who must see to <b>day-to-day</b> trial <b>administration,</b> and who [...] "do not live in the sterile and sometimes unrealistic environment of the appellate ivory tower." ...|$|R

5|$|Since 1990, the Tower of London {{has been}} {{cared for by}} an {{independent}} charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In 1988, the Tower of London {{was added to the}} UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations' Heritage in Danger List. The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006. Visitors can explore the chambers restored to their former glory, once used by past kings and queens. Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, the responsibility of <b>day-to-day</b> <b>administration</b> is delegated to the Resident Governor. At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance with the belief that if they are absent, the kingdom will fall. They are under the care of the Yeomen Warders. The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture from 1883. As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower. Just over 2.7 million people visited the Tower of London in 2016.|$|E

30|$|More specifically, {{the roles}} and {{responsibilities}} of CHROs {{can be described in}} four major categories (Deloitte Consulting 2006). As workforce strategists, CHROs {{play a key role in}} steering the direction of a business strategy that coincides with the current labor trends and available workforce. This is becoming more important, as “business strategy is increasingly a function of the workforce itself” (Deloitte Consulting 2006, p. 7). As organizational performance conductors, CHROs help implement the organizational structures that promote innovation and collaboration as well as flexible work practices that produce inspiring work. As HR service delivery owners, CHROs deliver the goods of <b>day-to-day</b> HR <b>administration.</b> Finally, as compliance and governance regulators, CHROs ensure that all activities adhere to local, national, and international laws and regulations in a business world that is affected by globalization and offshoring, and provide board development and executive succession planning.|$|R

5000|$|Indirect rule is {{a system}} of {{government}} used by the British and French to control parts of their colonial empires, particularly in Africa and Asia, through pre-existing local power structures. These dependencies were often called [...] "protectorates" [...] or [...] "trucial states". By this system, the <b>day-to-day</b> government and <b>administration</b> of areas both small and large {{was left in the}} hands of traditional rulers, who gained prestige and the stability and protection afforded by the Pax Britannica, at the cost of losing control of their external affairs, and often of taxation, communications, and other matters, usually with a small number of European [...] "advisors" [...] effectively overseeing the government of large numbers of people spread over extensive areas.|$|R

50|$|Mir Sohrab Khan Talpur had {{established}} control over Upper Sind by 1783. He established his capital at Burahan, which he renamed Khairpur in 1786 and extended his territories over a vast area, eventually helping his kinsmen from Hyderabad to expel the Afghans from the province by 1823. As early as 1811, he divided his territories into three emirates, each ruled {{by one of}} his sons, but with his eldest invested as principal amir. To them he left the <b>day-to-day</b> affairs of <b>administration</b> and retired to the Fort of Ahmedabad, in Diji. There, he took a new wife and raised a family, to whom he intended to bequeath a portion of his realm. This incurred the jealousy of his adult grandsons, especially those of his second son, Mubarak 'Ali.|$|R
