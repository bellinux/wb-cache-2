500|$|The {{gift for}} vivid characterisation, which Mitford {{developed}} in her fiction, {{was used to}} full effect in her four biographical works. In the first of these, Madame de Pompadour, she followed Waugh's advice not to write for experts but to fashion [...] "a popular life like Strachey's Queen Victoria", with [...] "plenty of period prettiness". This remained her yardstick in her subsequent biographical writings. Her own description of Voltaire in Love is [...] "a Kinsey report of his romps with Mme de Châtelet and her romps with Saint-Lambert and his romps with Mme de Boufflers... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> for pages". Acton thought The Sun King the most entertaining introduction to the subject in the English language. Mitford's informal style was remarked on by the literary critic Cyril Connolly, who wrote that her facility for transforming unpromising source material into readable form was a skill that any professional historian might envy. The historian Antonia Fraser considered Mitford an important contributor to the [...] "remorseless process by which historical and biographical sales have soared since 1950".|$|E

The influence of death metal on the album is clear, and on the subject Jordison stated; [...] "the roots are death metal, thrash, speed metal, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> and on about all those bands." [...] The album also shows influences from alternative metal and even rap metal. Critics have also noted an industrial influence. polarimagazine.com |last=Beck |first=Walter |date=January 17, 2013 |website=Polari Magazine |accessdate=July 4, 2013}} Due to the band's large line-up consisting of additional percussionists and electronics, the album has a very dense, layered sound. Alternative Press stated that the album used [...] "inventive sampling, creative guitar work and an absolute percussive overload", while Q magazine described the album as [...] "a terrifying racket". Slipknot also includes melody, most notably in the single [...] "Wait and Bleed".|$|E
500|$|By May, Perot {{was leading}} presidential polls in both Texas and California. The Bush and Clinton campaigns became {{concerned}} about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to [...] "play by his own rules". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his [...] "folk hero status" [...] {{to that of a}} politician, by highlighting his [...] "alleged character flaws". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired John P. White, who served as a budget official under President Jimmy Carter, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media that Perot would split the electoral college and force the United States House of Representatives to decide the presidency. Around this time, Hal Riney, who had worked on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign and was known for the [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly [...] "flipped out", and asked [...] "Why would I spend that when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the 'Today' show for free?" [...] Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired.|$|E

500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about {{it so many times}} yesterday that they got quite fed up, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> telling it masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E

[...] I have cause to think about Erving Goffman nearly {{every day of my}} life, every time I see people do something unconscious that reveals more than they’ll ever know about their interiors. [...] Aren’t human beings intriguing? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> writing about them forever.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In some of {{his other}} roles during the 1960s and 1970s, Bogarde played {{opposite}} renowned stars, yet several of the films were of uneven quality, due to demands or limitations set by the studio or their scripts: The Angel Wore Red (1960), playing an unfrocked priest {{who falls in love}} with cabaret entertainer Ava Gardner during the Spanish Civil War; Song Without End (1960), as Hungarian composer and virtuoso pianist Franz Liszt, a flawed film made under the initial direction of Charles Vidor (who died during shooting), and completed by Bogarde's friend George Cukor, the actor's only disappointing foray into Hollywood; the campy The Singer Not the Song (1961), as a Mexican bandit co-starring John Mills as a priest; H.M.S.

(1962), playing sadistic Lieutenant Scott-Padget, co-starring Sir Alec Guinness; <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Go</b> <b>On</b> Singing (1963), co-starring Judy Garland in her final screen role; Hot Enough for June, (a.k.a.
