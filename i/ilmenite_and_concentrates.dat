The obtained samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD results indicate that K(4) Ti(3) O(8) have been synthesized in different atmospheres. The oxidizing atmosphere could enhance the conversion rate of Ti from ilmenite to K(4) Ti(3) O(8), and Fe(II) is easily oxidized to trivalent iron Fe(III) during the reaction. Furthermore, SEM images show that the different atmospheres have significant effect on K(4) Ti(3) O(8) crystal morphology and particle size.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to {{establish}} the rate and mechanisms of solid stage reduction of titania <b>and</b> <b>ilmenite</b> ores. The project examined carbothermal reduction of titania and various types of ilmenite ores in argon, helium, hydrogen, and their mixtures. Effect of CO in the gas atmosphere on reduction behavior of titania <b>and</b> primary <b>ilmenite</b> ore was also studied. Isothermal and non-isothermal reduction experiments were conducted in a fixed bed reactor in the high temperature furnace in the temperature range up to 1500 oC. The off-gas composition in the reduction process was monitored by a CO/CO 2 /CH 4 infrared analyser. The extent of reduction was calculated using data on gas composition and LECO oxygen analysis. Phase composition and morphology of reduced samples were studied using XRD, SEM and optical microscopy. The major findings of this project are as follows: &# 149; The reduction of titania to titanium oxycarbide occurred in the following sequence: TiO 2 &# 8594; Ti 5 O 9 &# 8594; Ti 4 O 7 &# 8594; Ti 3 O 5 &# 8594; Ti 2 O 3 &# 8594; (TiO-TiC) solid solution. &# 149; Carbothermal reduction of ilmenite concentrates proceeded in two main stages. In the first stage pseudorutile <b>and</b> <b>ilmenite</b> were reduced to metallic iron and titania. Second stage involved the reduction of titania to titanium oxycarbide. &# 149; Rate and degree of reduction of titania <b>and</b> <b>ilmenite</b> <b>concentrates</b> increased with increasing temperature. &# 149; Reduction rate of titania <b>and</b> <b>ilmenite</b> <b>concentrates</b> was faster in hydrogen than in helium and argon. The difference in the reduction behavior in helium and argon was insignificant; reduction rate of ilmenite was slightly faster in helium than in argon. &# 149; High rate of reduction of titania <b>and</b> <b>ilmenite</b> in hydrogen was attributed to formation of methane which facilitated mass transfer of carbon from graphite to oxide. Hydrogen was also directly involved in reduction of titania <b>and</b> <b>ilmenite</b> concentrates; hydrogen reduced pseudorutile to iron and titania. Titania was further reduced to titanium oxycarbide by carbon through methane. &# 149; Increased gas flow rate slightly improved the reduction rate in hydrogen and suppressed the reduction in inert gases. &# 149; Addition of CO to hydrogen and inert gases above 3 vol% suppressed the reduction process...|$|R

The work includes both systematic thermodynamic assessment and targeted experimental investigations. Thermodynamic calculation results studying the effect of reactants composition, temperature and different sulphur sources (H 2 S and elemental S) showed that chromite can be selectively sulphidised at a controlled atmosphere of partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2) below 10 &# 8722; 10 atm and partial pressure of sulphur (pS 2) above 10 &# 8722; 6 atm. The addition of carbon with sulphur was found to be useful for the chromite sulphidation reaction.

Sulphidation experiments on a mixture of natural <b>ilmenite</b> <b>and</b> chromite at 1100 &# 0176;C for 5 h using 5 %H 2 S as a sulphur source showed that the ilmenite was preferentially sulphidised first, which was also in a good agreement with the thermodynamic assessment.
