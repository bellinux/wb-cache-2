The Solar Decathlon 2011 {{was held in}} Washington, D. C., from September 23 to October 2, 2011. A high-penetration microgrid was designed, installed, and operated for the Solar Decathlon 2011 to grid-connect 19 highly energy-efficient, solar-powered competition houses to a single utility connection point. The capacity penetration of this microgrid (defined as maximum PV generation divided by maximum system load over a two-week period) was 74 % based on 1 -minute averaged data. Temporary, ground-laid conductors and electrical distribution equipment were installed to grid-connect the Solar Decathlon village, which included the houses {{as well as other}} electrical loads used by the event organizers. While 16 of the houses were connected to the 60 Hz microgrid, three houses from Belgium, China, and New Zealand were supplied with 50 Hz power. The design of the microgrid, including the connection of the houses powered by 50 Hz and a standby diesel generator, is discussed in this paper. In addition to the utility-supplied net energy meters at each house, a microgrid monitoring system was installed to measure and record energy consumption and PV energy production at 1 -second intervals at each house. Bidirectional <b>electronic</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> were installed for groups of competition houses, which held the service voltage at each house to acceptable levels.

40|$|Supplying {{regulated}} voltage to critical loads {{is an important}} topic for several years. This paper presents a single-phase <b>electronic</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> based on high frequency switching of an isolated transformer where primary side voltage is controlled by two full-bridge converters sharing a common DC bus and operating at 50 Hz and 20 kHz switching frequencies. This allows 50 Hz induced voltage on the primary side of the transformer, regulated by high frequency switching. Depending on the input voltage, voltage at the secondary side of the transformer add to (boost mode) or subtract (buck mode) from the supply voltage, therefore, maintaining a {{regulated voltage}} value across the load. The regulator is controlled by a digital controller allowing fast dynamic response. A 5 kVA single-phase voltage regulator is realized to verify {{the operation of the}} proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that regulator maintains constant voltage across the load both in step-up (low supply voltage) and step-down (high supply voltage) modes...|$|E

40|$|An {{ultra-low}} area, current efficient <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> {{appropriate for}} distributed point-of-load voltage regulation in high performance integrated circuits (ICs) {{is described in}} this paper. The proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> is a hybrid combination of a switching <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> and a linear <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator.</b> The <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> can supply over 100 mA current while generating 0. 9 volts from a 1. 2 input voltage. The current efficiency exceeds 99 % while the load regulation to a step current ranges between 40 ns and 60 ns. No output capacitor is required to ensure stability. Hence, the required on-chip area is as small as 0. 026 mm 2 for the proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> which is approximately four to six times smaller than area efficient low dropout regulators.

Moreover, it had to enable automatic measurement and data collection, {{as well as the}} detection of any considerable degradation, well before the monitored <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator's</b> malfunction. The principal parameters of the <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator's</b> operation that were monitored were the serial pnp transistor's base current and the forward emitter current gain.
