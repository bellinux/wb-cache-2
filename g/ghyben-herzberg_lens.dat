2500|$|Diego Garcia is the above-water rim of a coral atoll {{composed}} of Holocene coral rubble and sand to {{the depth of}} about , overlaying Pleistocene limestone deposited at the then-sea level {{on top of a}} seamount rising about [...] from the floor of the Indian Ocean. The Holocene sediments are porous and completely saturated with sea water. Any rain falling on the above-water rim quickly percolates through the surface sand and encounters the salt water underneath. Diego Garcia is of sufficient width to minimise tidal fluctuations in the aquifer, and the rainfall (in excess of 102.5inches/260cm per year on average) is sufficient in amount and periodicity for the fresh water to form a series of convex, freshwater, <b>Ghyben-Herzberg</b> <b>lenses</b> floating on the heavier salt water in the saturated sediments.|$|R
40|$|About {{a hundred}} years ago, Alexander Agassiz, after making a fortune from Michigan copper and {{becoming}} the world authority on sea urchins [Revision of the Echini (1873) ],undertook to investigate coral reefs and limestone islands. Agassiz 2 ̆ 7 s coral reef expeditions, which he financed largely himself, lasted about a decade (1893 - 1902) {{and took him to}} the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Florida Keys, the Great Barrier Reef, the Fijis, Tongatapu, the Society islands, the Cook islands, the Carolines, the Marshalls, Guam, and Niue to name only carbonate islands that are examined in this book. Intellectually, the driving force behind those studies was Darwin 2 ̆ 7 s theory of coral reefs [Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs (1842) ]. Now, studies of carbonate island geology are energized by concepts and data of plate tectonics; deep-sea and on-island drilling; isotope geochemistry and geochronology; facies models and diagenetic pathways; sea-level curves and Milankovitch cycles. At roughly the same time, W. Badon Ghyben in the Netherlands (1888) and A. Herzberg in Germany (1901) independently published analyses of the hydrostatics whereby fresh groundwater floats on ocean-derived saline groundwater in coastal settings. Now, in addition to the Ghyben-Herzberg principle and <b>Ghyben-Herzberg</b> <b>lenses</b> of island settings, we have brackish-water mixing zones, dual-aquifer conceptualizations, hydrologic budgets, and variable density flow and transport modeling. We now know of the temperature-driven flow of Kohout convection and endoupwelling at greater depths, beneath the meteoric realm. There have been feedback studies relating the rocks to the flows, and the flows to the rocks, and these studies shed light on old questions such as dolomitization. According to one of our chapters, the deep flows explain Darwin 2 ̆ 7 s paradox - how the oligotrophic reefs of carbonate islands can exist in the first place, in such vast nutrient deserts. The purpose of this book is to sample the geological and hydrogeological knowledge of particular islands now, some hundred years after Agassiz and Ghyben and Herzberg...|$|R
40|$|Ground water springs {{near the}} {{shoreline}} discharge {{a large portion}} of the <b>Ghyben-Herzberg</b> fresh water <b>lens</b> in the Hawaiian Islands. Conventional methods are applicable to measurement of rainfall, evaporation and runoff, but the irregular distribution and size of holes in the volcanic rock through which most Hawaiian water flows make accurate ground water flow measurements difficult. More precise information on the rates of ground water losses through coastal spring discharge are important to the understanding and planning for future Hawaiian water supply. A variety of reliable and economical methods of utilizing infrared radiation and reflection are being successfully applied to the study of rocks, plants, sea water and other material. Specifically, infrared radiation has been shown to be an effective indicator of fresh and sea water temperatures. A joint federal and state project funded for the year 1966 - 67 through the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Hawaii in part will investigate the applicability of various sensors to the measurement of thermal contrast in and around coastal ground water springs wasting into the sea. Studies will include the examination of infrared radiation spectra at various wave lenghts by films and thermistor instrumentation. Surface and underwater temperatures will be compared with radiometer measurements to determine the accuracy and water penetration of radiation sensors.

40|$|The Maltese Islands are {{composed}} of Oligocene and Miocene coralline limestones which contain two aquifers, separated by the more poorly-permeable Globigerina Limestone. The lower ‘sea level’ aquifer exhibits a classic <b>Ghyben-Herzberg</b> <b>lens</b> which has been modified by heavy groundwater abstraction from sea-level pumping station galleries. Malta is dependent on groundwater for both public supply and irrigation as there is limited surface water. Water levels and spring flows in the upper ‘perched’ aquifer and {{in some areas of}} the lower aquifer respond quickly to rainfall and together with some visible karstic features has lead to the assumption that this is a predominantly rapid-flow system. However, tritium studies reported in 2003 by Bakalovich and Mangion and our recent residence time studies show that the bulk of water in the saturated zone moves slowly with a travel time of decades. This is in agreement with the estimated water balance which indicates that annual replenishment is low compared to the estimated storage. Microbiological work suggests that there are limited rapid pathways through the unsaturated zone and water movement must be primarily through the matrix. Where the unsaturated zone is thick the travel time may also be decades. This new model has profound implications for aquifer management, particularly with respect to the obligations of the Water Framework Directive...|$|E
40|$|Injection of wastes {{into the}} Hawaiian {{subsurface}} environment presents unique problems because the waste effluents normally are {{injected into the}} salt or brackish water underlying the fresh <b>Ghyben-Herzberg</b> <b>lens.</b> Because the waste water commonly has approximately the same density as fresh water, in addition to any ambient groundwater flow effects, a buoyant uplift is produced which causes the injected waste to move upward and outward from the injection point as a buoyant plume. A laboratory sand-packed hydraulic model was used to study the mechanics of buoyant plume movement, and the entrainment of salt water by the plume. Simulated waste effluent was injected into a density-stratified aquifer system under static groundwater conditions, and the effects on plume mechanics of varying several different injection parameters, such as injection depth, injection rate, type of injection source, density of receiving water, etc., were observed. The laboratory studies indicated that although several of the injection parameters (most notably depth of the injection {{with respect to the}} saltfresh interface) {{have an effect on the}} details of the injection process and the plume movement and configuration, none of the injection parameters exerts a truly significant control on the ultimate fate of the injected plume. That is, for the conditions stipulated in this study, the injection plumes always migrated well up into the freshwater lens, regardless of variations in any of the several injection parameters. Furthermore, these experiments showed little evidence of entrainment of the surrounding salt water into the injected buoyant plumes, which strongly suggests that the principal means of plume movement is by mass displacement rather than by mixing processes.

40|$|In 1966, the Water Resources Research Center {{initiated}} a {{comprehensive study of}} electric well-logging and other geophysical well-logging techniques in Hawaii. The primary objectives {{of this study were}} to determine what results could be obtained by the use of conventional electric and geophysical well-logging methods under Hawaiian conditions and to collect as much basic geologic, hydrologic, and geometric information as possible from wells in Hawaiian aquifers. The functions logged include spontaneous potential, point resistivity, short and normal resistivity, lateral resistivity, water temperature, water conductivity, and caliper. Resistivity logging in Hawaii produced much important qualitative information and some quantitative information. Resistivity logs from wells in basaltic aquifers indicate the location, number, thickness, and total thicknesses of permeable and less permeable formations and are extremely useful as indicators of water-yielding zones. High resistivities generally are indicative of dense impermeable basalts and low resistivities are indicative of porous permeable zones most likely to contribute water to the borehole. The logs also provide a direct measurement of depth to water, depth of casing, and depth of hole. Spontaneous potential logs sometimes are inconsistent and unreliable and are used primarily for correlation with other logs. Conductivity and temperature logs provide a direct quantitative measure of water conductivity and water temperature and provide considerable insight into the depth, thickness, quality, and temperature of waters contained in the wells of Hawaii. Borehole conductivity and temperature data also aid in the interpretation of the complex dynamic <b>Ghyben-Herzberg</b> <b>lens</b> relationships. The caliper module, which provides a measure of the well diameter, has been subject to frequent mechanical breakdown, however, recent alterations of the caliper module's design should allow the device to perform to its expected capability. Borehole photography employed recently by the Board of Water Supply provides positive identification of most Hawaiian rock types. Correlation between the photologs and electric logs is very good.

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed to explain the origin of marine isotope stage (MIS) 11 deposits in small Bermudian caves at + 21 m above modern sea level: (1) a + 21 m MIS 11 eustatic sea-level highstand, and (2) a MIS 11 mega-tsunami event. Importantly, the foraminifera reported in these caves {{have yet to be}} critically evaluated within a framework of coastal cave environments. After statistically comparing foraminifera in modern Bermudian littoral caves and the MIS 11 Calonectris Pocket A (+ 21 m cave) to the largest available database of Bermudian coastal foraminifera, the assemblages found in modern littoral caves – and Calonectris Pocket A – cannot be statistically differentiated from lagoons. This observation is expected considering littoral caves are simply sheltered extensions of a lagoon environment in the littoral zone, where typical coastal processes (waves, storms) homogenize and rework lagoonal, reefal, and occasional planktic taxa. Fossil protoconchs of the Bermudian cave stygobite Caecum caverna were also associated with the foraminifera. These results indicate that the MIS 11 Bermudian caves are fossil littoral caves (breached flank margin caves), where the total MIS 11 microfossil assemblage is preserving a signature of coeval sea level at + 21 m. Brackish foraminifera (Polysaccammina, Pseudothurammina) and anchialine gastropods (w 95 %, > 300 individuals) indicate a brackish anchialine habitat developed in the elevated caves after the prolonged littoral environmental phase. The onset of sea-level regression following the + 21 m highstand would first lower the ancient brackish <b>Ghyben-Herzberg</b> <b>lens</b> (< 0. 5 m) and flood the cave with brackish water, followed by drainage of the cave to create a permanent vadose environment. These interpretations of the MIS 11 microfossils (considering both taphonomy and paleoecology) are congruent with the micropaleontological, hydrogeological and physical mechanisms influencing modern Bermudian coastal cave environments. In conclusion, we reject the mega-tsunami hypothesis, concur with the + 21 m MIS 11 eustatic sea-level hypothesis, and reiterate the need to resolve the disparity between global marine isotopic records and the physical geologic evidence for sea level during MIS 11...|$|E

A laboratory sand-packed hydraulic model was used to study the mechanics of buoyant plume movement and the entrainment of salt water by the plume. Simulated waste effluent was injected into a density-stratified aquifer system under dynamic groundwater conditions, and the effects on plume mechanics of varying several different injection parameters, such as injection depth and rate, type of injection source, strength of the ambient flow field, and density of ambient perceiving water, were observed. In every experiment conducted during this study, a buoyant plume of injected effluent, which was clearly distinct from the president aquifer liquids, formed and rose vertically into the lower portion of the freshwater lens, where it was subjected to the freshwater flow field and migrated downgradient with the fresh water, still keeping its identity as a distinct plume of injected effluent. Three of the injection parameters exerted significant control on {{the movement of the}} injection plumes. The rate of effluent injection and the strength of the ambient freshwater flow field significantly influenced both the vertical and upgradient dimensions of the plumes, and also appeared to influence downgradient mixing of the plume with the ambient fresh water; and the depth of effluent injection, with respect to the relative density of the resident liquids, influenced the upgradient migration of the plumes. Although there was some initial evidence of salt water entrainment within the salt zone injection plumes, it was a transient phenomenon, and little evidence of salt water entrainment was observed once the plumes reached steady-state conditions. Downgradient dilution of the effluent plumes by the ambient fresh water was apparent, however, and increased with downgradient distance from the injection well. U. S.
