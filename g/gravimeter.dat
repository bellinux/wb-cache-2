50|$|Gravity is {{measured}} using <b>gravimeters.</b> Basically, {{there are two}} kinds of <b>gravimeters.</b> Absolute <b>gravimeters,</b> which nowadays can also be used in the field, are based directly on measuring the acceleration of free fall (for example, of a reflecting prism in a vacuum tube). They are used for establishing the vertical geospatial control. Most common relative <b>gravimeters</b> are spring based. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas for establishing the figure of the geoid over these areas. Most accurate relative <b>gravimeters</b> are superconducting <b>gravimeters,</b> and these are sensitive to one thousandth of one billionth of Earth surface gravity. Twenty-some superconducting <b>gravimeters</b> are used worldwide for studying Earth tides, rotation, interior, and ocean and atmospheric loading, as well as for verifying the Newtonian constant of gravitation.|$|R

Currently, about twenty five superconducting <b>gravimeters</b> are operating {{in the world and}} their global network has been developed. We investigate possible applications of the superconducting <b>gravimeters</b> to tests of gravitational physics.

25|$|The {{difference}} between clock pendulums and <b>gravimeter</b> pendulums {{is that to}} measure gravity, the pendulum's length {{as well as its}} period has to be measured. The period of freeswinging pendulums could be found to great precision by comparing their swing with a precision clock that had been adjusted to keep correct time by the passage of stars overhead. In the early measurements, a weight on a cord was suspended in front of the clock pendulum, and its length adjusted until the two pendulums swung in exact synchronism. Then the length of the cord was measured. From the length and the period, g could be calculated from equation (1).|$|E
500|$|Gravity and {{the nature}} of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local {{gravitational}} acceleration g, are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, g varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see Earth's gravity). There are also slight seasonal variations in g due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon. Although g would not be a term in the definition of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the delineation of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, g must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of g must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, g is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilized helium–neon laser interferometer. The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium atomic clock. Since this type of dropping-mass <b>gravimeter</b> derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the 'gravity' term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST's Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8ppb of [...]|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{gravimetric}} records obtained with tidal instruments, during the solar eclipse on August 11, 1999, when the shadow crossed Europe. Measurements recorded with spring and super-conducting <b>gravimeters</b> {{set up in}} Annelles, Uccle, Walferdange and Bondy are discussed. Comparisons between super-conducting <b>gravimeters</b> and spring <b>gravimeters</b> are made, in order to fix {{the limits of the}} magnitude of abnormal effects in relation to the possibility of a shielding effect by the Moon on the Sun’s gravitational attraction. The results from the LCR and Askania <b>gravimeters</b> will also be discussed in the paper. Our conclusions are that significant effects during an eclipse, if indeed they do exist, may be below the noise level of the <b>gravimeters</b> which is ± 1 nm/s (0. 1 µGal) for super-conducting <b>gravimeters.</b> Our findings confirm that in these situations both spring and super-conducting <b>gravimeters</b> are working at the limits of their precision, with a risk that abnormal environmental features induced by the eclipse could significantly modify the signals...|$|R

The majority of level sensing instruments are differential pressure sensing meters, which are invasive and could be the failure source in the pressure boundary of the primary coolant system. In this thesis, a new method for detecting the coolant inventory in {{nuclear reactors}} using superconducting <b>gravimeters</b> is investigated experimentally. A differential volume simulation from Information Systems Laboratories, Inc. is modified and used to predict the gravitational acceleration seen by the superconducting <b>gravimeters.</b> This model is then evaluated by comparing simulations to data taken at a scaled model of the NuScale, Inc. small modular reactor. The data is obtained using two iGrav™ superconducting <b>gravimeters</b> from GWR, Inc. to measure water inventory in the NIST- 1 facility at Oregon State University.

The concept of downwelling at trenches was characterized by Griggs in 1939 as the tectogene hypothesis, for which he {{developed a}}n analogue model using a pair of rotating drums. World War II in the Pacific led to great improvements of bathymetry, particularly in the western Pacific, and the linear nature of these deeps became clear. The rapid growth of deep sea research efforts, especially the widespread use of echosounders in the 1950s and 1960s confirmed the morphological utility of the term. Important trenches were identified, sampled, and their greatest depths sonically plumbed. [...] The early phase of trench exploration culminated in the 1960 descent of the Bathyscaphe Trieste, which set an unbeatable world record by diving {{to the bottom of the}} Challenger Deep. Following Robert S.

Specifically, to reduce the dependence of the relative spring <b>gravimeters</b> on vibrations such as those recorded during the explosive activity that produces lava fountains, some a priori and a posteriori techniques should be adopted to separate the gravity reading into an instrument-dependent signal (i.e., due to the mechanical perturbation of the sensor caused by seismic waves) and volcano-related components. For example, among the a priori techniques, a hardware damper system could be implemented as a support for the spring gravimeter; in this way, the high-frequency components in the three directions (x, y, and z) that can affect the <b>gravimeters</b> could largely be filtered out.
