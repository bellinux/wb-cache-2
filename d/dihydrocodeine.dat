5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} <b>dihydrocodeine</b> product, Paracodin, is an elixir of <b>dihydrocodeine</b> hydroiodide {{also available}} as a Tussionex-style suspension in many European countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dihydrocodeine</b> is {{also the}} {{original}} member and chemical base {{of a number of}} similar semi-synthetic opioids such as acetyldihydrocodeine, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> enol acetate, dihydroisocodeine, nicocodeine, and nicodicodeine.|$|E
25|$|Commonly {{available}} as tablets, solutions, elixirs, and other oral forms, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> {{is also available}} in some countries as an injectable solution for deep subcutaneous and intra-muscular administration. As with codeine, intravenous administration should be avoided, as it could result in anaphylaxis and life-threatening pulmonary edema. In the past, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> suppositories were used. <b>Dihydrocodeine</b> is available in suppository form on prescription.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{and other}} countries, 30mg tablets {{containing}} only <b>dihydrocodeine</b> as {{the active ingredient}} are available, also a 40mg <b>Dihydrocodeine</b> tablet {{is available in the}} UK as DF-118 Forte.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dihydrocodeine</b> can be presumptively {{detected}} by the Froehde reagent.|$|E
25|$|Injectable <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is {{most often}} given as a deep {{subcutaneous}} shot.|$|E
25|$|United Kingdom : In the United Kingdom, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is a Class B drug; but, it is {{available}} over-the-counter in small amounts (less than 8mg), when combined with paracetamol (see co-dydramol). <b>Dihydrocodeine</b> is listed in Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 whereby it is exempt from prohibition on possession provided {{that it is in}} the form of a single preparation not being designed for injection and less than 100mg (calculated as free base) or with a total concentration less than 2.5% (calculated as free base). Illegal possession of <b>dihydrocodeine</b> can result in up to 5 years in prison or an unlimited fine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dihydrocodeine</b> is {{the parent}} drug {{of a series}} of {{moderately}} strong narcotics including, among others, hydrocodone, nicocodeine, nicodicodeine, thebaine and acetyldihydrocodeine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dihydrocodeine</b> is {{sometimes}} marketed in combination preparations with paracetamol as co-dydramol (BAN) to provide greater pain relief than either agent used singly (see examples of synergy).|$|E
25|$|In late 2016 the TGA {{announced}} that from February 2018, all codeine and subsequently <b>dihydrocodeine</b> medicines currently being sold under Schedule 2 or 3 will become prescription only.|$|E
25|$|For {{use against}} pain, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is usually {{formulated}} as tablets or capsules containing 15–16mg or 30–32mg {{with or without}} other active ingredients such as aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, or others.|$|E
25|$|Hong Kong : In Hong Kong, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is {{regulated}} under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. It {{can only be}} used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. A pharmacist can dispense <b>Dihydrocodeine</b> when furnished with a doctors prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without a prescription can be fined $10000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption, without a licence from the Department of Health, is illegal and carries a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine or 7 years imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dihydrocodeine</b> is a semi-synthetic opioid {{analgesic}} prescribed for pain or severe dyspnea, {{or as an}} antitussive, either alone or compounded with paracetamol (as in co-dydramol) or aspirin. It was developed in Germany in 1908 and first marketed in 1911.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} opioids, {{tolerance}} and {{physical and psychological}} dependence develop with repeated <b>dihydrocodeine</b> use. All opioids can impair the mental or physical abilities required {{for the performance of}} potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery if taken in large doses.|$|E
25|$|Brand {{names for}} <b>dihydrocodeine</b> {{products}} include Drocode, Paracodeine and Parzone. Its many brand names include Rikodeine, Trezix, Synalgos DC, Panlor DC, Panlor SS, Contugesic, New Bron Solution-ACE, Huscode, Drocode, Paracodin, Codidol, Dehace, DHC Continus,Didor Continus, Dicogesic, Codhydrine, Dekacodin, DH-Codeine, Didrate, Dihydrin, Hydrocodin, Nadeine, Novicodin, Rapacodin, Fortuss, Paramol, Remedeine, Dico and DF-118.|$|E
25|$|The methyl {{group that}} makes {{morphine}} into codeine {{can be removed}} or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make codeine analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. Codeine analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in codeine and morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone, nicocodeine and nicomorphine, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> and dihydromorphine, etc.|$|E
25|$|Codeine {{is listed}} under the Betäubungsmittelgesetz in Germany and the {{similarly}} named narcotics and controlled substances law in Switzerland. In Austria, {{the drug is}} listed under the Suchtmittelgesetz in categories corresponding to their classification under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. Dispensing of products containing codeine and similar drugs (<b>dihydrocodeine,</b> nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, ethylmorphine etc.), in general, requires a prescription order from a doctor or {{the discretion of the}} pharmacist.|$|E
25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as <b>dihydrocodeine</b> (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of <b>dihydrocodeine,</b> poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E
25|$|The clandestine {{conversion}} of morphine to ketones of the hydromorphone class or other derivatives like dihydromorphine (Paramorfan), desomorphine (Permonid), metopon, etc. and codeine to hydrocodone (Dicodid), <b>dihydrocodeine</b> (Paracodin), etc. is more involved, time-consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and {{large amounts of}} morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so. Dihydromorphine can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin), and hydrocodone into thebacon.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} illicit {{morphine}} {{comes from the}} extraction of morphine from extended-release morphine products, such as MS-Contin. Morphine can be extracted from these products with simple extraction techniques to yield a morphine solution that can be injected. As an alternative, the tablets can be crushed and snorted, injected or swallowed, although this provides much less euphoria but retains some of the extended-release effect, and the extended-release property is why MS-Contin is used in some countries alongside methadone, <b>dihydrocodeine,</b> buprenorphine, dihydroetorphine, piritramide, levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM), and special 24-hour formulations of hydromorphone for maintenance and detoxification of those physically dependent on opioids.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{and human}} studies and {{clinical}} experience {{back up the}} contention that morphine {{is one of the}} most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Hydal), and oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents <b>dihydrocodeine,</b> hydrocodone, and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like nicomorphine and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like desomorphine, hydromorphinol, etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{the most}} {{abundant}} opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted by shallowly scoring the unripe seedpods of the Papaver somniferum poppy. Morphine is generally 8–14% of the dry weight of opium, although specially bred cultivars reach 26% or produce little morphine at all (under 1%, perhaps down to 0.04%). The latter varieties, including the 'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two other alkaloids, thebaine and oripavine, which {{are used in the}} manufacture of semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like oxycodone and etorphine and some other types of drugs. P. bracteatum does not contain morphine or codeine, or other narcotic phenanthrene-type, alkaloids. This species is rather a source of thebaine. Occurrence of morphine in other Papaverales and Papaveraceae, as well as in some species of hops and mulberry trees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in the life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various processes in the plant produce codeine, thebaine, and in some cases negligible amounts of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, <b>dihydrocodeine,</b> tetrahydro-thebaine, and hydrocodone (these compounds are rather synthesized from thebaine and oripavine).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} salts of {{morphine}} are used, {{with the most}} common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, {{so it is not}} used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not {{to be confused with the}} current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.|$|E
500|$|Göring {{was flown}} to Camp Ashcan, a {{temporary}} prisoner-of-war camp {{housed in the}} Palace Hotel at Mondorf-les-Bains, Luxembourg. Here he was weaned off <b>dihydrocodeine</b> (a mild morphine derivative)—he had been taking the equivalent {{of three or four}} grains (260 to 320mg) of morphine a day—and was put on a strict diet; he lost [...] His IQ was tested while in custody and found to be 138. Top Nazi officials were transferred in September to Nuremberg, which was to be the location of a series of military tribunals beginning in November.|$|E
2500|$|United States : In the USA, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is a DEA Schedule II substance, {{although}} preparations containing {{small amounts}} of <b>dihydrocodeine</b> are classified as Schedule III or Schedule V, depending on the concentration of <b>dihydrocodeine</b> relative to other active constituents, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). [...] This scheduling {{is similar to the}} UK's. [...] The DEA's ACSCN for <b>dihydrocodeine</b> free base and all salts is 9120. [...] The 2013 annual aggregate manufacturing quota is 250 kilos.|$|E
2500|$|Japan : In Japan, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is {{available}} without a prescription; used in cough medicines such as New Bron Solution-ACE. [...] <b>Dihydrocodeine</b> {{is used as}} an antitussive in many products as a Dextromethorphan alternative. [...] Medicines in Japan which contain <b>dihydrocodeine</b> are coupled with caffeine to offset the sedative effects and discourage recreational use. [...] Cough medicines containing <b>dihydrocodeine</b> are controlled similarly to dextromethrophan in the United States, in that its sale is strictly limited by purchase quantity and is restricted to persons 20 and older for purchase.|$|E
2500|$|Australia : In Australia, <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is a OTC 'pharmacy medicine' [...] drug when {{compounded}} with aspirin {{and no other}} therapeutically active substance, not exceeding 5mg per tablet and a recommended dose of 10mg. No more than 25 dosage units are permitted under Schedule 2 regulation for <b>dihydrocodeine.</b> It is a 'pharmacist only' [...] drug when {{compounded with}} one or more other therapeutically active substances and not exceeding 15mg <b>dihydrocodeine</b> per dose. Schedule 3 drugs, while still OTC, can only be dispensed after consultation with a pharmacist. It is a [...] (prescription only) drug when compounded {{with one or more}} other therapeutically active substances and not exceeding 100mg <b>dihydrocodeine</b> per dose. Single ingredient <b>dihydrocodeine</b> preparations fall under [...] regulation and require a government authorized, secure prescription.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dihydrocodeine</b> is {{available}} in Japan as tablets which contain 2.5mg of <b>dihydrocodeine</b> phosphate and caffeine, the decongestant d,l-methylephedrine HCl, and the antihistamine chlorpheniramine, and packets of granules which effervesce like Alka-Seltzer with 10mg of <b>dihydrocodeine</b> with lysozyme and chlorpheniramine, marketed for OTC sale as New Bron Solution-ACE. [...] These two formulations may have once contained phenyltoloxamine citrate as the antihistamine component.|$|E
2500|$|Controlled-release <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is a non-prescription item in some places, {{especially}} the 60mg strength. [...] A {{report by the}} Ivo Šandor Organisation in 2004 listed Andorra, Spain, Gibraltar and Austria as having varying degrees of access to these and other <b>dihydrocodeine,</b> nicocodeine and codeine products.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dihydrocodeine</b> was {{developed}} during the intense international search for more effective antitussives, especially to help reduce the airborne spread of tuberculosis, pertussis, pneumonia, and similar diseases, in the years from c.a. 1895 to 1915. It is similar in chemical structure to codeine. <b>Dihydrocodeine</b> is twice as strong as codeine. [...] Although <b>dihydrocodeine</b> does have extremely active metabolites, {{in the form of}} dihydromorphine and dihydromorphine-6-glucuronide (one hundred times more potent), these metabolites are produced in such small amounts {{that they do not have}} clinically significant effects.|$|E
2500|$|Two famous {{users of}} <b>dihydrocodeine</b> were William S. Burroughs, who {{described}} it as [...] "twice as strong as codeine and {{almost as good as}} heroin" [...] and Hermann Göring, who consumed up to 100 tablets (3 grams) of <b>dihydrocodeine</b> per day and was captured by the Allies with a large quantity of the drug in a suitcase, reportedly more than twenty thousand tablets, quite probably the entire world supply at the time. [...] He was also very fond of morphine and oxycodone (Eukodal), beginning with therapeutic use of morphine after being wounded in the groin during the November 1923 Beer Hall Putsch in Munich and then specifically starting <b>dihydrocodeine</b> therapy in the early 1930s for a toothache.|$|E
2500|$|As <b>dihydrocodeine</b> {{can provide}} a euphoric high when taken in higher-than-therapeutic doses, it is quite {{commonly}} abused recreationally. The typical recreational dose can be anything from 70mg to 500mg, or, in users with tolerance, even more. [...] Potentiators and adjuvants are often included when <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is used in an unsupervised fashion, especially carisoprodol, hydroxyzine and first-generation antihistamines, both to intensify the effect and lessen side-effects such as itching.|$|E
2500|$|Approved {{indication}} for <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is {{the management}} of moderate to moderately severe pain as well as coughing and shortness of breath. [...] As {{is the case with}} other drugs in this group, the antitussive dose tends to be less than the analgesic dose, and <b>dihydrocodeine</b> is a powerful cough suppressant like all other members of the immediate codeine family (see below) and their cousins hydrocodone, oxycodone and ethylmorphine, whole opium preparations, and the strong opioid hydromorphone.|$|E
2500|$|In many European {{countries}} {{and elsewhere in}} the world, the most commonly found <b>dihydrocodeine</b> preparations are extended-release tablets made by encasing granules of the ingredient mixture, almost always using the bitartrate salt of <b>dihydrocodeine,</b> of four different sizes in a wax-based binder. [...] The usual strengths are 60, 90, and 120mg. [...] Common trade names for the extended-release tablets are Didor Continus, Codidol, Codi-Contin, Dicodin (made in France and the major product containing the tartrate salt), Contugesic, DHC, and DHC Continus.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dihydrocodeine</b> {{products}} {{which can}} be purchased over the counter in many European and Pacific Rim countries generally contain from 2 to 20mg of <b>dihydrocodeine</b> per dosing unit combined {{with one or more}} other active ingredients such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), aspirin, ibuprofen, antihistamines, decongestants, vitamins, medicinal herb preparations, and other such ingredients. [...] In a subset of these countries and foreign possessions, 30mg tablets and 60mg controlled-release tablets are available over the counter and chemists may very well be able to dispense the 90 and 120mg strengths at their discretion.|$|E
