40|$|Context: Brain {{white matter}} hyper-intensities are seen on routine {{clinical}} imaging in 46 % of adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The extent and functional relevance of these abnormalities {{have not been}} studied using quantitative MRI analysis. Objective: To examine white matter microstructure, neural volumes and CNS metabolites in CAH due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency (21 OHD) and to determine whether identified abnormalities are associated with cognition, glucocorticoid and androgen exposure. Design, setting and participants: A cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital including 19 females (18 - 50 years) with 21 OHD and 19 age-matched healthy females. Main outcome measure: Recruits underwent cognitive assessment and brain imaging including; diffusion weighted imaging of white matter, T 1 -weighted volumetry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy for neural metabolites. We evaluated white matter microstructure using tract-based spatial statistics. We compared cognitive scores, neural volumes and metabolites between groups and relationships between glucocorticoid exposure, MRI and neurologic outcomes. Results: Patients with 21 OHD had widespread reductions in white matter structural integrity, reduced volumes of right hippocampus, bilateral thalami, cerebellum and brainstem, and reduced mesial temporal lobe total choline content. Working memory, processing speed, and <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> and <b>matrix</b> <b>reasoning</b> scores were reduced in patients with 21 OHD, despite similar education and intelligence to controls. 21 OHD individuals exposed to higher glucocorticoid doses had greater abnormalities in white matter microstructure and cognitive performance. Conclusion: For {{the first time we}} demonstrate that 21 OHD and current glucocorticoid replacement regimens have a profound impact on brain morphology and function. If reversible, these CNS markers represent a potential target for treatment...|$|R

However, {{the results in}} the literature are inconsistent with cognitive and physical performance measures. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the association between cognitive performance and physical function among older adults. Methods: A total of 164 older adults aged ≥ 60 years and residing in low-cost housing areas in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia participated in this study. Cognitive performance was measured using the Mini Mental State Examination, clock drawing test, Rey auditory verbal learning test, digit symbol test, <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> test, <b>matrix</b> <b>reasoning</b> test, and block design test. Physical performance measures were assessed using the ten step test for agility, short physical performance battery test for an overall physical function, static balance test using a Pro. Balance board, and dynamic balance using the functional reach test. Results: There was a negative and significant correlation between agility and the digit symbol test (r=− 0. 355), clock drawing test (r=− 0. 441), <b>matrix</b> <b>reasoning</b> test (r=− 0. 315), and block design test (r=− 0. 045). A significant positive correlation was found between dynamic balance, digit symbol test (r= 0. 301), and <b>matrix</b> <b>reasoning</b> test (r= 0. 251). The agility test appeared as a significant (R 2 = 0. 183, R 2 = 0. 407, R 2 = 0. 299, P< 0. 05) predictor of some cognitive performance measures, including the <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> test, clock drawing test, and Mini Mental State Examination. Conclusion: These results suggest that a decline in most cognitive performance measures can be predicted by poor execution of a more demanding physical performance measure such as the ten step test for agility. It is imperative to use a more complex and cognitively demanding physical performance measure to identify the presence of an overall cognitive impairment among community-dwelling older adults. It may also be beneficial to promote more complex and cognitively challenging exercises and activities among older adults for optimal physical and cognitive function.

40|$|This {{cross-cultural}} study investigates {{the impact of}} background experience on four verbal and visuo-spatial working memory (WM) tasks. Eighty-four children from low income families were recruited from the following groups: (1) Portuguese immigrant children from Luxembourg impoverished in terms of language experience; (2) Brazilian children deprived in terms of scholastic background; (3) Portuguese children from Portugal with no disadvantage in either scholastic or language background. Children were matched on age, gender, fluid intelligence, and socioeconomic status and completed four simple and complex span tasks of WM and a vocabulary measure. Results indicate that despite large differences in their backgrounds and language abilities, the groups exhibited comparable performance on the visuo-spatial tasks dot matrix and odd-one-out and on the verbal simple <b>span</b> task <b>digit</b> recall. Group differences emerged on the verbal complex span task counting recall with children from Luxembourg and Portugal outperforming children from disadvantaged schools in Brazil. The study suggests that whereas contributions of prior knowledge to <b>digit</b> <b>span,</b> dot <b>matrix,</b> and odd-one-out {{are likely to be}} minimal, background experience can affect performance on counting recall.

The <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> task is a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and consists of <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> forward and <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> backward. We were interested in performance on <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> backward, which is considered a measure of executive or complex working memory (George & Coch, 2011). In the <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> backward, participants were verbally presented {{with a series of}} numbers at a rate of one digit per second by an examiner and they were required to immediately repeat them back in the reverse order. If the participant correctly recalled the sequence, the number of digits presented increased by one in the following sequence. This procedure was repeated until participants recalled a set of two-digit sequences inaccurately. The total number of digit sequences correctly recalled by participants was measured and the task took approximately 5 min to complete.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate whether the immediate <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> measure traditionally used {{in the assessment of}} individual differences in cognition is a good predictor of performance on other memory tasks. In the first experiment, it was found that subjects' <b>digit</b> <b>spans</b> were not significantly related to their performances on either short-term or longterm memory tasks, or to theoretical measures of their memory store capacities. Memory for the temporal occurrence of events, however, proved to be positively correlated with <b>digit</b> <b>span.</b> A second experiment confirmed that <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> was correlated with memory for the temporal occurrence of events, but not with item memory.

This study investigated the rela tionship among <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> scores, rhythm span scores, and diagnostic factors of mentally retarded persons. The subjects were 25 indi viduals, aged 12 - 22, with IQs below 62. <b>Digit</b> <b>span</b> and rhythm span tasks were constructed by the experimenters. The <b>digit</b> <b>span</b> task required subjects to repeat spoken series of <b>digits.</b> The rhythm <b>span</b> task required subjects to reproduce even drum beats in response to prerecorded rhythmic stimuli.

Among non-pharmacological interventions, cognitive training appears as a promising option for delaying the effects of aging on cognition. Objective: The present study describes the procedures of a cognitive training program for healthy Brazilian elderly persons (without diagnosis of dementia). Method: Cognitive tasks for the training of attention, processing speed, episodic memory and working memory were carried out. The program training was performed over 12 individual sessions, and included an Instruction Book, a Stimulus Book and Protocol Record. To assess the effects of training, five subtests of the WAIS-III test were used: Picture completion, Coding, Arithmetic, <b>Matrix</b> <b>Reasoning</b> and <b>Digit</b> <b>Span.</b> The cognitive training program was tested with 15 individuals, divided into an experimental group (EG), which received training, and a control group (CG). The EG was formed of seven participants, aged between 70 and 82 years (M= 73. 57, SD= 4. 11) and with an average schooling of 5. 8 years (SD= 1. 02). The CG was formed by 8 participants, aged 69 - 77 years (M= 74. 00, SD= 4. 58), and who had an average schooling of 2. 88 years (SD= 2. 58). Results: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a training effect for three subtests: Coding: [F(1) = 5. 40, p= 0. 03, &# 951; 2 G= 0. 09], Arithmetic [F(1) = 9. 03, p= 0. 01, &# 951; 2 G= 0. 004] and Picture completion [F(1) = 8. 01, p= 0. 01, &# 951; 2 G= 0. 19].
