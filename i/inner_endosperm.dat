2500|$|Originally, {{by analogy}} with the animal ovum, the outer {{nucellus}} layer (perisperm) {{was referred to}} as albumen, and the <b>inner</b> <b>endosperm</b> layer as vitellus. Although misleading, the term began to be applied to all the nutrient matter. This terminology persists in referring to endospermic seeds as [...] "albuminous". The nature of this material is used in both describing and classifying seeds, in addition to the embryo to endosperm size ratio. The endosperm may be considered to be farinaceous (or mealy) in which the cells are filled with starch, as for instance cereal grains, or not (non-farinaceous). The endosperm may also be referred to as [...] "fleshy" [...] or [...] "cartilaginous" [...] with thicker soft cells such as coconut, but may also be oily as in Ricinus (castor oil), Croton and Poppy. The endosperm is called [...] "horny" [...] when the cell walls are thicker such as date and coffee, or [...] "ruminated" [...] if mottled, as in nutmeg, palms and Annonaceae.|$|E
30|$|In view {{of these}} {{assumptions}} we analyzed {{the amount of}} iron present in milled grains of low phytate T 3 transgenic seeds, which showed a 1.6 fold increase in iron levels {{as compared to the}} non-transgenic rice. Apart from iron other divalent cations (viz. Ca, Mg) also showed higher accumulation in transgenic milled seeds, due to reduction of phytate. Although, the increase in levels of iron does not directly correspond to higher bioavailability of iron in humans, but in accordance with earlier studies (Lucca et al. 2001), it is assumed that elevated levels of iron in milled rice grains might translate itself to higher iron bioavailability. It is thus suggested that the reduction of phytic acid levels in transgenic rice grains may facilitate higher mobilization of iron towards <b>inner</b> <b>endosperm</b> in a chelated form with different types of Mugineic acid family derivatives such as NA (Nicotianaminic acid), DMA (Deoxy mugineic acid), etc. (Paul et al. 2013).|$|E
30|$|In rice plants, the metals such as iron, zinc, {{magnesium}} etc. are translocated to {{the reproductive}} organs via xylem and phloem through {{different types of}} transporters viz. ZIP, IRT, YSL etc. During seed development and maturation an elevated amount of Fe, Zn etc. are transported {{in the form of}} Nicotianamine acid or Mugineic Acid chelated complex (Paul et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2009). However, the accumulation of calcium in the developing seeds is nearly constant, as it is considered to move preferentially in xylem and is generally immobile in phloem which may be related to its symplastic nature (Iwai et al. 2012). Although sufficient amount of metals (Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg etc.) are translocated into the rice seeds, still in its milled form (that is consumed) rice contain very low amount of iron (Lucca et al. 2001). This is attributed to {{the fact that most of}} these divalent cations are chelated by phytic acid and accumulates in the aleurone layer and embryo (which is removed during commercial milling) as inclusions in protein storage vacuoles (globoids), which cannot move into the <b>inner</b> <b>endosperm</b> (Brinch-Pedersen et al. 2007; Raboy 2009; Iwai et al. 2012; Paul et al. 2013). Moreover, the iron molecules chelated by phytic acid is not bioavailable (Jin et al. 2009), probably due to lack of phytase enzyme in the non-ruminants (Hegeman et al. 2001). Therefore, it is assumed that lower level of phytic acid in the aleurone layer will allow more iron to be present in the endosperm which will thereby supply more available iron for absorption by humans.|$|E
30|$|The endosperm-specific {{accumulation}} of rhGCase in CR W 3 seed was gained {{through the use}} of the rice glutelin 4 promoter (GluB 4 pro). In a former study carried out with different seed-specific promoters (Qu and Takaiwa 2004), GluB 4 pro determined the highest level of GUS expression in transgenic rice. The maximum {{accumulation of}} the GUS protein was observed in the <b>inner</b> starchy <b>endosperm,</b> close to the late maturation stage.|$|R
50|$|Aleurone (from Greek aleuron, flour) is {{a protein}} found in protein {{granules}} of maturing seeds and tubers. The term also describes {{one of the}} two major cell types of the endosperm, the aleurone layer. The aleurone layer is the outermost layer of the endosperm, followed by the <b>inner</b> starchy <b>endosperm.</b> This layer of cells is sometimes referred to as the peripheral endosperm. It lies between the pericarp and the hyaline layer of the endosperm. Unlike the cells of the starchy endosperm, aleurone cells remain alive at maturity.|$|R
40|$|The {{endosperm}} at {{the storage}} phase undergoes {{a series of}} coordinated cellular and metabolic events, including starchy endosperm cell death, starch synthesis, and starch granule packaging, which leads to efficient accumulation of starch. However, the mechanism underlying the interconnections remains unknown. We used integrated proteomic and cytological approaches to probe the interconnections in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm at the storage phase from 12 to 18 days after flowering (DAF). Starch granule packaging was completed first in the <b>inner</b> part of <b>endosperm</b> at 15 DAF and spread to almost the entire endosperm at 18 DAF. Programmed starchy endosperm cell death occurred after the starch granule packaging. Endogenous H 2 O 2 was detectable in the <b>inner</b> part of <b>endosperm</b> at 12 DAF and the region beyond the inner part at 15 DAF, with an H 2 O 2 burst at 15 DAF. Proteomics analysis with 2 -D fluorescent difference gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight/ time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed 317 proteins, including almost all known antioxidants, differentially expressed throughout the 3 stages of the developmental phase. More {{than two-thirds of the}} 317 proteins were potential thioredoxin targets, with a preferential skew toward central carbon metabolism, alcoholic fermentation, starch metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and protein synthesis or folding. These proteins implicated in starch synthesis and gluconeogenesis were upregulated...|$|R
30|$|Histological {{studies have}} {{revealed}} {{the time course of}} development of storage product in rice developing endosperm. Aleurone cells begin their differentiation at 4 – 5 DAF in the outermost endosperm, whereas active starch accumulation {{starts in the}} center of the endosperm at 5 DAF (Hoshikawa 1968; Ishimaru et al. 2003). Starch accumulation proceeds asynchronously depending on the region. During the early storage phase, starch rapidly accumulates around the center of the endosperm, whereas in the peripheral starchy endosperm, starch accumulation proceeds at a slower rate until the late storage phase (Hoshikawa 1968). Nitrogen and mineral contents are higher in peripheral endosperm layers corresponding to aleurone cells (Itani et al. 2002). Thus, storage products are quantitatively and qualitatively different depending on their position in the rice endosperm. In barley and maize, histochemical studies have revealed that the oxygen gradient in the endosperm tissues is associated with energy status and the accumulation of storage products. In barley kernels, oxygen-rich regions in the lateral and peripheral endosperm begin starch accumulation first in endosperm tissues under high-ATP conditions, whereas the hypoxic region in the <b>inner</b> <b>endosperm</b> accumulates starch at the later stage (Rolletschek et al. 2004). In developing maize kernels, the oil-storing embryo is in a high-O 2 state with high levels of metabolites of glycolytic intermediates and the mitochondrial TCA cycle and with some pools of amino acids (Rolletschek et al. 2005). Thus, in maize and barley, oxygen status differs among endosperm tissues and is closely linked with the accumulation of storage products. However, the quantification of mRNAs of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, described above as important genes for starch accumulation in rice endosperm, was performed using RNAs extracted from whole developing caryopses. No attempt has yet been made to elucidate the asynchronous development of starch among rice endosperm tissues at molecular level. In addition, the oxygen gradient in the developing endosperm is not yet known in rice.|$|E
30|$|A {{significant}} amount of nutritionally important mineral elements accumulates in rice bran (embryo and aleurone layers), whereas a lower amount {{is found in the}} endosperm (Lamberts et al. 2007). As most of the PA is present in the aleurone layer and, due to its chelating ability, there is a high probability of PA binding to minerals inside the aleurone layer. According to synchrotron-based X-ray micro-fluorescence (μ-XRF) investigations, the relative concentrations of Zn, Fe and K are in the following order: bran > hull > whole grain > brown rice > polished rice (Lu et al. 2013). Zinc and Fe concentrations in the bran are three-times and seven-times higher than that of the hull and endosperm, respectively (Lu et al. 2013). Therefore, grain processing results in a significant reduction in the micronutrient content of rice (Liang et al. 2008) in which approximately 40 – 45 % of the total Zn, two-thirds of the total Fe, and most of the total K, Ca and Mn are removed during polishing (Lu et al. 2013). As rice is mainly consumed after polishing, this significant removal of nutrients from rice bran affects human nutrition. Consequently, manipulating the micronutrient distribution, that is reducing the amount in bran and increasing the amount in endosperm, will be another approach for improving human micronutrient intake. Using μ-XRF analysis, Iwai et al. (2012) revealed the dynamic spatial distributions of micronutrients in developing rice seeds. The fine mapping method revealed that Zn is distributed from the aleurone layer to the <b>inner</b> <b>endosperm</b> with more than one-half of the total Zn present in the endosperm; Fe is localized in the aleurone layer. Considering the embryo separately, Zn is mainly found in the central parts of the embryo (the plumule and radicle), whereas Fe levels are higher in the scutellum and hull (Lu et al. 2013). The total amount of mineral elements in lpa seeds was identical to those of wild type, and the decreased PA content in seeds did not affect the translocation of mineral elements from vegetative organs into seeds but did affect mineral localization (Sakai et al. 2015). Zn and Cu were primarily localized in the narrow space around the aleurone layer, whereas P and K mainly diffused from the aleurone layer into the endosperm of the lpa seeds; however, the distribution pattern of Fe in lpa seeds was {{similar to that of the}} wild type. However, the optimal amount of the micronutrient present in different parts of rice grains, the mechanism responsible for differences in the distribution of micronutrients, and the resulting effects arising with the changes in micronutrient distribution should be broadly considered during low-PA development process.|$|E
30|$|The {{transcript}} of sucrose transporter 1 (OsSUT 1; Hirose et al. 1997) was specific to AL, {{as we reported}} previously for AL and SEC (Ishimaru et al. 2007). This study showed negligible expression in SEL (Fig.  5). An anti-sense transformant of OsSUT 1 showed impaired grain filling (Scofield et al. 2002). The specific localization of OsSUT 1 in AL (Fig.  5) suggests the critical function of aleurone cells for uptake of sucrose into developing endosperm tissues for starch accumulation. Our LM-based expression analysis revealed the specific localization of OsCIN 2 in AL among endosperm tissues as that of OsSUT 1 (Fig.  5). A mutation of OsCIN 2 (gif 1) causes slower grain filling and chalky phenotype of the kernel with aberrant amyloplast formation, indicating that hexoses catalyzed by OsCIN 2 function as an important carbon energy source for grain development in rice (Wang et al. 2008). The specific distribution of OsCIN 2 in AL (Fig.  5) was spatially inconsistent with starch accumulation in the starchy endosperm, such as in SEL and SEC. OsCIN 2 in AL is expected {{to contribute to the}} partitioning of hexoses to the <b>inner</b> <b>endosperm</b> tissues for starch accumulation in SEL and SEC. The organ expression analysis of OsSUS 3 and OsSUS 4 revealed their predominant localization in the developing caryopsis, especially in the endosperm, after the onset of starch accumulation at 5 DAF (Hirose et al. 2008). Our LM-based expression analysis found OsSUS 3 and OsSUS 4 to be localized mainly in the SEL and SEC, respectively (Fig.  5). The expression profile of the sucrose-cleavage genes OsCIN 2, OsSUS 3, and OsSUS 4 was spatially complemented in the developing endosperm. The cleavage of sucrose in the developing endosperm is necessary for generating a sucrose gradient to maintain sink strength (Sturm and Tang 1999). The results suggest that OsCIN 2, OsSUS 3, and OsSUS 4 contribute to sink strength by cleaving sucrose in different locations in developing endosperm tissues. With respect to the expression profile for hexokinase, OsHXK 4 and OsHXK 5 showed predominant expression in SEC and AL, respectively. For OsHXK 2, a gradient in expression level was observed from AL to SEC in descending order. OsHXK 6 and OsHXK 8 showed highest expression level in SEL and SEC, respectively, and relatively high expression was observed remaining two tissues. Transcripts of OsUgp 1 and phosphoglucomutase were highest in AL and SEC, respectively, and relatively high expression was observed in the remaining two tissues. Thus, the expression of each gene appeared to be functional in a different space in hexokinase. OsUgp 1 and phosphoglucomutase are assumed to generate metabolites for subsequent starch biosynthesis in all three regions: AL, SEL, and SEC.|$|E

40|$|A new glutelin gene, {{designated}} GluD- 1, {{has been}} discovered by comparing the seed storage proteins from 48 japonica and indica rice cultivars on SDS-PAGE gels. Evidence that GluD- 1 {{is a member of}} the glutelin family was provided by Western blots using anti-glutelin antiserum and by mapping the gene to the chromosomal glutelin gene cluster. The limited GluD- 1 size polymorphism among the rice varieties is due to amino acid substitutions rather than to post-transcriptional modification. GluD- 1 is maximally expressed in the starchy endosperm starting at 5 d after flowering (DAF) and increasing through 30 DAF, a major difference from the other glutelins which are primarily expressed in the subaleurone from 10 – 16 DAF. Only about 0. 2 kb of the GluD- 1 promoter was sufficient to confer inner starchy endosperm-specific expression. The 0. 2 kb truncated GluD- 1 promoter contains a bifactorial endosperm box consisting of a truncated GCN 4 motif (TGA(G/C) TCA) and AAAG Prolamin box (P box), and ACGT and AACA motifs as cis-regulatory elements. Gel retardation assays and trans-activation experiments indicated that the truncated GCN 4 and P box are specifically recognized by RISBZ 1 b-ZIP and RPBF Dof activators in vitro, respectively, and are synergistically transactivated, indicating that combinatorial interactions of these motifs are involved in essential endosperm-specific regulation. Furthermore, deviation from the cognate GCN 4 motif alters tissue-specific expression in the <b>inner</b> starchy <b>endosperm</b> to include other endosperm tissues...|$|R

Specific enzymes were used to confirm the identity of these two polysaccharides in sections of endosperm tissue. All barley lines tested contained both types of B-glucan but (1, 3; 1, 4) -B-glucan was synthesized at an earlier stage of development than was (1, 3) -BGlucan.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} J. curcas {{is due to}} the high amount of oil accumulated in their seeds, specifically in the endosperm. In this context, the events related to the endosperm formation and the accumulation of toxic compounds in the seeds could help in the production of varieties that produce more oil and are less toxic. Thus, anatomical, proteomic and gene expression analysis were made with J. curcas seeds to contribute with the knowledge about physiologic events related with the formation of endosperm and the processes of synthesis and accumulation of phorbol esters. The anatomical analysis showed the maternal tissue responsible for the nutrients transfer to the endosperm and contributed to fill the gaps present in the literature about the anatomy of J. curcas seeds. The inner integument is the maternal tissue that presents the vasculature of the mother plant and is the responsible for the nutrition of the endosperm through the process of programmed cell death (PCD). Based on this result proteomic analysis of two anatomically different regions of the inner integument, named as proximal and distal, were performed. The identified proteins indicated that the inner integument pass through PCD in different degrees in the proximal and distal regions and that in this tissue there is a spatial distribution between catabolism and anabolism. In the proximal region especially hydrolases were identified and in the distal region storage proteins and proteins of biosynthetic pathways were prevalent. The gene expression analysis had two purposes: first, verify wether the transcripts levels of the genes likely involved in PCD, whose proteins were identified and quantified in the proteomic analysis, were related to the protein abundance and second, identify the site of synthesis of the committed enzyme in the phorbol esters biosynthesis, the casbene synthase, through a study with root, leaf, embryo, <b>inner</b> integument and <b>endosperm</b> and 14 putative genes of the mentioned enzyme. The results indicated that the proteins related to PCD must be controlled at transcript level. Nine putative genes from casbene synthase were expressed in roots {{and one of them was}} expressed in the leaf and embryo. This work denotes the role of PCD in the inner integument to the development of the seed and also demonstrates the transitory nature of storage of this tissue. In addition gives notation that the seed, despite of accumulates phorbol esters, do not synthesizes these compounds, but probably import them from roots. A importÃncia econÃmica da espÃcie J. curcas deve-se a grande quantidade de Ãleo acumulada em suas sementes, especificamente no endosperma. Os eventos relacionados Ã formaÃÃo do endosperma e ao acÃmulo de compostos tÃxicos nas sementes podem auxiliar na produÃÃo de variedades com maior produÃÃo de Ãleo e menos tÃxicas. Visando isso, foram realizadas anÃlises anatÃmicas, proteÃmicas e de expressÃo de genes nas sementes de J. curcas para contribuir com o entendimento sobre os eventos fisiolÃgicos associados Ã formaÃÃo do endosperma e aos processos de sÃntese e acÃmulo dos Ãsteres de forbol. A anÃlise anatÃmica mostrou o tecido maternal responsÃvel pela transferÃncia de nutrientes para o endosperma e contribuiu para resolver lacunas existentes na literatura sobre a anatomia de sementes de J. curcas. O integumento interno Ã o tecido maternal que apresenta a vascularizaÃÃo da planta-mÃe e Ã o responsÃvel pela nutriÃÃo do endosperma atravÃs do processo de morte celular programada (PCD). Com base nesse resultado, realizou-se uma anÃlise proteÃmica do integumento interno na regiÃo proximal e distal ao endosperma, uma vez que as caracterÃsticas celulares indicativas de PCD nesse tecido se apresentavam diferentes nessas regiÃes. As proteÃnas identificadas indicaram que o integumento interno sofre PCD em diferentes graus nas diferentes regiÃes e que nesse tecido hÃ uma distribuiÃÃo espacial entre catabolismo e anabolismo, pois na regiÃo proximal identificaram-se principalmente hidrolases e na regiÃo distal proteÃnas de reserva e de vias biossintÃticas. A anÃlise de expressÃo de genes teve dois propÃsitos: primeiro, verificar se os nÃveis de transcritos de genes possivelmente relacionados Ã PCD, cujas proteÃnas foram identificadas e quantificadas na anÃlise proteÃmica, estavam relacionados Ã abundÃncia de proteÃnas e o segundo foi identificar o local de sÃntese da enzima comprometida na biossÃntese dos Ãsteres de forbol, a sintase do casbeno, atravÃs de um estudo com raiz, folha, embriÃo, integumento interno e endosperma e 14 genes candidatos Ã enzima mencionada. Os resultados indicaram que as proteÃnas relacionadas Ã PCD devem ser controladas no Ãmbito transcricional. Nove genes candidatos Ã sintase do casbeno foram expressos em raiz e um deles foi expresso na folha e no embriÃo. Este trabalho evidencia o papel da PCD no integumento interno para o desenvolvimento da semente, alÃm de demonstrar a natureza transitÃria de reserva desse tecido.
