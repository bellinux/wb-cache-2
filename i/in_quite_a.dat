25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous version of the cricket cap in the modern setting is the baggy green cricket cap of the Australian cricket team, for which the players and fans of Australia hold a degree of reverence. The cap is treated {{with a degree of}} mysticism, and players who have long careers often refuse to replace the {{original}} one they receive as they often feel the cap is a lucky talisman. This sometimes results in players who have long careers wearing their cricket caps <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> tattered state. The Australian side has long worn their baggy cricket cap, rather than alternatives such as a sun hat, for the first session of each match as a symbol of team solidarity.|$|E
25|$|A {{manifolded}} {{twin set}} with isolation valve {{is a special}} case. It is a redundant air supply when the isolation valve is closed, as the cylinders are then for most practical purposes independent, but not when it is open, as a leak will eventually drain both cylinders. Divers who intend {{to rely on a}} manifolded twin for bailout {{need to be able to}} isolate the cylinders quickly, as a major leak can drain a set <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> short time. In comparison with independent twins, the manifolded set is less task loading through the most of the dive, but requires skilled and immediate reaction in the event of a catastrophic failure, as it does not fail safe. If diving as part of a team, the risk is mitigated by the presence of buddies who can help.|$|E

500|$|Sumner largely {{acted as}} the band's director, a role he {{continued}} in New Order.

Sumner said, [...] "He played <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bizarre way and that to us was interesting, {{because no one else}} would play like Ian". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.|$|E

[...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, and I think people [...] that I was an artist on a project.

500|$|Miriam Coleman from Rolling Stone {{appreciated}} the songs's [...] "easy poppy beat" [...] and its [...] "repeated refrains", factors she believed contributed {{to make the}} song a [...] "determined note for the new album". James Montgomery of MTV described it as [...] "one of the more perfect pop songs to come down the pipeline <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> while". Gerrick D. Kennedy from Los Angeles Times also gave a positive review, classifying [...] "Roar" [...] as a [...] "sweet, poppy confection {{with a bit of}} bite". Melinda Newman from HitFix saw the song as a [...] "change of pace" [...] for Perry, whilst Andrew Hampp from Billboard believed it to be a return to the style of her album One of the Boys, but criticized its tempo and its lyrics that [...] "rarely rise above easy clichés and rhymes". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as [...] "more of a yelp than a roar".|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Eastwood {{directed}} {{and played the}} title role in Bronco Billy alongside Locke, Scatman Crothers, and Sam Bottoms. Eastwood has cited Bronco Billy as {{being one of the}} most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel has argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood's most self-referential character. The film was a rare commercial disappointment in Eastwood's career, but was liked by critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that film was [...] "...the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> while", and praised Eastwood's directing, intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West. Later that year, Eastwood starred in Any Which Way You Can, the sequel to Every Which Way But Loose. The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Maslin described it as [...] "funnier and even better than its predecessor". Released over the Christmas season of 1980, Any Which Way You Can was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year.|$|E

I can’t imagine that he would, but it’s a 'you never know' kind of thing. I haven’t talked to him <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> while. I don’t know where he’s at these days.

He’s a phenomenal musician and songwriter who gave so much to our band. All the feelings I have for him not being in the band any more... He really took us to a higher level." [...] Frusciante eventually declined to be present for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April.|$|E
500|$|With the {{departure}} of several cast members throughout the seasons, many new characters {{were added to the}} drama's ensemble. McKidd and Capshaw were referred to as [...] "fresh additions" [...] to the series, by Monfette of IGN. In addition, Matt Roush of TV Guide commented: [...] "Hunt/McKidd is the most encouraging thing to happen to Grey's Anatomy <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> while." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide noted that Robbins [...] "quickly established herself as a fan favorite", describing her as: [...] "a breath of fresh air in the often angsty halls of Seattle Grace. On April Kepner and Jackson Avery Courtney Morrison of TVFanatic wrote [...] "April has grown since her character was introduced. She’s no longer much less annoying than she used to be, and she’s honest. A girl with principles is a girl you want to do well." [...] and described her and Avery as [...] "a couple for whom viewers can root". Speaking of the new cast members, in addition to the remaining original, Robert Bianco from USA Today called them the show's [...] "best ensemble in years".|$|E
500|$|The Historia {{is perhaps}} Hale's most famous work. Pleas of the Crown were capital {{offences}} committed [...] "against {{the peace of}} our Lord the King, his Crown and dignity"; as such, the book dealt with capital crimes and the associated procedure. The 710-page work followed the pattern of Coke's Institutes of the Lawes of England, but was far more methodical; James Fitzjames Stephen said that Hale's work [...] "was {{not only of the}} highest authority but shows a depth of thought which puts it <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> different category from Coke's Institute... is far more of a treatise and far less of an index or mere work of practice". The book dealt with the criminal capacity of infants, insanity and idiocy, the defence of drunkenness, capital offences, treason, homicide and theft. In the 19th century, Andrew Amos wrote a critique of the Historia titled Ruins of Time exemplified in Sir Matthew Hale's History of the Pleas of the Crown, which both criticised and praised Hale's work while directing the main criticism at the judges and lawyers who cited the Historia without considering that it was dated.|$|E

500|$|When {{the episode}} aired, the {{production}} team received [...] "very few" [...] complaints about its content, {{with most of}} the response being positive. Alan Frutkin gave the episode a positive write-up in the LGBT-interest magazine The Advocate, calling it [...] "vintage Simpsons." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood stated in their book, I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, that: [...] "Only The Simpsons could do this so tongue-in-cheek that nobody could get in a tizzy about it. Very good indeed." [...] In the book Leaving Springfield, Matthew Henry praised the episode's critiquing of [...] "the most common misconception about homosexuality: namely that gayness is somehow contagious", as well as its other themes. Catharine Lumby of the University of Sydney cited the episode as an example of good satire as it [...] "managed to explore a lot of [...] issues <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> deep way [...] without being overtly political", which she claimed, along with the episode's humor, made its anti-homophobia message more successful than that of other gay-themed shows like Queer as Folk. In his review of The Simpsons – The Complete Eighth Season DVD, Todd Gilchrist said that [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] "certainly qualifies as one of the all-time greatest episodes".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{acclaimed}} by several publications. Spin writer Doug Brod {{referred to it}} as the band's best record since Mechanical Animals. Ed Power of Hot Press and John Earls of Planet Sound both rated the album 8 out of 10 and also compared the two releases, with the latter complimenting The High End of Lows [...] "strutting glam and magnificently [...] ballads". In another 8 out of 10 review, Amy Sciarretto of Ultimate Guitar noted Twiggy's return to the band, and claimed that he [...] "must be the catalyst sparking Manson's creative drive and gears, because [...] hasn't sounded this delightfully or determinedly pissed <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> long time." [...] Similarly, BBC Music concluded that Twiggy's involvement saw the band resurrected after Eat Me, Drink Me, which they called [...] "lacklustre", and said that the album provided a pointed satirical commentary on modern America. Los Angeles Times reviewer Mikael Wood complimented its production, describing how the band had [...] "sculpted a sound both harder-hitting and more finely detailed than on any previous Marilyn Manson record." [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post praised the album for its personal lyrical content, contending that Manson's divorce from Von Teese had led to a new musical high.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Systematic Chaos was generally positive. Writing for MetalReview.com, Jon Eardley called the album, [...] "another solid outing". He complimented Petrucci for [...] "Constant Motion", writing that it contains [...] "some {{of the best}} riffs Petrucci has brought to the table". In addition, he called {{the latter part of}} [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] "the most brutal part in any song to date". Reviewing for Metal Invader, Nikos Patelis called the album, [...] "energetic, sharp– edged, full of beautiful melodies and heavy riffs, long epic compositions". He called Dream Theater's instrumentalists [...] "four masters of music that use their instruments as if they were their limbs", in addition to stating, [...] "James LaBrie sounds more mature than ever". In conclusion, Patelis called Systematic Chaos, [...] "an excellent album that needs many times to be listened in order to be digested". Greg Prato, of AllMusic, wrote [...] " [...] 'Forsaken' proves wrong those who say that Dream Theater is all about instrumental gymnastics and not songwriting". He also compared riffs in [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] to the band Pantera. Overall, he states [...] " [...] the quintet sticks to the prog metal game plan that they've followed since their inception". Reviewer Chad Bowar of About.com, wrote that [...] "In the Presence of Enemies - Part I" [...] is [...] "an effective way to {{set the tone for the}} rest of the songs". Overall, Bowar gave the album four out of five stars, calling it, [...] "one of the best Dream Theater releases <b>in</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> while".|$|E
