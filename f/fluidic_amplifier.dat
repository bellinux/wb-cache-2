50|$|In a <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> a fluid supply, {{which may}} be air, water, or {{hydraulic}} fluid, enters at the bottom. Pressure applied to the control ports C1 or C2 deflects the stream, so that it exits via either port O1 or O2. The stream entering the control ports may be much weaker than the stream being deflected, so the device has gain.|$|E

50|$|The {{physical}} {{basis of}} fluidics is pneumatics and hydraulics, {{based on the}} theoretical foundation of fluid dynamics. The term fluidics is normally used when devices have no moving parts, so ordinary hydraulic components such as hydraulic cylinders and spool valves are not considered or referred to as fluidic devices. The 1960s saw the application of fluidics to sophisticated control systems, {{with the introduction of}} the <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E
40|$|Due to some {{drawbacks}} {{of conventional}} drilling methods and drilling tools, {{the application of}} hydraulic hammers with a <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> have been extensively popularized since its emergence in recent years. However, the performance life of a <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> is still unsatisfactory in oil and gas wells drilling, especially the heavy wear or erosion of the <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> leads to the reduction of service life time of hydraulic hammers, which {{is derived from the}} incision of drilling muds with high speed and pressure. In order to investigate the influence of drilling muds, such as particle size, solid content and jet velocity, on the antierosion property of a <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> several groups of drilling muds with different performance parameters have been utilized to numerical simulation on basis of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Simulation results have shown that the jet nozzle of fluidic amplifiers is primarily abraded, afterwards are the lateral plates and the wedge of the <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which shows extraordinary agreement with the actual cases of <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> in drilling process. It can be concluded that particle size, solid content and jet velocity have a great influence on the anti-erosion property of a <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and the erosion rate linearly varies with the particle size of drilling muds, nevertheless exponentially varies with solid content and jet velocity of drilling muds. As to improve the service life time of a <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier,</b> the mud purification system or low solid clay-free mud system is suggested in the operation of directional well drillin...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{wind tunnel test}} of a model {{vertical}} tail fin is described in this report. The model {{is designed to provide}} the aerodynamic forces necessary for lateral stabilization without moving parts or a separate source of power. It employs scoop-fed slots on both surfaces of the symmetrical airfoil. They are to be controlled differentially by means of a <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> to implement an automatic fulltime lateral stabilization system. The results of tests show that the control of forces is stable and quite linear in various modes of operation. Significant forces were produced that can be increased as necessary by increasing slot size and scoop size. Slots can be located ahead of the conventional rudder and the scoop can be {{at the base of the}} vertical tail fin to avoid the need for major changes in conventional aircraft design. The first phase of the work demonstrated the feasibility of no-moving-parts aircraft control. The second phase established that a practical <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> can be built to control slot flows from fluidic signals. Recommendations are made to optimize the design of the <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> and to characterize its dynamic response in support of further analytical studies...|$|E

The paper discusses {{a new concept}} of flow control in the cascade, inspired by <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> based on the Coanda effect. In place of mechanically articulated blades, the airfoil properties are controlled by auxiliary flow issuing from a slit nozzle in the blade. The alternate attachment to either one {{of a pair of}} attachment walls results in two alternative flow regimes. Several applications are discussed in detail, mainly concentrating on a cascade controlling the entrance flow into the vortex chamber of a turn-down flow control valve...|$|R

40|$|A <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> is {{a crucial}} {{automatic}} control component in a liquid jet hammer used to drill hard formations in the oil industry. This study aims to determine the true causes of the fracture failure of baseplates in a <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> made of WC- 11 Co cemented carbide {{in a very short}} period of time. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), theoretical estimation, and finite element analysis (FEA) were employed to analyze the effect of static and dynamic loads on the strength of the baseplates. Fractographic, metallographic, and processing defect analyses were also carried out. The FEA results showed that the static and dynamic loads caused stress concentrations at the actual fracture locations, and the effect of working loads on material strength was allowable and safe. Fracture surfaces exhibited typical characteristics of a brittle fracture. The metallographic analysis revealed that a specific amount of brittle eta-phase (η-phase) was present in the material. The microstructure of the processing cutting zone was inspected and the results revealed that some voids, pores, and microcracks were formed on the processing surface. The manufacturing and processing defects resulted in low stress fracture failure of the baseplates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—For the {{development}} of cardiovascular devices {{and the study of}} the dynamics of blood flow through the cardiovascular system, hardware fluidic models are commonly used to minimize animal experiments and clinical trials. These systems, called “mock circulatory systems, ” are also critical for {{the development}} of ventricular assist devices. The passive and active elements in these systems are frequently “hard-plumbed ” and are difficult to modify in experimental studies. Therefore, we propose a concept of novel <b>fluidic</b> operational <b>amplifier</b> comprised of a high-gain feedbackcontrolled gear pump. With pressure being the analog of voltage, design with the fluidic op-amp is analogous to electrical op-amp circuit design. Initial computer and hardware simulation results demonstrate that the device may be programmed for use in mock circulatory systems to emulate the function of the energy sources (the ventricles) or passive networks (hemodynamic loads).

40|$|Progress in the {{development}} of concepts for control of aircraft without moving parts or a separate source of power is described. The design and wind tunnel tests of a full scale fluidic rudder for a Cessna 172 K aircraft, intended for subsequent flight tests were documented. The 172 K fluidic rudder was designed to provide a control force equivalent to 3. 3 degrees of deflection of the conventional rudder. In spite of an extremely thin airfoil, cascaded <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> were built to fit, with the capacity for generating the required level of control force. Wind tunnel tests demonstrated that the principles of lift control using ram air power are sound and reliable under all flight conditions. The tests also demonstrated that the performance of the 172 K fluidic rudder is not acceptable for flight tests until the design of the scoop is modified to prevent interference with the lift control phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} a temperature sensor and pulse duration modulation (PDM) diverter valve for a thermal control-mixing control device are described. The temperature sensor selected for use uses a <b>fluidic</b> pin <b>amplifier</b> in conjunction with an expansion device.

In addition, the valve operates with a flow efficiency of at least 95 %, with the possibility of attaining 100 % if the vent flow of the PDM can be channeled through the last stage of the diverter valve.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the actual solution used by Secoma Enterprise {{and a new}} solution concerning {{the implementation of the}} digital devices in the pressing strength’s control of a pneumatic rotating hammer drill, which is included {{in the structure of the}} drilling installation. The monostable element, which was proposed to be used, is a special device, with an incompressible fluid as supply jet and compressible fluid as command jet. The fluidic command proposed solution presents superior advantages given the existing variants and the automation solutions with electronic components. This is due to the higher security in hostile work environments (moist environment, with high methane gas contents, with fire danger, with high temperature) of their high feasibility and maintenance. For the practical achievement of the automated regulation with fluidic elements, of the type tested in the experimental plan, it is necessary to choose a monostabile <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier</b> for the prototype device, which respects several clear conditions regarding wall attachment angle and geometrical parameters.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are exposed}} to unsteady incident flow conditions such as gusts or tower interference. These cause {{a change in the}} blades ’ local angle of attack, which often leads to flow separation at the inner rotor sections. Recirculation areas and dynamic stall may occur, which lead to an uneven load distribution along the blade. In this work, a fluidic actuator is developed that reduces flow separation. The functional principle is adapted from a <b>fluidic</b> <b>amplifier.</b> High pressure air fed by an external supply flows into the inter-action region of the actuator. Two control ports, oriented perpendicular to the inlet, allow for a steering of the actuation flow. One of the control ports is connected to the suc-tion side, the other to the pressure side of the airfoil. Depending on the pressure differ-ence that varies with the angle of attack, the actuation air is directed into one of four outlet channels. These guide the air to different chordwise exit locations on the airfoil’s suction side. The appropriate actuation location adjusts automatically according to the pressure difference between the control ports and therefore incidence. Suction side flow separation is delayed as the boundary layer is enriched with kinetic energy. Experiments were conducted on a DU 97 -W- 300 airfoil at Re 2. 2 105. Compared to the baseline...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} control fluid flow within a microactuator, two special types of fluidic beam element, beam {{deflection}} amplifiers and bistable wall attachment amplifiers are miniaturised and investigated. The elements are fabricated out of Plexiglas {{by means of}} the LIGA-technique and their characteristics with different kinds of gas as working fluid are determined. Beam deflection <b>amplifiers,</b> which are <b>fluidic</b> proportional <b>amplifiers,</b> are fabricated with heights up to 500 #mu#m and a nozzle width of 55 #mu#m. They are operated with nitrogen and have a gain of 3. 5 at a supply pressure of 20 hPa. Bistable wall attachment <b>amplifiers,</b> which are <b>fluidic</b> flip flops, are fabricated with heights up to 500 #mu#m and nozzle widths of 30 #mu#m and 60 #mu#m. They are working with Argon, Carbon dioxide and Nitrogen as working fluid. The bistable behaviour can be observed for supply pressures higher than a certain value. Working with nitrogen, this value does not depend on the element height if the aspect ratio (=element height/width of supply nozzle) is greater than 5. In this case it is 260 hPa for elements of 30 #mu#m nozzle width and 140 hPa for elements of 60 #mu#m nozzle width. The control pressure to switch the fluidic flip flop is about 20 hPa at low supply pressures and decreases with decreasing element height. The maximum pressure at the output port at which the jet is directed depends linearly on the supply pressure. It does not depend on the element height for heights greater than 250 #mu#m. The value of the maximum output pressure is about 40 hPa at an element height of 500 #mu#m, a nozzle width of 30 #mu#m and a supply pressure of 330 hPa. The steady state flow within a fluidic flip flop is calculated numerically with finite-element-simulations. The flow through the ports is calculated with 10 % difference to the experiment and the pressure at the output ports with 20 % difference. By means of the calculations an optimization of the element geometry is achieved. In detail the geometry of the control area and the angle of the attachment walls is optimized and the characteristics of the elements are improved. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by J.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents a comprehensive dynamic analysis of <b>fluidic</b> laminar proportional <b>amplifiers</b> (LPA) and a subsequent {{design of a}} broad-band voice communication system and narrow-band data link that demonstrates {{the utility of the}} analysis. Starting from first principles, the governing equations for the lumped parameter representation of the various flow regimes found in an LPA are derived. From these governing equations, in the Laplace domain, equivalent electrical circuits are derived. The input of the LPA is determined to have a fifth order impedance. The transmission of the signal from input to output is delayed by a transport time, determined both phenomenologically and experimentally, to be twice the average particle transit time. A pressure is developed at the output that is dependent on the loading and the vent conditions. This pressure is acoustically fed back to the control region of the jet, augmenting jet deflection when in phase. The vent inductance has the effect of producing a low frequency hump on the Bode plot. The regions of enhanced gain correspond almost exactly to the edge-tone Eigen frequencies reported in the literature and as such the theory developed herein may be used to predict not only the ratios of Eigen frequencies but also their actual values, Experiments have shown good agreement between theory and data for the amplitude frequency response of LPA's and excellent agreement for their phase shift. Using the analysis as a tool, an engineering guide was developed for the dynamics characteristics of LPA's especially the HDL STD MOD 3. 1. 1. 8. Operating bandwidths of grater than 14 kHz can be expected for amplifiers with a nozzle width of 0. 25 mm. Ultrasonic operation is feasible with smaller devices.
