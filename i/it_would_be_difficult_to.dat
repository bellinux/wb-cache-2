5|$|Blomkamp {{declared}} the project dead in late 2007, but Jackson replied {{that the film}} would still be made. Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9, but the director told /Film {{that he was no}} longer considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> return. The rights for the film have since reverted to Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's comments {{were limited to}} the use of the Parliament Acts and would not apply to legislation enacted using the ordinary legislative procedure. He also argues that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> explain how courts would refuse to apply legislation unless human rights were involved, citing the example of the removal of judicial review: using fundamental common law principles to interpret legislation is very different from striking down legislation supported by the elected House of Commons, and would be even more contentious if the legislation only substantially modified judicial review procedure.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, {{producers}} began scouting {{locations in}} Africa {{in order to}} film the feature in the upcoming weeks. The original plan was to shoot three days worth of scenes in Africa and then have Simi Valley, California fill in for the location. After realizing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> fake, {{it was decided to}} shoot the majority of the film on location in Cape Town, South Africa. Filming took place from June 4 to June 20 with the final scenes being shot in Los Angeles, California. By July 13, principal shooting of the film had been completed and post-production had begun.|$|E

5|$|Squall was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with input from game director Yoshinori Kitase. He was modelled after late actor River Phoenix. Squall's weapon, the gunblade, also made so that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> master. In order to make players understand Squall's silent attitude, Kazushige Nojima made the character's thoughts open to them. Squall's first voiced appearance {{was in the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, voiced by Hideo Ishikawa in Japanese and by David Boreanaz in English; Doug Erholtz has since assumed the role for all other English-speaking appearances.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Sholay {{began as a}} four-line snippet which screenwriter pair Salim-Javed told G. P. Sippy and Ramesh Sippy; two other producer/director teams had earlier {{rejected}} the idea. Ramesh Sippy liked the concept and hired them to develop it. The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge {{the murder of his}} family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|The smash {{success of}} Docter's 2009 film Up {{encouraged}} those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film {{with a more}} sophisticated story. Inside Out is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer John Lasseter, who was focused on restructuring Walt Disney Animation Studios in Los Angeles {{at the time of}} its production. Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making Inside Out, but acknowledged <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> market.|$|E

5|$|The BDF and its {{superior}} headquarters, the Seventh Area Army, initially disagreed {{over where}} the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade should be deployed. In July 1944 the BDF {{believed that the}} Allies were likely to invade northern Borneo in January 1945 or later, and wanted to station the brigade in this area. However, the Seventh Area Army judged that Allied forces {{were more likely to}} attack the Brunei Bay region in western Borneo to support a drive on Singapore. Moreover, the area army believed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> transfer units from northern to western Borneo due to the island's rugged terrain. The BDF eventually won the debate, and the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade's units were landed in the Sandakan area of north-east Borneo as they arrived from Japan.|$|E
5|$|The entire park {{is within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, who was accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to raise this argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his specific agreement not to raise the issue in his appeal.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making {{it more likely that}} the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E

5|$|Soult {{was in a}} dilemma. He {{could not}} defend both the {{important}} southwestern port of Bordeaux and Toulouse. He decided that trying to hold Bordeaux would put the Garonne Estuary at his back and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> obtain food in that area. Therefore, the French marshal determined to operate to the east {{in the direction of}} Toulouse. On 2 March, the Allies clashed with the French at Aire-sur-l'Adour in a combat that cost the French about 250 men killed and wounded, including 12 officers, and 100 captured. Hippolita Da Costa sent his Portuguese brigade to attack a strong position. When it was repulsed with losses of five officers and 100 men, Da Costa failed to rally the soldiers and was replaced in command. British losses were 156 killed and wounded in the 2nd Division. After this action with Hill, Harispe abandoned Aire. Soult withdrew to a position between Maubourguet and Plaisance where his army was left alone for ten days.|$|E
5|$|Tammi Peyton enters AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators {{and plays}} her message machine, which {{contains}} the victim's {{phone call from}} the previous night. She attempts to get into her right desk drawer, when Dwight walks in, and begins harassing her about a message on the machine. She mentions the murder to Dwight, and he responds by asking her to try to get Randall on the phone. Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind what he does, as long as he asks first. Later, Scully and Doggett investigate the Chase residence and find a bullet casing on the floor. Doggett notes that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon family {{traveled}} to Europe in 1963, where Nixon gave press conferences {{and met with}} leaders of the countries he visited. The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander. Nixon had pledged, when announcing his California campaign, not {{to run for president}} in 1964; even if he had not, he believed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> defeat Kennedy, or after his assassination, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson. In 1964, he supported Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination for president; when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination, Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention. Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win, Nixon campaigned for him loyally. The election was a disaster for the Republicans; Goldwater's landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors.|$|E

5|$|The {{route from}} Victoria to Orpington via Herne Hill is {{projected}} to be amongst the most congested and overcrowded in South East London by 2026. Network Rail is considering grade-separating the two lines passing through Herne Hill so that trains would not cross each other's paths at the station's junctions; this restricts the number of services that can pass through the station. A 2008 route utilisation strategy for South London concluded that this improvement will not be required before 2020 but recommended safeguarding the required land. Grade-separation is supported by Southeastern and First Capital Connect believed it should be given more consideration, but Network Rail has stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> carry out the work because the station is on a viaduct and surrounded by buildings. The 2011 route utilisation strategy, which examined options for congestion relief at Herne Hill before 2031, did not suggest grade-separation as an option in the 2011–2031 period.|$|E

25|$|The Drammen Line {{past the}} site of Høvik Station opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872. The area of Jong was at first served by Sandvika Station and from 1873 also by Slependen Station. The need for a station serving Jong was first {{articulated}} during the early 1930s by the manager of Fru Hjorts Pleiehjem, who served 300 patients and 60 employees at the nursing home. The residents' association for Jongåsen joined in on the effort through {{a letter to the}} Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in April 1935. They argued that some passengers taking the bus would switch to the train. They met with NSB' director the following year, without success. NSB responded that this would increase travel time for the trains, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> stop because of the hill and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> fit into the schedule.|$|E
