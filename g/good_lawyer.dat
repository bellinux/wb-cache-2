500|$|At first a weak Federalist, Lincoln {{became more}} closely {{associated}} with the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party. He repeatedly ran for election to the United States House of Representatives in the 1790s, losing each time to Federalist Dwight Foster. Foster was elected to the Senate in a special election in early 1800, opening his House seat; after a series of special elections (in most of which Lincoln won a plurality but not the required majority of votes), Lincoln was finally elected to the seat in December 1800. His service was brief: on March 5, 1801, President Jefferson appointed him Attorney General, an office he held until March 1805. Jefferson's choice of Lincoln was supported by his close advisor and eventual Treasury Secretary, Albert Gallatin, who described Lincoln as [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>lawyer,</b> a fine scholar, a man of great discretion and sound judgment" [...] and a [...] "sound and decided Republican".|$|E

40|$|This essay begins, therefore, by briefly {{examining}} {{the question of}} what constitutes <b>good</b> <b>lawyering.</b> The essay acknowledges the difficulty of defining precisely what is <b>good</b> <b>lawyering.</b> In fact, scholars, judges, and lawyers often disagree markedly when they characterize lawyer behavior using the term. Not surprising, then, even though academic commentators routinely trumpet the importance of establishing a meaningful attorney-client relationship as an important aspect of <b>good</b> <b>lawyering,</b> not all in the legal profession embrace that view. 8 Indeed, the debate about the importance of a good lawyer-client relationship largely reflects contrasting attitudes within the legal profession about the client 2 ̆ 7 s role in the lawyer-client decision-making process. After briefly discussing the differing orientations toward lawyer-client decision-making, the essay next looks at some of the lawyer-client relationships and a number of the lawyer-client interactions depicted in the book to analyze {{the extent to which the}} lawyers portrayed in Damages engaged in <b>good</b> <b>lawyering.</b> The essay concludes by highlighting some of the lessons about lawyering revealed by {{examining the}} lawyer-client relationships described in the book...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} how a <b>good</b> <b>lawyering</b> paradigm may nevertheless undermine client empowerment and perpetuate disability, {{it is necessary to}} appreciate the larger ethical debate about client autonomy. This Article will examine two dominant models of <b>good</b> <b>lawyering</b> and explore their implications for client choice and lawyer autonomy, with an emphasis on poverty lawyering. The Article then turns to a discussion of the lawyering experience in juvenile court to illustrate the ways in which dominant visions of the client as dependent, incompetent, and disabled affect not only the role and responsibilities of the attorney for the child but the extension of the right to counsel itself. Lastly, the lessons learned from lawyers for children are proffered to those who propound a civil right to counsel...|$|R
