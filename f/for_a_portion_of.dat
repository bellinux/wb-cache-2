5|$|In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, {{arrived in}} Virginia, having {{traveled}} south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland.

After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony, was sent to England to argue the Virginians' case. This happened to be to Claiborne's private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island.|$|E
