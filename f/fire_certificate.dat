25|$|Following {{several small}} fires in {{chemical}} plants {{and a major}} explosion and fire at the Nypro plant in Flixborough on 1 June 1974, the Government decided to require <b>fire</b> <b>certificates</b> for major chemical and other risks and to give enforcement to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It issued the <b>Fire</b> <b>Certificates</b> (Special Premises) Regulations 1976 (SI 1976/2003), enforced by the HSE on a similar line to the Fire Precautions Act 1971.|$|R

25|$|The Fire Precautions Act had {{relied on}} codes and guides for its implementation, and the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations had changed {{that a little}} by {{introducing}} risk assessment {{as a way of}} complying, but because the requirement for a <b>fire</b> <b>certificate</b> was never repealed, the guides and codes were still used as a prescriptive means of applying the law. The RR (FS) O took this one step further and implemented fully a risk assessment based regime.|$|E
25|$|The Fire Precautions Act 1971 {{came into}} force in 1972, when hotels and {{boarding}} houses {{were the first}} class of premises to be designated.

25|$|Following a fire on 11 May 1985 at the Bradford City {{football}} {{ground in}} which 56 people died a committee {{was set up}} to examine the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

25|$|Licensed {{premises}} (pubs, clubs, cinemas, theatres) were classed {{as providing}} a service, not as shops, {{and so did}} not normally fall within the designated groups in the FPA, so some never needed <b>fire</b> <b>certificates.</b> However, the local authority who issued the licence usually asked the fire brigade to inspect plans and carry out inspections, which led to confusion even by fire safety officers.|$|R
25|$|A {{fire at the}} Eastwood Mills, Keighley, Yorkshire in February 1956, {{in which}} 8 people died, {{resulted}} in the Act being further amended in 1959 giving the fire brigades the power to inspect factories for fire safety.

50|$|The Fire Precautions Act 1971 made {{amendments}} to the Rent Act 1968 and arrangements to amend the Rent (Scotland) Act 1971. Where a dwelling was subject to a controlled or a regulated tenancy and the dwelling was issued with a <b>fire</b> <b>certificate,</b> {{the amount of the}} expenditure (or a proportion of it approved by the county court) incurred in fire precautions work was to be considered as an improvement in an application for a certificate of fair rent. The county court could, upon application, determine an increase in the rent of controlled or regulated tenancies due to the cost of carrying out fire precaution works.|$|E

This required partitioning to be built across previously open galleried landings, fireproofing of many doors and door frames, removal of combustible material, and installation of a fire alarm system. This means that many original features are now hidden behind plasterboard, corridors divided by modern fire doors or internal views seen through wired glass. The scale of this internal alteration can be appreciated by its cost in 1973 of Â£9000, {{the same as the}} average price of a house bought in the UK that year.|$|E

In July 2007 the capacity was raised to 6,553 following an inspection from safety officials, but was reduced back to 4,684 in September after visiting Chesterfield supporters were given too many tickets by mistake. Field Mill's capacity was then increased to 5,457, and in January 2008 further increased to 7,300 for the FA Cup tie against Middlesbrough after a problem with the turnstiles and other issues were resolved.|$|R

Senator Hendersonâs SB250 made this confusing patchwork of regulations a little more manageable for food truck owners. [...] This bill requires food trucks to maintain business licenses and health and <b>fire</b> safety inspection <b>certificates</b> without compromising public safety and right-of-way requirements. It provides more standardization for business license fees and permit fees. It limits the fees beyond the cost of regulation and to require redundant safety inspections. Lastly, it prohibits âPer-dayâ ,âPer-locationâ fees, and regulations specifying that food trucks must maintain a certain distance from a restaurant.|$|R
