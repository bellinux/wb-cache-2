40|$|Thanks. This {{is a very}} Interesting paper. In some 20 {{years of}} {{counseling}} undergraduates {{we went through the}} process of trying to give weight to these things. This little paper formalizes the process! Two comments-I. The biggest question in my experience was what special weight should be given to Freshmen for the imponderable of adjustment to college life. a. finding out how to use study time efficiently. b. establishing criteria for value judgments on ~!Household Production$lf as there were so many activities competing for time. II. In the students judgement of the value of better grades or more courses [...] he must consider his over-all educational ob~ectives. It may well be that a part of the value of part-time work is that it contributes to the ob~ectlves in a large way- so, a new criterion for value of work may be needed to arrive at MPP. Example: work on experimental plots by agronomy major, etc. Dlffmences In regressions for lower and upper classmen are interesting. Lldybe the students who failed to adjust credit load m Lower Div. were the ones who pulled down G. P. A. for group and they are highly represented in the numbers missing at U. Div. level.

40|$|In this paper, I {{discuss whether}} there are some moral diﬀerences between killing and letting die. Based on “the moral equivalence(Rachels) ” or “the moral {{symmetry}} principle(Tooley) ”, Rachels and Tooley {{argue that there is}} no moral diﬀerence between killing and letting die. They thereby conclude that there is no moral diﬀerence between active euthanasia and passive euthanasia, and that active euthanasia is also morally acceptable. I argue two points. First, they give counterexamples for a moral principle “All killings are morally wrong. ” This doesn. t justify individual actions such as giving lethal injection, withholding life support treatment. Their claims <b>don.</b> <b>t</b> support individual actions in actual clinical practices. Second, I argue about a relationship between “the moral symmetry principle” and other moral principles. When we evaluate an action using a moral principle, it is not always the case that “the moral symmetry principle” by itself takes precedence over other moral principles. To support the idea, some additional justiﬁcation is required to “the moral symmetry principle” used in case of euthanasia. Based on these points, I conclude that their attempts to argue for active euthanasia <b>don.</b> <b>t</b> succeed...|$|R
