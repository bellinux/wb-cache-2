40|$|Detection {{of a human}} on {{a bicycle}} is an {{important}} research subject in an advanced safety vehicle driving system to decrease traffic accidents. The Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature has been proposed as useful feature for <b>detecting</b> <b>a</b> standing human in various kinds of background. So, many researchers use currently the HOG feature to <b>detect</b> <b>a</b> human. <b>Detecting</b> <b>a</b> human on a bicycle is more difficult than <b>detecting</b> <b>a</b> standing human, because {{the appearance of a}} bicycle can change dramatically according to viewpoints. In this paper, we propose <b>a</b> method of <b>detecting</b> <b>a</b> human on a bicycle using HOG feature and RealAdaBoost algorithm. When <b>detecting</b> <b>a</b> human on a bicycle, occlusion is a cause of decreasing detection efficiency. Occlusion is a serious problem in car vision research, because there are often occlusion in real transportation environment. In such a case, the proposed method predicts the next position of a human on a bicycle using a tracking strategy. Experimental results and their evaluation show satisfactory performance of the proposed method...|$|R

Their peak normal optical depths are 8.5×10−6 and 5.4×10−6, respectively. The resulting equivalent optical depths are 0.14km and 0.012km. The rings have triangular radial brightness profiles.|$|E
5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is <b>detected,</b> <b>a</b> 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E

5|$|Close to Jupiter, the planet's {{rings and}} small moons absorb high-energy {{particles}} (energy above 10keV) from the radiation belts. This creates noticeable {{gaps in the}} belts' spatial distribution and affects the decimetric synchrotron radiation. In fact, the existence of Jupiter's rings was first hypothesized {{on the basis of}} data from the Pioneer 11 spacecraft, which <b>detected</b> <b>a</b> sharp drop in the number of high-energy ions close to the planet. The planetary magnetic field strongly influences the motion of sub-micrometer ring particles as well, which acquire an electrical charge under the influence of solar ultraviolet radiation. Their behavior {{is similar to that of}} co-rotating ions. The resonant interaction between the co-rotation and the orbital motion is thought to be responsible for the creation of Jupiter's innermost halo ring (located between 1.4 and 1.71RJ), which consists of sub-micrometer particles on highly inclined and eccentric orbits. The particles originate in the main ring; however, when they drift toward Jupiter, their orbits are modified by the strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance located at 1.71RJ, which increases their inclinations and eccentricities. Another 2:1 Lorentz resonance at 1.4Rj defines the inner boundary of the halo ring.|$|E
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{were first}} {{observed}} in the late 1960s by the U.S. Vela satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The United States suspected that the Soviet Union might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 UTC, the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites <b>detected</b> <b>a</b> flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature. Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, led by Ray Klebesadel, filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen bursts and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, {{a team of}} Indian, British and American astronomers {{working in}} Java (Indonesia) and Kavalur (India) claimed that they had <b>detected</b> <b>a</b> thin {{atmosphere}} during an occultation, when it and Jupiter passed {{in front of a}} star. They estimated that the surface pressure was around 0.1 Pa. However, in 1979, Voyager 1 observed an occultation of the star κ Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter, with differing results. The occultation measurements were conducted in the far-ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements made in the visible spectrum. No atmosphere was revealed by the Voyager data. The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be , which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 µPa.
