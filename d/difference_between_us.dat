500|$|At its introduction, The Woman's Bible {{was widely}} criticized in editorials {{and from the}} pulpit. Stanton wrote that [...] "the clergy denounced it {{as the work of}} Satan..." [...] Some were put off just by its prejudicial, sacrilegious title, {{especially}} those who did not take the time to read the book. Others countered the book's more extreme conclusions one by one in public fora such as letters to the editor. One female reader of The New York Times wrote to decry The Woman's Bible for its radical statements that the Trinity was composed of [...] "a Heavenly Mother, Father, and Son", and that prayers should be addressed to an [...] "ideal Heavenly Mother". Mary Seymour Howell, a member of the Revising Committee, wrote to The New York Times in defense of the book, saying that its title could be better understood as [...] "The Woman's Commentary on the Women of the Bible". Stanton countered attacks by women readers, writing [...] "the only <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>us</b> is, we say that these degrading ideas of woman emanated from the brain of man, while the church says that they came from God." ...|$|E

500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court! Sometimes I can see myself living in a castle surrounded by servants. I might even entertain the thought of a handsome prince.....As long as he was gentle and kind...

Not one of them could even spell gallant! // Maurice: A day will come when those boys will look like knights in shining armor to you. // Belle: Never! I won't {{have anything to do with}} them.

Explicit models of cultural differences in conceptions of plan quality are useful for establishing performance metrics for multinational planning teams. This paper discusses the prospects of enabling automatic evaluation of multinational team performance by combining recent advances in cultural modelling with enhanced ontology languages...|$|R
