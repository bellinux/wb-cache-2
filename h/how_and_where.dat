25|$|The {{university}} has traditionally incorporated parts of its {{coat of arms}} into its brandmark. The first brandmark was heavily based on its armorial bearings, following the common university practice of using only the escutcheon and the motto. It is acceptable for a university to use the shield of Arms by itself, or with a motto. A university can choose <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> to display the different elements of its Arms.|$|E
25|$|The final {{government}} regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers {{are required to}} label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product (including the packaging), consumers {{are better able to}} make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient buying power can then choose more environmentally conscious options, prompt producers {{to increase the amount of}} recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> the product can be recycled.|$|E

ECLAC further suggests that the United Nations expand its agenda to work more rigorously with international lending agencies and that they become more inclusive of all nations. Key factors in achieving universal competition is the spread of knowledge at the State level through education, training and technological advancements. Economist Jagdish Bhagwati suggested that programs to help developing countries adjust to the global economy would be beneficial for international economic relations.|$|E

25|$|On July 16, Colonel Prescott {{assembled}} 1200 {{men from}} various regiments and companies, acting on orders from General Artemas Ward, and departed from Cambridge at 9:00 that evening. Putnam had procured the various entrenching tools and materials needed for building the fortifications, had them loaded into wagons, {{and proceeded to}} Charlestown with Prescott. There was some disorganization among the colonial troops, some of them with no commanding officers to lead them, along with disagreement {{among some of the}} officers as to <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> to prepare for battle. After a two-hour meeting at Charlestown Neck, Putnam and Colonel Richard Gridley, an army engineer, had persuaded Prescott to fortify Breeds Hill rather than Bunker Hill as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|The general {{beliefs and}} {{practices}} of Agama Hindu Dharma are a mixture of ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of panca sila. Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> to pray. However, officially, Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognized beliefs that comply with its national ideology. Indonesian school text books describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam. Scholars contest whether these Indonesian government recognized and assigned beliefs reflect the traditional {{beliefs and practices}} of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.|$|E
25|$|Opinions differ {{about exactly}} <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> Combined Action originated, {{but it seems}} to have started in August 1965 as a unit drawn from 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, under LtCol William W. Taylor in the Phu Bai(3/4) area. 3/4’s TAOR {{included}} six villages and an airfield in a ten square mile area. The unit was overextended, and Taylor's executive officer, suggested that they incorporate local militia units into 3/4's operations. Taylor sent the plan to COL E. B. Wheeler, Commanding Officer (CO) of the 4th Marine Regiment, who forwarded it to the III Marine Amphibious Force (IIIMAF) and Fleet Marine Forces Pacific (FMFPAC). Major General Lew Walt and Lieutenant General Victor Krulak, both of whom had fought in the Banana War, saw the potential value and agreed to the proposal. GEN Nguyen Van Chuan, the local Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) CO, gave Walt control of the Vietnamese platoons near Phu Bai.|$|E

25|$|The second {{position}} {{is relatively new}} and was first officially stated by Laurie Corbett and Mike J. Daniels. They represented the opinion that dingoes have changed {{and that it is}} not possible to bring the “pure” dingo back. Furthermore, historical definitions and the protective legislation based on them, have been rendered “obsolete” by anthropogenic environmental change. Thus interbreeding only means that the dingo today exists in a different form than its ancestors - some researchers now use the term evolving dingo. Protection for these dogs should be based on <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> they live, as well as on their cultural and ecological importance, instead of concentrating on precise definitions or concerns about genetic “purity”. This approach was generally agreed to, but also hinted that it would be difficult to prove that a species shapes its environment. Essentially the genetic integrity of the dingo is already lost due to interbreeding; however, the importance of this phenomenon is disputable according to Corbett and Daniels, since the genes come from a domesticated version of the same species.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the capital}} {{investment}} needed to build the railroad was generated by selling government-guaranteed bonds (granted per mile of completed track) to interested investors. The Federal donation of right-of-way saved money and time as {{it did not have}} to be purchased from others. The financial incentives and bonds would hopefully cover most of the initial capital investment needed to build the railroad. The bonds would be paid back by the sale of government-granted land, as well as prospective passenger and freight income. Most of the engineers and surveyors who figured out <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> to build the railroad on the Union Pacific were engineering college trained. Many of Union Pacific engineers and surveyors were Union Army veterans (including two generals) who had learned their railroad trade keeping the trains running and tracks maintained during the U.S. Civil War. After securing the finances and selecting the engineering team, the next step was to hire the key personnel and prospective supervisors. Nearly all key workers and supervisors were hired because they had previous railroad on-the-job training, knew what needed to be done and how to direct workers to get it done. After the key personnel were hired, the semi-skilled jobs could be filled if there was available labor. The engineering team's main job was to tell the workers where to go, what to do, how to do it, and provide the construction material they would need to get it done.|$|E
500|$|Egg {{clutches}} number 8–13 creamy {{white to}} greenish-buff eggs free of speckles. They measure about [...] {{in length and}} [...] in width. The eggs are laid on alternate days, and incubation begins when the clutch is almost complete. Incubation takes 27–28days and fledging takes 50–60days. The ducklings are precocial and fully capable of swimming {{as soon as they}} hatch. However, filial imprinting compels them to instinctively stay near the mother, not only for warmth and protection but also to learn about and remember their habitat as well as <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> to forage for food. When ducklings mature into flight-capable juveniles, they learn about and remember their traditional migratory routes (unless they are born and raised in captivity).|$|E

[...] The judicial review opened on 13 March 2014 and was expected to last two days but the decision was deferred for four to six weeks. Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Justice Ouseley and Justice Haddon-Cave, said the court would take time to consider its judgment. On 23 May the High Court ruled there was [...] "no duty to consult" [...] and [...] "no public law grounds for the court to interfere", so reburial in Leicester could proceed. The litigation cost the defendants £245,000—far more {{than the cost of}} the original investigation.|$|E
500|$|Researchers, {{including}} social scientists, {{state that}} often behavior and identity do not match: women may label themselves heterosexual but {{have sexual relations}} with women, self-identified lesbians may have sex with men, or women may find that what they considered an immutable sexual identity has changed over time. A 2001 article on differentiating lesbians for medical studies and health research suggested identifying lesbians using the three characteristics of identity only, sexual behavior only, or both combined. The article declined to include desire or attraction as it rarely has bearing on measurable health or psychosocial issues. Researchers state that there is no standard definition of lesbian because [...] "he term has been used to describe women who have sex with women, either exclusively or in addition to sex with men (i.e., behavior); women who self-identify as lesbian (i.e., identity); and women whose sexual preference is for women (i.e., desire or attraction)" [...] and that [...] "he lack of a standard definition of lesbian and of standard questions to assess who is lesbian has made it difficult to clearly define a population of lesbian women". <b>How</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> study samples were obtained can also affect the definition.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, Giovanola {{underwent}} {{a change of}} management; Bolliger & Mabillard decided to leave, and founded their own company. At the time, B employed four people; two draftsmen, Bolliger, and Mabillard. When B was created, the pair had agreed not to make any more amusement attractions. However, Six Flags contacted the new company and asked it to build a roller coaster. B accepted the offer and hired two more draftsmen. But B had a problem regarding <b>how</b> <b>and</b> <b>where</b> to manufacture the track pieces for the roller coaster. With the impression of the work done by Clermont Steel Fabricators on Vortex at Kings Island and Shockwave Six Flags Great America, Walter Bolliger went to the steel plant {{and asked if they}} would be interested in manufacturing the track. Clermont Steel Fabricators accepted and currently manufactures all Bolliger and Mabillard roller coaster track pieces for all of North America. Now with a company to manufacture the track, B built its first roller coaster, a stand-up roller coaster, Iron Wolf, which opened in 1990 at Six Flags Great America. Two years later, [...] Bolliger & Mabillard built another project for Six Flags Great America, , the world's first inverted roller coaster, which brought them to prominence in the industry.|$|E
