25|$|Marshall used Federalist {{approaches}} {{to build a}} strong federal government over the opposition of the Jeffersonian Republicans, who wanted stronger state governments. His influential rulings reshaped American government, making the Supreme Court the final arbiter of constitutional interpretation. The Marshall Court struck down an act of Congress in only one case (Marbury v. Madison in 1803) but that established the Court as a center of power that could overrule the Congress, the President, the states, and all lower courts <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> a fair reading of the Constitution required. He also defended the legal rights of corporations by tying them to the individual rights of the stockholders, thereby ensuring that corporations have {{the same level of}} protection for their property as individuals had, and shielding corporations against intrusive state governments.|$|E

500|$|The House of Lords {{agreed with}} ex parte Kynoch in British Oxygen Co. Ltd. v Minister of Technology (1970). The {{court held that}} there was nothing to stop the Minister from {{requiring}} the operation of some limiting rule <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> policy or good administration requires. It also reiterated that for discretion to be unfettered, consideration must be given to exceptional cases. [...] "What the authority must not do is to refuse to listen at all. There can be no objection to , provided the authority is always willing to listen to anyone with something new to say." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1983, ABC {{announced}} that Jennings {{had signed a}} four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> it comes down to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hippolytus condemns the obscurity of it. He cannot accuse Heraclitus {{of being}} a heretic so he says instead: [...] "Did not (Heraclitus) the Obscure {{anticipate}} Noetus in framing a system ...?" [...] The apparent pantheist deity of Heraclitus (<b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> DK B67 means) must be equal to the union of opposites and therefore must be corporeal and incorporeal, divine and not-divine, dead and alive, etc., and the Trinity can only be reached by some sort of illusory shape-shifting.|$|E

50|$|It may <b>be</b> argued <b>that,</b> {{of all of}} {{the battles}} in the Pacific War, Samar best {{demonstrates}} the effectiveness of air attack and destroyer-launched torpedoes against larger surface vessels. Cautious Japanese tactics were hampered by the belief they were fighting a much more powerful force. Conversely, the Americans accurately sensed the gravity of their predicament, and quickly improvised a strategy based on harassment and delay which did not hesitate to throw inadequately armed planes and ships directly against battleships <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> available.|$|R
2500|$|Race {{relations}} {{continue to}} be a vexing issue in Bermuda, occasionally leading to heated exchanges with the press and the opposition UBP in Parliament. Brown rejected inappropriate questions as [...] "plantation questions". He later explained, [...] "A plantation question is for me a question which conjures up images of the plantation: of a master-servant relationship, a man-boy relationship. A question that would be asked of a black politician and not a white one. [...] I will continue to indicate to reporters <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> a question is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sturgeon {{met with}} new UK Prime Minister Theresa May in Edinburgh on 15 July 2016 after the latter {{had made it}} clear that UK unity was a high priority. Afterwards, Sturgeon said that [...] "It would be inconceivable for any prime {{minister}} to seek to {{stand in the way of}} a referendum <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the Scottish Parliament voted for ... if there's a clear sense that that's what people in Scotland want, would be completely the wrong thing to do." [...] She added a conciliatory note, however in her assessment of May: [...] "She's a woman who has a fairly businesslike way of doing things, which I have too. So I think we can find a way of working together, notwithstanding those disagreements." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Indus script (also {{known as}} the Harappan script) is a corpus of symbols {{produced}} by the Indus Valley Civilization during the Kot Diji and Mature Harappan periods between 3500 and 1900 BCE. Most inscriptions containing these symbols are extremely short, {{making it difficult to}} judge whether or not [...] these symbols constituted a script used to record a language, or even symbolise a writing system. [...] In spite of many attempts, 'the script' has not yet been deciphered, but efforts are ongoing. There is no known bilingual inscription to help decipher the script, nor does the script show any significant changes over time. [...] However, some of the syntax (<b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> it may be termed) varies depending upon location.|$|E
6000|$|Fan, {{reddening}} {{a little}} at being laughed at, returned somewhat defiantly, [...] "He was comparing you to me--to your advantage, of course--and said that I {{had no sense of}} humour. I answered <b>that</b> you <b>were</b> always mocking at something, and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he meant by a sense of humour, I was very pleased to be without it." ...|$|R

2500|$|In February 2014, Wurzelbacher {{took a job}} at a Jeep plant which {{required}} him {{to be a member of}} the United Auto Workers. He complained that his colleagues have called him a [...] "Tea-bagger". The Washington Post, citing Sean McAlinden, who has studied the auto-bailout as the Chief Economist for the non-profit Center for Automotive Research, commented that an [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "that Joe the Plumber may not have gotten this auto job if it weren’t for the hated bailout of the auto industry" [...] which was [...] "first championed by Bush" [...] but attacked by conservatives when implemented by Obama. McAliden is quoted saying “He wouldn’t have gotten a job in Toledo if Chrysler hadn’t been bailed out..Chrysler would have shut down immediately. No production; no jobs; no pension payments; no nothing." [...] For his part, Joe indicated he has no problem with unions per se, stating [...] "Private unions, such as the UAW, is a choice between employees and employers. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they want, then who am I to say you can’t have it?".|$|E

60|$|He {{knew that}} some of the boys had broken training, and he pondered <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> caused the drag Worry mentioned.

It must be perfectly smooth. And to make it so every player must be of one mind.|$|R
50|$|Charles FitzRoy, the {{recorder}} of Coventry was particularly dissatisfied with his son's behavior. For instance, one of George's tenants, {{a father of}} six children, killed himself {{after he had been}} pressed to pay more than his rent. The tenant stated that he had paid the full rent owed, but {{would be willing to pay}} extra <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> needed, to which George threatened to have the man's family removed from his residence.

50|$|Seven village councils, {{as well as}} {{the districts}} of Dobropillia Raion and Krasnoarmiisk Raion in Donetsk Oblast {{requested}} accession to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.
