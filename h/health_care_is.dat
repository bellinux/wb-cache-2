5|$|The {{quality of}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only}} one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.

Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there.

Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo.
