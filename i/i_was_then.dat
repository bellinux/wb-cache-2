Alexander is not Gladiator." [...] In response, Sean Penn rebutted Rock's remarks praising Law {{as one of his}} generation's [...] "finest actors". Over a year later, Law {{expressed}} his anger toward Rock in The New York Times telling columnist Craig Modderno, [...] "At first I laughed because I didn't think he knew who <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>Then</b> I got angry as his remarks became personal.

500|$|With the Station to Station {{sessions}} {{completed in}} December 1975, Bowie started {{work on a}} soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth with Paul Buckmaster as his collaborator. Bowie expected to be wholly responsible for the film's music but found that [...] "when I'd finished five or six pieces, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> told that if I would care to submit my music along with some other people's... and I just said [...] "Shit, you're not getting any of it". I was so furious, I'd put so much work into it." [...] Notwithstanding, Harry Maslin argued that Bowie was [...] "burned out" [...] and could not complete the work in any case. The singer eventually collapsed, admitting later, [...] "There were pieces of me laying all over the floor". In the event, only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack saw the light of day, evolving into [...] "Subterraneans" [...] on his next studio album, Low.|$|E

500|$|By 286 BC, Lysimachus {{was able}} to expel Pyrrhus and his forces from Macedonia altogether, yet in 282 BC, a new war erupted between Lysimachus and Seleucus I. The {{conflict}} {{came to a head}} at the Battle of Corupedion where Lysimachus was killed, allowing Seleucus I to claim both Thrace and Macedonia. In yet another reversal of fortunes, Seleucus <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> assassinated in 281 BC by his officer Ptolemy Keraunos, son of Ptolemy I and grandson of Antipater, who was then proclaimed king of Macedonia. There was little respite from the political chaos in Macedonia, though, since Ptolemy Keraunos was killed in battle in 279 BC by Celtic invaders in the Gallic invasion of Greece. The Macedonian army proclaimed the general Sosthenes of Macedon as king, although he apparently refused the title. After defeating the Gallic ruler Bolgios and driving out the raiding party of Brennus, Sosthenes died and left a chaotic situation in Macedonia. The Gallic warbands ravaged Macedonia until the arrival of Antigonus Gonatas, son of Demetrius, who defeated them in Thrace at the Battle of Lysimachia in 277 BC. He was then proclaimed king Antigonus II of Macedon (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>then,</b> so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "if you have a closet full of clothes {{and you try to}} keep them all, your life will get very small. But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like, if you give it to them, the world is a better place." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E

2500|$|In early 2001 All Saints broke up, and Lewis later {{explained}} that the catalyst for the break-up was a disagreement over who would wear a certain jacket for a photoshoot: [...] "I would never {{in a million years}} have put money on the group ending over a jacket incident.

Late that night the Confederates pulled back to their new position. Beauregard expressed his frustration with the lack of support or concern from Robert E. Lee, writing years after the war, [...] "The Army of Northern Virginia was yet far distant, and I had failed to convince its distinguished commander of the fact that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> fighting Grant's whole army with less than eleven thousand men." [...] Lee had systematically ignored all of Beauregard's pleas and it was not until his own son, cavalry Maj. Gen. W.H.F.

2500|$|In July 1868 the Ottoman {{government}} further banished Bahá'u'lláh and {{his family}} to the prison-city of Acre, then part of the Syrian segment of the Ottoman Empire. As a young woman of twenty-one, Bahíyyih Khánum entered into Acre as a prisoner. This was her fourth place of exile, and her last. Despite her beauty and suitors — she was still determined to remain unmarried, and her father seemed to have advocated this. She was later respected for her choice. When arrived on the bay of Acre, the exiles were disorientated and demoralized. The populace spoke Arabic, which Bahíyyih Khánum understood, and she overheard them mocking and jeering how the family were to be thrown into the sea or imprisoned in chains. She later explained the impact this had on her: [...] "imagine, if you can, the overpowering impression made by all this upon {{the mind of a}} young girl, such as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>then.</b> Can you wonder that I am serious, and that my life is different from those of my countrywomen?".|$|E

Tebbit later said: [...] "I don't think my reaction was extreme at all. I placed my hand on the drum so I could diminish the noise and asked the drummer what was going on and got a rap on the knuckles for my pain. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> barged by the dragon. I barged it back and might have done something like kick it. I wasn't sure how to deal with it. I've never been barged by a dragon before".

As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited {{him to stay in}} his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: [...] "Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>then,</b> you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that.
