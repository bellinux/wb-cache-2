5|$|Do I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> endured post-partum depression? Absolutely. But to {{deny the}} {{experience}} is to deny who I am. I still mourn the loss of what could have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} time I ever swung wood full time. I was {{learning}} how to play pro ball. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> played every day in my life. That's totally different.... You {{have to learn to}} conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|E
5|$|McDowell's {{statement}} of admission {{was published in}} David McKittrick's book Lost Lives:"There was very little planning. I only came into it because of my UDR connection {{and the fact that}} I had a uniform. I was given a sub-machine gun but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> fired it. I passed out when the explosion happened and that was when I lost the gun, the glasses, and a UDR beret".|$|E

25|$|Evans {{began her}} life as an activist by {{organizing}} demonstrations at Michigan State University during 1965. In 1967 Evans {{became a member of}} the East Coast chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). She stated that she became interested in the civil rights movement after getting attacked by police during a demonstration at the Pentagon. “When I first became a political activist, I was a pacifist. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> experience real violence in my own life and naively hoped that it changed.” Evans demonstrated her interest in anti-racism movements by supporting various groups championing Black, Native and Puerto Rican liberation causes.|$|E
25|$|The {{primitive}} southern Negro, as he sang, {{was sure}} to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, {{it was always the}} same. Till then, however, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major..., and I carried this device into my melody as well... This was a distinct departure, but as it turned out, it touched the spot.|$|E
25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling him that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

500|$|Nichols {{had done}} {{commercial}} work {{and had a}} bit part as a model in the romantic drama film Autumn in New York (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of Sex and the City (2002). She later said she had [...] "never really done a proper audition before", and added that [...] "I had such fun , that day actually {{made me want to}} pursue [...] more seriously." [...] Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in [...] (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, [...] "I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [...] and freely admitted that I {{had no idea what was}} going on. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> done a big film before, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take."

The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me.
