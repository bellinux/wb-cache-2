5000|$|The <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> of the 004 {{featured}} a variable geometry nozzle, {{which had a}} special restrictive body nicknamed the Zwiebel (German for onion, due to its shape when seen from the side) which had roughly 40 cm (16 inch) of fore-and-aft travel, moved by an electric-motor powered jackscrew mechanism to vary the jet exhaust's cross-sectional area for thrust control, as the active part of a pioneering [...] "divergent-convergent" [...] nozzle format.|$|E
5000|$|Fitting of the GT 101 in the Panther hull {{took some}} design effort, but {{eventually}} a suitable arrangement was found. The engine exhaust was {{fitted with a}} large divergent diffuser to lower the exhaust velocity and temperature, which also allowed for a larger third turbine stage. The entire <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> extended out of {{the rear of the}} engine compartment into [...] "free air", which made it extremely vulnerable to enemy fire, and it was realized this was not practical for a production system.|$|E

Pellet stoves can be either free standing units or fireplace inserts vented into an existing chimney.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{influence}} on performances, specially on fuel consumption, {{of the effect of}} varying <b>exhaust</b> nozzles <b>areas</b> and specific work of the fan in two-spools turbofan engines is carried out. The study is conducted by means of an approximated method, essentially based on substituting the performances maps of compressors, fan and turbines by means of approximated analytical expressions. The approximation given by the method is verified by comparing results with those theor£ tically obtained without simplifications and with actual data obtained from air data computer measurements carried out in flight resulting in both cases excellent approximations. Final results show that modest but significant reduction in fuel consumption may be obtained by varying the <b>exhaust</b> <b>areas</b> and specific work of the fan, which couples with important reductions in turbine inlet temperature. All this might be of special interest for large turbofan engines specially designed for short range aircraft...|$|R

When there is insufficient clearance in attic <b>exhaust</b> <b>areas,</b> the whole house fan can be installed to exhaust directly outside through the wall. Maximum benefit is obtained when the fan exhausts through the attic because it cools both the attic and the occupants. This differs from attic fans which are designed to cool the attic only and are not cost effective if the attic is well insulated. (See Figur...|$|R

Even at the best efficiency point, the {{internal flow}} in the pump of circular casing is asymmetric. The flow goes out from the impeller only at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> of the casing. Also, there is a very strong unsteady flow near this area...|$|E

Variation in stator-exit angle and <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> was not excessive for wide ranges of engine output. Variation in turbine efficiency for contemporary turbines equipped with adjustable stators was small. Improvements from 4. 5 to 17 percent in over-all engine specific fuel consumption over conventional engines and from 2 to 8. 5 percent over engines equipped with only adjustable-area exhaust nozzles were obtained at 60 -percent rated power with adjustable-stator turbines and variable-area exhaust nozzles. The improvements depend on design parameters...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of turbojet engine with variable <b>exhaust</b> nozzle <b>area</b> were investigated over {{a range of}} altitudes and flight Mach numbers. These characteristics generalize to standard static level condition. Data resulting from approximate step disturbances in either manipulated variable suggested functional relationships from which functions can be derived. The constants of the transfer functions are listed for five combinations of engine speed and <b>exhaust</b> nozzle <b>area.</b> The minimum data needed to completely define the transfer functions were: experimentally determined {{dynamic characteristics}}, such as engine time constant and initial rise ratio, resulting from either manipulated variable; static characteristics determined from steady-state performance curves...|$|R

Aiming at the practical problems such as the large workload but inaccurate data of the traditional loss and dilution calculation method, this thesis introduces the operating principle and process of calculating the loss rate and dilution rate at the mining fields by adopting geological models. As an example, authors establishes 3 D models of orebody units in the <b>exhausted</b> <b>area</b> and mining fields in Yangshu Gold Mine in Liaoning Province, and conduct Boolean calculation among the models to obtain the calculation parameters of loss and dilution, and thereby calculate out the dilution rate and loss rate of the mining fields more quickly and accurately...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics of airframe-integrated {{scramjet}} (AIS) aerospacecraft are studied using {{elementary and}} a recently developed AIS analysis code. Of principal {{interest is the}} definition of the AIS and what concepts offer the most potential. One of the concepts is selected for a limited optimization study aimed at defining the relationship of <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> to performance potential. The study shows that, if the AIS vehicle is to be fully constrained within the 'optimum' flowpath envelope, large values of exhaust-area-to-capture-area ratio are desired. A benefit of this choice is that performance at the very highest airbreather speeds is improved and, thus, may delay the need to switch to rocket power...|$|E

The geometrical configurations consisted of nozzles with coplanar and non-coplanar exit planes and various <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> ratios. Primary and secondary nozzle flows were varied independently over a range of nozzle pressure ratios from 1. 4 to 3. 0 and gas temperatures from 280 to 1100 K. Acoustic data are presented for the conventional mode of coaxial nozzle operation {{as well as for}} the inverted velocity profile mode. Comparisons are presented to show the effect of configuration and flow changes on the acoustic characteristics of the nozzles...|$|E
40|$|The {{particle}} simulations in a Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) currently include self-consistent calculation of. 1) stationary {{magnetic field}} in plasma, 2) ion density and velocity, 3) ion-cyclotron radio-frequency heating, 4) ambipolar electric field. The assumptions of quasineutral and collissionless plasma {{are based on}} the range of operating VASIMR parameters. The main motivation for the particle simulation in VASIMR is plasma detachment from the magnetic field in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>area.</b> The plasma detachment is caused mainly by the Larmor radius increase. The plasma beta effect on detachment is observed and investigated as well. The results of particle simulations are compared with those from MHD simulations...|$|E

40|$|Consideration of {{the various}} factors which {{determine}} the performance of supersonic aircraft and missiles utilizing air-breathing power plants has clearly indicated a critical necessity for optimizing the propulsion system-airframe relationship. Studies of this relationship demonstrate the dominant effects of the required intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>areas</b> in establishing the airframe configuration for high Mach number cruising flight. In the flight Mach number range from 2. 5 to 5 0, it is mandatory to consider the power plant as an inte-gral part of the aircraft {{from the standpoint of}} vehicle lift and drag and balance and, in addition, to give careful attention to preserving the maximum possible intake efficiency. This proposal deals with an integrated ramjet- lifting surface combination which is intended to optimize the power plant- airframe relationship mentioned above, The essential features of the system are: (a) A variable configuration diffuser (b) A constant diffuser throat area and Mach numbe...|$|R
40|$|An {{empirical}} model for predicting {{the noise from}} inverted-velocity-profile coaxial or coannular jets is presented and compared with small-scale static and simulated flight data. The model considered the combined contributions {{of as many as}} four uncorrelated constituent sources: the premerged-jet/ambient mixing region, the merged-jet/ambient mixing region, outer-stream shock/turbulence interaction, and inner-stream shock/turbulence interaction. The noise from the merged region occurs at relatively low frequency and is modeled as the contribution of a circular jet at merged conditions and total <b>exhaust</b> <b>area,</b> with the high frequencies attenuated. The noise from the premerged region occurs at high frequency and is modeled as the contribution of an equivalent plug nozzle at outer stream conditions, with the low frequencies attenuated...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of two externally blown flap (EBF) wind tunnel models was {{compared with an}} engine exhaust flap impingement correlation parameter. One model was a four engine EBF triple slotted flap transport. Isolated engine wake surveys were conducted to define the wake properties of five separate engine configurations for which performance data were available. The other model was a two engine EBF transport for which the engine wake properties were estimated. The correlation parameter was a function of engine exhaust dynamic pressure at the flap location, area of engine exhaust flap impingement, total <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> at the flap location, and engine thrust. The distribution of dynamic pressure for the first model was measured; however, the distribution for the second model {{was assumed to be}} uniform...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} of the capture efficiency of pollutants by the slot reinforced exhaust system situated in two positions over the workbench. The slot reinforced exhaust system, which is known as REEXS, is the traditional slot exhaust hood equipped with an air supply inlet that intensifies exhausting along the axis of the exhaust hood. It can operate in traditional or reinforced exhaust modes. Measurements were made for the same air velocity in the suction slot and with the different momentum flux ratio of supplied and exhausted air flow. The tracer gas method {{was used for the}} capture efficiency measurement of the system. As the tracer gas the carbon dioxide was chosen. The knowledge of the shape and range of the effective <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> for various configurations in front of the exhaust hood is important for the exhaust hood setting according to a source of pollutants...|$|E
40|$|A {{scale model}} (0. 484 scale factor) {{of a single}} stage fan {{designed}} for a 1. 5 pressure ratio and 1160 ft/sec tip speed was tested to determine its noise characteristics.

40|$|Advanced thermal {{protection}} materials envisioned {{for use on}} future hypersonic vehicles will likely be subjected to temperatures in excess of 1811 K (2800 F) and, therefore, will require the rapid conduction of heat away from the stagnation regions of wing leading edges, the nose cap area, and from engine inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>areas.</b> Carbon-carbon composite materials are candidates for use in advanced {{thermal protection}} systems. For design purposes, high temperature thermophysical property data are required, but {{a search of the}} literature found little thermal conductivity data for carbon-carbon materials above 1255 K (1800 F). Because a need was recognized for in-plane and through-the-thickness thermal conductivity data for carbon-carbon composite materials over a wide temperature range, Langley Research Center (LaRC) embarked on an effort to compile a consistent set of thermal conductivity values from room temperature to 1922 K (3000 F) for carbon-carbon composite materials on hand at LaRC for which the precursor materials and thermal processing history were known. This report documents the thermal conductivity data generated for these materials. In-plane thermal conductivity values range from 10 to 233 W/m-K, whereas through-the-thickness values range from 2 to 21 W/m-K...|$|R

By the mid-1990s, with the {{proliferation}} of fax machines, mobile phones, computers, and pagers in the region, the 809 area code was almost <b>exhausted.</b> New <b>area</b> codes were added, and since 1999 no two territories share a code. 809 is now used only in the Dominican Republic.|$|R
40|$|Positive {{pressure}} ventilation was investigated. Forty-three {{experiments were}} performed on the first, second, and third floors of a three-storey brick building with wooden trusses. The objectives of the experiments were to investigate the effects of distance between fan and inlet, size and numbers of outlets, and volume of building on vent flow rates when using positive pressure ventilation. Four different fans from two different manufacturers with varying characteristics were used. Airflow through outlets was measured. The results shows that flow rate through an exhaust increases with increasing distance between fan and inlet up to some maximum value and a decreasing flow rate after this point. Also, flow rate through an exhaust decreases as volume of the structure increases. In a larger volume more leakage can be expected, thus decreasing the efficiency of positive pressure ventilation. In addition, increasing the <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> decreases the flow loss, thus increasing the efficiency of positive pressure ventilation. The number of exhaust openings affects the volumetric flow rate in a nonlinear manner...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{detecting}} gas turbines malfunctions through engine emissions concentration plots is presented. The method is materialized {{through the use}} of a bank of Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs). The main idea comes from the fact that specific operating and health conditions of an engine lead to specific concentrations of emissions on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>area.</b> By comparison of an emission concentration plot with emission plots of known engine health conditions, diagnostic conclusions can be extracted. The stochastic nature of emission concentrations can be handled by PNNs, a specific type of Artificial Neural Networks which are known to be efficient probabilistic classifiers. The diagnostic problem and the overall diagnostic procedure are first described. A detailed description of the way the diagnostic procedure is set-up, with focus on building the PNNs, follows. The case of an operating family of turbofan engines is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The examined case demonstrates that the proposed method can act as an additional tool on the existing methods for better and safer fault diagnosis. Copyright © 2007 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the Divertor Tokamak Test {{facility}} (DTT) is to explore alternative power exhaust solu- tions for DEMO. The principal objective is to mitigate {{the risk of a}} difficult extrapolation to fusion reactor of the conventional divertor based on detached conditions under test on ITER. The task includes several issues, as: (i) demonstrating a heat exhaust system capable of withstanding the large load of DEMO in case of inadequate radiated power fraction; (ii) closing the gaps in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> that cannot be ad- dressed by present devices; (iii) demonstrating how the possible implemented solutions (e. g., advanced divertor configurations or liquid metals) can be integrated in a DEMO device. In view of these goals, the basic physical DTT parameters have been selected according to the follow- ing guidelines: (i) edge conditions {{as close as possible to}} DEMO in terms of dimensionless parameters; (ii) flexibility to test a wide set of divertor concepts and techniques; (iii) compatibility with bulk plasma performance; (iv) an upper bound of 500 M€ for the investment costs...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} work by {{consultants to}} Diversitech Inc. for the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) {{to revise the}} fan noise prediction procedure based on fan noise data obtained in the 9 - by 15 Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel at GRC. The purpose of this task is to begin development of an enhanced, analytical, more physics-based, fan noise prediction method applicable to commercial turbofan propulsion systems. The method is to be suitable for programming into a computational model for eventual incorporation into NASA's current aircraft system noise prediction computer codes. The scope of this task is in alignment with {{the mission of the}} Propulsion 21 research effort conducted by the coalition of NASA, state government, industry, and academia to develop aeropropulsion technologies. A model for fan noise prediction was developed based on measured noise levels for the R 4 rotor with several outlet guide vane variations and three fan <b>exhaust</b> <b>areas.</b> The model predicts the complete fan noise spectrum, including broadband noise, tones, and for supersonic tip speeds, combination tones.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to determine {{the performance of a}} hydrogen burner used to produce a test gas that simulates air entering a scramjet combustor at various flight conditions. The test gas simulates air in that it duplicates the total temperature, total pressure, and the volume fraction of oxygen of air at flight conditions. The main objective of the tests was to determine the performance of the burner {{as a function of the}} effective <b>exhaust</b> port <b>area.</b> The conclusions were: (1) pressure oscillations of the chugging type were reduced in amplitude to plus or minus 2 percent of the mean pressure level by proper sizing of hydrogen, oxygen, and air injector flow areas; (2) combustion efficiency remained essentially constant as the <b>exhaust</b> port <b>area</b> was increased by a factor of 3. 4; (3) the mean total temperature determined from integrating the exit radial gas property profiles was within plus or minus 5 percent of the theoretical bulk total temperature; (4) the measured exit total temperature profile had a local peak temperature more than 30 percent greater than the theoretical bulk total temperature; and (5) measured heat transfer to the burner liner was 75 percent of that predicted by theory based on a flat radial temperature profile...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{multi-mode}} {{implementation of}} pulsed detonation engines is investigated in this paper. The various modes in this proposed concept are (as illustrated in Fig. [1]) : (1) An ejector augmented pulse detonation rocket for take off to moderate supersonic Mach numbers (2) A pulsed normal detonation wave mode at combustion chamber Mach numbers {{less than the}} Chapman-Jouguet Mach number, (3) An oblique detonation wave mode of operation for Mach numbers in the airbreathing regime that are higher than the Chapman-Jouguet Mach number, and (4) A pure Pulsed Detonation Rocket (PDR) mode of operation at high altitude. These various modes utilize a single flow path, in which an array of detonation tubes is placed. From present considerations, 10 tubes will be placed across {{the width of the}} engine, which fire sequentially in such a manner as to make the maximum use of the incoming air mass and provide the smoothest possible operation of the device. These tubes could alternately be arranged as load bearing struts that are embedded with rocket chambers. The advantage of such a mode is that a larger <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> is available for these tubes when operating in the rocket mode and mixing properties are enhanced in the other modes when these tubes are used for fuel injection alone...|$|E
40|$|Wire bonding {{is still}} the {{dominating}} technology for realizing the first level contact of semiconductors. In the last decades miniaturization and increasing connection density resulted in new challenges in terms of reliability and long term stability. But now additionally the movement towards harsher application environments leads to new problems in automotive applications (also e-mobility) {{as well as in}} power applications for regenerative energy systems (solar, offshore, geothermal etc.). For example higher temperatures occur in the manufacturing process due to lead free soldering, in automotive applications close to the engine or in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> and in tracking systems of solar panels. Furthermore aggressive media like oily or salty atmosphere and moisture are a strain on the contact stability. Corrosion effects in especially Au/Al and Al/Cu wire bond interfaces are the interaction result of temperature, moisture, aggressive media and different electrical or electrochemical potentials. The paper presents {{the first step in a}} substantial investigation with the goal to get profound knowledge about the influencing factors for corrosive interface degradation in wire bond contacts. We tried to reproduce the corrosion mechanisms with different halides (e. g. iodine, fluorine, bromine) which are known as corrosion initiator. The halides concentrations were varied as well as the thermal aging conditions (e. g. high temperature storage, damp heat test, thermo cycling, biased high temperature storage). The interface morphology and micro structure of the samples were analysed after focused ion beam preparation (FIB) using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmissions electron microscopy (TEM) including energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} {{computer equipment}} rack-level cooling device with two heat exchangers was demonstrated to illustrate an energy efficient cooling capability. This unique device {{was designed and}} constructed by APC by Schneider Electric to operate with higher-temperature cooling water, {{so that it can}} support many more hours of free cooling compared to traditional systems that utilize chilled water. The cooling system contained two separate air-to-water heat exchangers, rather than one usually found in similar devices that operate using chilled water. In this design, one heat exchanger was configured to use higher temperature water produced by a cooling tower alone. The other coil was configured and controlled to allow chilled water flow, should supplemental cooling be required. The device also contained three fans, which were used to pull warm air from the computer equipment <b>exhaust</b> <b>area</b> through the two heat exchangers and return the cooled air to the air intake area of the computer equipment. A model of the heat exchangers performance was developed and used with an industry standard energy-efficiency metric to explore the device's capabilities and efficiency The device effectively cooled the warm air from the exhaust of the computer equipment and had favorable energy use efficiency and capability when compared to other similar equipment. In this analysis, the concept of using two heat exchangers in the intended configuration is more energy efficient, compared to typical designs using a single heat exchanger. The high cooling performance of this device is able to meet cooling requirements while using higher-temperature water, thereby reducing energy needed for compressor-based cooling. Results suggest that the development of a production version be continued using the design concepts of this prototype...|$|E
