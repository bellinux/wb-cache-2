5000|$|The {{most common}} Mechanical Presses use an {{eccentric}} drive {{to move the}} press's ram slide, length of stroke or slide travel depends on the crankshaft or eccentric, whereas hydraulic cylinders are used in hydraulic presses. The nature of drive system determines the force progression during the ram's stroke. Mechanical presses have a full tonnage rating point above BDC / Bottom Dead Center, normal full tonnage rating points are [...]187", [...]25" [...] & [...]5". Hence a mechanical press has a tonnage curve and should be operated within the press capacity limits. Link Motion mechanical is yet another option, this provides a slide slow down near BDC / bottom dead center for soft touch tooling. This link feature can improve die life and reduce reverse-snap thru tonnage <b>for</b> <b>blanking</b> operations.|$|E

Based on theory of the rigid FEM, the geometry model used <b>for</b> <b>blanking</b> with a negative clearance was established. The facts of influence {{the quality of the}} blanking work pieces were analyzed and concluded, at the same time, the parameters were indicated {{to improve the quality of}} the blanking work pieces. Through the experiment, the blanking load was measured with different clearance, thickness and material in group. The reciprocity between these facts was analyzed and the clearance was optimized. After the blanking load was regress analysis, the coefficient of the load and these facts were researched. Using quality analysis of the work pieces in the experiment, the thickness and the material were obtained which were suitable <b>for</b> <b>blanking</b> of metal plastic without burr. The reactions which were used to separate the metal were studied, which offered thereunder for proper remaining based on the better quality and smaller blanking load...|$|E

As the optimized threshold is determined {{according to the}} peak, mean, and median of the signal, it gives better results and better system performance regardless of the probability of impulsive noise occurrence.

Furthermore, an automated spatially varying offset of the hole boundary from the minimum hole is achieved using a dual wall-distance function and an orphan point removal iteration process.

30|$|Impulsive noise (IN) degrades the {{performance}} of OFDM-based communication systems. Performance degradation is usually {{measured in terms of}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and symbol-error rate (SER). To improve {{the performance}} of the system of OFDM receivers, one of the effective methods is to use blanking nonlinearity. In this method, the samples whose magnitudes exceed a certain fixed threshold are considered to be IN-affected and are therefore blanked. A fixed threshold does not always determine the IN-affected samples truly for all probabilities of IN occurrence. This paper proposes an optimized threshold-calculation method <b>for</b> <b>blanking</b> nonlinearity which is based on distribution characteristics of the received signal, i.e., mean, median, and peak. The proposed method can calculate an optimized threshold for all probabilities of impulsive noise occurrence. Simulation results show over 2.2 -dB gain in SNR and lower SER by using the proposed method as compared to fixed threshold.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of a blanking nonlinearity to cope with impulsive interference is a common approach in OFDM systems. The choice of the amplitude threshold to decide whether a received sample is blanked heavily affects {{the performance of the}} entire transmission. Unfortunately, the perfect blanking threshold strongly depends on the characteristics of the interference. In previous publications this perfect threshold has been derived, given knowledge about the interference statistics. However, in general no reliable information about the interference statistics is known at the receiver side. In this paper a practical method for calculating an adaptive blanking threshold to maximize the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio after the blanking nonlinearity is proposed. The calculation is based on the distribution of the amplitude of the received signal at the OFDM receiver. Simulation results show only a negligible performance degradation when comparing the proposed method to the case where the theoretically derived perfect threshold is applied <b>for</b> <b>blanking...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{covers and}} {{describes}} {{the influences of}} speed cutting on the part edge quality of blanked parts. Experiment shave been conducted using different material, punch die clearances and different cutting speeds. In {{order to determine the}} reachable cutting speeds and calculate the energy required <b>for</b> <b>blanking,</b> velocity stroke cures were obtained. The quality of the part edges shows that higher cutting speeds can improve the part edge quality, resulting in smaller burr height and rollover, and a larger shear zone. Furthermore, it could be observed that the part quality improvement when blanking with high cutting speeds is much more distinct for stele than for copper or aluminum. According to blanking theory, this improvement was expected because copper and aluminum have much higher heat conduction coefficients. Therefore, the at dissipates faster and the desired stress relief effect does not take place to the same degree as for stele...|$|E
