50|$|Woollard’s work in <b>flow</b> <b>production</b> in the mid-to-late 1920s pre-dates Kiichiro Toyoda’s {{interest}} in <b>flow</b> <b>production</b> by nearly 15 years. It is notable that Woollard’s work was well publicized in technical automotive production and engineering journals. Papers written by Woollard and William Morris showed their {{strong desire to}} share {{the details of their}} innovative continuous <b>flow</b> <b>production</b> system with others and to showcase British industrial prowess. Their work was no secret and was readily available to anyone interested in learning about advanced automobile production methods.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, Woollard {{understood}} that to achieve <b>flow</b> <b>production,</b> management practice {{had to be}} non-zero-sum, meaning that workers had to be respected and also benefit from <b>flow</b> <b>production,</b> in addition to customers. He recognized {{that in order for}} flow to exist, the interests of key stakeholders cannot be marginalized. Flow must cause no harm; if it does, then material and information will not flow. Woollard understood and practiced what today we call “Continuous Improvement” and “Respect for People” - the two principles of Lean management, and embodied them in his 18 principles of <b>flow</b> <b>production</b> (Woollard, 1954, p. 51).|$|E

The production method is financially the most efficient and effective because there is less of a need for skilled workers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe random utility based multiregional {{input-output}} (RUBMRIO) {{model is}} used by several integrated land use and transportation models (ILUTMs) to forecast commodity flows in a region and for spatial allocation of production activities. It makes use of multiregional input-output models {{which are based on}} random utility theory. In this work, we use optimal control techniques to find optimal final demand and transportation costs of a RUBMRIO model, that would lead to a desired level of commodity <b>flow</b> and <b>production</b> costs. At first, the RUBMRIO model is formulated as a discrete time dynamical system. It is shown, using Lyapunov argument, that the fixed point of the dynamical system is input-to-state stable (ISS). Then, a discrete time optimal control problem is formulated with states as commodity <b>flows</b> and <b>production</b> costs, and the final demand and transportation costs as control inputs. An optimization problem is then solved to obtain control inputs that would lead to desired commodity <b>flows</b> and <b>production</b> costs. Further, the proposed methodology is applied to a numerical example. It is shown that the optimal control based method can achieve user specified commodity <b>flows</b> and <b>production</b> costs up to an acceptable accuracy level...|$|R
