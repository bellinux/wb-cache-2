The growth of gram-positive but not gram-negative bacteria was inhibited to different extents by these compounds. An extract of hop cones containing 51 % xanthohumol was slightly less active against S. aureus strains (MIC range 31. 2 – 125. 0 [*]μg/mL) than pure xanthohumol (MIC range 15. 6 – 62. 5 [*]μg/mL). The spent hop extract, free of xanthohumol, exhibited lower but still relevant activity (MIC range 1 - 2 [*]mg/mL). There were positive coactions of <b>hop</b> <b>cone,</b> spent hop extracts, and xanthohumol with oxacillin against MSSA and with linezolid against MSSA and MRSA.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityThis study {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} water stress levels on the yield, quality, water use efficiency and grower returns of drip irrigated native spearmint and four subsurface drip irrigated hop cultivars: Mt. Hood, Columbus, Chinook and Willamette. For native spearmint, stress levels were applied at different times during the growing periods. For hops, each stress level was applied throughout the growing season. The field experiments were carried out for two years at the Washington State University Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center near Prosser WA. Mint results showed that biomass production decreased with increasing water stress as is expected. However, mint oil yield and quality {{were not significantly different}} across treatments. This suggests that deficit irrigating native spearmint might enhance oil accumulation. This is further supported by the observed increase in oil concentration as water stress increased. A number of mint production costs were affected by the reduction in applied water thus reducing the total mint production costs. Since oil yields were similar across treatments, revenues were not significantly affected. This resulted into increase in net farm income. Also, water stress improved the water use efficiency in native spearmint. Hop results showed that the dried <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> yield decreased with increasing water stress in all the cultivars. The <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> quality however did not change significantly across treatments. In the full year of production, water stress improved water use efficiency in hop production across all the cultivars. In the Yakima Valley, reduction in amount of water applied only affects the cost of pumping of the irrigation water which is minimal when compared to the total cost of producing hops. The yield reductions due to applying less water to hops caused reductions in revenues that were higher than the savings in the cost of producing hops due to pumping less water. This decreased the net farm income. The study observed how the subsurface drip irrigation system coupled with scientific irrigation scheduling can substantially reduce hop water use. This study also provides production functions for irrigation optimization of native spearmint and four hop cultivars. Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State Universit...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 A {{necrosis}} {{at the tip}} of cones {{was observed}} on hop (Humulus lupulus), cultivar "Nugget", grown in Oregon in the early 1990 's. Fusarium sambucinum and F. avenaceum were recovered from symptomatic cones in 1998 and preliminary inoculation experiments suggested both Fusarium species could cause <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> necrosis. Studies were carried out to (1) examine pathogenicity and demonstrate Koch's postulates for <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> tip blight using isolates of F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum obtained from hop cones; (2) examine isolates of F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum derived from other diseased plant hosts, and other Fusarium species derived from hop cones, for ability to cause cone necrosis; and (3) survey commercial fields to determine Fusarium populations on 'Nugget' cone parts. Isolates ofF. avenaceum and F. sambucinum recovered from diseased hop cones were used for pathogenicity experiments. In addition, cone inoculations were done with single isolates of F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum from diseased sweet corn roots, one isolate of F. sambucinum recovered from a diseased potato tuber, individual isolates of F. equiseti and F. oxysporum from hop cones. Cones of two hop cultivars, 'Nugget' and 'Willamette', were collected from three different farms on three sampling dates and inoculated with spore suspensions of hop-derived F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum at concentrations of 10 ², 1 O⁴, and 10 ⁶ conidia/ml to examine dosage effects. Necrosis was evaluated 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after inoculation. Percent cone necrosis decreased as inoculum concentration of either F. avenaceum or F. sambucinum decreased, and was lowest on water-treated cones, for all three sampling dates. The respective Fusarium species were recovered from symptomatic cones. Cone necrosis developed following cone inoculation with F. avenaceum or F. sambucinum from potato or corn. Hop cones inoculated with F. equiseti or F. oxysporum also developed necrosis, but at relatively lower levels compared to the other Fusarium species used for inoculations. For the surveys in commercial hop fields, burr and cone material were collected on five different dates. Fusarium sambucinum was recovered most frequently, but F. avenaceum was also found. Both Fusarium species were recovered from asymptomatic burr and cone materials throughout the growing season. In general, Fusarium species, F. equiseti, F. oxysporum, F. culmorum, F. solani, plus F. avenaceum and F. sambucinum were found more frequently early in the season on stigmatic tissue, and Fusarium recovery decreased as the season progressed.

Our molecular investigations of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) focus on genes that determine the biosynthesis of prenylflavonoids with interesting biological activities which accumulate in the lupulin glands. However, optimized protocols for RNA extraction from hop cones are not available. In this study, the RNeasy midi kit protocol was modified to isolate high amounts of total RNA from fresh and freeze-dried hop tissues, specifically leaves, female inflorescences, and lupulin-enriched <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> fractions. The main difficulties in obtaining high RNA yields were related to specific features of hop, including the abundance of secondary metabolites and their accumulation in the sticky lupulin glands.

The research aimed at calibrating and validating the soil water balance model SIMD-ualKc for Humulus lupulus L. cv. ‘Nugget’. The model computes the soil water balance using the dualKcapproach, thus partitioning crop evapotranspiration (ETc) into crop transpiration, ground covertranspiration and soil evaporation. Calibration and validation were performed using TDR soil watercontent measurements, which produced small root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0. 012 to 0. 015 cm 3 cm− 3. The initial, mid-season and end-season basal crop coefficients (Kcb) that allow com-puting hop transpiration were respectively 0. 16, 0. 97 and 0. 83.

40|$|Beer derives bitterness, {{flavour and aroma}} {{from the}} {{secondary}} metabolites of the <b>hop</b> <b>cone.</b> Breeding programs strive to produce superior hop cultivars with higher yields and desirable brewing characteristics {{as well as to}} increase efficiency and reduce input costs. In pursuing these goals, classical breeding approaches rely on morphological and biochemical markers to assess the genetic potential of hop. These methods are, however, hampered by environmental influences and by the complex interactions between hop secondary metabolites and the brewing process. Genetic-based analyses are able to account for these environmental influences to assess quantitative variation at the genetic level. This thesis describes investigations into two of these analyses, using molecular markers for quantitative trait loci (QTL) identification and the estimation of quantitative genetic parameters. These investigations were conducted with the aim of improving our understanding of the genetic control of <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> chemistry and important agronomic traits as well as to provide some insight as to the potential of these methods to inform hop breeding programs. Molecular technologies are generally costly, low throughput and reliant on DNA sequence information. Diversity arrays technology (DArT) is a marker system invented specifically to overcome these barriers. This thesis examines the applicability of DArT for high-throughput, cost-effective genotyping of hop. A total of 1241 polymorphic markers were identified from 497 hop accessions. A genetic diversity analysis was conducted on representative hop accessions to validate the robustness of these markers in the hop system. Hop accessions separated into two broad, genetically distinct groups (European and North American origin), with hybrids between them clearly distinguishable. These genetic relationships concur with the current understanding of hop phylogenetics and diversity, demonstrating the accuracy and resolution of DArT markers in a hop system and their potential as an effective marker technology for this species. The DArT markers, in conjunction with microsatellite, RAPD, STS and AFLP markers, were used to construct genetic linkage maps of two hop mapping populations; these linkage maps were then used for QTL analysis. This study focussed on identifying QTL for traits relating to three key targets in the genetic improvement of hop: expediting plant sex identification, increasing yield capacity and improving the organoleptic properties of hop cones. Sixty-three significant QTL were detected for 36 traits, including two yield traits (dry cone weight and essential oil content) and 33 different secondary metabolite traits. A previously identified sex-linked marker (HLAGA 7) was also verified in a third hop pedigree, demonstrating the utility of this marker as a routine screening tool in hop breeding programs. Many of the QTL identified were co-located, providing the first demonstration of pleiotropy/linkage influencing secondary metabolites in hop. Both pleiotropy and linkage have implications for hop breeding, as selection for specific secondary metabolites associated with such loci are likely to instigate adverse changes to other secondary metabolites, impeding the breeding for particular chemical profiles. Specific QTL influencing single secondary metabolites were also identified, demonstrating the potential for selection of particular chemical traits in isolation. The findings of this study significantly advance our understanding of the genetic control of sex, yield and secondary metabolites in hop, and provide important information on incorporating QTL for these complex traits into hop molecular selection programs. The genetic control of hop traits was also examined through quantitative genetics analysis. Traits related to cone chemistry, yield and plant growth were assessed in a hop progeny trial, consisting of 108 families of diverse genetic backgrounds (European, North American and hybrid origins). The investigation revealed significant genetic diversity between families in emergence of shoots, vegetative morphology and all assessed cone chemical traits, but not in cone yield. Cone chemical traits were generally more heritable (0. 15 to 0. 29) than growth traits (0. 04 to 0. 20), reflecting the more intense genetic selection of <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> chemistry and the greater environmental and agronomical influences on plant growth. Significant genetic correlations existed between cone chemistry and plant growth traits, with more vigorous plants associated with lower levels of α-acid and β-acid. This trend may reflect the underlying binary population structure of founder genotypes having either European or North American origin, or possibly the influence of selection in the Australian environment. This study also showed {{for the first time that}} sex has an effect on the phenotype of hop plants as early as emergence. It is currently held that male and female hop plants are indistinguishable until flowering, but this study found that male and female plants display differences in variation from emergence to cone maturity. This study provides valuable information on the potential genetic variation in cone chemistry and growth traits available to hop breeders, the prospective heritability of these traits and the influence that factors other than additive genetic influences have on the hop phenotype. Relationships between cone chemistry and plant growth traits present several growth measures that could be used as proxy selection indicators for particular cone chemical attributes. This thesis provides a comprehensive investigation of two genetic-based techniques to assess quantitative genetic variation in hop traits. The findings of both molecular and quantitative genetic analyses provide important insights into the underlying genetic architecture of hop and reveal novel information on the biology of this species. The knowledge gained from both techniques demonstrates the value of their incorporation into breeding programs...|$|E

The use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for prevention {{of cardiovascular}} disease in older postmenopausal failed to meet expectations. Phytoestrogens may induce some improvements in climacteric symptoms, but their effect on the progression of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The reduction of cholesterol accumulation at the cellular level should lead to inhibition of the atherosclerotic process in the arterial wall. The inhibition of intracellular lipid deposition with isoflavonoids was suggested as the effective way for the prevention of plaque formation in the arterial wall. The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was to investigate the effect of an isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation on atherosclerosis progression in postmenopausal women free of overt cardiovascular disease. One hundred fifty-seven healthy postmenopausal women (age 65 ± 6) were randomized to a 500 mg isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation containing tannins from grape seeds, green tea leaves, <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> powder, and garlic powder, or placebo. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors and intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries (cIMT) were evaluated at the baseline and after 12 months of treatment.

The differences between lipid changes in the isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation and placebo recipients did not reach statistical significance (p > 0. 05). Nevertheless, the mean cIMT progression was significantly lower in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients as compared to the placebo group (6 μm, or < 1 %, versus 100 μm, or 13 %; p < 0. 001 for the difference). The growth of existing atherosclerotic plaques in isoflavonoid-rich herbal preparation recipients was inhibited by 1. 5 -fold (27 % versus 41 % in the placebo group).

In hop, powdery mildew (caused by Podosphaera macularis) is most damaging to cones when infection occurs during bloom and the juvenile stages of cone development. Experiments were conducted over 3 years to evaluate whether fungicide applications could be ceased after the most susceptible stages of cone development (late July) without unduly affecting crop yield and quality when disease pressure was moderated with varying levels of basal foliage removal. In experimental plots of ‘Galena’ hop, the incidence of leaves with powdery mildew was similar whether fungicides were ceased in late July or made in late August. Disease levels on leaves were unaffected by the intensity of basal foliage removal, whereas the intensity of basal foliage removal interacted with the duration of fungicide applications to affect disease levels on cones. Similar experiments conducted in large plots of ‘Tomahawk’ hop in a commercial hop yard similarly found no significant impact on disease levels on leaves from either the duration of fungicide applications or intensity of basal foliage removal. In contrast, on cones, application of fungicides into August had a modest, suppressive effect on powdery mildew. There was also some evidence that the level of powdery mildew on cones associated with fungicide treatment was influenced by the intensity of basal foliage removal. When fungicide applications ceased in late July, there was a progressive decrease in the incidence of cones with powdery mildew with increasing intensity of basal foliage removal. Removing basal foliage two to three times allowed fungicide applications to be terminated in late July rather than late August without diminishing disease control on cones, yield, or cone quality factors. Thus, this study further establishes that fungicide applications made during the early stages of <b>hop</b> <b>cone</b> development have the strongest effect on suppression of powdery mildew on cones. The additive effect of fungicide applications targeted to the periods of greatest cone susceptibility and canopy management to reduce disease favorability may obviate the need for fungicide applications later in the season.

The paper deals with the losses of bitter substances (primary α-acids) during <b>hop</b> <b>cones</b> drying, their pelletisation by two manufacturing procedures and storage in different conditions. The {{results of this study}} show that integrated procedure of hop pelletising decreases the total loss of α-acids compared to the usual procedure. During storage of hop pellets (produced by integrated procedure) the highest decrease (loss) of α-acids content was observed in pellets stored at 21 °C in the presence of air and the lowest under inert atmosphere (N 2) at 4 to 7 °C, respectively. ...|$|R

The research results show that increasing sum of effective temperatures during the technological maturity stay in negative correlation with accumulation of α-acids in <b>hop</b> <b>cones</b> (r = - 0. 39 *), whereas total rainfalls stays in positive one (r = 0. 46 *) At the same time sum of hours of sun shining stay in not significant negative correlation with the accumulation of α-acids (r = - 0. 38). The results of factorial analysis show significant positive multiple correlation between sum of effective temperatures and total rainfalls with α-acids accumulation (multiple r = 0. 6232 **) {{and at the same}} time show a significant positive multiple correlation between total rainfalls and sunshine hours with α-acids accumulation (multiple r = 0. 5492 *). However, there was a very strong negative {{influence of}} reference crop evapotranspiration during the phenological phase of <b>hop</b> <b>cones</b> formation on yield of <b>hop</b> <b>cones</b> and of α-acids (rs = - 0. 75 * and – 0. 88 *, respectively). The total rainfalls during the hop vegetation in interval of [212. 1; 391. 8] mm and also the sum of effective temperature in interval of [1601. 74; 2000] ºC caused the α-acids accumulation in <b>hop</b> <b>cones</b> of cultivar Aurora in interval of [7. 41; 12. 35] % in dry matter. It is important to point out that the level of provided tillage, plant protection measures and fertilization was the same in all six experimental years, which excluded their effects on accumulation of α-acids. These results could possibly contribute in creating a model of predication of α-acids accumulation and beginning of hop harvest...|$|R

Lupulin contains lupulone and humulone, which possess antibiotic properties, suppressing bacterial growth favoring brewer's yeast to grow. After lupulin has been extracted in the brewing process the papery cones are discarded.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{variability}} of hop oils in the <b>hop</b> <b>cones.</b> <b>Hops</b> {{is the most important}} raw material for the production of beer and hop oils are the most important group of compounds responsible for the aroma of hops and thus the beer. Essential oils are applied in commercial quality assessment of <b>cone</b> <b>hops</b> for beer production. Essential oils have also hop buffer and antibacterial effects and pharmacology are used for suppressing agitation, restlessness and insomnia. Essential oils are complex mixtures of hundreds of natural compounds of different chemical composition. They represent a mixture of carbon compounds, oxygen compounds and sulfur compounds. The content of hop oils in the <b>hop</b> <b>cones</b> depends on the genetic characteristics of the variety, growing area, the average temperature, rainfall, and other conditions cultivation. This work was performed by steam distillation determination of hop oils. The determination was carried out on samples from 2012 and 2013, the essential oil content was profitable in 2012. Highest value of the hop oils was measured in a variety of Premiant from Tršice growing region (837 micro liters. 100 g- 1). The lowest value then the variety Saaz classical form of the Saaz hop-growing area (220 mocro liters. 100 g- 1) ...|$|R
