5|$|In early 2005, the Grantham Canal Partnership {{appointed}} a full-time Grantham Canal restoration manager, Kevin Mann, for an initial 18-month trial period. He {{would be responsible}} for planning and managing funding schemes for the restoration, identifying development opportunities and the promotion and interpretation of the canal. The trial proved to be successful, as he was still <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa {{arrive at}} the beach, but {{discover}} {{that the ability to}} help the animals is reserved for celebrities, who are already <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> The two are put to work cleaning rocks, and soon abandon the job and drive home. While picking up Bart, Homer learns about {{the true nature of the}} burlesque house, but does nothing about Bart working there. Principal Skinner visits the house and sees Bart as the door greeter. He reports it to the Lovejoys and the Flanders, who confront Homer about the matter. Homer declares that he has no problem with Bart working there just as Marge returns home unexpectedly.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, {{soon after}} his last {{appearance}} for Argyle, Carless accepted an offer to become the club's head groundsman, having gained experience <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for Cardiff City before moving to Plymouth.

25|$|The steam-powered {{pumping station}} is {{preserved}} and operates on selected weekends. It contains an operational Boulton & Watt steam engine dating from 1812 {{that is the}} oldest working beam engine {{in the world in}} its original engine house and capable of <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for which it was installed.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{and brother}} Phil plan to cheat some gangsters {{to pay off}} a debt by intercepting a drug deal and {{stealing}} {{a large amount of}} cash. Before <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> with Phil, Grant punches Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). However, the job goes awry when Phil finds out that Grant has had sex with his ex-wife Kathy before <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> He confronts Grant after the job and Grant admits he did it in revenge for Phil having sex with Sharon. Phil pulls out a gun, and shoots the steering wheel in their getaway car, causing Grant to plunge the car into the River Thames. Phil is rescued but Grant is not found and presumed dead. A week later it is revealed that Grant is alive. He departed with Courtney and the stolen money to Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{still in}} its {{original}} engine house and still capable of <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> {{for which it was}} installed is the 1812 Boulton and Watt engine at the Crofton Pumping Station. This was used to pump water for the Kennet and Avon Canal; on certain weekends throughout the year the modern pumps are switched off and the two steam engines at Crofton still perform this function.|$|E

25|$|The {{only time}} the {{guillotine}} {{was used in}} North America was in Saint-Pierre in the late 19th century. Joseph Néel was convicted of killing Mr Coupard on Île aux Chiens on 30 December 1888, and executed by guillotine on 24 August 1889. The guillotine had to be shipped from Martinique {{and it did not}} arrive in working order. It was very difficult to get anyone to perform the execution; finally a recent immigrant was coaxed into <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> This event was the inspiration for the film The Widow of Saint-Pierre (La Veuve de Saint-Pierre) released in 2000.

25|$|Not {{only were}} the weapons of German tanks improving, so was their armour. Soviet firing tests against a {{captured}} Tiger I heavy tank in April 1943 showed that the T-34's 76mm gun could not penetrate {{the front of the}} Tiger I at all, and the side only at very close range. A Soviet 85mm antiaircraft gun, the 52-K, was found capable of <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> and so derivatives of it were developed for tanks. The resulting tank gun could penetrate the side armour of the Tiger I from a distance of 800 meters and the turret side from a distance of 600 meters. It was still not enough to match the Tiger, as a Tiger could destroy the T-34 from a distance of 1,500 to 2,000 meters, but it was a noticeable improvement.|$|E
25|$|The battles {{continued}} to rage behind the leading trio, as Grosjean started to attack 4th placed Webber. The Red Bull driver {{decided to make}} a second pitstop for new tyres and rejoined in 8th place, behind Rosberg and Pérez, but ahead of Räikkönen. Felipe Massa, who was unable to regain the places he lost due to his spin, was now back up to 5th place as he too attempted a one-stopper. That did not work out however, and Rosberg had closed right up to him by lap 55, and brought Pérez, Webber and Räikkönen along. Rosberg attacked Massa on the DRS zone, but overshot the last chicane and had to give the position back. Pérez took advantage of this and was right behind Massa, which meant that he too was able to get the jump on Rosberg when he handed the place back to Massa. He then passed Massa on the same lap, with Rosberg also going through, this time <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> cleanly. The Brazilian had enough, and pitted for a new set of tyres and rejoined in 10th place, where he stayed till the end.|$|E
500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's {{very hard for me}} to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don't {{have anything to do with}} my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E

500|$|Lovato had no {{interest}} in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother. She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, [...] "He was mean, but {{he wanted to be a}} good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [...] taking care of you and <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> that I wish I could do'." [...] She has written multiple songs about him. Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013, at age 53. After his death, Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and in his honor she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the National Institute on Media and the Family {{criticized the}} ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating {{because it has}} a vested {{interest}} in the video game industry, stating that [...] "study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> It took explicit porn to get [...] an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them. We have been calling for AO ratings for the Grand Theft Auto series for years—now it is clear why the ESRB has ignored our request." [...] The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization [...] "relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence", was [...] "imposing its own narrow values and morality {{on the rest of the}} country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view", and did not reply to the ESRB's request for comments following its report card in 2004. The board also pointed out that the NIMF's study and [...] "report card" [...] used data from PSVRatings, a for-profit competitor to the ESRB.|$|E
500|$|Angel of Darkness follows on from {{events in}} [...] and Tomb Raider Chronicles, where Lara Croft was presumed dead. An {{unspecified}} time later, Lara arrives in Paris {{at the request}} of her former mentor, Werner Von Croy, who mentions that he has been tasked by a man named Eckardt to track medieval icons known as the Obscura Paintings. The city, and Von Croy, are gripped with fear over a serial killer the press have dubbed the [...] "Monstrum". The Monstrum steals body parts and leaves distinctive signs made with the victim’s blood in its wake. During a confrontation with Von Croy at his apartment, a flurry of activity occurs and Lara is knocked unconscious. When she wakes, she discovers Von Croy dead, apparently having been murdered by the Monstrum, and Lara becomes the prime suspect. Fleeing his demise & running away from the cops, Lara tracks down Von Croy's friend Margot Carvier in her apartment building who agrees to give Lara Von Croy's old notebook, which he had left with her for safekeeping. Carvier reveals to Lara how Von Croy had been contracted by Eckhardt to track the Obscura Paintings while adding details on how he had been fearful <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> The next day, a local Parisian prostitute reveals to Lara that Carvier has also been murdered by the Monstrum.|$|E

500|$|Groves's {{biggest concern}} was about people. Soldiers and {{scientists}} {{wanted to return}} to their peacetime pursuits, and there was a danger that wartime knowledge would be lost, leaving no one who knew how to handle and maintain nuclear weapons, much less how to improve the weapons and processes. The military side of the Manhattan Project had relied heavily on reservists, as the policy of the Corps of Engineers was to assign regular officers to field commands. The reservists were now eligible for separation. To replace them, Groves asked for fifty West Point graduates from the top ten percent of their classes to man bomb assembly teams at Sandia Base, where the assembly staff and facilities had been moved from Los Alamos and Wendover Field in September and October 1945. He felt that only such high quality personnel would be able to work with the scientists who were currently <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> They were also urgently required for many other jobs in the postwar Army. When General Thomas T. Handy turned down his request, Groves raised the matter with the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, who similarly did not approve it. Groves then went over his head too, and took it to the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, who agreed with Groves. [...] The personnel manned the 2761st Engineer Battalion (Special), which became a field unit under the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP).|$|E
500|$|Another {{recurring}} {{element in}} Lynch's films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, [...] "you {{look at the}} image and the scene silent, it's <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> it's supposed to do, but the work isn't done. When you start working on the sound, keep working until it feels correct. There's so many wrong sounds and instantly you know it. Sometimes it's really magical." [...] In the opening scene of the film, as the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy. After Lynch added [...] "a hint of the steam [...] and the screaming kids", however, it transformed Laura Elena Harring from clumsy to terrified. Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects. Hageman also identifies [...] "perpetual and uncanny ambient sound", and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkie's as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise [...] "creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order". Mulholland Drives ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering {{is an example of}} Lynch's aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, [...] "The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over, and therefore, there is only silence and enigma." ...|$|E

Ford further stated, [...] "this executive is incompetent, it's time they got on with <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> that they were set up to do". Following further negotiations, Ford assumed office on 12 April 2010.|$|E
