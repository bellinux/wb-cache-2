40|$|Tool {{improvisation}} analogies are {{a special}} case of motion and force analogies {{that appear to be}} implemented pre-conceptually, in many species, by <b>event-file</b> binding and action planning. A detailed reconstruction of the analogical reasoning steps involved in Rutherford's and Bohr's development of the first quantized-orbit model of atomic structure is used to show that human motion and force analogies generally can be implemented by the <b>event-file</b> binding and action planning mechanism. Predictions that distinguish this model from competing concept-level models of analogy are discussed, available data pertaining to them are reviewed, and further experimental tests are proposed...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} <b>event-file</b> format for the {{dissemination}} of next-to-leading-order (NLO) predictions for QCD processes at hadron colliders. The files contain all information required to compute generic jet-based infrared-safe observables at fixed order (without showering or hadronization), and to recompute observables with different factorization and renormalization scales. The files also {{make it possible to}} evaluate cross sections and distributions with different parton distribution functions. This in turn makes it possible to estimate uncertainties in NLO predictions {{of a wide variety of}} observables without recomputing the short-distance matrix elements. The event files allow a user to choose among a wide range of commonly-used jet algorithms and jet-size parameters. We provide event files for a $W$ or $Z$ boson accompanied by up to four jets, and for pure-jet events with up to four jets. The files are for the Large Hadron Collider with a center of mass energy of 7 or 8 TeV. A C++ library along with a Python interface for handling these files are also provided and described in this article. The library allows a user to read the event files and recompute observables transparently for different pdf sets and factorization and renormalization scales. Comment: 43 pages, 6 table...|$|E
