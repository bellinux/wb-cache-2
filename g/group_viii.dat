5|$|In Mendeleev's 1871 {{periodic}} table, copper, silver, {{and gold}} are listed twice, once under <b>group</b> <b>VIII</b> (with the iron triad and platinum group metals), and once under group IB.

Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due {{to the existence of}} copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time.

Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from <b>group</b> <b>VIII</b> for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.|$|E
500|$|Under an {{international}} naming convention, {{the groups are}} numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases). Previously, they were known by roman numerals. In America, the roman numerals were followed by either an [...] "A" [...] if the group was in the s- or p-block, or a [...] "B" [...] if the group was in the d-block. The roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (e.g. the group 4 elements were group IVB, and the group 14 elements were group IVA). In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that [...] "A" [...] was used if the group was before group 10, and [...] "B" [...] was used for groups including and after group 10. In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used {{to be treated as}} one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as <b>group</b> <b>VIII.</b> In 1988, the new IUPAC naming system was put into use, and the old group names were deprecated.|$|E

40|$|Of the {{one hundred}} or so {{elements}} in the Periodic Table no less than spventy-jive are metals, but of these only the twelve i n Groups V I I l and I B have important catalytic properties. The marked changes in these properties on proceed-ing either certically or horizontally through the groups is discussed i n terns of the periodic variation of the solid-state properties of the mijtals. It is now well established that the occur-rence of significant and useful catalytic properties is largely confined to the elements lying in <b>Groups</b> <b>VIII</b> and IB of the Periodic Table. Other elements of the transition series are able to act catalytically, {{but because of the}} great thermochemical difficulty of reducing them to the metallic state, and of keeping them reduced, they do not find any practical applications. Metals which have either no d-electrons or which have only filled d-electron shells, while sometimes thermo-chemically suitable, are generally catalytically inactive, and catalysis (particularly of hydro-genation and related reactions) has therefore come to be particularly associated with the presence of unpaired d-electrons in thc metal. There are, however, many large and im-portant differences between the twelve metals constituting <b>Groups</b> <b>VIII</b> and IB: to facilitate discussion we will subdivide the twelve metals as follows: (I) The Group IB metals (coinage metals) ...|$|R
