[...] Falling into [...] "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the Anarky miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an [...] "anti-villain", as opposed to [...] "antihero", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: [...] "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well.

A meeting of the Company's shareholders was held within two days, and it was decided that the situation was serious enough to justify sending a memorial to the king asking once more for the loan of the Fortuna, [...] and for the sending thence of a commissioner with power to settle all the difficulties.

2500|$|Lawrence Freedman in Foreign Affairs {{magazine}} called the book a [...] "fascinating exercise in historiography", highlighting the book's analysis {{of how a}} [...] "number of Hitler's leading generals were {{given an opportunity to}} write the history of the Eastern Front to help develop lessons for the Americans on fighting the Russians, and in doing so they provided a sanitized version of events". However, Freedman also noted that the impact of this involvement on U.S. perceptions of the Eastern Front was less clear. The review by Joseph Robert White, titled [...] "A Noble But Sisyphean Effort", concluded by quoting the book's closing sentence: “The ‘good German’ seems destined for an eternal life”. White observed that the book should nonetheless provide <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>thought</b> in classroom discussions about the German army, but noted that an assumption of specialised knowledge and the concomitant lack of a chapter about war crimes committed by the Wehrmacht undermined the authors' efforts to challenge the myth.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The paper {{deals with}} the role of {{knowledge}} in UN peacekeeping operations, and the modalities of its management. In detail, the study: a) illustrates the peculiar Knowledge Management issues arising from the context considered; b) describes the Knowledge Management practices adopted; c) makes some remarks about the practicability and problematic aspects of these practices. Design/methodology/approach – We propose an approach based on case-study research. The originality of the case-study proposed rests on {{the fact that this is}} a “frontier” experience that summarises and incorporates many elements of complexity of public decision-making, such as: uncertainty, multiplicity of goals and tasks, participation of different and often conflicting stakeholders, different levels of authority, etc. Originality/value – The analysis shows important elements of interest. From a conceptual viewpoint, the study addresses the more general issue of KM programmes applied to complex decision-making processes in public environments, involving multidimensional problems, different goals, and various independent organisations interacting in a non-hierarchical way. These aspects reflect on the complexity of the KM solution adopted in peacekeeping, whose study therefore provides interesting insights for both scholars and practitioners. Practical implications – From a practical viewpoint, peacekeeping is a recognised ingredient of the global stability, favouring the political, social and economic development of the countries coming out of conflicts. Considering that the UN is the major player, and this represents the most important example of programmes of peacekeeping and socio-economic promotion, the analysis of the UN experience provides <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>for</b> all the professionals and organisations alike involved in these processes...|$|R
40|$|Attaining a {{sufficient}} level of safety {{from the point}} of view of stability is typically considered to be a matter of design. However, it is impossible to ensure safety only by design measures, and operational measures can then represent a complementary tool for efficiently and cost-effectively increasing the overall safety of the vessel. Time could therefore be coming for systematically considering operational measures as a recognised and regulated integral part of a holistic approach to ship safety {{from the point of}} view of stability. This paper therefore aims at capturing recent trends of research targeting operational safety measures, with specific attention to the intact ship condition. Open challenges and opportunities for research are identified, potential benefits and shortcomings of different options are discussed, and needs and possibilities for further developments in this area are explored. As an overall goal, this paper aims at providing <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>thoughts</b> as well as a ground for further proceeding towards the target of implementing a virtuous integrated approach to intact ship safety, {{from the point of view}} of stability, which gives due credit to effective and robust operational risk control options...|$|R

From this point onwards, Hazlitt's goal was to become a philosopher. His intense studies focused on man as a social and political animal, and, in particular, on the philosophy of mind, a discipline that would later be called psychology.|$|E

But after all that, tonight’s episode manages {{something}} that not all of its Christmas predecessors manage, as it anchors its story in something that feels particular to the holidays. There is a melancholy to the comings and goings that define this time of year, and “Last Christmas” recognises that from its title outward." [...] Praise was also given to Capaldi's performance in the special, [...] "If there’s one thing we never really saw in Capaldi’s first season as the Doctor, {{it was the kind of}} unabashed joy that so animated the 10th and 11th Doctors and made the tail-end of the 9th Doctor’s journey—including his Santa claim to Rose at the end of “The Doctor Dances”—so powerful. Well, it takes the full hour, but “Last Christmas” gets us there. It was worth the wait." [...] Digital Spy awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, stating that [...] "Moffat pulls off a number of difficult balancing acts spectacularly well, refusing to deliver another throwaway special that's heavy on the frothy festive cheer but light on real substance". They closed their review by saying [...] "Last Christmas is an absolute cracker.

The Mirror also praised the episode, saying that it [...] "might have borrowed, somewhat heavily, from a few films, but it still had the Doctor Who spin". They also expressed praise over Clara's continuation, saying [...] "It’s great news that we will have another series with these two verbally sparring" [...] and closed their review by claiming the episode [...] "was [...] real Christmas treat to join Capaldi and Coleman on another adventure, and it was the icing on the cake that Clara is staying with the Doctor".|$|E

The crisis provides <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>thoughts</b> {{on the issues of}} financial organizations’ risk management and corporate governance. This dissertation examines bank’ risk management and corporate governance under three themes, they are Theme 1 : CRO and Risk committees, Theme 2 : Risk measurement and mitigation, and Theme 3 : Compensation Policy and Board Composition The discussion will be based on data from three banks: Citigroup (Citi), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JP Morgan (JPM), over a period of eight years from financial year 2001 to 2008. Different from other research which is mostly quantitative, this dissertation adopts a qualitative perspective. A literature review is conducted {{in order to understand the}} best practices of risk management and corporate governance under the three themes, followed by a in-depth analysis to determine how each of the three firms perform in those aspects. In general, based on their reports and accountings, it was found that Citi have performed significantly worse in all aspects when compared to JPM and GS prior to the crisis, and it did not improve much after the crisis. As reflect in the 2008 ’s reports, despite the fact that GS became a bank holding company in 2008 and disclosure was expected to align with Citi and JPM, the least information was provided before and after the crisis. From the limited information provided by GS, it is found that GS has in place a good risk management system and sound corporate governance. On the other hand, JPM has in place a sound risk management system that is comparable to GS; it has good corporate governance and had provided rich information to investors...|$|R
