25|$|In early March 2011, she {{announced}} that she is working on her first full English album, entitled All Your Love which was produced by her own stepson's production team What's Up Entertainment, with all the songs written and produced by Australian singers, Christian Alexanda and Bryan Bouro and released on 26 September with her first English single, Falling in Love debuted at a concert in UiTM where she also expressed her interest to further her study in that university. Two out of ten tracks from the album, Remember You and <b>I</b> <b>Wait</b> Forever were a duet between her and Sean Kingston and Christian Alexanda respectively.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} a single crash cymbal {{followed}} by two bars of 4/4 drumming, then a plaintive three-note guitar line rings through a strummy rhythm, and Martin's vocals. Its instrumentation is varied {{with the sound of}} thumping drums, chiming guitars, a singalong chorus, and a string arrangement. The song also features a guitar lick swirl. The three lines of the third verse allude to a man's love of a woman, who does not reciprocate his love. He is saying he will always wait for her, but he does not think that she should stay where she is any longer. The lyrics emphasize: [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> for you/if you go, if you go/leave me down here on my own/then I'll wait for you." [...] The song's lyrics also include references to a desire for weary optimism.|$|E

The Cremin family erects a billboard each year since her death, to offer a reward {{for information about the}} killer. At the bottom of the billboard, a quote reads: [...] "You know what you did to me. How much longer must <b>I</b> <b>wait!</b> Please help make my time in heaven restful." [...] The reward has grown from $10,000 in 1995 to $20,000 by 2005, to $50,000 in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Some members {{continued}} to produce music following {{the demise of}} The W's. Gruener and Morris joined Corvallis friend Mark Cleaver in the indie band Bendixon. Bendixon released two albums, Bendixon (1999) and Slaying of the Dragon (2000). Their sound was comparable to Weezer or All Star United, and like The W's most of their songs could be considered fun or witty. Schar and Stubbert formed the band Alpha Charlie and released one album, ...and <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> (2002), before breaking up in 2004. [...] Early member Shultz moved to Los Angeles in 1997.|$|E

60|$|I {{sank down}} on the shelf, legs powerless, body in cold sweat. As <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> slowly my mind freed itself from a tight iron band and a sickening relief filled my soul. Tensely <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> and listened. Don whined once.|$|R
