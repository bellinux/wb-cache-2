40|$|Session 3 - DC Switching And Limiting DevicesInternational audienceThe fuse {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{components}} of electrical engineering. As soon as engineers made use of electricity for practical, domestic or industrial applications, they met problems with over-currents. And the solution they chose immediately was the fuse [1]. Without the safe protection provided by this component, electricity would be probably regarded as far too dangerous for widespread use and there would be no modern electrical industry [2]. Even today, despite their apparent banality, electric fuses remain the ultimate protection against short-circuits in equipment, including those with the most advanced topologies. Let us consider power-electronics converters. They are very reliable equipment and are widely used in many activities including industries, services and even residential. However, there is a non-negligible risk of failure of a semi-conductor acting to commutate in a leg. In that case, the semi-conductor will short-circuit and all the available energy will pass through the leg. There is then a very high risk of explosion of the semi-conductor, with occurrence of an electric arc inside the converter and even outside. A huge amount of energy is to be dissipated and not only the converter and its components will be concerned and destroyed, but also fragments will be ejected, intensive radiations emitted, toxic gases produced and a pressure wave propagated. All these dangers fly in the face of the safety requirements in the industrial field. Moreover, designers of equipment for the general public – think to automotive, railways, aeronautics – will be especially concerned by this issue. More particularly, VSI-inverters present specific short circuits conditions, the over-current coming from the discharge of a capacitor into a no-inductive circuit [3] [4]. The fuse operates very fastly, in a range from about ten to hundred microseconds. The optimization of its design justifies to undertake fundamental studies in order to offer the right protection to the customer.

Due to upward air temperature gradient in rooms {{there will be a}} heat transfer through slabs upwards. The size of this depends on insulation degree of building envelope and slabs and air flow through the building. With a linear mathematical model, considering 1 m² floor area, it is shown how some parameters affect the heat transfer. Starting position for the model is a building in the thermal balance from which deviations are calculated. The model gives, for a basic case, results that agree well with the measured values. The vertical temperature increase, results in lower temperature in lower storeys and higher temperature in upper storeys. Total temperature rise for 4 – 28 storeys are in the range 0. 5 – 0. 7 °C, which give vertical heat transfer of 0. 6 – 1. 1 W/m². A better <b>insulated</b> building <b>envelope</b> will increase the vertical temperature deviations. Better insulated slabs between the storeys will decrease the deviations.

To this aim, we perform cooling simulations using newly constructed models of the envelopes composed of binary ion mixtures (H [...] He, He [...] C, C [...] Fe) varying the mass of lighter ions (H, He or C) in the envelope. The results are compared with those calculated using the standard models of the envelopes which contain the layers of lighter (accreted) elements (H, He and C) on top of the Fe layer, varying the mass of accreted elements. The main effect is that the chemical composition of the envelopes influences their thermal conductivity and, hence, thermal insulation of the star.
