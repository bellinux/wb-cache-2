40|$|An {{outbreak}} of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) occurred in November 2012 in Switzerland (CH), traditionally PRRSV-free. It was detected after a German boar stud informed a semen importer about {{the detection of}} PRRSV during routine monitoring. Tracing <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> deliveries revealed 26 Swiss sow herds that had used semen from this stud after its last negative routine monitoring and 62 further contact herds. All herds were put under movement restrictions and examined serologically and virologically. As a first measure, 59 sows from five herds {{that had previously been}} inseminated with suspicious semen were slaughtered and tested immediately. Investigations in the stud resulted in 8 positive boars with recent semen deliveries to CH (Seven with antibodies and virus, one with antibodies only). In one boar out of six tested, virus was detected in <b>semen.</b> <b>Of</b> the 59 slaughtered sows, five from three herds were virus-positive. In one herd, the virus had spread, and all pigs were slaughtered or non-marketable animals euthanized. In the remaining herds, no further infections were detected. After confirmatory testings in all herds 3 weeks after the first examination gave negative results, restrictions were lifted in January 2013, and Switzerland regained its PRRSV-free status. The events demonstrate that <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> from non-PRRS-free countries - even from negative studs - poses a risk, because monitoring protocols in boar studs are often insufficient to timely detect an infection, and infections of sows/herds occur even with low numbers <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> doses. The outbreak was eradicated successfully mainly due to the high disease awareness of the importer and because immediate actions were taken before clinical or laboratory diagnosis of a single case in the country was made. To minimize the risk of an introduction of PRRSV in the future, stricter import guidelines for boar semen have been implemented...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Pilocarpine (50 mg) {{administered}} to the boar 20 min before semen collection had no detectable effect on either ejaculation or semen composition. However, the volume <b>of</b> fluid <b>semen,</b> the total volume <b>of</b> <b>semen,</b> and the time required for ejaculation differed significantly(P< 0 =. 1) between breeds ofboars. Atropine, a parasympathetic-blocking drug, {{has been found to}} reduce the volume <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> with little or no effect on the total number of spermatozoa ejaculated by the boar (Dziuk & Norton, 1962). Differences in composition <b>of</b> the <b>semen</b> from atropine-treated and control boars indicated that atropine suppressed the secretion of the urethral glands (Dziuk & Mann, 1963). In the bull, atropine has been found to reduce both the volume <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> and the number of spermatozoa per ejaculate (Signoret, 1962; Baker, VanDemark & Graves, 1963), whereas pilocarpine, a parasympathetic-stimulating drug, has significantly increased the volume <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> and total spermatozoa per ejaculate (Baker et al., 1963; J.

40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} (BVD) is endemic and prevalent {{disease in}} North America (United States and Canada). In Finland {{the occurrence of}} BVD {{has been reduced to}} internationally very low level. This descriptive assessment follows the guidelines for import risk analysis by the World organisation for animal health (OIE). 1. Hazard identification: Artificial insemination of bovine animals is a recognized route of transmission of BVD virus (BVDV). The possible contamination by BVDV <b>of</b> bovine <b>semen</b> <b>imported</b> from North America constitutes a hazard for the favourable BDV situation among Finnish cattle. 2 Release assessment: The lots <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> <b>imported</b> from North America may contain annually a few contaminated by BVDV. The risk of release through these lots is a remote but not wholly insignificant possibility. 3. Exposure assessment: The contaminated lots <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> are considered to be able to transmit the infection to {{at least half of the}} dams inseminated with them. Contraction of BVDV infection this way is annually a rare event with low but not zero probability. 4. Consequence assessment: The predicted frequency for birth of persistently infected (PI) calves is one every 4 – 8 years. 90 % of the intervals modelled with Gamma distribution lie below 11. 2 and 25. 0 years, respectively. 5. Risk estimation: Birth of a PI calf due to the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> contaminated sperm from North America is a quite rare event, but taking the potential consequences into account, this frequency is not completely insignificant...|$|R
