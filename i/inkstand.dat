5|$|Goodman {{was born}} and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where his father, George, was a printer and real estate agent. His mother, Ella, died of typhoid fever in early 1895 when Goodman was just three years old. He {{attended}} Central High School, graduating in 1909. He enjoyed writing and began keeping a detailed journal of daily activities during his senior year of high school, expressing his aspirations for the future along with occasional doubts. With several classmates, he began a literary club and published a newsletter, The <b>Inkstand.</b> He also showed interest in music, playing the piano and violin, and composed a song for his high school senior class. When it was not selected by the class officers, he wrote in his journal of his disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as 'Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn', the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the first floor were officially opened by Lord Coleridge a descendant of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 2011 the National Trust undertook a major re-presentation project that also saw the opening of additional rooms. The oldest parts of the cottage are now presented as the Coleridge family might have known them, with the original inglenook fireplace in the parlour uncovered and working once more. The garden was opened to visitors for the first time, complete with an 18th-century vegetable plot, a wildflower area and representations of Coleridge's animals. It is possible to listen to poetry at audio posts around the garden and the well is operational once more and {{can be seen in the}} small courtyard behind the cottage. A number of mementos of Coleridge are on display including his <b>inkstand,</b> locks of his hair and correspondence in his handwriting.|$|E
60|$|On a small shelf {{over one}} of the desks rested two new <b>inkstands</b> and several boxes of pens. Going to the desk, Hardwick pretended to be busy {{examining}} some papers. While thus engaged, Hal saw the book-keeper transfer the <b>inkstands</b> and the boxes of pens to his overcoat pocket.|$|R
60|$|Hal had the <b>inkstands</b> and the pens in his {{overcoat}} pocket, and he at once handed them over, much to Mr. Sumner's astonishment.|$|R
60|$|The {{newspaper}} was cast aside, {{and the box}} opened. Out came a pair of cuff-buttons, a gold watch-chain, a flat pocket-book, two <b>inkstands,</b> and several boxes of pens.|$|R
25|$|Silversmiths' {{whose work}} is {{represented}} in the collection include Paul de Lamerie and Paul Storr whose Castlereagh <b>Inkstand</b> dated 1817–19 {{is one of his}} finest works.|$|E
25|$|The pen {{and paper}} on the table signify the rule of law. The table's leg is shaped like a fasces, an ancient Roman symbol of power and {{authority}} (imperium). On the far left of the table is a silver inkwell, emblazed with George Washington's coat of arms (see Syng <b>inkstand).</b> A white quill rests upon silver dogs, ancient symbols of loyalty. Behind the table is a large black hat.|$|E
25|$|Having {{achieved}} {{effective control}} of the convention, the opposition to Governor Chamberlain proceeded to select delegates to the national convention {{with the purpose of}} excluding the governor from the delegation. However, the convention descended into chaos between those in support of the governor and those in opposition. An <b>inkstand</b> was thrown {{at the head of a}} delegate and a chair was raised above Governor Chamberlain with the intention of striking him.|$|E
5000|$|Eclipse died due to {{an attack}} of colic on 27 February 1789, {{at the age of}} 24. His {{skeleton}} is now housed at the Royal Veterinary College, Hertfordshire, in the Learning Resource Centre named after him, although it cannot be said for certain whether all the bones displayed are really from Eclipse. [...] His hooves were made into <b>inkstands,</b> although {{the fact that there are}} at least five Eclipse-hoof <b>inkstands</b> casts some doubt on the authenticity of some. Hairs from his tail have also been used for decorations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you can," [...] sneered Ferris. [...] "Look here," [...] {{he pointed}} to the <b>inkstands</b> and the pens. [...] "Aunt Amanda, do you know who those things belong to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] he {{reminded}} himself {{in a state of}} excitement, [...] "we must sit up all night, my Christopher. I must correct these Proofs for the press. Fill all the <b>inkstands,</b> and bring me several new pens." ...|$|R
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of arrests at a London Corresponding Society meeting at Chalk Farm, treason charges were laid against Thomas Hardy, John Thelwall and John Horne Tooke among others; Losh, Frend and associates (John Cartwright, Godfrey Higgins, William Maxwell (1760–1834), Gilbert Wakefield and the publishers Joseph Johnson and J. S. Jordan) formed a committee to raise defence funds. When Joseph Priestley emigrated to America that year, Losh, with Frend, Higgins and Tweddell presented him with an <b>inkstand.</b> At this period he also involved himself with the investigations of Edward Christian into {{the circumstances of the}} Mutiny on the Bounty, assisting with interviews of mutineers who been brought back to the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|John Muir, {{who served}} as a keeper with the NLB for 39 years all told, had a posting to Skerryvore from 1902 to 1914. He helped {{complete}} a new [...] "landing grating", as the slender metal walkway was called, that made landings possible in conditions previously considered [...] "hopeless". He baked his own bread and scones and made an inlaid table and Iona marble <b>inkstand.</b>|$|E
500|$|Yancey {{gradually}} ran {{afoul of}} President Davis {{on matters of}} policy, although he {{was not one of}} Davis’s most extreme critics. [...] Their differences accelerated in a series of letters exchanged after May 1863, and no final resolution was reached. [...] In Congress, Yancey and Benjamin Hill of Georgia, who had previously clashed in 1856, had their differences over a bill intended to create the Confederate Supreme Court erupt into physical violence. [...] Hill hit Yancey {{in the head with a}} glass <b>inkstand</b> on the floor of the Senate, but in the ensuing investigation it was Yancey, not Hill, who was censured.|$|E
60|$|We {{found that}} the dead literati of Ferrara had the place wholly to themselves; not a living soul disputed the {{solitude}} of the halls with the custodians, and the bust of Ariosto looked down from his monument upon rows of empty tables, idle chairs, and dusty <b>inkstands.</b>|$|R
60|$|Jack had got a large {{table and}} some benches. <b>Inkstands,</b> slates, paper, and pencils {{were on the}} table, and four candles were burning. He took the place of honour {{at the head of}} the table, and the others, much pleased with the {{appearance}} of the room, took their seats round the table.|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the Islamic {{tradition}} of knowledge, the Fatimids collected books {{on a variety of}} subjects and their libraries attracted the attention of scholars from across the world. The Imam-Caliph al-Hakim was a great patron of learning and provided paper, pens, ink and <b>inkstands</b> without charge to all those who wished to study there.|$|R
500|$|A finalist in {{the same}} talent quest was seven-year-old Tommy Dawes, who Appleroth chose to appear as the [...] "whistling boy" [...] {{on the front of}} the jelly packets and advertising. According to Dawes, as a finalist he {{received}} 10 guineas and an onyx <b>inkstand,</b> but has received no other compensation for the use of his image or his recorded version of the jingle. Dawes said, [...] "It was absolutely fantastic; I loved seeing my picture and singing the song and all my friends were very impressed... I have never wanted any money from it... I just like telling everyone that I'm the Aeroplane Jelly boy." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{collection}} of Renaissance metalwork Benvenuto Cellini (1500–71) represents the ultimate attribution, as his genuine works as a goldsmith are rarer than paintings by Giorgione. [...] In his 1902 catalogue Charles Hercules Read mentions {{that many of the}} pendants had been attributed to Cellini, but refrains from endorsing the attributions. [...] A small silver hand-bell (WB.95) had belonged to Horace Walpole, who praised it extravagantly in a letter as [...] "the uniquest thing in the world, a silver bell for an <b>inkstand</b> made by Benvenuto Cellini. It makes one believe all the extravagant encomiums he bestows on himself; indeed so does his Perseus. Well, my bell is in the finest taste, and is swarmed by caterpillars, lizards, grasshoppers, flies, and masques, that you would take it for one of the plagues of Egypt. They are all in altissimo, nay in out-issimo relievo and yet almost invisible but with a glass. Such foliage, such fruitage!" [...] However Baron Ferdinand had realized that it was more likely to be by Wenzel Jamnitzer, goldsmith to the Emperor Rudolf II, to whom it is still attributed. [...] Another piece no longer attributed to Cellini is a large bronze door-knocker, with a figure of Neptune, 40cm high, and weighing over 11 kilos.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{his most}} notable works, however, were those he created for himself, often with the {{proceeds}} of the winning of an architectural competition. Examples include the Elephant <b>Inkstand,</b> which Crook considers [...] "the very epitome of its creator's special genius", the pair of jewelled decanters paid for with the fees for the plans of the Crimea Memorial Church and for his series of lectures, Art Applied to Industry, and the Cat Cup, created by Barkentin in commemoration of the Law Courts competition, of which Crook writes: [...] "Its technical virtuosity sets standards for the Arts and Crafts phase. But the overall conception, the range of materials, the ingenuity, the inventiveness, the sheer gusto of the design, is peculiarly, triumphantly Burges." [...] Burges also designed more utilitarian articles which were nonetheless imbued with his love of allusion and punning, including silverware featuring mermaids, spiders and other creatures {{and a set of}} knives and forks for the Tower House, with the handles, carved by Nicholls, showing symbols of [...] "meat and vegetables, veal, venision, onion, pea and so on." [...] He was also a knowledgeable critic, referred to by a contemporary as [...] "one of the best judges of armour in Europe." [...] His large collection of armour, parts of which came from the famed collection of Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, was bequeathed to the British Museum upon his death.|$|E
60|$|Where was I? Oh, {{they married}} {{and came to}} New York. Bob showed his college diploma, and {{accepted}} a position filling <b>inkstands</b> in a lawyer's office at $15 a week. At the end of two years he had worked up to $50, and gotten his first taste of Bohemia--the kind that won't stand the borax and formaldehyde tests.|$|R
50|$|Kotli Loharan {{consists}} of two subtowns. One is Kotli Loharan West (Laandi (meaning West) Kotli) and other is called Kotli Lohraran East (Chardi (meaning East) Kotli). All kinds of articles for use and ornament are made, such as shields and arms, betel-nut cutters, knives, boxes, plates, <b>inkstands,</b> and so on. The material used is iron, and gold and silver are used in inlaying.|$|R
50|$|An informally voluble, genial, {{and very}} profane man, Dryden {{conducted}} his courts pretty much after his own personality traits. Lawyers and jurymen appeared coatless, and wearing firearms, if they so desired. Solemnity was lacking. <b>Inkstands,</b> canes, chairs, and jackknives were hurled at opponents during altercations. Judge and attorneys engaged in violent disputes. Dryden himself {{was guilty of}} blasphemy from the bench.|$|R
2500|$|The service often {{contains}} {{one or a}} pair of ewer and basin {{sets for}} washing. [...] There is normally {{a number of other}} vessels of various sizes and shapes, some covered and others not, which go by a great variety of names, and whose purpose was perhaps always rather undefined. [...] A variety of brushes might be included, and sometimes a small bell. In the 18th century glass and porcelain items might be mixed in with the silver ones. Services also might contain food plates and cutlery (usually just for one) for breakfast or snacks in the bedroom or dressing-room, or when travelling. [...] One large type of bowl is connected with oatmeal, though it seems this might either be made into a facial, or eaten as porridge (or both, with a pair). [...] Descriptions include items such as comb-boxes, glove-trays, soap-boxes, low tazze (or [...] "waiters"), salvers, ecuelles (small bowls with two handles) and others. The 48-piece German Schenk von Stauffenberg service (1740s, now Metropolitan Museum of Art) contains several items for food and drink, including a teapot, and also items for writing, such as an <b>inkstand.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Very {{little is}} known of Ouranos's origin, his early years or his family, and the chronicles {{represent}} him very much as a [...] "new man". A prōtospatharios and asēkrētis Basil Ouranos, possibly an elder relative, is attested, and we know from Nikephoros's letters {{that he had a}} brother named Michael. Nikephoros Ouranos himself first enters history in the early 980s, during negotiations between Byzantium and the Emir of Baghdad for the return of the renegade rebel general Bardas Skleros. After a first Byzantine embassy in 980, an Arab embassy under Ibn Shahram visited Constantinople in 982, and Ouranos is mentioned in its report as a confidante of the young Basil II, holding the high court position of epi tou kanikleiou (keeper of the kanikleion, the imperial <b>inkstand).</b> Ibn Shahram further mentioned that Ouranos's close association with the emperor made him an enemy to the powerful eunuch parakoimomenos, Basil Lekapenos, who had supervised the affairs of state for decades. During the negotiations, Ouranos functioned as the intermediary between the Arabs and the emperor, and he was subsequently chosen by the parakoimomenos to head a Byzantine delegation to Baghdad, which would take custody of Skleros.|$|E
2500|$|The Confederate States Congress was {{sometimes}} unruly. The journal clerk {{shot and killed}} the chief clerk, and Henry S. Foote was attacked with [...] "fists, a Bowie knife, a revolver and an umbrella". In a Senate debate, Benjamin H. Hill threw an <b>inkstand</b> at William Lowndes Yancey, and Yancey and Edward A. Pollard had such fierce attacks on one another that newspapers would not publish the exchange for fears of their personal safety. Military glory redounded to those on the battlefield, but Congress and Congressmen were held in contempt, in some part due to members habit of berating one another in personal terms. Nevertheless, one historian of the Confederacy assessed the Congress as [...] "better than its critics made it." [...] The Confederacy lived out its existence during wartime, and virtually all of Congressional action addressed that fact. While it {{took an interest in}} military affairs, it never followed the U.S. Congress' example of harassing either the President, his cabinet, or military commanders. Despite Jefferson Davis' bitter Congressional critics, he dominated the Congress throughout most of the war until near the very end. Davis vetoed thirty-nine bills in total, deemed unconstitutional or unwise, and these were upheld in the Congress for all but the bill for free postage for newspapers addressed to soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|Carol Brooks MacNeil (January 15, 1871 - June 22, 1944) [...] was an American sculptor, born in Chicago {{where she}} {{studied at the}} Art Institute of Chicago under Lorado Taft. MacNeil modeled many charming and unique designs for vases, teapots, <b>inkstands,</b> and other {{decorative}} and useful objects, as well as children's busts, including those of her two sons, and statuettes.|$|R
5000|$|The 1903 Handbook of the New York State Library School {{listed the}} {{requirements}} of library hand. They included legibility, speed, and uniformity. The particular type of ink, <b>inkstands,</b> pens, penholders, and erasers was specified. The standards for lettering were dictated in regard to size, slant, spacing, special letters and figures, and even the proper posture and position of the writer was outlined.|$|R
60|$|As {{this was}} his usual hour for having a little {{confidential}} chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen {{that she was going}} to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers, <b>inkstands,</b> and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing through the open window, down into the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mary Bell, [...] "I will." [...] So she {{sat down}} to her desk, taking up her pen, she dipped it into the <b>inkstand.</b> The <b>inkstand</b> had been placed into the chair which Mary Bell's end of the ironing-board rested upon. It could not stand safely on the board itself as that was sloping.|$|E

6000|$|... 'She is a curate's daughter,' said Traddles; 'one of ten, down in Devonshire. Yes!' For {{he saw me}} glance, involuntarily, at the {{prospect}} on the <b>inkstand.</b> 'That's the church! You come round here to the left, out of this gate,' tracing his finger along the <b>inkstand,</b> 'and exactly where I hold this pen, there stands the house--facing, you understand, towards the church.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very bad? It's {{the highest}} social offence I know; it ought--it {{absolutely}} ought--I'm quite serious--to be capital If I knew I should be hanged else, I should manage {{to find the}} best word. The people who could n't--some of them don't know it when they see it--would shut their <b>inkstands,</b> and we should n't be deluged by this flood of rubbish!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{wheeling}} basket vomited {{its contents}} as it dropped. The theodolite hit a jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell; the books, <b>inkstands,</b> paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed {{for a few}} seconds like a swarm of bees. Then they vanished; and, though Kim, hanging half out of the window, strained his young ears, never a sound came up from the gulf.|$|R
2500|$|Practical gifts {{included}} work-baskets, a travelling bag, a biscuit-box, a thimble, an egg-boiler and a photograph-book. Some gifts give an {{glimpse of}} items necessary {{at the time}} but which are no longer needed or are now less valuable and more disposable. For example, [...] "carved ivory" [...] hair brushes {{have been replaced by}} plastic ones; visiting cards, <b>inkstands</b> and riding whips are no longer in regular use.|$|R
