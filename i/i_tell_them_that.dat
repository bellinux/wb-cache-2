2500|$|In an {{interview}} he said, [...] "People ask why I don't paint flowers, butterflies and landscapes? <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> I seek {{the truth and}} I am after reality. I am not inspired by someone posing {{against the backdrop of}} roses in a vase or pink curtains. What inspires me is a person who has gone hungry for hours and is struggling for survival. The expression that lights his face {{at the end of the}} day when he has finally found some scraps, that is what touches me. I am a painter of the expression of reality." [...] Self-proclaimed [...] "Faqir," [...] Sadequain was outside society's worldly greed or hypocrisy and called himself [...] "speaker of truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He brings tidings {{that they}} seek {{peace with the}} Zulus, to whom they will do no hurt if no hurt is done to them. Shall <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the Zulus also seek peace?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{just four}} times three;--that's the difference. But I comfort {{myself with the}} text about the quiver you know; and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> when they've eat up all the butter, they'll have to take their bread dry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no,' said Uncle Bat, 'I'm {{sure he did}} not; nor he won't long at the Admiralty either, <b>I</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that.</b> But where's Gertrude?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Among {{the friends}} of the Hilarys there was misgiving on this point of their {{approval}} of Matt's marriage. Some of <b>them</b> thought <b>that</b> the parents' hands had been forced in the blessing they gave it. Old Bromfield Corey expressed a general feeling to Hilary with senile frankness. [...] "Hilary, you seem to have disappointed the expectation of the admirers of your iron firmness. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that's</b> what you keep for your enemies. But they seem to think that in Matt's case you ought to have been more of a Roman father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so. <b>I</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{the letter}} was left for father"--pointing to Bill Cashaw--"after he started for the ranch. I don't see how they can help but swallow the story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Major, {{that all}} right. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{when they travel}} with Little Bonsa, they must keep Lent like pious Roman Catholic family that live near Yarleys. They catch plenty fish in river, and perhaps we shoot game, or rich 'potamus, which they like 'cause he fat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “‘I expect, sir,’ I said, ‘that when we {{get hold}} of a few prime seamen, and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they are as sure of prize-money with you {{as if it was}} already divided, they will soon spread the news, and we shall not be long before we fill up.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{trust me}} for that, sir. I know where {{lots of them}} are lying hid, not because they don’t want to serve, but because they want a good ship and a good captain. When <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it is a fine ship, and a good captain, and a good first and second, they will jump at it.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then,' cried Bernez, 'I will {{divide the}} jewels amongst {{everybody}} in the world, {{so that they may}} be wealthy and happy; and <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it is Rozennik who would have it so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} let them hurt you," [...] she said sturdily. [...] "They are serfs, and when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> who <b>I</b> am they will obey me, for if they don't <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> my father will have them all flogged to death." ...|$|R
60|$|They will be full {{of sympathy}} and talk about you when I get home, and <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> send their loves beforehand. They are all enclosed. The moment you feel hearty, just write me that word by post. I shall be so delighted to receive it.|$|R
6000|$|... "But was it?" [...] thought Billy. [...] "Didn't <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> I was dying? I {{thought so}} myself, {{and there is}} no reason why they shouldn't have thought so too. I suppose I shouldn't blame them, and I don't; but I wouldn't have left them that way and not come back. They had a warship full of blue jackets and marines--there wouldn't have been much danger to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{hope that}} my clients--the people of average opinions--have by this time some {{confidence}} in me; for when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that,</b> after all, Mr. Gladstone is of opinion that the [...] "Mosaic record" [...] was meant to give moral, and not scientific, instruction to those for whom it was written, they may be disposed to think that I must be misleading them. But let them listen further to what Mr. Gladstone says in a compendious but not exactly correct statement respecting my opinions:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am An-Tak, the Galu," [...] {{replied the}} man. [...] "Luata alone {{knows how long}} I have been here--maybe ten moons, maybe ten moons three times"--it was the Caspakian {{equivalent}} of thirty. [...] "I was young and strong when they brought me here. Now I am old and very weak. I am cos-ata-lu--that is why they have not killed me. If I tell them the secret of becoming cos-ata-lu they will take me out; but how can <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> which Luata alone knows? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--but what do I {{care for}} 'em?" [...] said Sally, with a toss of her head. [...] "Why they follow me, I don't see. I don't do {{anything}} to make <b>'em,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'em</b> all <b>that</b> they tire me to death; and still they will hang round. What is the reason, do you suppose?" ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{his friend}} Louis Kelsch, {{on the day of}} his death Broadbent said that he had not {{experienced}} any personal vision of heavenly messengers. However, Broadbent also commented, [...] "If they come to get me, <b>I</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am still in the work," [...] as he pointed to religious books he planned to mail.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} {{let us not}} deserve it, Mrs. O'Dwyer. There {{will be a lot}} of them at Gortnaclough to-morrow, and <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> we, on our side, won't be wanting. To give them their due, I must say that they are working well. That young Herbert Fitzgerald's a trump, whether he's Protestant or Catholic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you say? Impossible? Why, my friends, at {{this moment}} he is here in this theatre--skulking up there in that box. He is too shy to show himself--oh, a very modest gentleman. But there he is behind the curtains. Will you not show {{yourself}} to your friends, M. de La Tour d'Azyr, Monsieur le Marquis who considers eloquence so very dangerous a gift? See, they would like a word with you; {{they do not believe}} me when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> you are here." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{some people}} the serious {{nature of this}} may not at first be apparent. But they may {{appreciate}} the situation in some degree when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> on that occasion I suddenly found myself about twenty miles from home, fatigued, hungry, with the night descending over the wilderness, the thermometer about thirty-five below zero, of Fahrenheit's scale, with the snow for my bed, and without that all important flint, steel and tinder, wherewith to procure fire for the cooking of my food and the warming of my frame! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's {{all very}} well; that's all very well, my dear. But I am older than you, and time goes quick with me. I {{tell you it}} made me unhappy. I thought I wasn't doing my duty by you. I was {{beginning}} {{to know that you}} ought to have a house and servants of your own. People say that it is a great match for you; but <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it is a great match for him. Perhaps it is because you've been my own in a way, but I don't see any girl like you round the country.' ...|$|E
60|$|Pand. Was he angry, say you? true, he was so, and I {{know the}} cause. He was struck down {{yesterday}} in the battle, but he'll lay about him; he'll cry quittance with them to-day. I'll answer for him. And there's Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take heed of Troilus, <b>I</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> too.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{an article}} Sinkwich wrote in 1988, he grew to {{appreciate}} the value of competitiveness {{on the streets of}} Youngstown's west side. [...] "I learned early in neighborhood pickup games that I had the desire to compete", he wrote. [...] "When people ask why I succeeded in athletics, <b>I</b> always <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to get beat".|$|R
5000|$|Pollard also {{commented on}} the fact that GBV and his solo output are basicially the same, when he told Harp Magazine in 2005, [...] "You know, a lot of people try to {{distinguish}} things between what is Robert Pollard and what is Guided By Voices. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> basically <b>that</b> there is no difference; I am Robert Pollard and I am Guided By Voices." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have seen}} the fall of my tree in their bowls," [...] {{explained}} Nya to Noie, [...] "and ask me {{if it is a}} true vision. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> I am come here to die and that is why they are sad. This is the place of dying of all the Ghost-priests, whence they pass into the world of spirits, and here no blood may be shed, no, not that of the most wicked evil-doer. If any one of the family of the priests reaches this place living, the glory of the White Death is won. Follow and see." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate and Georgina unite {{with me in}} most cordial remembrances to Mrs. and Miss Stanfield, and to all the children. They particularise {{all sorts}} of messages, but <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they had better write {{themselves}} {{if they want to}} send any. Though I don't know that this writing would end in the safe deliverance of the commodities after all; for when I began this letter, I meant to give utterance to all kinds of heartiness, my dear Stanfield; and I {{come to the end of}} it without having said anything more than that I am--which is new to you--under every circumstance and everywhere, ...|$|E
60|$|I {{fear that}} many ladies will condemn Miss Amedroz when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> she showed this {{letter to her}} cousin Will. It does not promise well {{for any of the}} parties {{concerned}} when a young woman with two lovers can bring herself to show the love-letters of him to whom she is engaged to the other lover whom she has refused! But I have two excuses to put forward in Clara's defence. In the first place, Captain Aylmer's love-letters were not in truth love-letters, but were letters of business; and in the next place, Clara was teaching herself to regard Will Belton as her brother, and to forget that he had ever assumed the part of a lover.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sent to you!" [...] they exclaimed, in {{a chorus}} of protest and derision. And how, indeed, was I to make good my claim? The Peterses, when assembled, were a clan, led by Julia and in matters of controversy, moved as one. How was <b>I</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> in answer to my prayers for twenty-five cents, God had deemed five all that was good for me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{think on}} 't, I think <b>I</b> hearn <b>'em</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> dat ar road was all fenced {{up and down}} by der creek, and thar, an't it, Andy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then, Richards and Herbert {{will make}} the third party. After breakfast we can pick out the twelve strongest of the natives. <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they have to work, but {{that they will be}} each paid half a rupee a day in {{addition}} to their ordinary wages. Then you will give a general supervision to the work, Bathurst, in addition to your own share in it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, they come. Last {{night they}} say they not come, too much afraid of dwarf. But I settle their hash. I tell them I save up bits of their hair and toe nails when they no thinking, and I mix it with medicine, and if they not come, they die every one before they get home. They think me great doctor and they believe. Perhaps they die if they go on. If so, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> because they want show white feather, and they think me greater doctor still. Oh! they come, they come, no fear, or else Jeekie know reason why. Now, here coffee, Major. Drink him hot before you go take tub, but keep in shallow water, because {{crocodile}} he very early riser." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have not}} once, to man or woman, pretended {{to tell their}} fortune. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{the whole thing is}} a joke; that I will look into the crystal for them if they wish it, or read their hands, but I do not profess to tell their fortunes. What I see I will tell them. It may {{interest}} them or it may not. If it does, I ask them to give me something as a present. Of course, I see that they always do that. But you are quite right, Bertrand. Every one of our shows is being watched. Besides that fellow this afternoon I had two detectives yesterday, and a woman whom I am doubtful about, who keeps on coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} and find you a better place to-morrow, Robert. I am {{going to see the}} people with whom Maître Leroux is in hiding. I hear that they have no sympathy with these butchers, and when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> you are stout fellows and good fighters methinks they will find {{quarters}} for you; and {{you may be able to}} put on safer disguises than those you wear at present, except that of Tom's, which I think we cannot better. Besides, he can lie there quietly, and need not, except when he chooses, sally out. I myself am lodging at present among the butchers. I hear that Caboche and the Legoix are furious at our having slipped through their fingers, and they declare that, as we cannot have escaped from Paris, they will lay hands on us very soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish there}} were more people in your country," [...] replied the trader, [...] "who felt as you do. <b>I</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that,</b> {{although}} a trader, I regard the salvation of men's souls {{as the most important}} work in this world. I would argue that until you get men to listen, you cannot preach the gospel to them; that the present system of trade in Africa is in itself antagonistic to religion, being based upon dishonesty, and that, therefore, the natives will not listen to missionaries--of course, in some cases they will; for I believe that the gospel, when truly preached, is never preached in vain--but they will throw every possible impediment in their way. <b>I</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{in order to make the}} path of the missionary practicable, the system of trade must be inverted, the trader and the missionary must go hand in hand, and commerce and religion--although incomparably different in their nature and ends--must act the part of brother and sister if anything great is to be done for the poor natives of Africa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I might {{seek help}} at Lyons or Moulins. I might find loyal {{soldiers}} {{who would be}} willing to follow me by virtue of my warrant to levy such help as I may require, if <b>I</b> but <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the help was refused me in Grenoble. I am not sure that it would be so, for, unfortunately, my warrant is for the Seneschal of Dauphiny only. Still, I might make the attempt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, of course, we {{must have}} a {{military}} band and fireworks, and we had better have a big platform put down for those who like to dance, and a lot of shows and things for the elders and children, and a conjurer with a big lucky basket, and things of that sort. Of course, at present one cannot give even an approximate date, but <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they shall have a fortnight's notice." ...|$|R
