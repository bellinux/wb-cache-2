25|$|A {{tripartite}} Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (MM) would {{monitor and}} verify {{implementation of the}} agreement and compliance with the rules governing the ceasefire and <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons.</b> The MM would be integrated by representatives of the Colombian government, the FARC and an International Component made up of unarmed United Nations (UN) observers from Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) member states. The mechanism would have three instances or levels: one national, eight regional verifying structures and 'some' local monitoring structures. The International Component would preside over {{all levels of the}} mechanism, resolve disagreements (such as incidents and violations of the ceasefire or disarmament), present recommendations and present written reports.|$|E
25|$|The {{decommissioning}} {{would take}} place gradually over 6 months (180 days) from the formal signature of the final agreement ('D-day'). From the fifth to thirtieth day following D-day, the FARC would move to the ZVTN transporting all their individual and secondary weapons, militia armament, grenades and ammunition. The formal <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> would begin once {{all members of the}} FARC have reached the zones. The collection and storage of weapons {{would take place}} in three phases: 30% of weapons by D+90, an additional 30% of weapons by D+120 and the remaining 40% by D+150. By D+180 at the latest, or six months from the signature of the final agreement, the UN would have completed the process of extraction of weapons and would certify compliance of this process and duly inform public opinion. The bilateral ceasefire and the functioning the zones would end on D+180.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> is a [...] "technical, {{traceable}} and verifiable procedure {{through which}} the UN receives all the weapons of the FARC to destine them {{to the construction of}} 3 monuments" [...] The FARC's decommissioning would involve the following technical procedures: registration, identification, monitoring and verification of possession, collection, storage, disablement, removal and final disposition. In short, after the UN registers, identifies and verifies possession of weapons, it would collect all of the FARC's weapons, store them in specific containers, remove them from the zone and disposes of them by building three monuments.|$|E
2500|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, when it {{came into}} existence, Northern Ireland was marked by {{discrimination}} and hostility between these two sides in what First Minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble called a [...] "cold house" [...] for Catholics. In the late 1960s, conflict between state forces and chiefly Protestant unionists on the one hand, and chiefly Catholic nationalists on the other, erupted into three decades of violence known as the Troubles, which claimed over 3,500 lives and caused over 50,000 casualties. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement was a major step in the peace process, including the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> although sectarianism and religious segregation still remain major social problems, and sporadic violence has continued.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} was gradually scaled down from 1998, after the Good Friday Agreement, when patrols were suspended and several military barracks closed or dismantled, {{even before the}} beginning <b>of</b> IRA's <b>decommissioning.</b> The process <b>of</b> demilitarisation started in 1994, after the first IRA ceasefire. From the second IRA ceasefire in 1997 until the first act <b>of</b> <b>decommission</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> in 2001, almost 50% of the army bases had been vacated or demolished along with surveillance sites and holding centers, while more than 100 cross-border roads were reopened.|$|R

50|$|According to {{data from}} the International Atomic Energy Agency, world {{production}} of mined uranium has peaked twice in the past: once, circa 1960 in response to stockpiling for military use, and again in 1980, in response to stockpiling for use in commercial nuclear power. Up until about 1990, the mined uranium production was in excess of consumption by power plants. But since 1990, consumption by power plants has outstripped the uranium being mined; the deficit being made up by liquidation of the military (through <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>weapons)</b> and civilian stockpiles. Uranium mining has increased since the mid-1990s, but is still less than the consumption by power plants.|$|R

5000|$|Along with Jackie McDonald and Billy McFarland, fellow brigadiers on the UDA's Inner Council, Gregg {{was lacking}} in {{enthusiasm for the}} Belfast Agreement when it {{appeared}} in 1998. Throughout 1999 his brigade continued to be active, undertaking a pipe bomb campaign against Catholic homes whilst on 12 May members of his brigade shot and wounded a Catholic builder in Carrickfergus under the cover name [...] "Protestant Liberation Force". Much of this activity was inspired by Gregg's personal hatred of Catholics. A senior police source once described {{him as a man}} driven by [...] "pure and absolute bigotry". Gregg was also characterised as [...] "a bully, a racketeer, and a sectarian bigot who took particular delight in carrying out vicious punishment attacks and randomly targeting Roman Catholics." [...] In 2000 he helped to ensure that a proposal before the Inner Council to initiate the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> was rejected.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the republican}} side, the [...] "No" [...] {{campaign}} seemed {{to concentrate on}} the purity of the republican ideal of complete and absolute independence from Britain. In this view any compromise, however temporary, on the goal of Irish unity (or the right to pursue the armed struggle) was depicted as a betrayal of those who had fought and died for Ireland. <b>Decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> and an end to paramilitary activity was portrayed as surrender to the British. The principle of consent was represented as a unionist veto, as it meant political progress would be almost impossible without unionist participation. It was pointed out that the agreement accepted partition. The state and its institutions would remain hostile to the republican community, claimed the critics. Despite these misgivings, the vast majority of republicans voted yes, with only some tiny unrepresentative parties (such as Republican Sinn Féin) on the nationalist side advocating a No vote.|$|E
50|$|Hutchinson {{was also}} {{nominated}} by the UVF as {{their point of}} contact with John de Chastelain and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and he helped to ensure the eventual <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> some UVF <b>weapons</b> in 2009. This was {{despite the fact that}} Hutchinson had been a noted sceptic on the issue and had criticised David Trimble because of it, arguing that his insistence on republican decommissioning was in fact damaging the peace process.|$|R
40|$|It {{is hoped}} that future nuclear arms control {{treaties}} will call for the dismantlement of stored nuclear warheads. To make the authenticated <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>weapons</b> agreeable, methods must be developed to validate the structure and composition of nuclear warheads without it being possible to gain knowledge about these attributes. Nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) imaging potentially enables the physically-encrypted verification <b>of</b> nuclear <b>weapons</b> {{in a manner that}} would meet treaty requirements. This thesis examines the physics behind NRF, develops tools for processing resonance data, establishes methodologies for simulating information gain during warhead verification, and tests potential inference processes. The influence of several inference parameters are characterized, and success is shown in predicting the properties of an encrypting foil and the thickness of a warhead in a one-dimensional verification scenario. by William DeMaio.

2500|$|The Troubles {{were brought}} to an uneasy end by a peace process which {{included}} the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations and the complete <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> their <b>weapons,</b> the reform <b>of</b> the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets and from sensitive border areas such as South Armagh and Fermanagh, as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the [...] "Good Friday Agreement"). This reiterated the long-held British position, which {{had never before been}} fully acknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern Ireland decides otherwise. The Constitution of Ireland was amended in 1999 to remove a claim of the [...] "Irish nation" [...] to sovereignty over the entire island (in Article 2), a claim qualified by an acknowledgement that Ireland could only exercise legal control over the territory formerly known as the Irish Free State.|$|R
50|$|During 1998 {{the party}} {{suffered}} {{a significant amount}} of internal turmoil. O'Brien published an article in which he called for unionists to consider and embrace the idea of a United Ireland (in order to challenge the growth in popularity of Sinn Féin) - an idea that was anathema to most in the UKUP. He subsequently resigned from the party. In December the party split over the issue of Sinn Féin taking up its seats in the power-sharing executive without prior Provisional Irish Republican Army <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons.</b> McCartney proposed that if this should happen, the five UKUP members should resign their seats in protest, but this was opposed by the other assembly members. At a party meeting at which the other four were absent, McCartney censured his Assembly colleagues over this split. The two sides both argued that they had the support of the grassroots members of the party. On 5 January 1999, all four left the UKUP to form the Northern Ireland Unionist Party (NIUP), leaving McCartney as the sole UKUP representative in the assembly.|$|E
5000|$|Although the UDA {{was officially}} on ceasefire, the South East Antrim Brigade {{remained}} active in late 1998 and early 1999, undertaking {{a series of}} pipe bomb attacks on Catholic properties. These were carried out under the Red Hand Defenders cover name, with some attacks also blamed on the Orange Volunteers who were active in similar attacks at the time. Gregg, who was noted for his sectarian beliefs, insisted that such attacks were {{necessary in order to}} prevent the [...] "greening" [...] of places such as Carrickfergus and Antrim, a process he claimed had already happened in Glengormley where the Catholic population had experienced significant growth. Around this time Gregg spearheaded an initiative to significantly increase recruitment into the South East Antrim Brigade. He told author Ian S. Wood that he had only supported the Combined Loyalist Military Command ceasefire in an effort to ensure the release of imprisoned friends. In 2000, he helped to ensure that a proposal before the Inner Council to initiate the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> was rejected. Trevor Lowry (aged 49) was beaten to death in Glengormley by UDA members under Gregg's command on 11 April 2001 after he was mistaken for a Catholic.|$|E
40|$|Power-sharing {{government}} resumed in Northern Ireland on 8 May 2007 after {{a historic}} {{agreement was reached}} between the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein. Unionist Ian Paisley became First Minister and Sinn Fein’s Martin McGuinness, former Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), became Deputy First Minister. The Provisional Republican movement has signed up to the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> and policing in Northern Ireland; and hard-line Unionism has signed up to power-sharing and cross-border bodies. For the vast majority in Northern Ireland the conflict is over after almost a century of political turmoil {{and more than a}} generation of violent conflict. It is fitting, therefore, to examine the ‘war of ideas ’ in the revisionist controversy that dominated Irish historiography throughout the period of this conflict. The {{purpose of this article is}} to offer an overview of this controversy. The writing on the Easter Rising of 1916 serves to illuminate the discussion and will aid in answering the issue of what the revisionist controversy is all about.

2500|$|In October 2009, after a {{long period}} of inactivity, the Official IRA began talks with a view to <b>decommissioning</b> its {{stockpile}} <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> and in February 2010 the Newry-based Official Republican Movement announced that the process was complete. The process was confirmed to be completed by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning on 8 February 2010, coming in the last 24 hours of the commission's existence. The decommissioning was completed {{at the same time as}} that of the republican INLA and the loyalist UDA South East Antrim Brigade. The step was described by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a [...] "central part of moving Northern Ireland from violence to peace".|$|R
40|$|The Nationalist {{minority}} in Northern Ireland {{is protected by}} the Agreement. One of the principles to which both Sinn Fein and the Progressive Unionist Party agreed in 1997 was that they gave their 2 ̆ 2 total and absolute commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations. 2 ̆ 2 It is important for a U.

But if one of the parties in a coalition has an association with a paramilitary organization that is refusing in principle to disarm itself that party is likely to rely in its coalition negotiations on something more than just the weight of votes that it has in the Dail. A party associated with a paramilitary organization has, at all times, an extra lever in negotiations because a paramilitary organization is an organization that has held onto the means to use violence to achieve its ends...|$|R
