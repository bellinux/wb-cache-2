50|$|The label was <b>dormant</b> (with ABC <b>Records</b> {{distributing the}} label's back catalog during that time) from 1970 to early 1972, when the label was revived as 20th Century Records.|$|R
5000|$|The label's first {{release was}} the 1987 album A Texas Trip, a various artists {{compilation}} which was co-released by Caroline Records. Following 1989's Double Live, a limited edition release documenting the band's 1988 tour, Latino Buggerveil became largely <b>dormant</b> as a <b>record</b> company and was instead {{used as the}} new name for the group's publishing company, which until that point was known as [...] "Second Harvest." ...|$|R
50|$|Since its re-release, La Gigantona {{has been}} a success and Lovo {{has been the subject}} of many reviews and {{interviews}} worldwide, including praises from BBC music critic Gilles Peterson radio personality in London, Relix Magazine, Dusted Magazine, Radio Nacional de Colombia, and many more international stations, and several TV shows. La Gigantona has become a well-known name, and in November 14, it reached # 4 in Billboard, Tropical music category. A new version of Wolf and The Pack has been formed in Miami, with Latin jazz players, and new performances have been seen up to the end of 2012, of La Gigantona, considered a <b>dormant</b> hit <b>record,</b> that {{has been a}}wakened by Numero Group, the reissue label from Chicago.|$|R
5000|$|After its {{eruption}} in 1996, {{the volcano}} entered {{a period of}} dormancy, the longest it had been <b>dormant</b> since <b>records</b> of its eruptions have been kept. This period ended on August 15, 2007, with {{the start of a}} new eruption involving seismic disturbances and a [...] "vigorous eruption of lava." [...] Scientists said that the volcano [...] "could be working toward a massive eruption that could affect air travel but was not expected to threaten any of the towns in the area." [...] The eruption ended on September 13. The volcano erupted again on May 13, 2013, but activity had greatly diminished by July 3, 2013, and on August 8, 2013, the Current Volcano Alert Level was reduced to NORMAL and the Current Aviation Color Code reduced to GREEN.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Dmitry Yakubovskiy was {{appointed}} as {{new head of}} the Task Force of the Ministry of Defense (Western Troops of the UdSSR) (Germany). Not after long he was relieved of this duty after multiple complaints from the Germans were filed as he was too active in <b>recording</b> <b>dormant</b> asset claims in favor of the UdSSR.After leaving the Task Force he worked as a representative of Agrochim (Ex-Departement of Agriculture) in the city of Basel, Switzerland.|$|R
5000|$|The {{issue was}} ignited by Lieutenant Governor Joseph Royal reading the Speech from the Throne in French on 31 October 1888. The outcry caused Royal {{to read his}} second throne speech in English only. On 28 October 1889, the issue was made <b>dormant</b> when a <b>Record</b> Division was taken on the [...] "Language Resolution", a motion that stated the {{assembly}} did not need official recognition of languages. The vote was 17 for 2 against. But this did not last, {{because the federal government}} got involved, and warned the Lt. Governor Royal to start making speeches in French again, and tried to legislate official bilingualism back in the territory, through the Canadian House of Commons. The bill was defeated on second reading, however.|$|R
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} college, Masucci was handed two film {{canisters}} {{of the movie}} Our Latin Thing by his brother and told to form a company and distribute the film. This {{was the beginning of}} A&R Film Distributors, cofounded with partner Ray Aviles. A&R proceeded with four wall distribution in New York, Puerto Rico, Chicago, Venezuela, Panama and Colombia, handling advertising and distribution for Our Latin Thing. Following the film's release, Masucci helped produce live concerts for the Fania All-Stars. The first major concert was held at Yankee Stadium on Friday, August 24, 1973 and was attended by 45,000 people. The concert is included in the second set of 50 recordings preserved by the National Recording Registry. The second major concert was in 1974 featuring Celia Cruz performing with the Fania All Stars at the Stadu du Hai in Kinshasa, Zaire and attended by 80,000 people. In 1975, Fania Records produced two albums from the Yankee Stadium concert, Live at the Yankee Stadium Volumes 1&2, as well as a film of the live concert titled [...] "Salsa." [...] Masucci became Vice President of Fania in 1976, producing concerts around the country and at Madison Square Garden in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978. In 1978, Masucci left Fania for Island Records at the request of founder Chris Blackwell in order to head Island's Special Projects division. While there, Masucci signed and produced hit albums for Invisible Man's Band, including [...] "All Night Thing," [...] and Third World (band)'s hit single [...] "Now That We Found Love." [...] Masucci also coordinated production on the film featuring Third World (band) titled [...] "Prisoner in the Street." [...] He was also instrumental in orchestrating the breakthrough of Bob Marley into urban radio in the United States. During that time, Masucci and Clarence Burke Jr., formerly of the Five Stairsteps and lead singer of the [...] "Invisible Man's Band," [...] cowrote and produced most of the songs on both [...] "Invisible Man's Band" [...] albums.In 1981, music and film industry visionary Neil Bogart urged Masucci to join his label Boardwalk Records. Masucci and Burke Jr. had previously formed Seduction Productions and agreed to sign with Boardwalk, joining a group of artists including Joan Jett, Ringo Starr and Curtis Mayfield.In the early 1990s, Masucci re-partnered with his brother Jerry and formed a new Salsa label called Cache'. This was to {{be the beginning of a}} new era for the Masucci brothers, aimed a reactivating the then largely <b>dormant</b> Fania <b>Records</b> label group with a plan to take Fania public. Sadly, Jerry passed away before those plans could be realized. In 1997, Chris Blackwell again reached out to Masucci and asked him to head his new Latin music label, Island Miami. Masucci accepted. After Blackwell's departure from Island/PolyGram, Blackwell and Masucci signed a joint venture between Masucci Entertainment and Blackwell's newly formed Palm Pictures, signing Cuban artist Carlos Manuel y su Clan. Masucci was executive producer on the album released in 2001. Masucci has recently formed Haz-Mat Entertainment, and is developing film and music projects, as well as a documentary on the history of Fania Records.|$|R
40|$|Following mineral-sand mining in the {{northern}} sandplains near Eneabba, southwestern Australia, rehabilitation managers have {{the difficult task of}} restoring shrubland communities of exceptional plant species richness. Management aims to restore a fully functional and self-sustaining shrubland community with similar vegetation and resilience properties to that of the surrounding natural vegetation. This thesis examines the performance of the restoration program by Iluka Resources Ltd. (and their predecessors) by comparing current vegetation properties and their response to fires on previously mined land versus the surrounding natural shrubland. As biomass accumulates post-restoration, fires will return as a natural disturbance factor and, as a result, a desirable measure of restoration success might include the ability of the postmined lands to recover from disturbance. Pre-burnt plant species diversity, composition, structure and key functional attributes in four mined sites rehabilitated 8 (R 8) to 24 (R 24) years ago were compared with those of surrounding natural areas classified on the basis of substrate type (low and high sand dunes, shallow sand swales, sand over laterite and sand over limestone). The rehabilitated sites (except R 8) had more species (about 140) than natural sites (about 100) with 12 – 37 % species in common with natural sites. Floristic composition was most similar to the local swales and dunes (physically closest). Two strong colonizers, the fire-killed Acacia blakelyi and the fire-tolerant Melaleuca leuropoma, were universally present. Plant densities were about a quarter to half those of natural sites. Fire-resprouters were under-represented. Growth-form distributions were most {{similar to those of the}} dunes, with some woody shrubs up to 2. 5 m tall present. Greater iron levels and soil hardness (penetrability) were the only soil factors consistently greater in rehabilitated sites. Following experimental fires at the same study sites, species richness fell by 22 – 41 % in rehabilitated sites but increased by 4 – 29 % in natural sites. Species present before fire were reduced by 40 – 56 % in rehabilitated sites and 4 – 12 % in natural sites. Only 42 – 66 % of resprouting species recovered in rehabilitated sites, whereas 96 – 100 % recovered in natural sites. Nonsprouting species recruitment was also lower in rehabilitated (18 – 57 %) than natural (67 – 85 %) sites. Seedling mortality over the first summer after fire was higher in rehabilitated sites (59 - 86 % death of individuals) than in natural sites (14 - 60 %). PCoA ordination showed that fire altered the floristic composition of rehabilitated sites much more than it did in natural sites, mostly attributable to the loss of the extant resprouter species. It was found that the smaller lignotuber size (source of <b>dormant</b> buds) <b>recorded</b> in rehabilitated (vs. natural) resprouters was responsible for their higher post-fire mortality. For equivalent crown size in ten common lignotuberous shrub species, lignotuber circumferences were, on average, 50 % smaller at rehabilitated sites. As a result, overall persistence in these species was much lower in rehabilitated (mean of 52 % alive, range of 11 – 93 %) versus natural sites (mean of 96 %, range of 79 – 100 %), but improved with time since restoration for five of the ten selected species. Apart from differences in the age of the plants (natural sites having much older plants recruited after previous fires), the lower soil penetrability at rehabilitated sites may have restricted lignotuber development. A tradeoff favoring a higher crown volume to lignotuber size ratio was also apparent in nine of the ten species with greater crown volumes (by 37 %) and smaller lignotubers (by 36 %) in rehabilitated sites. Demographic attributes for six selected woody species were compared between rehabilitated and natural sites (~ 3 - 30 years since disturbance) to investigate growth patterns and optimum fire-return intervals. At matched years since restoration or last fire, nonsprouter species in rehabilitated sites grew larger (1. 1 to 4. 7 times) and produced/stored more viable seeds per plant (1. 1 to 10. 9 times). Despite older aged individuals in natural sites at matched years since restoration vs. last fire, restored resprouters were larger (1. 1 to 3. 6 times) and produced/stored more viable seeds (1. 1 to 6. 9 times). Although greater growth and fecundity rates were recorded in rehabilitated sites, the estimated optimum fire-return interval based on maximum seed production was similar in rehabilitated and natural sites for five out of six species. However, mean fire intervals typical of surrounding natural vegetation near the Eneabba area (13 years over the last 40 years) may not be suitable for rehabilitated minesites at Eneabba, whereby longer initial fire intervals (20 – 30 years) would better ensure persistence of resprouter individuals via the seedling recruitment strategy and resprouting strategy. Iv My study indicated that the returned vegetation can at present be classified as “rehabilitated” or “partially restored” but not “completely restored” since the original plant diversity, composition, structure, and resilience properties to fire have not yet been achieved. It may not be possible/realistic to achieve complete restoration since mining is such a destructive disturbance type that some complex ecological attributes may take centuries to develop. I discuss six key factors as important in improving the overall restoration success at Eneabba: 1) restoration of a deeper topsoil and looser subsoil profile; 2) collection of appropriate amounts of only local provenance species, mulch and topsoil; 3) control of highly competitive species; 4) management of fertilizer additions; 5) reseeding and replanting in subsequent years after the initial restoration treatments, including after initial fires; and 6) delaying the introduction of management fires until the restored vegetation develops sufficient fire-resilience properties...|$|R
