It shows that neglecting heterogeneity and dynamics can lead to misleading inferences about the key determinants of savings behavior. The results indicate that among the many variables considered in the literature only the fiscal variables—the <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>surplus</b> as a proportion of GDP and the ratio of government consumption to GDP—are important determinants of private savings rates in the industrial countries in the post-World War II period. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} economic {{developments in}} Luxembourg during the 1990 s. Economic performance {{continues to be}} exceptional in Luxembourg. Growth averaged 6 percent during 1980 s, well above the European average, while the inflation and unemployment rates ranked among the very lowest. In 1994, Luxembourg was the only European industrialized country to run a <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>surplus.</b> Luxembourg also had the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio, the largest current account surplus, and possibly the highest real saving in this group. These successes are attributable {{at least in part}} to the skillful management of policy to facilitate structural change. ...|$|E

Inflation has declined further to 6. 4 percent in December (year-over-year). Gross international reserves of the National Bank of Kazakhstan have risen to US$ 2. 5 billion, which provides for about three months of import coverage. The <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>surplus</b> is projected to be about 3. 3 percent of GDP in 2001, on account of higher oil revenue, but also reflecting economic buoyancy. ...|$|E

An imminent recession became clear by mid-2008. Subsequently, government deficits increased, many businesses closed and unemployment increased. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) fell and many immigrant workers left.|$|R
40|$|France has a {{track record}} of {{persistent}} <b>general</b> <b>government</b> deficits, partly reflecting pro-cyclical fiscal policies in upswings. This has resulted in a quadrupling of its public debt-to-GDP ratio since the 1970 s to above 80 % of GDP. Reducing public debt is crucial because a high level of public debt may hamper long-term growth and may have a direct impact on fiscal sustainability if long-term interest rates rise. Bringing back public debt to 60 % of GDP even by 2030 would require a fiscal effort of 4 to 5 percentage points of GDP (under the assumption of unchanged long-term rates), implying permanent primary <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>surpluses,</b> which is very ambitious in view of French fiscal history since 1970. The government?s consolidation programme, which is aimed at reducing the <b>general</b> <b>government</b> deficit to 3 % of GDP by 2013, represents around two-thirds of this effort. This study analyses how fiscal governance could be improved by the creation of a structural deficit rule and looks at ways the public deficit could be lowered. With France already having a very large public sector, most of the effort should be borne by holding down spending. Better control of the public wage bill, increasing public-sector efficiency and tackling age-related costs are the obvious candidates to contain expenditure. On the revenue side, there is significant potential for cutting tax expenditures. Furthermore, eliminating distortions in the tax base would encourage economic growth. public debt, healthcare, government spending, fiscal rule, fiscal council, <b>general</b> <b>government</b> deficit, local governments, tax expenditure, pension system, structural deficit, tax revenues...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the findings from}} {{a case study of}} the 2004 – 05 annual budgets prepared by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments of Australia. The study examined the headline budget balance (<b>general</b> <b>government</b> sector <b>surplus</b> or deficit) announced in the budget papers and speeches of each of the nine governments. Findings indicate the adoption of varying measurement bases and a consequent lack of comparability in the headlined budget balance numbers. Accounting reforms have resulted in adoption of two different systems of accrual accounting by governments — the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) system and the professional Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) system — which provide significantly different measurements of the budget balance. However, there has been no prescription of the manner in which these alternative measures should be presented. This raises a number of questions from an accounting perspective. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which the conclusions of cross-country studies of private savings are robust to allowing for the possible heterogeneity of savings behaviour across countries and for the inclusion of dynamics. It reviews the econometric implications of neglected slope heterogeneity and dynamics for the fixed effects estimators routinely used in such studies, and illustrates the nature and extent of the biases involved by a re-examination of time series data from 21 OECD countries. The paper shows that neglecting heterogeneity and dynamics in cross-country savings regressions can lead to misleading inferences about the key determinants of savings behaviour. The results indicate that among the many variables considered in the literature only the fiscal variables - the <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>surplus</b> as a proportion of GDP and the ratio of government consumption to GDP - seem to be the key determinants of private savings rates in the industrial countries in the post-World War II perio...|$|E

The study examined the headline financial outcome (<b>general</b> <b>government</b> sector <b>surplus</b> or deficit) announced in the budget papers of each of the nine governments. Findings indicate the adoption of varying measurement bases and a consequent lack of comparability in the headlined budget outcome numbers. Accounting reforms have resulted in a variety of cash and accrual based measurements becoming available for presentation by governments. However, there has been no prescription of the manner in which these alternative measures are to be presented, resulting in a lack of consistency and comparability. It is not surprising in this reporting environment that different governments would choose to headline different budget outcome numbers in their budget announcements. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effect of fiscal rules in Stage Three of EMU for France and Germany, Bayoumi and Eichengreen's (1992) {{structural}} VAR analysis is extended by including the <b>general</b> <b>government</b> financial <b>surplus</b> and conditioning by external variables. This allows a distinction between fiscal and monetary shocks. During the period 1972. 1 - 1995. 4, monetary policy has {{a significant effect on}} prices in both countries. On the other hand, fiscal shocks, whose effect on the deficit provides a measure of the " structural deficit ", only contribute to {{a significant part of the}} dynamics of output in Germany. For that period, they appear to have little effect in France. In addition, fiscal shocks are uncorrelated between the two countries, although it is difficult to conclude that it reflects purely idiosyncratic shocks rather than a different policy-mix.

40|$|The {{government}} sector in Australia {{has seen the}} introduction of accrual accounting principles in recent years. However, this process has been complicated {{by the presence of}} two alternative financial reporting frameworks in the form of a) the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) uniform framework and b) the accrual accounting rules specified in Australian professional accounting standards, principally AAS 31. While a variety of cash and accrual based measurements are available pursuant to these frameworks, there has been no prescription of {{the manner in which the}} alternative measures should be presented. This paper presents the findings from a case study of the 2005 - 06 annual budgets prepared by the Australian Commonwealth government and the governments of the six Australian States and the two Australian Territories. The study examined the headlined financial outcome (<b>general</b> <b>government</b> sector budget <b>surplus</b> or deficit) announced in the budget papers of the nine governments. Findings indicate the adoption of varying measurement bases and a consequent lack of inter-government comparability. A number of variations to the measurements prescribed in the accounting frameworks were also observed. The paper analyses these <b>government</b> budget <b>surplus</b> and deficit numbers in the context of fiscal responsibility, the Commonwealth government’s Charter of Budget Honesty and the AASB’s current GAAP/GFS Convergence project.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 95 - 102. From 1973 to 1997 South Africa's {{fiscal stance}} has {{undergone}} large fluctuations. The primary {{balance of the}} <b>general</b> <b>government</b> recorded a <b>surplus</b> of 3. 8 % of GDP in 1990 and a deficit equivalent to 4. 5 % of GDP in both 1977 and 1994. This paper identifies ten episodes of fiscal adjustment, defined as a fiscal year during which the primary deficit was reduced by more than 1. 5 % of GDP. It then assesses {{the success of these}} episodes, according to the evolution of the debt ratio two or three years after the adjustment. In South Africa there have been two episodes of successful fiscal adjustment: in 1978 and in 1980. The paper proceeds by analysing the size and the composition of the various fiscal adjustments. It shows that successful fiscal adjustments are generally smaller than unsuccessful ones. On the taxation side, successful adjustments rely mainly on non-tax revenue, whereas unsuccessful ones record large increases in direct taxation. Generally the adjustment is mostly felt on the expenditure side. As in most developing countries, capital expenditure is the main target for cuts. However, the size of the reduction in capital expenditure is smaller in successful adjustments. Furthermore, these adjustments record spending cuts in all categories of expenditure, contrary to unsuccessful contractions. It seems that successful adjustments rely on temporary tax increases and permanent spending cuts...|$|R
