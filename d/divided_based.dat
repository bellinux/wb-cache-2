5|$|According to the 2015 Louisiana Laws Revised Statutes, {{residents}} of any unincorporated area may propose to incorporate as a municipality if the area meets prescribed minimum population thresholds. Municipal corporations are <b>divided</b> <b>based</b> on population into three classes: cities, towns, and villages. Those having five thousand inhabitants or more {{are classified as}} cities; those having less than five thousand but more than one thousand inhabitants are classified as towns; and those having one thousand or fewer inhabitants are classified as villages. The governor may change the classification of the municipality if the board of aldermen requests a change and a census shows that the population has increased or decreased making it eligible for a different classification. Municipalities are granted powers to perform functions required by local governments including the levy and collection of taxes and to assume indebtedness.|$|E
5|$|The {{groups are}} <b>divided</b> <b>based</b> on their {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars feed {{off of the}} ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having evolved from the teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having evolved from the arion-Phengaris group. Another way these groups are categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) {{to attract the attention of}} the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, which is part of the teleius group.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the Lesser Antilles {{encompasses}} the music of this chain of small islands making up the eastern and southern portion of the West Indies. Lesser Antillean music {{is part of the}} broader category of Caribbean music; much of the folk and popular music is also a part of the Afro-American musical complex, being a mixture of African, European and indigenous American elements. The Lesser Antilles' musical cultures are largely based on the music of African slaves brought by European traders and colonizers. The African musical elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous West African tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from India. In many ways, the Lesser Antilles can be musically <b>divided</b> <b>based</b> on which nation colonized them.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, {{the school}} follows the National Curriculum in Years 7–11 {{and offers a}} broad range of GCSEs (national exams taken by {{students}} aged 14–16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16–18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and boys may opt to take the subject as part of their GCSE course. Although morning assemblies take place and are Christian in nature, they are non-denominational. Students participate in a number of educational visits and excursions throughout their school career and Year Eleven students participate in a nine-day work experience programme. The curriculum comprises English and Drama, Mathematics, French, Latin, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Art, Music, Design Technology, Religious Education, Physical Education (P.E.) and Games and Personal, Social and Health Education (P.S.H.E.). In the second year German is added and in Mathematics, students are <b>divided</b> <b>based</b> on their ability. The use of Information Technology is central to all teaching and is taught as a discrete subject in Years 7 and 8. Boys usually take ten subjects for GCSE, English (Language and Literature), Mathematics, a foreign language, all three separate sciences or Dual Certificate Science, supplemented by three other subjects from those listed above.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{development}} staff had {{an equal number}} of writers as illustrators, it was originally planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine. Though this would have simplified the project's workload by easing communications among the staff, the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces. Ultimately, writing and design responsibilities were <b>divided</b> <b>based</b> on the staff members' individual preferences. The staff also commented that {{the development}} team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios. Early in production, members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development, but as production progressed, they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls and instant messaging. Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for the writers and illustrators to communicate effectively, and during the development of To Heart 2 X Rated, Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{technical}} feasibility of whole-brain diffusional variance decomposition (<b>DIVIDE)</b> <b>based</b> on q-space trajectory encoding (QTE) at clinical MRI systems with varying performance. DIVIDE {{is used to}} separate diffusional heterogeneity into components that arise due to isotropic and anisotropic tissue structures. Methods: We designed imaging protocols for DIVIDE using numerically optimized gradient waveforms for diffusion encoding. Imaging was performed at systems with magnetic field strengths between 1. 5 and 7 T, and gradient amplitudes between 33 and 80 mT/m. Technical feasibility was assessed from signal characteristics and quality of parameter maps in a single volunteer scanned at all systems. Results: The technical feasibility of QTE and DIVIDE was demonstrated at all systems. The system {{with the highest performance}} allowed whole-brain DIVIDE at 2 mm isotropic voxels. The system with the lowest performance required a spatial resolution of 2. 5 x 2. 5 x 4 mm 3 to yield a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Conclusions: Whole-brain <b>DIVIDE</b> <b>based</b> on QTE is feasible at the investigated MRI systems. This demonstration indicates that tissue features beyond those accessible by conventional diffusion encoding may be explored {{on a wide range of}} MRI systems. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

2500|$|It was {{not until}} the {{beginning}} of the 19th century that it became clear that reptiles and amphibians are, in fact, quite different animals, and Pierre André Latreille erected the class Batracia (1825) for the latter, dividing the tetrapods into the four familiar classes of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley made Latreille's definition popular and, together with Richard Owen, expanded Reptilia to include the various fossil [...] "antediluvian monsters", including dinosaurs and the mammal-like (synapsid) Dicynodon he helped describe. This was not the only possible classification scheme: In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863, Huxley grouped the vertebrates into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids (the latter containing the fishes and amphibians). He subsequently proposed the names of Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the latter two groups. In 1866, Haeckel demonstrated that vertebrates could be <b>divided</b> <b>based</b> on their reproductive strategies, and that reptiles, birds, and mammals were united by the amniotic egg.|$|E
2500|$|Bilaterians can be <b>divided,</b> <b>based</b> {{on events}} that occur {{very early in}} {{embryonic}} development, into two groups (superphyla) called protostomes and deuterostomes. [...] Deuterostomes include vertebrates as well as echinoderms, hemichordates (mainly acorn worms), and Xenoturbellidans. Protostomes, the more diverse group, include arthropods, molluscs, and numerous types of worms. [...] There is a basic {{difference between the two}} groups in the placement of the nervous system within the body: [...] protostomes possess a nerve cord on the ventral (usually bottom) side of the body, whereas in deuterostomes the nerve cord is on the dorsal (usually top) side. [...] In fact, numerous aspects of the body are inverted between the two groups, including the expression patterns of several genes that show dorsal-to-ventral gradients. [...] Most anatomists now consider that the bodies of protostomes and deuterostomes are [...] "flipped over" [...] with respect to each other, a hypothesis that was first proposed by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire for insects in comparison to vertebrates. [...] Thus insects, for example, have nerve cords that run along the ventral midline of the body, while all vertebrates have spinal cords that run along the dorsal midline.|$|E

2500|$|The Ming Chinese {{refugees}} were mostly male immigrants who generally married local Vietnamese or Khmer women while fostering a strong Chinese cultural identity in their descendants. Chinese trade and immigration began to increase towards the earlier {{half of the}} 18th century as population and economic pressures encouraged more Chinese men to seek trade opportunities in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam. It was around this time that {{the descendants of the}} Ming Chinese refugeesoften referred to as Ming Huong Chinesebegin to foster a separate ethno-cultural identity from the newer Chinese immigrants, whom they refer to as [...] "Thanh Nhan (清人)", or Qing people. The Thanh Nhan form independent Chinese associations along the same dialect group or clans in cities and towns where large populations prevail, including Cholon, Hội An and some towns in the Mekong Delta. The Minh Huong Chinese also formed similar associations, and notable examples include the Đình Minh Hương Gia Thạnh in Cholon, and the Dinh Tien Hien Lang Minh Huong in Hội An. Both groups of Chinese were also very active in the interior affairs of Vietnamese society; notable Minh Huong Chinese such as Trinh Hoai Duc and Ngo Nhan Tinh who became ministers under the Nguyễn court during Gia Long's reign. Many Thanh Nhan Chinese also participated as ragtag militia during the Tây Sơn rebellion, although their loyalties were <b>divided</b> <b>based</b> on their location of residence.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} some of {{the causes}} of poor connectivity in developing countries, and suggests options for overcoming the so-termed digital <b>divide.</b> <b>Based</b> on a techno-economic analysis of connectivity technologies and design, I show that technical limitations per se are not the bottleneck for widespread connectivity; rather, design, policy, and regulatory challenges are the reasons for high costs (which determines penetration to a large extent). The first part of this paper deals with the “digital divide ” and a brief look at existing measures and difficulties with such measures, such as issues of granularity. I present a starting point for a new framework for the digital <b>divide,</b> <b>based</b> on what we call the 4 Cs of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) : Computers, Connectivity, Content, and (human) Capacity. The next section focuses on the Connectivity aspect of ICT, and examines cost components of different technologies. While there are obvious differences between technologies in terms of speeds, reach, and infrastructure, there are non-technical implications of such choices, such as legacy requirements, competition, leapfrogging, etc. Once we formulate a basic, indicative, network design for broadband, using estimated costs and some limited real-world emerging economy data, we can see what reasons there are for higher costs (and prices) than the model would indicate.
