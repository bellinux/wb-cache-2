40|$|This {{document}} {{provides information}} on the minimum requirements necessary for an emergency department {{to be considered for}} accreditation by ACEM for advanced training. Detail relating to periods of 6, 12 or 24 months accreditation is included. The guidelines will assist ACEM non-accredited emergency departments to ascertain their possible status prior to making an application for an inspection to the College. It will also assist ACEM accredited departments; and other key stakeholders, by providing clear references to the current requirements. The Board of Education (BOE) and Council recognises that emergency departments across Australia and New Zealand are a complex mix of factors, and therefore, some discretion may be applied when making decisions regarding accreditation. As a result, the meeting of these requirements does not provide a guarantee of ACEM accreditation for the training periods outlined. Similarly a department may not meet all these requirements but may offer other elements that would help it gain accreditation for one of the training periods outlined. The inspection visit and, the DEMT and trainee feedback received by the College, are considered the most important parts of the accreditation process and issues identified by those mechanisms will clearly {{play an important role in}} the final decision regarding accreditation. 2.
