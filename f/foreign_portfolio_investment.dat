The study explored on the various factors perceived to affect FPI to Kenya. Global trends were factored in the background of the study with an objective of finding those institutional factors that affect FPI.

The results indicate that there is a relationship between exchange rate regimes, inflation, and the governance or administration of the various assets listed at the NSE that attract FPI,. Those listed companies that had strong corporate earnings and practised good corporate governance continued to attract the highest attention from foreign investors.

40|$|The Paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} foreign direct <b>investments</b> (FDI) and <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments.</b> FDI is characterized by hands-on management style that enables the owner to obtain relatively refined information about the productivity of the firm.

In contrast, the results from nonlinear tests reveal a strong evidence of nonlinearity in returns throughout the sample period with a sign of tapering magnitude of nonlinear dependence in the recent period. The findings suggest that Indian stock market is moving towards efficiency.

In order to support the country’s economic growth, South Africa needs foreign capital in the form of foreign capital flows and these include both foreign direct investment and <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b> Given the low national savings rate in South Africa, foreign portfolio inflows {{play an important role in}} the sustenance of higher levels of investment and growth. The study employed the Johansen Cointegration technique to analyse the long-run relationship and the Vector Error Correction Model for the short-term interaction between variables. The long-run results illustrated that there is a negative relationship between Gross Domestic Product and <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment.</b> However in the short run the results indicate a positive relationship between <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investment</b> and gross domestic product.

The data for the study were source from the CBN statistical bulletin for the period 1984 to 2015.

The study used the Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) technique for data analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper empirically {{examines}} short- and long-run {{relationships between}} foreign direct investments (FDI) and volatility of <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investments</b> (FPI) in 12 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries.

The results strongly suggest that a decrease in FPI volatility is followed {{by an increase in}} FDI in the long-run, and this indicates economies that advance in capital liberalization benefit from increases in FDI. However, the relationship in opposite direction in the long-run is valid in only half of the countries studied. In short-run, we observe that the former relationship is valid only in Turkey, the Czech Republic, and Lithuania; where the latter is valid only in Latvia...|$|R
