These include cheeses and yogurts, cheese-based pies and quiches called pashtidot, cheese blintzes, and cheesecake prepared with soft white cheese (gvina levana) or cream cheese.|$|E
40|$|A {{mulberry}} <b>harvesting</b> machine <b>and</b> <b>harvesting</b> & pruning machine {{have been}} designed newly to suit for sericulture use which save cost and labour. The machines were tested in local field and suit better. Sericulture or silk culture is a labour intensive rural industry. At present it faces a shortage of labour force. <b>Harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning of mulberry plants are the most critical activities involved in sericulture. In the survey, 80 % sericulturists felt that the <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning are most tedious and stressful activities. The main reasons are high work stress, less rest and health problems associated with it. Hence, labourers show less interest towards sericulture. Hence, mechanized way of <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning may be an alternative approach to minimize the problem. The Japanese scientists developed a <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning equipment attached to tiller. This machine has certain limitation to Indian cultivation. Hence, a design methodology has been framed to develop mechanized mulberry plant <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning system to suite Indian mulberry plantation {{and at the same}} time cost effective...|$|R

Based on save-then-transmit protocol, we proposed two energy cooperation schemes for throughput optimization: two-node communication model with energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> energy transfer (TCM-EH-ET) and three-node relay communication model with energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> energy transfer (TRCM-EH-ET). Where, nodes in TCM-EH-ET model can harvest energy from nature and transfer energy to each other. In TRCM-EH-ET model, energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> energy transfer are only considered on source node and relay node. We {{assume that the}} nodes transmitting information have independent exogenous energy arrival processes to recharge their batteries and without considering energy expenditures on computation and sensing.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in November 1895, {{artist and}} author Alfred Lambourne {{spent a year}} living on the remote Gunnison Island, where {{he wrote a book}} of musing and poetry, Our Inland Sea.

5|$|By {{early spring}} of 1794, the {{situation}} in France was dire. With famine looming after {{the failure of the}} <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for sustenance. Turning to France's colonies in the Americas, and the agricultural bounty of the United States, the National Convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay, where Admiral Vanstabel would wait for them. According to contemporary historian William James this conglomeration of ships was said to be over 350 strong, although he disputes this figure, citing the number as 117 (in addition to the French warships).|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, after a meteorite crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995. The meteorite brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium, which becomes extremely valuable because {{of its ability to}} absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil. An ancient, cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of Nod claims to have foreseen the potentials of this new substance, investing in the development of technology to <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community. Nod soon controls nearly half of the supply and uses these assets to sustain a rapidly growing army of followers worldwide.

Cyclone Nadia severely affected four provinces in the country, primarily Nampula Province where it moved ashore. There, 85% {{of the houses}} were destroyed, and across its path, the cyclone left 1.5million people homeless. High winds caused widespread power outages, left areas without water, and significantly damaged crops, notably the cashew crop. The storm struck before the <b>harvest,</b> <b>and</b> lack of food resulted in 300deaths {{in the months after}} the storm. Across Mozambique, Nadia directly caused 240deaths and injured thousands.

In November, John of Salisbury was sent by Becket to England to inspect the estates prior to Becket's return from exile. John claimed that although de Broc had originally returned custody of the estates to Becket's officials, shortly before John's arrival de Broc had regained control of the estates and expelled Becket's officials. De Broc was also accused of seizing a cargo of the archbishop's wine and destroying the ship carrying it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning of horticultural crops {{is quite}} {{difficult}} {{due to their}} tallness. There are small hand tools available for <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning. But these tools of <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning are restricted due tree height, unavailability of trained labours for climbing and cost of operation etc. The mechanized machines are available; these are heavy and costly and are not suitable for low land holding, Indian marginal famers. <b>Harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning of horticultural crops with the available hand tool is very difficult. The labor has to climb on the tree by carrying these hand tools, which requires skill too. To overcome the above problems a Tractor Mounted Hydraulic Elevator (TMHE) powered by tractor PTO, was tested for the mechanical <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning of mango orchards using digital load cell, digital Vibration meter and digital Techometer for elevator stability study and pruner engine RPM measurements while in branch cutting respectively. The field performance of the above machine was carried out on plane mango plot, at Dr. Balasaheb Sawant Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth, Dapoli, Dist:-Ratnagiri (Maharashtra, India). The machine was tested for the better stability at maximum reach position for <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> pruning of various mango varieties, like Alphanso, Totapuri etc. Approach: To reduce the harvesting /pruning cost, increase the harvesting/pruning efficiency and enhance the overall productivity of mango orchards.

5|$|According to Russian {{scholars}} Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, {{the cross}} was originally {{kept in the}} Prečista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir. The peak of Islamization of the Krajina region was reached {{at the end of}} 18th century. The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the cross was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich <b>harvest,</b> <b>and</b> kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam. The cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted to Islam, they entrusted the cross to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it more appropriate for the cross to be kept in a Christian home, rather than in a Muslim one.|$|E
5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and <b>harvest,</b> <b>and</b> as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide in tall trees). An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E
5|$|Although Jones took {{no part in}} {{the raising}} of his {{children}} by Tuhbenahneequay, he did take an active interest in their welfare. In 1805, he secured a pair of two-square-mile plots of land {{near the mouth of}} the Credit River for his two sons from the local Mississauga Indians, but the government of Upper Canada would not recognise the title. In 1816, Jones feared that the Mississauga band his sons John and Peter lived with would fall apart, {{in the aftermath of the}} War of 1812, the famine of 1816's <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> the influx of settlers to the area in recent years. Jones travelled to find the boys, and brought them to his farm in Stoney Creek. He arranged for the boys to be schooled in Stoney Creek, as neither spoke much English. After nine months, Jones felt that Peter's command of English was sufficient, and took him out of school to teach him the farming craft. The next year, Jones and his family relocated to land along the Grand River, and Jones brought his son Peter with them. Peter lived with his father for seven years there.|$|E

5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall. The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> damage plants from ash loading.|$|E
5|$|Because small landowning {{families}} {{represented the}} mainstay of the Han tax base, the Han government attempted to aid and protect small landowners and to limit the power of wealthy landlords and merchants. The government reduced taxes in times of poor <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> provided relief after disasters. Tax remissions and crop seed loans encouraged displaced peasants {{to return to their}} land. An edict in 94 AD excused displaced peasants from paying land and labor service taxes for a year upon returning to their own farms. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced in 168 BC from a rate of one-fifteenth of crop yield to one-thirtieth, and abolished in 167 BC. However, the tax was reinstated in 156 BC at a rate of one-thirtieth. At the beginning of the Eastern Han, the land tax rate was one-tenth of the crop yield, but following the stabilization following Wang Mang's death, the rate was reduced to the original one-thirtieth in 30 AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{most serious}} {{threat of the}} 1848 {{revolutions}} in Belgium was posed by Belgian émigré groups. Shortly after the revolution in France, Belgian migrant workers living in Paris were encouraged to return to Belgium to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. Around 6,000 armed émigrés of the Belgian Legion attempted to cross the Belgian frontier. The first group, travelling by train, was stopped and quickly disarmed at Quiévrain on 26 March 1848. The second group crossed the border on 29 March and headed for Brussels. They were confronted by Belgian troops at the hamlet of Risquons-Tout and, during fighting, seven émigrés were killed {{and most of the}} rest were captured. The defeat at Risquons-Tout effectively ended the revolutionary threat to Belgium. The situation stabilized that summer after a good <b>harvest,</b> <b>and</b> fresh elections returned a strong Liberal majority.|$|E
