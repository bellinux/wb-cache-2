During the <b>excavation</b> <b>process</b> for the junction, a bone from a woolly mammoth (colloquially known as Jefferson's mammoth) was found buried in the earth below. The bones were moved to the New York State Museum in Albany. The construction also required the relocation of the Kitchawan Tavern from the site of the exit to the junction of Kitchawan and Chadeanye roads a half-mile (0.8km) to the east.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the dry season by seeking refuge in alligator holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the <b>excavation</b> <b>process,</b> provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E

Friction and wear general laws are presented in order to apply them at macroscopic level due to excavation modeling. Different examples are studied to calibrate friction and wear, analyzing the normal and tangential force evolution produced in 2 D and 3 D models. <b>Excavation</b> <b>processes</b> are tested in order to compute the contact forces.

25|$|<b>Excavation</b> <b>processes</b> can be {{as simple}} as hauling the {{contaminated}} soil to a regulated landfill, but can also involve aerating the excavated material in the case of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Recent advancements in bioaugmentation and biostimulation of the excavated material have also proven to be able to remediate semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) onsite. If the contamination affects a river or bay bottom, then dredging of bay mud or other silty clays containing contaminants (including sewage sludge with harmful microorganisms) may be conducted.|$|R

30|$|Surface mining also {{affected}} the hydrological and hydrogeological {{system of the}} catchment areas, located within the exploiting zones. These effects resulted from the <b>excavation</b> <b>processes</b> that removed part of the aquifer. Generally, post-mining pit-lakes formed after the mine closure and receive their water from groundwater. Thus, the surface mining consumes the groundwater storage of the aquifers. Moreover, the pit-lakes lose {{a large portion of}} their water by evaporation. In addition, materials removed by mining, which are normally barrier to contaminants, increase the possibility of groundwater contamination (Younger 2003). Leaching from tailings and waste rock via soil water and surface runoff cause contamination of groundwater and surface water by toxic constituents, contained in these materials (ELAW 2010).|$|R

25|$|Woodpeckers {{use their}} chisel-like bills to {{excavate}} their cavity nests, {{a process which}} takes, on average, about two weeks. Cavities are normally excavated on the downward-facing side of a branch, presumably {{to make it more}} difficult for predators to access the nest, and to reduce the chance that rain floods the nest. There is also some evidence that fungal rot may make the wood on the underside of leaning trunks and branches easier to excavate. Most woodpeckers use a cavity for only a single year. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is an exception; it takes far longer—up to two years—to excavate its nest cavity, and may reuse it for more than two decades. The typical woodpecker nest has a short horizontal tunnel which leads to a vertical chamber within the trunk. The size and shape of the chamber depends on species, and the entrance hole is typically only as large as is needed to allow access for the adult birds. While wood chips are removed during the <b>excavation</b> <b>process,</b> most species line the floor of the cavity with a fresh bed of them before laying their eggs.|$|E
500|$|During {{his student}} years, Lethbridge had frequented the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, {{where he had}} befriended its curator, Louis Clarke. Upon Lethbridge's graduation, Clarke offered him the honorary {{position}} of Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the museum. Lethbridge took up the voluntary and unpaid post, being able to subsist on his family's finances. There, Lethbridge befriended the archaeologist Cyril Fox, aiding in Fox's excavation of the Devil's Dyke in Cambridgeshire. Lethbridge's archaeological excavations were however deemed of poor quality by many of his peers. In turn, Lethbridge derided the archaeological establishment, being frustrated by {{how long it took}} them to accept what he deemed to be [...] "facts", and he believed in focusing on what he believed to be instinct and common sense. There were exceptions to his scorn; for instance, he developed a friendship with T. D. Kendrick, an Anglo-Saxon art historian who then worked as Keeper of the British Museum in London. Over the course of his career at the museum, Lethbridge produced 60 archaeological reports, written in an unusually informal manner that used humour and wit and included narrative descriptions of the <b>excavation</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Reworking such a busy {{corridor}} without seriously restricting {{traffic flow}} required {{a number of}} state-of-the-art construction techniques. Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized slurry wall techniques to create [...] concrete walls upon which the highway could rest.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{situations}} {{in nature and}} technology where particulate matter is excavated by a fluid jet. Such a process {{is often used to}} excavate soil or to dig wells. Air jets are often used to transport particulate matter such as powders in various industrial processes. Similar situations occur in nature, as when waterfalls scour holes in sand. In other cases, the excavation is unwanted such as when a rocket lands on the sandy or dusty surface of a planet or moon. Recent research into regolith excavation by gas jets has obtained new insights into the physical <b>processes</b> of that <b>excavation,</b> and these may lead to new advances in technology for more efficient fluid-jet <b>excavation</b> <b>processes</b> and for better control of the unwanted excavation effects of landing rockets.

40|$|The {{relation}} between the depth and diameter of excavation for impacts typically {{is assumed to be}} proportional. Such an assumption is consistent with the constant aspect ratio (diameter:depth) observed for simple craters found {{in a wide range of}} planetary settings and crater-scaling laws derived from laboratory experiments. Although complex craters exhibit evidence for floor uplift and rim collapse of a transient profile, they are typically thought to resemble initially smaller, simple craters. At large scales, however, early-time processes consume a greater fraction of crater growth and the assumption of late-time equivalence of energy release as a point source becomes inappropriate. The authors propose instead that crater diameter, depth, and impactor penetration represent separable dependent variables that underscore the fundamental difference between impact and point-source explosion <b>excavation</b> <b>processes.</b> An important consequence of this perspective is that central pits, peaks, and rings may represent contrasting target responses to impactor penetration and could provide an important indicator of impactor dimensions...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the new advances on the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) for the modeling of <b>excavation</b> <b>processes</b> and the wear of the cutting tools. In the PFEM [3, 9, 6], the continuum solid domains {{are defined by}} set of particles. These particles are used for {{the definition of the}} mesh that discretizes the domain. The most relevant phenomenon to model during a cutting process is the continuous change of the boundary definition of the geomaterial. The characterization of geomaterial boundary is performed by the particle kinematics and established when the particles set is reconnected with a new mesh. For the kinematics description the theory of the continuum mechanics is used. The problem is highly non-linear. Involving large displacements and defonnations, constitutive laws for geomaterials and contact mechanics. The contact characterization is crucial.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of fluid-solid coupling during immersion is {{an important}} topic of investigation in rock engineering. Two rock types, sandstone and mudstone, are selected in this work to study {{the correlation between the}} softening characteristics of the rocks and moisture content. This is achieved through detailed studies using scanning electron microscopy, shear tests, and evaluation of rock index properties during exposure to different moisture contents. An underground roadway excavation is simulated by dynamic finite element modeling to analyze the effect of moisture content on the stability of the roadway. The results show that moisture content has a significant effect on shear properties reduction of both sandstone and mudstone, which must thus be considered in mining or <b>excavation</b> <b>processes.</b> Specifically, it is found that the number, area, and diameter of micropores, as well as surface porosity, increase with increasing moisture content. Additionally, stress concentration is negatively correlated with moisture content, while the influenced area and vertical displacement are positively correlated with moisture content.
