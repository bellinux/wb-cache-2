Miranda finds the fourth note in Richard's shoe and learns that the laughing man came from the future to save Sal's life. The note asks Miranda to prepare a chronicle of recent events and deliver it by <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> {{she does not know}} who to give it to.|$|E

5|$|Johnson fell {{unconscious}} {{after this}} duel and was dragged from the battlefield; {{in addition to}} his five wounds, twenty other bullets had hit his horse and gear. But the war in the Northwest was over. Although there was no organized resistance to his presence in Canada, Harrison withdrew to Detroit because of supply problems. (The Canadians would not feed his men.) Johnson eventually recovered, except for a crippled <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> he was still suffering from his wounds {{when he returned to the}} House in February 1814.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the gallows, Beauchamp {{asked to}} see Patrick Darby, who was among the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E
5|$|This culminated on the November 15 {{episode of}} Raw, when Kidd refused to tag in and {{attacked}} Smith during {{a match for}} the WWE Tag Team Championship against The Nexus (Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater), resulting in Kidd became a heel once again. Smith defeated Kidd in a singles match on the November 25 episode of WWE Superstars. Afterward, Smith offered to shake Kidd's <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> Kidd refused and instead slapped him across the face. On the following episode of Raw, Kidd defeated Smith in a rematch, with this officially ending the alliance as a team.|$|E

5|$|When the {{commander}} of the newly renamed 90th Light Afrika Division, Generalmajor Max Sümmermann, was killed in an Allied air raid on 10 December 1941, Mickl was appointed to temporarily command the division. During December, Mickl was wounded in the head and <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> remained at his post. Rommel recommended Mickl for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, for his leadership at Sidi Rezegh, and it was duly awarded on 13 December 1941. The harsh conditions of desert warfare had begun to affect Mickl's health, so at the end of December he was sent home on convalescent leave.|$|E
5|$|Within days, Simpson {{was heading}} east again, taking a flying boat to Batavia, where {{he joined the}} advance party of the I Corps, which was being sent from the Middle East to the Dutch East Indies to counter the Japanese threat. He met there with the local {{authorities}} regarding signals arrangements for the defence of Java. These were soon well in <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> the tactical situation rapidly deteriorated {{to the extent that}} the I Corps was ordered to leave Java on 21 February 1942. Simpson departed on the troop ship Orcades, which arrived in Adelaide on 14 March.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI safe house, {{a police}} car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the room that Linda is in and locks the door behind him. Mulder tells Scully {{the news of the}} therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds Linda's room door locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> once he is on the ground Skinner sees that his hand is curled into the shape of the gun.|$|E

5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E
5|$|However, Rainbow Dash {{is still}} {{apart from the}} group and without her, the Elements will not activate. They find Rainbow Dash {{protecting}} a cloud, believing it to be her home of Cloudsdale. They start to give chase, but Rainbow flies away. They quickly use a hot-air balloon, pulled along by Fluttershy, {{to catch up to}} Rainbow. At first, it seems that Rainbow has the upper <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> as soon as Twilight reminds Fluttershy that if she gets away Discord will win, Fluttershy puts on an enormous burst of speed and the ponies eventually catch Rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for Twilight to cast her memory spell. The ponies share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord's influence.|$|E

5|$|In November 1960, Thi led the paratroopers in a coup against Diệm, citing {{political}} {{interference in the}} military. The rebels gained the upper <b>hand</b> <b>but</b> Thi was reluctant {{to push for a}} complete victory, and the coup was defeated after Diệm falsely promised to make reforms in order to buy time for loyalists to rescue him. Thi fled into exile in Cambodia, but returned after Diệm was deposed and executed in November 1963. He became the deputy commander of I Corps under Nguyễn Khánh, and helped his superior to overthrow Diệm's subjugators three months later. Thi became the commander of the 1st Division, before taking control of I Corps later in the year.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{edition of}} his memoirs, Vrba responded that he is certain the {{reference}} to the imminent Hungarian deportations was in the original Slovak version of the Vrba–Wetzler report, some of which he wrote by <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> which did not survive. He wrote that he recalled Oscar Krasniansky of the Slovak Jewish Council, who translated the report into German, arguing that only actual deaths should be recorded, and not speculation, to lend the report maximum credibility. Vrba speculated {{that this was the}} reason Krasniansky omitted the references to Hungary from the German translation, which was the version that was copied around the world.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, 1954, Garcia {{pitched a}} one-hitter against the Philadelphia Athletics in a 6–0 Indians win. Garcia {{called it the}} finest game of his career. He was {{selected}} for his third and final All-Star Game when American League manager Casey Stengel added him, Lemon, and Doby to an American League roster that already featured Avila and top vote-getter Al Rosen. During a late July exhibition game, Garcia learned {{that his father had}} {{died at the age of}} 65; Garcia's son Michael was born the same day. He missed several games that year with a broken blood vessel in his throwing <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> he managed 45 appearances on the season.|$|E

5|$|Pistorius uses {{custom-made}} spike pads on the blades. Before {{development of}} the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.|$|E
5|$|The Pearl and the Dutchman {{battle in}} the maelstrom. Elizabeth and Will are wed by Barbossa before {{swinging}} over to the Dutchman to aid Jack. On board the Dutchman, Jones and Jack engage in a duel, with Jones gaining the upper hand. Jones stabs Will with a sword, causing Bootstrap to fly into a rage and attack Jones. Jones begins to gain the upper <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> Jack and Elizabeth help Will stab Jones' heart. Jones falls into the maelstrom, while Will succumbs to his injuries. Jack and Elizabeth escape the Dutchman as it is sucked into the maelstrom, while {{the crew of the}} Dutchman converge on Will, led by Bootstrap.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} Alboin's reign as king in Pannonia {{following}} the death of his father, Audoin, was one of confrontation and conflict between the Lombards and their main neighbors, the Gepids. The Gepids initially gained the upper <b>hand,</b> <b>but</b> in 567, thanks to his alliance with the Avars, Alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies, whose lands the Avars subsequently occupied. The increasing power of his new neighbours caused Alboin some unease however, and he therefore decided to leave Pannonia for Italy, hoping {{to take advantage of the}} Byzantine Empire's reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the Gothic War.|$|E
