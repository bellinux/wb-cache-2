40|$|Context: Preterm low-birth-weight (PLBW) infants are at {{a higher}} risk {{for a number of}} acute and chronic disorders. Studies point to an {{association}} between periodontal infection and increased rates of preterm birth, and pregnant mothers with periodontal diseases are at increased risk of subsequent preterm birth or low birth weight. However, the awareness level of <b>gynecologists</b> about this relationship is unknown. Aims: The aim of the present survey was to assess the awareness about the effects of periodontal disease on pregnancy among practicing <b>gynecologists,</b> and also compare such awareness between <b>gynecologists</b> in two places-Khammam (a district headquarter) and Hyderabad (a state capital). Settings and Design: Random, cross-sectional study in a population of practicing <b>gynecologists</b> from Andhra Pradesh. Materials and Methods: A random study population was selected from the practicing <b>gynecologists</b> in Khammam and Hyderabad. Sixty practicing <b>gynecologists,</b> 30 each in Khammam and Hyderabad, were approached and they consented to join the study. Data were collected in questionnaire format from the subject population. Collected data were statistically analyzed. Chi-square test with Yates correction was used to analyze the data. A " P" value of < 0. 05 was taken as a significant difference. Results: 73. 3 % of the <b>gynecologists</b> said that their patients complain of bleeding gums, swellings and mobility. 58. 3 % of the <b>gynecologists</b> were aware that gum diseases occur at a higher rate in pregnant females. 38. 3 % of the <b>gynecologists</b> were aware that periodontal diseases can affect the outcome of delivery. No significant difference was found between the awareness levels of <b>gynecologists</b> in Khammam and in Hyderabad. Conclusions: There is a need for interdisciplinary approach for the prevention of PLBW cases by the integration of periodontal care into obstetric management. Effort should be made to increase awareness among the <b>gynecologists...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} how gynecologists' sex, beliefs, appropriateness ratings, {{and practice}} characteristics influence hysterectomy rates in North Carolina. <b>Gynecologists</b> who performed hysterectomies {{at higher rates}} were further from training, practiced in areas with fewer <b>gynecologists,</b> and had more patients with abnormal bleeding or cancer. Male <b>gynecologists</b> performed 60 % more hysterectomies than female <b>gynecologists,</b> but {{this may have been}} because they were further from their training. Appropriateness ratings were affected by gynecologists' attitudes toward surgery, recency of training, and practice case mix, and by patients' expressed desire to avoid surgery, but they did not predict hysterectomy rates.

5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a <b>gynecologist</b> when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic {{hysterectomy}} (LH) {{is poorly}} adopted by general <b>gynecologists.</b> The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the differences between residents, general <b>gynecologists,</b> and laparoscopic-orientated <b>gynecologists</b> in the choice of surgical route in patients planned for hysterectomy. METHODS: An observational study was carried out at a teaching hospital in south of The Netherlands. All patients who were planned for a hysterectomy for benign or premalignant indications between January 2005 and April 2009 were included. All performed hysterectomies were evaluated for the planned surgical route: vaginal, abdominal, or LH. Surgeons were divided into three categories: residents, general <b>gynecologists,</b> and laparoscopic-orientated <b>gynecologists.</b> RESULTS: One hundred thirty-nine (35. 8 %) patients were planned for a vaginal approach, 151 (38. 9 %) for an abdominal approach, and 98 (25. 2 %) for a laparoscopic approach. The percentage of planned vaginal hysterectomies was comparable for all surgeons. There was a significant difference between the percentage of planned LHs by residents (30 %) and that by general <b>gynecologists</b> (6 %). As expected, laparoscopic-orientated <b>gynecologists</b> planned a laparoscopic approach in 53 % of their cases. CONCLUSIONS: LH as alternative to abdominal hysterectomy is rarely planned by general <b>gynecologists.</b> Residents could play a role in the implementation of LH...|$|R

40|$|Study Objective: To {{assess the}} impact of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning about power morcellation use on the daily {{clinical}} practice of Italian <b>gynecologists.</b> Design: Electronic survey mailed to the main gynecologic centers (Canadian Task Force Classification type III). Setting: Unit of Obstetrics and Gynecology, IRCCS - Arcispedale S. Maria Nuova di Reggio Emilia (Italy). Patients: The study did not include patient data. Intervention: There was no intervention. Measurements and Main Results: From 490 surveys sent out, 426 replies were included in the final analysis (return rate = 86. 9 %). Four hundred of the 426 (93. 9 %) <b>gynecologists</b> were aware of the FDA warning. One hundred fifty of 302 (49. 7 %) of experienced <b>gynecologists</b> and 176 of 349 (50. 4 %) of oncology <b>gynecologists</b> considered laparoscopy the best approach for myomectomy. The FDA communication was considered overly restrictive by experienced and oncology <b>gynecologists</b> who declared that they had no intention of changing their surgical approach. Two hundred fifty of the 426 (58. 7 %) <b>gynecologists</b> declared that they would change their surgical approach only to prevent legal litigation. Conclusion: The FDA warning also affected Italian <b>gynecologists.</b> Particularly, less experienced <b>gynecologists</b> and those without oncologic practice seem to be more interested in avoiding legal litigation rather than a real clinical risk of upstaging an unexpected leiomyosarcoma. Fear of undiagnosed sarcoma could increase the number of laparotomies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Laparoscopic surgery {{has been}} a present factor in medical science {{for the last two}} decades. However, recent {{outcomes}} by the inspection for healthcare have suggested that complications during operation are more frequent than other forms of surgery. Minimal invasive surgery demands a different learning model and skills compared to traditional types of surgery. This {{led to the development of}} box trainers and simulators, which created the opportunity to train this technique outside the operating room. Today, numerous researches have been done on the learning curve of laparoscopic techniques. However, little research has been done on the laparoscopic learning curve of <b>gynecologists</b> who perform advanced laparoscopic procedures. Design: Prospective cohort study Purpose: To get a summary of operation characteristics of <b>gynecologists</b> who perform advanced laparoscopic procedures and compare these with their performances on a box trainer. Methods: 53 <b>Gynecologists</b> who performed advanced laparoscopic procedures, specifically laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) were asked to perform an intracorporal suture (ICS) in a box trainer. This box trainer registered the movements made in the box trainer. Additionally, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire. Results: <b>Gynecologists</b> who had performed more than 30 LH’s, took significant less time to perform an ICS than <b>gynecologists</b> who performed less than 30 LH’s. <b>Gynecologists</b> who had more than 5 years of LH experience, were significant faster than colleagues who have less than 5 years of experience. <b>Gynecologists</b> who regularly performed the ICH during an operation are significant faster than <b>gynecologists</b> who perform the ICH sporadically or not at all. There was no significant difference between the group of <b>gynecologists</b> who trained the laparoscopic procedures outside the operating room and the group who did not follow training.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{current practice}} of Dutch <b>gynecologists</b> in polyp removal. STUDY DESIGN: All practicing <b>gynecologists</b> in The Netherlands in 2003 were surveyed by a mailed self-administered questionnaire about polypectomy. <b>Gynecologists</b> {{were asked about}} their individual performance of polypectomy: setting, form of anesthesia, method and instrument used. RESULTS: The response rate was 74 % (553 of 752 <b>gynecologists).</b> Among the respondents, 455 (83 %) stated that they removed polyps themselves. Polyps were most commonly removed in an inpatient setting (71 %), under general or regional anesthesia (77 %), and under direct hysteroscopic visualization (69 %). <b>Gynecologists</b> working in a teaching hospital removed polyps more often in an outpatient setting compared to <b>gynecologists</b> working in a non-teaching hospital (93 (39 %) versus 36 (19 %) p < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: In the Netherlands, outpatient polyp removal is not practiced on a large scale. However, teaching hospitals are more often performing polypectomy in an outpatient setting.

40|$|Background: Previously, the REDLINC VI {{study showed}} that {{the main reason for}} the low use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was its low rate of {{prescription}} by doctors. Objective: To determine the use of MHT and perceived related risks among <b>gynecologists.</b> Methods: A self-administered and anonymous questionnaire was delivered to certified <b>gynecologists</b> in 11 Latin American countries. Results: A total of 2154 <b>gynecologists</b> were contacted, of whom 85. 3 % responded to the survey (n = 1837). Mean age was 48. 1 +/- 11. 4 years; 55. 5 % were male, 20. 3 % were faculty members and 85 % had a partner. Overall, 85. 4 % of <b>gynecologists</b> responded that they would use MHT if they had menopausal symptoms (81. 8 % in the case of female <b>gynecologists)</b> or prescribe it to their partner (88. 2 % in the case of male gynecologists; p < 0. 001). Perceived risk related to MHT use (on a scale from 0 to 10) was higher among female than among male <b>gynecologists</b> (4. 06 +/- 2. 09 vs. 3. 83 +/- 2. 11, p < 0. 02). The top two perceived reported risks were thromboembolism (women 33. 6 % vs. men 41. 4 %, p < 0. 009) and breast cancer (women 38. 5 % vs. men 33. 9 %, p < 0. 03). Overall, <b>gynecologists</b> reported prescribing MHT to 48. 9 % of their symptomatic patients (women 47. 3 % vs. men 50. 2 %, p < 0. 03) and 86. 8 % currently prescribed non-hormonal remedies and 83. 8 % alternative therapies for the management of the menopause. <b>Gynecologists</b> who were older and academic professionals prescribed MHT more often. Conclusion: Although this Latin American survey showed that <b>gynecologists</b> are mostly supporters of MHT use (for themselves or their partners), this is not necessarily reflected in their clinical practice...|$|R

30|$|Another {{question}} is whether or not all <b>gynecologists</b> should be able to perform advanced endoscopic procedures [25]. It is our opinion that all <b>gynecologists</b> should be able to perform level 1 and level 2 procedures (Table  1), with laparoscopic hysterectomy as an exception. Hysterectomy is the most frequent, major surgical procedure performed by nearly all <b>gynecologists</b> [12] and patients’ demand for the minimally invasive approach for hysterectomy is increasing. Therefore, every hospital (teaching and non-teaching) should be able to offer this specific procedure. To implement this, every department of gynecology should dispose of one or two laparoscopic skilled <b>gynecologists</b> in order to be able to establish an internal referral system for laparoscopic hysterectomy. In an internal referral system ‘open’ <b>gynecologists</b> can refer patients with an indication eligible for the laparoscopic approach to their skilled colleagues for a laparoscopic hysterectomy. An internal referral system will build a bridge between abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy on the one hand, and laparoscopic hysterectomy on the other.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the current practice of Dutch <b>gynecologists</b> in the removal of benign endometrial polyps and compare these results with the results of a previous study from 2003. In 2009 Dutch <b>gynecologists</b> were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire about polypectomy. <b>Gynecologists</b> answered questions about their individual performance of polypectomy: setting, form of anesthesia, method, and instrument use. The results were compared with the results from the previous survey. The response rate was 70 % (585 of 837 <b>gynecologists).</b> Among the respondents, 455 (78 %) stated to remove endometrial polyps themselves. Polyps were mostly removed in an inpatient setting (337; 74 %) under general or regional anesthesia (247; 54 %) and under direct hysteroscopic vision (411; 91 %). <b>Gynecologists</b> working in a teaching hospital removed polyps more often in an outpatient setting compared with <b>gynecologists</b> working in a nonteaching hospital [118 (43 %) vs. 35 (19 %) p< 0. 001].
