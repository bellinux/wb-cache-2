25|$|The {{drawbacks}} of {{this technology}} are found in a strong <b>fall-off</b> of the SNR, which {{is proportional to the}} distance from the zero delay and a sinc-type reduction of the depth dependent sensitivity because of limited detection linewidth. (One pixel detects a quasi-rectangular portion of an optical frequency range instead of a single frequency, the Fourier-transform leads to the sinc(z) behavior). Additionally the dispersive elements in the spectroscopic detector usually do not distribute the light equally spaced in frequency on the detector, but mostly have an inverse dependence. Therefore, the signal has to be resampled before processing, which can not take care of the difference in local (pixelwise) bandwidth, which results in further reduction of the signal quality. However, the <b>fall-off</b> is not a serious problem with the development of new generation CCD or photodiode array with a larger number of pixels.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the peeling {{property}} of the Weyl spinor for asymptotically (anti-) de Sitter spacetimes is guaranteed. In the case where there are Maxwell fields present, the peeling properties of both Weyl and Maxwell spinors similarly hold, if the leading order term of the spin coefficient ρ when expanded as inverse powers of r (where r is the usual spherical radial coordinate, and r→∞ is I) has coefficient - 1. This proof relies on a stipulation of the <b>fall-offs</b> for the unknown functions defining the null tetrad {{as well as the}} <b>fall-offs</b> of the spin coefficients for asymptotically (anti-) de Sitter spacetimes. If the cosmological constant is zero, then the peeling property {{does not appear to be}} guaranteed even with the stipulation of those <b>fall-offs.</b> Note that this approach is based on using the Newman-Penrose equations exclusively on the physical spacetime, i. e. we do not explicitly deal with conformal rescaling nor the conformal spacetime. In addition, we also discuss how the choices of coordinate system and null tetrad would affect the manifestation of the peeling property. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to this straightforward mass-action effect, the rate coefficients themselves can change due to pressure. The rate coefficients and products of many high-temperature gas-phase reactions change if an inert gas {{is added to the}} mixture; variations on this effect are called <b>fall-off</b> and chemical activation. These phenomena are due to exothermic or endothermic reactions occurring faster than heat transfer, causing the reacting molecules to have non-thermal energy distributions (non-Boltzmann distribution).

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} argued that the human visual system is {{optimized}} for identification of broadband objects embedded in stimuli possessing orientation averaged power spectra <b>fall-offs</b> that obey the 1 /fβ relationship typically observed in natural scene imagery (i. e., β= 2. 0 on logarithmic axes). Here, we were interested in whether individual spatial channels leading to recognition are functionally optimized for narrowband targets when masked by noise possessing naturalistic image statistics (β= 2. 0). The current study therefore explores the impact of variable β noise masks on the identification of narrowband target stimuli ranging in spatial complexity, while simultaneously controlling for physical or perceived differences between the masks. The results show that β= 2. 0 noise masks produce the largest identification thresholds regardless of target complexity, and thus do not seem to yield functionally optimized channel processing. The differential masking effects are discussed in the context of contrast gain control...|$|R
40|$|A finite-difference {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} generate synthetic seismograms for waves propagating through two-dimensional random media. The media have a significant component of their material properties varying randomly over length scales smaller than the seismic wavelength and are meant to approximate the heterogeneity of the crust and upper mantle. The finite-difference technique retains all multiply scattered and diffracted waves, and also accounts for transmission losses. The synthetic seismograms clearly exhibit coda and apparent attenuation caused by scattering. For a medium with a white wavenumber spectrum of velocity fluctuations, the coda is higher frequency than the initial pulse. The apparent attenuation is greatest when the scatterer size {{is comparable to the}} seismic wavelength. The spectra of the coda generally increase in frequency as the scatterers decrease in size. Examples demonstrate how scattering can produce spectra with broad peaks and sharp <b>fall-offs</b> that can make the determination of the source spectra and corner frequencies of small earthquakes extremely difficult...|$|R
25|$|There was {{a rise in}} sectarian killings {{during the}} truce, which 'officially' lasted until February 1976.

The ECF obtained by hypotonic exposure shows a fluctuating pattern with sharp peaks and steep <b>fall-offs</b> in activity. The ECF-release for each stimulus is temperature dependent; extracellular calcium is required when the ionophore or phagocytosis are used as stimuli, while with arachidonic acid and hypotonic exposure no extracellular calcium is necessary for ECF-release.

25|$|In 1993, a major {{milestone}} for {{the airport}} was the signing of a new United States – Ireland bilateral agreement which allowed airlines to operate some direct transatlantic services {{for the first time}} to/from Dublin Airport instead of touching down en route at Shannon Airport on the west coast of Ireland. (Shannon had once been a major transatlantic refuelling stop for pre-jet aircraft, and this agreement was designed to protect the interests of the Shannon region when modern jets no longer required a refuelling stop and Shannon saw a <b>fall-off</b> in traffic.) Airlines still had to provide an equal number of flights either to or through Shannon as to Dublin. A gradual further watering down of Shannon's so-called 'stopover' status came into effect in November 2006 when more direct flights to Dublin were allowed. The stopover requirement disappeared completely in 2008. At that time, airlines were allowed to fly direct to the US from Dublin without having to match these with any to/from Shannon. It was expected that this would result in a huge increase in services between Dublin and the US and Aer Lingus has identified 16 destinations that it would like to serve directly from Dublin.|$|E

A total number of 140 adult species of Synydas and Stomorhina cribrata, and 400 dipteran larvae were captured at the abattoir using pitfall techniques, with correspondingly fewer species of similar dipterans trapped at the contiguous fallow plot. Significant difference existed in the trapping of the Diptera larvae with more trapped at the abattoir than the fallow plot using Student t-test. There was also a preponderance of calliphorid species at the abattoir when the sweep net was used, with these species implicated as being potential pests of medical and forensic importance.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{controlling}} the appearance of an arbitrary 3 D object using a projector and a camera. Our {{goal is to make}} one object look like another by projecting a carefully determined compensation image onto the object. The determination of the appropriate compensation image requires accounting for spatial variation in the object’s reflectance, the effects of environmental lighting, and the spectral responses, spatially varying <b>fall-offs,</b> and non-linear responses in the projectorcamera system. Addressing each of these effects, we present a compensation method which calls for the estimation of {{only a small number of}} parameters, as part of a novel off-line radiometric calibration. This calibration is accomplished by projecting and acquiring a minimal set of 6 images, irrespective of the object. Results of the calibration are then used on-line to compensate each input image prior to projection. Several experimental results are shown that demonstrate the ability of this method to control the appearance of everyday objects. Our method has direct applications in several areas including smart environments, product design and presentation, adaptive camouflages, interactive education and entertainment. ...|$|R

This is possible in our QCD formulation because there are two parameters which describe confinement, a mass scale μ, and a "deformation parameter" ξ, which shrinks the transverse-quark-coordinate separation distribution φ(b) away from Gaussian. With the mass scale μ defined as equal to the mass of each quark bound state, we show that ξ decreases with increasing bound state mass, m_BS, using order-of-magnitude estimates which agree with obvious intuition. Our ξ-values, including a calculation for the recently detected 4 -quark system, display the predicted behavior: ξ decreases with increasing m_BS.

Moreover, warty barberry plants with half total leaf area suffered from drought earlier, because of enhanced soil water loss through evaporation. Thus, Hooker’s barberry can be taken as more drought tolerant than its counterpart, therefore making it more suitable for plantings in areas that are prone to this environmental constraint...|$|R
