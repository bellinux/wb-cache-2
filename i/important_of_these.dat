5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions {{trying to}} reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about {{the early history of}} Lithuania. The matter is further complicated by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E

5|$|In Orissa, {{the goddess}} is worshipped in the lying-in {{room on the}} sixth day after {{childbirth}}, on the 21st day after childbirth and on every subsequent birthday of the child until he or she reaches the age of sixteen. Shashthi is also prescribed to be worshipped the sixth day {{of each of the}} two lunar fortnights occurring each month; as part of the vrata rites, the worship occurring on the bright fortnight of the month of Bhadrapada is the most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> and holds the same status in Orissa as the Aranva-Shashthi ritual in Bengal. By these rites, it is believed a childless woman may gain offspring, while a mother may secure the longevity and welfare of her child by the grace of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn {{provides}} {{some insight into}} his interpretation of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted impression of the whole, but certainly among the most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> for any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends {{the extent to which}} a particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others of like mind.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, {{buoyed by the}} immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose of}} instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor were the most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E

5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all. Iodates {{are by far the}} most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> compounds, which can be made by oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{assuming}} the throne, Edward set about restoring order and re-establishing royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father. To accomplish this, he immediately ordered an extensive change of administrative personnel. The most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was {{the appointment of}} Robert Burnell as chancellor, {{a man who would}} remain in the post until 1292 as one of the King's closest associates. Edward then replaced most local officials, such as the escheators and sheriffs. This last measure was done in preparation for an extensive inquest covering all of England, that would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers. The inquest produced the set of so-called Hundred Rolls, from the administrative subdivision of the hundred.|$|E
5|$|The Deshastha {{community}} has produced several saints and philosophers. Most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were Dnyaneshwar, Eknath and Ramdas. The most revered of all Bhakti saints, Dnyaneshwar was universally acclaimed for his {{commentary on the}} Bhagvad Gita. He lived in the 13th century. Eknath was yet another Bhakti saint who published an extensive poem called the Eknathi Bhagwat in the 16th century. Other works of Eknath include the Bhavartha Ramayana, the Rukmini Swayamwara and the Swatma Sukha. The 17th century saw the Dasbodh of the saint Samarth Ramdas, who was also the spiritual adviser to Shivaji.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} and their {{hydrides}} react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, {{the most common}} of which being tetrahydrofuran. The most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide, NaC5H5, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (K2C8H8) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene. The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E

Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on road stages (stages 2–6): the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for {{the second and third}} riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints (three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The leader of the general classification received a blue jersey and the winner of the classification was considered the overall winner of the race.|$|E

In the opening stages, the Black Sea Fleet Air Force was tasked with destroying industrial targets in Nazi Germany-allied Romania. The most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was the King Carol I Bridge over Danube which carried the Ploieşti-Constanţa oil pipeline. After several failed attempts to destroy the heavily protected bridge with conventional bombers, the task {{was given to the}} Zveno squadron. As a combat test, it was decided to first attack the Constanţa oil depot. On 26 July 1941, two Zveno-SPB aircraft performed a successful attack on the depot in broad daylight with no losses. The fighters disconnected 40km (22 NM, 25mi) from the target and returned to the home airfield under their own power.|$|E
5|$|Al-Razzaz, Aflaq's {{successor}} as Secretary General, {{came from}} the pro-Aflaq faction. With the defection of al-Hafez, he ordered that the National Command was the de jure ruling body of the Ba'ath Party. He appointed al-Bitar Prime Minister, Umran defence minister, Mansur al-Atrash as Chairman of the National Council of the Revolutionary Command and al-Hafiz retained his post as President of Syria. Salah Jadid, the Military Committee's strongman, responded by arresting several Umran supporters. Umran responded by dismissing a handful of pro-Jadid officials. The most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> dismissals was the removal of Ahmad Suwaydani from the post of head of the country's military intelligence to head of the Officer Administration. On 23 February a coup d'état led by Jadid and Hafez al-Assad overthrew the Syrian Government and the Ba'ath Party leadership. Aflaq was exiled from Syria, and ordered never to return his homeland. Members of the party's other factions fled; Aflaq was captured and detained, along with other pro-Aflaq supporters, in a government guest house. When the new rulers launched a purge in August that year, Aflaq managed to make his escape, {{with the help of}} Nasim Al Safarjalani and Malek Bashour, both closely trusted friends and colleagues, and hence was able to flee to Beirut, Lebanon, and later to Brazil.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} source of symbolism on memorials, however, is Christian imagery and icons. Religious imagery permeated many war memorials, even the secular. The most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> symbols was the Christian cross, a widely used symbol of hope and suffering. The cross could take multiple forms, from Catholic designs in France, to Orthodox crosses in eastern Europe. Celtic crosses were popular in Britain and Ireland, partially because they avoided Catholic connotations, although they were considered vulgar by more classical architects such as Blomfield. In France, les croix des bois, wooden crosses, became popular symbols at memorials after Roland Dorgelès's novel of the same name. German memorials made extensive use {{of the image of}} the Virgin Mary tending her son Christ, following {{in the tradition of the}} pietà. The crucifixion was also a widely used symbol, as seen in Derwent Wood's Canada's Golgotha, although Christ himself was relatively rarely typically seen on British memorials.|$|E

5|$|Captain Ernest J. King, {{who later}} rose {{to serve as}} the Chief of Naval Operations during World War II, assumed command on 20 June 1930. Lexington was assigned, {{together}} with Saratoga, to defend the west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931. While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys, the enemy forces succeeded in making a landing. Shortly afterward, all three carriers transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers. The most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was when Saratoga successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from an attack by Lexington. Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for King with a destroyer and scored a kill on Lexington on 22 March while the latter's aircraft were still searching for Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|Despite his misgivings Berdyev kept Kinkladze in the team, {{where he}} was used as one of three {{offensive}} midfielders in a 4–2–3–1 formation. Kinkladze, with his technical style and inclination for improvisation, brought more variety to the attacking play of the team, {{in contrast to the}} restrained style of play that Berdyev favoured. He provided an assist in four consecutive matches. The most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was against Zenit St. Petersburg, in a match that decided a place in the following year's UEFA Cup. Subsequently, he received a recall to the Georgian national squad for friendlies against Bulgaria and Jordan. However, a muscle strain meant he missed both national team games and Rubin's final league match. He ended the 2005 season with seven assists and two goals in nine appearances for Rubin.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} {{expanding}} Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire {{had come into}} contact in the mid-1st century BC, there had been friction between the two great powers over {{the control of the}} various states lying between them. The largest and most <b>important</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> was the Kingdom of Armenia. In 20 BC, Augustus succeeded in establishing a Roman protectorate over the country, when Tigranes III was enthroned as king of Armenia. Roman influence was secured through a series of Roman-sponsored kings until 37 AD, when a Parthian-supported candidate, Orodes, assumed the throne. The Roman-supported king, Mithridates, recovered his throne with the support of Emperor Claudius in 42 AD, but was deposed in 51 AD by his nephew Rhadamistus of Iberia. His rule quickly became unpopular however, and this gave the newly crowned king Vologases I of Parthia the opportunity to intervene. His forces quickly seized the two capitals of Armenia, Artaxata and Tigranocerta, and put his younger brother Tiridates on the throne. The onset of a bitter winter and the outbreak of an epidemic forced the Parthians forces to withdraw, allowing Rhadamistus to retake control of the country. His behavior towards his subjects, however, was even worse than before, and they rose in rebellion against him. Thus in 54 AD Rhadamistus fled to his father's court in Iberia, and Tiridates re-established himself in Armenia.|$|E
