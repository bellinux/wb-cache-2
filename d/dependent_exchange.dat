We provide two pragmatic methods for imposing these conditions. As an example we take the Gross and Kohn (GK) frequency dependent XC functional (Phys. Rev.

The effect can be retained down to very small thicknesses. For a Ni 50 Mn 32 Sn 18 thin film, which does not undergo a martensitic transformation, no exchange bias is observed. Our results suggest that a significant interplay between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions, which is the origin for exchange bias, is only present in the martensite. The finding is supported by ab initio calculations showing that the antiferromagnetic order is stabilized in the phase. (C) 2013 Author(s).
