500|$|Additional {{positive}} feedback {{for the film}} came from Joblo.com reviewer Berge Garabedian, who praised director Bertino for [...] "building the tension nicely, with lots of silences, creepy voices, jump scares, use of songs and a sharp eye behind the camera, as well as plenty of Steadicam <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> more of a voyeuristic feel." [...] Empire Magazine remarked on the film's retro-style, saying, [...] "Like much recent horror, from the homages of the Grindhouse gang through flat multiplex remakes of drive-in classics, The Strangers looks to the '70s.", and ultimately branded the film as [...] "an effective, scary emotional work-out." [...] Slant Magazines Nick Schager listed The Strangers as the 9th best film of 2008. Also, the film was ranked #13 on [...] "Bravo's 13 Scarier Movie Moments" [...] television piece.|$|E
500|$|Fleming stated he was {{impressed}} by Love's [...] "focus and intensity," [...] especially while recording vocals for one song when Love [...] "literally ripped her clothes off while she sang". [...] "Courtney was amazing", said Fleming. [...] "She was the most gung-ho person I've ever met. She {{was going to make}} the greatest record ever—I like that attitude in the studio. Courtney was like 'Let's go, fuckers', and I loved that." [...] In a later interview, Fleming said: Courtney was great at the time—it was before she even knew Kurt [...] She gave 180%. I've worked with some people that you've had to coax the performance out of them. With Courtney, there was no attitude. She was gonna <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> And she did and it was really impressive to me... I loved the whole band; they were a lot of fun. That early lineup of Hole—I felt they were the real deal. They were Hollywood misfits—all of them. I felt it really captured what they were.|$|E
500|$|Writing {{began in}} late 2009, when the American singer Holly Hafermann resided at the Artula Retreat in Bandon, Oregon, and {{composed}} songs. Later, in New York City, under her new stage name Skylar Grey, she visited her Universal Music publisher, Jennifer Blakeman, {{to seek help}} presenting her work; Blakeman suggested she collaborate with Alex da Kid. The producer emailed Grey his track, which suggested a theme of abusive romantic relationships {{to her as she}} spontaneously sang lyrics to the melody. She told the Los Angeles Times that she was in an abusive relationship with the music industry: [...] "I love it so much, and I <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> that I have, yet it beats me down." [...] This idea inspired her writing, a process she found came naturally, as if she were creating an alternative pop song for herself. She wrote the chorus to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in fifteenminutes and recorded vocals for Alex da Kid's demo.|$|E

500|$|On 3 December, Benfica {{travelled}} to Barreiros to play Marítimo. Under {{pressure from}} the run of poor results, Koeman asked his players to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> to beat Maritímo. Benfica fended off Marítimo attacks, responding with a goal through Mantorras in the 86th minute and winning {{for the first time}} since 26 October. Four days later, Benfica hosted Manchester United for the last match of the group stage. United's Paul Scholes scored first but ten minutes later, Geovanni equalized 1–1 and in the 34th minute, Beto fired a shot from outside the box to make it 2–1. The result was unchanged and Benfica qualified in second for the knockout stages {{for the first time since}} 1994–95. On 11 December, Benfica played Boavista at home. Anderson scored for Benfica off a corner-kick from Petit; the only goal of the game. Koeman was happy with the win, saying, [...] "We played well, as did the fans, who supported us. Like this, it is very difficult to beat us." [...] On 17 December, Benfica continued their winning run, beating Nacional 1–0 with a goal from Nuno Gomes. The goal was controversial because of an alleged infraction of Luisão over Diego Benaglio prior to the goal. Koeman said, [...] "I agree that it should have been signalled, like it should have been in many other instances". Benfica ended 2005 with an away visit to the Estádio do Bonfim. They struggled to beat Vitória de Setúbal's goalkeeper Marcelo Moretto throughout the game, only securing the win in the 90th minute through Nuno Gomes. The win was Benfica's fifth in December; enough to place them third in the league table just before the Christmas break.|$|E

In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals".

2500|$|Brown {{has many}} {{trademarks}} in his composing style, {{which is often}} rhythmically dynamic and harmonically unconventional, calling for a wide vocal range. His vocal lines often include internal rhymes, as well as melodic phrases which do not adhere to a predictable 4-measure length. He favors songs in written in AABA' form, with some exceptions to this form in his show Parade. Perhaps most characteristic are his love duets; all five ("I'd <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> <b>All</b> for You" [...] from Songs for a New World, [...] "All the Wasted Time" [...] from Parade, [...] "The Next Ten Minutes" [...] from The Last Five Years, [...] "Tell Her" [...] from 13, and [...] "One Second And A Million Miles" [...] from The Bridges of Madison County) are written in a very distinct format: male-female-both, compound time in the duet section (two using hemiola), and {{four of the five}} end with the couple singing the same pitch.|$|E
2500|$|Romanian {{historian}} Lucian Boia {{believes that}} Ion Antonescu may have nevertheless had expansionist goals to the east, {{and that he}} implicitly understood Operation Barbarossa {{as a tool for}} containing Slavic peoples. Similar verdicts are provided by other researchers. Another Romanian historian, Ottmar Trașcă, argues that Antonescu did not wish to annex the region [...] "at least {{until the end of the}} war", but notes that Antonescu's own statements make reference to its incorporation in the event of a victory. In addition to early annexation plans to the Southern Bug (reportedly confessed to Bossy in June 1941), the Conducător is known to have presented his ministers with designs for the region's colonization. The motivation he cited was alleged malnutrition among Romanian peasants, to which he added: [...] "I'll take this population, I'll lead it into Transnistria, where I shall <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the land it requires". Several nationalists sympathetic to Antonescu acclaimed the extension of Romanian rule into Transnistria, which they understood as permanent.|$|E

They have a suit of rooms over them, with small windows of wooden lattice, of intricate but regular carved work, and some have frames cased with thin gold.

2500|$|Victoria Louise [...] "Vicki" [...] Fowler is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Emma Herry from the character's birth in 1986 to 1988, Samantha Leigh Martin from 1988 to 1995, and Scarlett Alice Johnson from 2003 to 2004. She {{is the daughter}} of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). The character is born in the serial, conceived in a controversial storyline about teenage pregnancy. Exploiting a whodunnit angle, {{at the time of the}} first showing, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 in episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Early suspects were Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), but then four possible suspects are seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts. As Michelle waits by their rendezvous point, a car pulls up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leap out of a car to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> away: Den Watts is the father of Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.|$|E
