40|$|A {{series of}} isonicotinoylhydrazones 2 were {{prepared}} by addition of some aryloxyacetonitriles with <b>isonicotinoylhydrazine</b> in basic medium. These compounds have been further reacted with pyridinecarboxaldehydes {{to give the}} corresponding pyridylmethyleneamino derivatives 3 - 5. The new synthesized hydrazones and their pyridylmethyleneamino derivatives were tested for their activity against mycobacteria, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The cytotoxicity was also tested. Several compounds showed a good activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv and some isonycotinoylhydrazones 2 showed a moderate activity against a clinically isolated M. tuberculosis which was isoniazid resistant...|$|E

40|$|This {{is about}} synthesizing new complex {{combinations}} of Cu(II), Ni(II),Co(II), Zn(II) with aroylhydrazone ligand isonicotinoylhydrazone- 2 -aldehydefluorene (INHAF) made by condensation of <b>isonicotinoylhydrazine</b> with 2 -aldehydefluorene. The complexes have {{been characterized by}} analytical data, IR, UV-Vis, NMR spectra, magnetic susceptibility values, thermal analysis and for the Cu(II) complex the ESR spectrum has been registered. For all complexes the biological activity against the Staphylo-coccus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebssiella pneumoniae bacteria has been investigated. The experimental data sustain stoichiometry of 1 : 2 (metal/ligand) for the Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) complexes and of 1 : 1 for the complex with Co(II). The electronic spectra and the magnetic moments suggest octahedral stereochemistry at the complexes with Cu(II), Ni(II) and the tetrahedral geometry for the Co(II) complex. The INHAF ligand is coordinated bidentate by the O=C amide oxygen and the azomethine nitrogen in the complexes of Cu(II), Ni(II), Co(II) and monodentate by the azomethine nitrogen in the complex of Zn(II) ...|$|E
