40|$|Visibility of exit {{signs in}} terms of the height of the sign content was studied {{experimentally}} in an 18 m internal corridor. Four factors affecting the visibility including graphics, colours, lighting conditions and ages of the observers were investigated. Combinations of designations containing the English and Chinese words EXIT, five directional indicators and two exit symbols in different colours under normal and emergency lighting conditions were presented to 30 observers of different age groups to determine their visibility. The sign heights detected, identified and identified with confidence were measured. Increased height for correct identification was found for an exit sign containing two symbols as compared to a sign containing only one symbol. A <b>green</b> <b>exit</b> sign was reported to be highly visible. It was also reported that at reduced illumination, the sign height for correct identification increased.

When m[downwards arrow] 0, our estimates reduce to the sharp Green function estimates for -(-[Delta]) [alpha]/ 2 in such kind of open sets that were obtained recently in Chen and Tokle [12].

5000|$|Each game {{starts out}} in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will {{automatically}} take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen - the <b>green</b> frog <b>exits</b> to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a [...] "The End" [...] message, which it leaves {{in the center of the}} screen.

This paper assesses the risks and rewards of tackling climate change in the G- 20 and finds that despite its seeming attractiveness, the G- 20, as structured, is not a suitable replacement for the UN-led process and has limited ability, at present, to advance climate change negotiations. There is much, however, that the G- 20 can do {{to contribute to the}} goals of the climate negotiations outside of wading into the negotiations themselves. Building on its existing agenda the G- 20 has the power to significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, accelerate the deployment of clean energy technology, and help vulnerable countries adapt to a warmer world through the mobilization of public and private finance. Following through on the existing G- 20 pledge to phase out and rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, establishing new green guidelines for multilateral development banks, coordinating <b>green</b> stimulus <b>exit</b> strategies, promoting open markets for environmental goods and services, and rebalancing global economic growth all fall well within the G- 20 ’s mandate and help meet the climate challenge...|$|R

40|$|Genre: Legend/Oral history. Title: Methi Liru 2. Wora Ngangene (b. 1940), kampong Kaju keri, {{recorded}} {{in the home of}} Pidu (Ebbe), Mata Mere, in the morning 19 Feb 2014. This morning's set of recordings were the only ones ever done with a Shure 58 microphone. The recordings are not loud enough, due to low rec level settings to reduce the background noise and the subject's soft voice, and at times unclear speech (because of age, no teeth). Wora (born 1940) is a resident of the neighbouring kampong Kaju Keri and is a relative (nephew?) of the healer-sorcerer Methi Liru (c. 1885 - 1974), who was the topic of three recordings. The content of the longer recording is also covered in another recording, titled M Liru, narrated by a young relative of Wora (MM). This short tale and the other (MLiru 3) are just examples of what Methi did in her life as a sorcerer-healer (Ple: 'pisa', 'pisa molo'. BI. 'dukun', 'dukun sakti'). In this tale she cured a woman with stomach problems ('ngembung rere', or hepatitis?). As she caressed the woman, a <b>green</b> snake <b>exited.</b> The family of the cured woman paid Methi with an ivory tusk, but it made her ill and they had to make some rituals to become well again. She also tried to give the ivory to Wora for a while. Portrait in SD 1 - 104. Palu'e, Flores, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia. Recording made in kampong Kaju keri, Keli domain...|$|R
50|$|I-69 {{follows the}} former I-164 south from I-64 to the Ohio River near <b>Green</b> River Road (<b>exit</b> 3 on I-164). The {{plan was to}} have I-69 {{continue}} south (instead of turning west with I-164) for approximately 3 mi before crossing the Ohio River on a new bridge between Evansville and Henderson, Kentucky, {{near the mouth of}} the Green River. This portion of the route has not yet been funded, as construction of the new Ohio River crossing and new roadway on the Kentucky side is expected to cost approximately $800 million. Indiana and Kentucky officials had said construction on the new Ohio River Bridge would not begin until at least 2020, after two new crossings near Louisville were completed. With Indiana then preparing to break ground on SIU 3, Kentucky officials indicated that collecting tolls might be the only feasible option for completing the I-69 bridge, as traditional federal and state funding for such projects were drying up. , neither Kentucky nor Indiana officials had yet come up with the funding for the I-69 bridge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{position}} is sometimes summarized, in an extreme form, as [...] "all votes for {{anyone other than}} the runner-up are votes for the winner." [...] This is because by voting for other candidates, they have denied those potential votes to the second-place candidate who could have won had they received them. Following the extremely close 2000 U.S. presidential election, some supporters of Democratic candidate Al Gore believe that one reason he lost the election to Republican George W. Bush is because {{a portion of the}} electorate (2.7%) voted for Ralph Nader of the <b>Green</b> Party, and <b>exit</b> polls indicated that more of these voters would have preferred Gore (45%) to Bush (27%), with the rest not voting in Nader's absence. [...] The argument for this case is even more pronounced because the election was ultimately decided {{on the basis of the}} election results in Florida where Bush prevailed over Gore by a margin of only 537 votes (0.009%), which was far exceeded by the number of votes, 97488 (1.635%), that Nader received.|$|R
40|$|Although much {{research}} has been conducted on the greening of universities in the international context, not many studies focus on this topic in the South African context. A literature overview also identified that there are insufficient guidelines for green buildings at South African universities. Even though the Green Star rating tool is implemented in South Africa, no set of guidelines for <b>green</b> buildings <b>exits</b> at South African universities. The development of guidelines for green buildings at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan is a challenge which needs to be investigated. From the literature overview, it was possible to develop a framework containing seventeen green building aspects which could assist in developing green building guidelines. For this study, a two stage process was used to obtain information to evaluate green building guidelines critically at South African universities. Green building guidelines, as available at South African universities, were firstly explored by conducting a content analysis of all South African university websites. The information available on South African university websites regarding green buildings was scant and only two universities, namely the University of Cape Town and the University of Pretoria, reported that they had a green building. Stage two in the research process involved the empirical investigation of guidelines for green buildings at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University. The results of the descriptive statistics showed that most building guidelines were perceived as important, but difficult to implement. The building guideline that was ranked the most important was the design of buildings that required low levels of maintenance or were maintenance free. The building guideline that was ranked the easiest to implement was to save energy in general. Considering the 17 suggested aspects and the five groups identified, a proposed set of green building guidelines was developed. The data gathered in this study is important as it could be utilised by the university to develop and implement the proposed green building guidelines...|$|R
