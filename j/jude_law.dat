5|$|The Swinton {{house was}} {{constructed}} on Stage 16, while Stage 20 {{was used for}} Rouge City and other sets. Spielberg copied Kubrick's obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew, banning press from the set, and making actors sign confidentiality agreements. Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production. Haley Joel Osment and <b>Jude</b> <b>Law</b> applied prosthetic makeup daily {{in an attempt to}} look shinier and robotic. Costume designer Bob Ringwood (Batman, Troy) studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras. Spielberg found post-production on A.I. difficult because he was simultaneously preparing to shoot Minority Report.|$|E

5|$|Arulpragasam befriended {{students}} in the college's fashion, advertising and graphics departments.

5|$|In June 1937 the Old Vic company took up an {{invitation}} to perform Hamlet {{in the courtyard of}} the castle at Elsinore, where Shakespeare located the play. Olivier secured the casting of Leigh to replace Cherry Cottrell as Ophelia. Because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel, but the tradition of playing Hamlet at Elsinore was established, and Olivier was followed by, among others, Gielgud (1939), Redgrave (1950), Richard Burton (1954), Derek Jacobi (1979), Kenneth Branagh (1988) and <b>Jude</b> <b>Law</b> (2009). Back in London, the company staged Macbeth, with Olivier in the title role. The stylised production by Michel Saint-Denis was not well liked, but Olivier had some good notices among the bad. On returning from Denmark, Olivier and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over; Esmond moved out of the marital house and in with her mother. After Olivier and Leigh made a tour of Europe in mid 1937 they returned to separate film projects—A Yank at Oxford for her and The Divorce of Lady X for him—and moved into a property together in Iver, Buckinghamshire.|$|E

One year later, Rocca appeared in Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley as <b>Jude</b> <b>Law's</b> lover, then she appeared in other international productions, including Kenneth Branagh's Love's Labour's Lost, Mike Figgis' experimental Hotel and Tom Tykwer's Heaven.|$|R
50|$|Simpkins' film break was in Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005). Next was a {{featured}} role in All the King's Men (2006) {{where he}} played a young version of <b>Jude</b> <b>Law's</b> character; leading up to Simpkins' playing Aaron in the multiple-award-winning Little Children (2006). Simpkins went on to film Pride and Glory (2008), in which he and his sister, actress Ryan Simpkins, play the children of Colin Farrell. Simpkins also completed Gardens of the Night (2008) and then in Revolutionary Road (2008), in which he again starred alongside his real-life sister Ryan.

5|$|In July 2004, it was {{announced}} Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen, and they hired Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Eventually, Aronofsky left to focus on The Fountain, and Paramount replaced him with Paul Greengrass, with a target release date of summer 2006. At this time, Paddy Considine, was involved in negotiations for Rorschach. <b>Jude</b> <b>Law</b> (a fan of the comic) and Tom Cruise both lobbied for Ozymandias. Greengrass wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Dan Dreiberg and Hilary Swank as Laurie. To publicize the film, Paramount launched a now-defunct Watchmen teaser website that had a message board as well as computer wallpaper available to download. Graphic artist Tristan Schane drew designs of Dr. Manhattan for the film, which depicted him with visible intestines. Gilliam read Greengrass's revision of Hayter's script and liked it, but told the director {{he did not think}} the studio would greenlight such a dark film. In March 2005, with rumors that high-profile projects, including Watchmen, were in danger of being cut, Paramount's CEO Donald De Line began urging a reduction in Watchmens budget so the film could get the greenlight. When Brad Grey took over as Paramount’s CEO, Levin feared potential budget cuts, so he made plans to move the project outside the UK in an effort to save money. Before he could, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround, again.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2013, Donmar Warehouse {{opened their}} new production. It was {{directed}} by Josie Rourke, starring Tom Hiddleston in the title role, along with Mark Gatiss, Deborah Findlay, Hadley Fraser, and Birgitte Hjort Sørensen. The production received very strong reviews. Michael Billington with The Guardian wrote [...] "A fast, witty, intelligent production that, in Tom Hiddleston, boasts a fine Coriolanus." [...] He also credited Mark Gatiss as excellent as Menenius, the [...] "humorous patrician". Writer for Variety, David Benedict wrote that Deborah Findlay in her commanding maternal pride, held beautifully in opposition by Birgitte Hjort Sørensen as Coriolanus's wife Virgilia. Helen Lewis, in her review of Coriolanus, along with two other concurrently running sold-out Shakespeare productions with celebrity leads — David Tennant's Richard II and <b>Jude</b> <b>Law's</b> Henry V — concludes [...] "if you can beg, borrow or plunder a ticket {{to one of these}} plays, let it be Coriolanus." [...] The play was broadcast in cinemas in the U.K. and internationally on 30 January 2014 as part of the National Theatre Live programme.|$|R
5000|$|Film actors won {{an unusual}} number of awards this season, with Denzel Washington, Scarlett Johansson, Viola Davis and Catherine Zeta-Jones among the winners. [...] So many film actors {{appeared}} on Broadway {{last year that}} theatre actor Hunter Foster created a Facebook page called [...] "Give the Tonys Back to Broadway". The New York Times critic Charles Isherwood wrote, [...] "I share {{to a certain extent}} Mr. Foster’s dismay at this year’s star-glutted Tony awards. ... It’s possible that if the Tony administrators had not kicked the journalists out of the voting pool, {{there might have been a}} few more worthy winners." [...] Isherwood called the proliferation of Hollywood stars on Broadway [...] "ominous", claiming that projects from last season featuring film actors such as <b>Jude</b> <b>Law's</b> Hamlet and A Steady Rain monopolized the box office, causing [...] "superior" [...] plays to fail. On the other hand, Isherwood felt, it is possible that [...] "welcoming film stars on Broadway - the talented ones, anyway - help New York theater to reassert its importance to the culture, and maybe even to tilt the balance of the entertainment business at least a little back toward the East Coast".|$|R
500|$|In late 2003, Murphy starred as a lovelorn, hapless {{supermarket}} stocker who plots a bank heist with Colin Farrell in Intermission, {{which became}} the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until The Wind That Shakes the Barley broke the record in 2006). Reflecting on his roles in 28 Days Later and the [...] "sad-sack Dublin shelf-stacker" [...] in Intermission, Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune stated that Murphy brought [...] "fluent ease to the roles he takes on, a graceful and wholly believable intensity. His delicate good looks have, {{as much as his}} acting prowess, caused people to mark him as Ireland's next Colin Farrell, albeit one who seems less likely to be caught tomcatting around or brawling drunkenly at premieres". Murphy had a minor supporting role in the successful Hollywood period drama Cold Mountain. He portrayed a deserting soldier who shares a grim scene with <b>Jude</b> <b>Law's</b> character, and was only on location in Romania for a week. Murphy stated that it was a [...] "massive production", remarking that director Anthony Minghella was the calmest director he'd ever met. Murphy also had a role as a butcher in Girl with a Pearl Earring with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.|$|R
