50|$|The {{replication}} initiator protein (Rep) plays a {{key role}} in initiation of replication in plasmids. In its monomer form, Rep binds an <b>iteron</b> and promotes replication. The protein itself is known to contain two independent N-terminal and C-terminal globular domains that subsequently bind to two domains of the <b>iteron.</b> The dimer version of the protein is generally inactive in <b>iteron</b> binding, however it is known to bind to the repE operator. This operator contains half of the <b>iteron</b> sequence making it able to bind the dimer and promote gene expression.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Iteron</b> plasmids, {{including}} F and RK2-related plasmids, have oriV regions containing multiple (~3-7) repeats of 17-22 bp <b>iteron</b> sequences.pSC101 {{represents a}} simple model of an <b>iteron</b> plasmid. <b>Iteron</b> plasmids control copy number through two combined methods, suitable for low copy number stringent plasmids. One method is control of RepA synthesis. RepA {{is the only}} plasmid-encoded protein required for replication in pSC101. RepA protein represses its own synthesis by binding to its own promoter region and blocking transcription of itself (transcriptional autoregulation). Thus, the more RepA is made, the more its synthesis is repressed, and subsequently limiting plasmid replication. The coupling hypothesis proposes that the second method is coupling of plasmids through the Rep protein and <b>iteron</b> sequences. When the plasmid concentration is high, RepA plasmids bound to iterons form dimers in between two plasmids, [...] "handcuffing" [...] them at the origin of replication and inhibiting replication.|$|E
50|$|High {{copy number}} plasmids, also called relaxed plasmids, require {{a system to}} ensure that {{replication}} is inhibited once the number of plasmids in the cell reaches a certain threshold. Low copy number plasmids, also called stringent plasmids, require tighter control of replication.Relaxed plasmids are generally regulated through one of two mechanisms: antisense RNA or <b>iteron</b> binding groups.|$|E
50|$|Plasmids {{are known}} to have very similar {{structure}} when under control of <b>Iterons.</b> This structure consists of an origin of replication upstream of a gene that codes for a replication initiator protein.

40|$|Plasmid {{origins of}} {{replication}} are rare in bacterial chromosomes, except in multichromosome bacteria. The replication origin of Vibrio cholerae chromosome II (chrII) closely resembles iteron-bearing plasmid origins. <b>Iterons</b> are repeated initiator binding sites in plasmid origins and participate both in replication initiation and its control. The control is mediated primarily by coupling of <b>iterons</b> via the bound initiators (“handcuffing”), which causes steric hindrance to the origin. The control in chrII must be different, since {{the timing of}} its replication is cell cycle-specific, whereas in plasmids it is random. Here we show that chrII uses, in addition to <b>iterons,</b> another kind of initiator binding site, named 39 -mers. The 39 -mers confer stringent control by increasing handcuffing of <b>iterons,</b> presumably via initiator remodeling. <b>Iterons,</b> although potential inhibitors of replication themselves, restrain the 39 -mer–mediated inhibition, possibly by direct coupling (“heterohandcuffing”).

40|$|A typical plasmid {{replicon}} of Escherichia coli, such as ori γ of R 6 K, contains tandem iterons (iterated initiator protein binding sites), an AT-rich {{region that}} melts upon initiator-iteron interaction, two binding {{sites for the}} bacterial initiator protein DnaA, and a binding site for the DNA-bending protein IHF. R 6 K also contains two structurally atypical origins called α and β that are located {{on either side of}} γ and contain a single and a half-iteron, respectively. Individually, these sites do not bind to initiator protein π but access it by DNA looping-mediated interaction with the seven π-bound γ iterons. The π protein exists in 2 interconvertible forms: inert dimers and active monomers. Initiator dimers generally function as negative regulators of replication by promoting <b>iteron</b> pairing (“handcuffing”) between pairs of replicons that turn off both origins. Contrary to this existing paradigm, here we show that both the dimeric and the monomeric π are necessary for ori α-driven plasmid maintenance. Furthermore, efficient looping interaction between α and γ or between 2 γ iterons in vitro also required both forms of π. Why does α-γ <b>iteron</b> pairing promote α activation rather than repression? We show that a weak, transitory α-γ interaction at the <b>iteron</b> pairs was essential for α-driven plasmid maintenance. Swapping the α <b>iteron</b> with one of γ without changing the original sequence context that caused enhanced looping in vitro caused a significant inhibition of α-mediated plasmid maintenance.

It has been proposed that the iteron-bound RepA couples with the promoter-bound RepA and thereby maintains repression. Although not the product of replication, we find that the act of replication itself can renew RepA synthesis. Replication apparently cleans the promoter of bound RepA and provides a window of opportunity for repA transcription.

40|$|In bacteria, {{plasmids}} {{and some}} DNA viruses, DNA replication is initiated and regulated by binding of initiator proteins to repetitive sequences. To understand the control mechanism {{we used the}} plasmid mini-F, whose copy number is stringently maintained in Escherichia coli, mainly by its initiator protein RepE and the incC region. The monomers of RepE protein bound to incC <b>iterons,</b> which exert incompatibility in trans and control the copy number of mini-F plasmid in cis.

Using a ligation assay, we found that RepE proteins mediated a cross-link structure between ori 2 and incC, for which the dimerization domain of RepE and the structure of incC seem to be important.

Transcription of the repN gene starts 167 nucleotides upstream from the translational start site of repN. The copy number of repN-coding plasmid pHDCS 2, in which the repN gene was placed downstream of the IPTG (isopropyl- 1 -thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) -inducible Pspac promoter, was increased 100 fold by the addition of IPTG. Histidine-tagged RepN bound to a specific region in the repN gene containing five 22 -bp tandem repeats (iterons) with partial mismatches, as shown by gel retardation and foot printing analyses. Sequence alterations in the first three iterons resulted in an increase in plasmid copy number, whereas those in either the forth or fifth <b>iteron</b> resulted in the failure of plasmid replication.

Finally, by using a plasmid, pHDMAEC 21, carrying the sequence alterations in all the five iterons in repN and thus unable to replicate but encoding intact RepN, the region necessary for replication was confined to a 96 -bp sequence spanning the 3 ′-terminal half of the fourth <b>iteron</b> to an A+T-rich region located downstream of the fifth <b>iteron.</b> From these results, we conclude that the iterons in repN are involved in both the control of plasmid copy number and incompatibility, and we suggest that the binding of RepN to the last two iterons triggers replication by melting the A+T-rich DNA sequence...|$|E

The ability of the pRAS 3 plasmids to mobilize the oriT regions of two other plasmids of the IncQ- 2 family, pTF-FC 2 and pTC-F 14, suggested that the mobilization proteins pRAS 3 are relaxed and can mobilize oriT regions with substantially different sequences. Plasmids pRAS 3. 1 and pRAS 3. 2 were highly incompatible with plasmids pTF-FC 2 and pTC-F 14, and this incompatibility was removed on inactivation of an open reading frame situated downstream of the mobCDE mobilization genes rather than being due to the 22 -bp oriV-associated <b>iterons.</b> We propose that the pRAS 3 plasmids represent a third, γ incompatibility group within the IncQ- 2 family plasmids.

40|$|In {{one family}} of {{bacterial}} plasmids, multiple initiator binding sites, called <b>iterons,</b> {{are used for}} initiation of plasmid replication {{as well as for}} the control of plasmid copy number. <b>Iterons</b> can also pair in vitro via the bound initiators. This pairing, called handcuffing, has been suggested to cause steric hindrance to initiation and thereby control the copy number. To test this hypothesis, we have compared copy numbers of isogenic miniP 1 plasmid monomer and dimer. The dimer copy number was only one-quarter that of the monomer, suggesting that the higher local concentration of origins in the dimer facilitated their pairing. Physical evidence consistent with iteron-mediated pairing of origins preferentially in the dimer was obtained in vivo. Thus, origin handcuffing can be a mechanism to control P 1 plasmid replication...|$|R
40|$|The RepE {{initiator}} protein (251 residues) {{is essential}} for mini-F replication in Escherichia coli and exhibits two major functions: initiation of DNA replication from ori 2 and autogenous repression of repE transcription. Whereas the initiation is mediated by RepE monomers that bind to the ori 2 <b>iterons</b> (direct repeats), the autogenous repression is mediated by dimers that bind to the repE operator, which contains an inverted repeat sequence related to the <b>iterons.</b> We now report that the binding of RepE to these DNA sites is primarily determined by the C-terminal region of this protein. The mutant RepE proteins lacking either the N-terminal 33 (or more) residues or the C-terminal 7 (or more) residues were first shown to be defective in binding to both the ori 2 and the operator DNAs. However, direct screening and analysis of mutant RepEs which are specifically affected in binding to the ori 2 <b>iterons</b> revealed that the mutations (mostly amino acid substitutions) occur exclusively in the C-terminal region (residues 168 to 242). These mutant proteins exhibited reduced binding to ori 2 and no detectable binding to the operator. Thus, whereas truncation of either end of RepE can destroy the DNA-binding activities, the C-terminal region appears to represent a primary DNA-binding domain of RepE for both ori 2 and the operator. Analogous DNA-binding domains seem to be conserved among the initiator proteins of certain related plasmids...|$|R
