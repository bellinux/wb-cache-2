40|$|With this handbook, our {{aim is to}} {{show how}} students, {{teachers}} and universities throughout Europe can {{get the most out}} of OpenCourseWare to participate in new learning communities and facilitate virtual exchanges across borders. This handbook is one of the results of a <b>European</b> <b>education</b> <b>project</b> funded by the Lifelong Learning Programme of the European Union entitled “OpenCourseWare in the European HE context: How to make use of its full potential for virtual mobility”. More information about the project can be found at www. opencourseware. eu/background. The focus of this project is to lay the foundations for a strong European OpenCourseWare framework. A stronger framework also means closer cooperation between European institutes, which results in the mutual use of material and even joint degrees. A better functioning OpenCourseWare system will enhance quality and increase the usage of online courses while facilitating virtual mobility through increased co-operation and the removal of barriers to higher education. A virtual mobility experience can be a valid alternative for the many students who cannot travel for studies abroad for financial reasons. This handbook offers a number of resources, guidelines and scenarios to increase the use of open educational resources for student mobility in European Higher Education. In the first chapter, we define a number of frequently used terms, such as Open Educational Resources, OpenCourseWare or (Virtual) Student Mobility, and outline the context of student mobility, both physical and virtual. In the second chapter, we offer a number of scenarios for the use of OpenCourseWare both in the context of on-campus education and that of (virtual) student mobility. This handbook ends with a description of current (and future) trends in Open Education. nrpages: 24 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Objectives of the Study: This study aims to {{facilitate}} the rapprochement of the <b>European</b> higher <b>education</b> benchmarking <b>projects</b> towards a unified European benchmarking project. Total of four higher <b>education</b> IT benchmarking <b>projects</b> are analysed by comparing their categorisation of benchmarking indicators and their data manipulation processes. Four select benchmarking projects are compared in this fashion for the first time. The focus is especially on the Finnish Bencheit project's point of view. Academic background and methodology: The comparability of <b>European</b> higher <b>education</b> IT benchmarking <b>projects</b> is explored by combining theories from the literature and experience from higher education IT directors. Using case study methods, four IT benchmarking projects are examined, each in a different country. Results are obtained by analysing acquired raw data, reports, documentation, public material, interview data, and by commissioning a questionnaire. Findings and conclusions: Comparison of the participating projects using the framework shows that their data indicators are currently not very comparable. Most comparable data categories {{can be found in}} basic volume and cost data, but almost all advanced - and especially qualitative indicators - are non-comparable. Data collection, validation, and manipulation processed show certain similarities, which can be potentially streamlined without losing data comparability. Successful rapprochement of the existing <b>European</b> higher <b>education</b> IT benchmarking <b>projects</b> requires constant and close cooperation among the projects' managers. Sudden fusion of the existing projects will most likely lead to a failure, not least due to unacceptable sacrifices in lost data collection work over the years. We propose a Co-operation Organisation for coordinating the rapprochement of the European benchmarking projects through gradual streamlining of their operations over consecutive benchmarking cycles...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To compare {{different}} {{indicators for}} assessing the quality of drug prescribing and establish their agreement in identifying doctors who may not adhere to treatment guidelines. Data Sources/Study Setting. Data from 181 general practitioners (GPs) from The Netherlands. The case of asthma is used as an example because, in this area, different quality indicators exist whose validity is questioned. The study {{is part of the}} <b>European</b> Drug <b>Education</b> <b>Project.</b> Study Design. Spearman rank correlations were assessed among the GPs' scores on self-report instruments, aggregated prescribing indicators, and individualized prescribing indicators. Kappa values were calculated as agreement measures for identifying low adherence to the guidelines. Data Collection. Prescribing data from GPs were collected through pharmacies, public health insurance companies, or computerized GP databases. Two self-report instruments were mailed to the GPs. The GPs first received a questionnaire assessing their competence regarding the treatment of asthma patients. Three months later they received a series of 16 written asthma cases asking for their intended treatment for each case. Principal Findings. Correlations between scores based on self-report instruments and indicators based on actual prescribing data were mostly nonsignificant and varied between 0 and 0. 21. GPs identified as not adhering to the guidelines by the prescribing indicators often had high scores on the self-report instruments. Correlations between 0. 20 and 0. 55 were observed among indicators based on aggregated prescribing data and those based on individualized data. The agreement for identifying low adherence was small, with kappa values ranging from 0. 19 to 0. 30. Conclusions. Indicators based on self-report instruments seem to overestimate guideline adherence. Indicators assessing prescribing quality at an aggregated level give clearly different results, as compared to indicators evaluating prescribing data on an individual patient level. Caution is needed when using such prescribing indicators to identify low adherence to guidelines. Further validation studies using a gold standard comparison are needed to define the best possible indicator...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a British Council funded Higher <b>Education</b> Link <b>project</b> {{involving}} three institutions-Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) in the UK and two South African institutions, the University of South Africa (UNISA) and Rhodes University. The link is a research and development project that has three main research strands: contextual profiling that will establish the applicability of a <b>European</b> teacher <b>education</b> <b>project</b> to the South African context, evaluative materials development and piloting predicated on a respect for indigenous and contextual knowledge, and impact analysis that will examine the role of multidirectional intergenerational mentoring in disseminating messages about sustainable lifestyles. The project is strongly influenced by the South African Revised National Curriculum statements pertaining to environment and {{an analysis of the}} impact that these materials have had on promoting whole school approaches to environmental education in South Africa. The link's initial purpose is to develop advanced certificate in education (ACE) course materials that will promote whole school approaches to environmental education, based on developing concepts of collaboration, pupil participation, educational process and action in schools in South Africa. Materials from the MMU-based, European Commission funded Sustainability <b>Education</b> in <b>European</b> Primary Schools (SEEPS) Project will be adapted for use in South Africa by UNISA and Rhodes. This paper reports {{on the development of the}} project and explores some of its activities and results to date. It documents how the project team approached the integrating redevelopment of SEEPS ideas and materials to use these resources in the design of continuing professional development (CPD) activities for ACE courses in environmental education at UNISA and Rhodes. The second section is written in semi-dialogue form to try to reflect the nature of the discussions that occurred between the partners in the link during meetings in the UK. This dialogue outlines the conceptual and philosophical background to the SEEPS Project before examining continuities and tensions that arose in clarifying and situating guiding perspectives for CPD and whole school approaches in and for South African school contexts through the medium of teacher education. The paper also reviews how the South African team are interacting with ideas and materials from SEEPS to clarify whole school approaches to environmental education in South Africa and discusses the contexts within which the outcomes of the link will unfold. © 2006 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
