2500|$|The Lerma is introduced, an {{original}} adaptation combining VAM American sedan with {{the rear of}} the smaller Rally creating a line of two- and four-door hatchbacks in a European style. The VAM American for 1981 in high trim included as standard equipment a rear defroster, reading <b>dome</b> <b>lights,</b> intermittent wipers, dual remote controlled mirrors, and AM/FM stereo radio. The option list now added a tilt steering column and power seats. All units had the AMC-designed Spirit grille for the year along with fan shroud and coolant recovery tank as standard equipment regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. Appearance changes included [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel covers for the high trim versions. The base models were upgraded, and ordering any of the three body styles with automatic transmission now included as standard equipment: a quartz digital clock, retractable seat belts, tinted windshield, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light), woodgrain panels applied on the dashboard, wheel trim rings, full bright molding package (hood, rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails), and protective rubber side moldings aside from the already existing power steering and bumper guards. This meant a mid-range model between the standard basic units and the GFS/ECD/DL ones. This created for the first time an automatic base wagon that was not a DL. However, despite this change, VAM did not create any designation or distinction for the new better-equipped base models. In 1981 and 1982 there were four versions of the station wagon model: base manual, base automatic, basic DL, and equipped DL.|$|E

The leader of the expeditionary force appears to be a gold Dalek with natural aluminium collars and slats, black hemispheres and a black fender. A black Dalek with gold hemispheres, natural aluminium collars and slats and a black fender is in charge of a mining operation in Bedfordshire, while a red Dalek with natural aluminium collars and slats and a black fender with red topping is shown commanding a Dalek spaceship and operations to capture human slaves and wipe-out the resistance.
