5|$|In the interim, {{between the}} Royal Rumble and WrestleMania, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction {{was brought to}} an {{official}} on-screen conclusion. By the time he returned, Triple H's on-screen marriage to Stephanie McMahon was faltering, so Stephanie faked a pregnancy {{in order to get}} him back on her side.

Stephanie aligned with Jericho afterward, but she was forced to leave after losing a triple threat match on Raw the night after WrestleMania when she was pinned by Triple H. The divorce, and thus the storyline, was finalized at Vengeance.|$|E

Lois goes to comfort Tom's co-anchor, Diane Simmons, only to {{intuitively}} realize she is the true murderer when Diane shows a dress for her solo debut on the news, even though she couldn't have known Tom would be leaving. Diane reveals that she had dated Woods until he <b>dumped</b> <b>her</b> upon her fortieth birthday, around which Tom arranged her to be replaced on the Channel 5 News. Seeking revenge, Diane bribed Priscilla to make James become a born-again Christian and throw the dinner party so she could murder Woods and frame Tom for the crime, but was forced to kill the other guests after her plan went awry upon Stephanie's accidental death. Priscilla woke up when she was removing the knife due to Joe pointing out her fingerprints were on it, so had her throat slit. When Diane was hiding the body in Tom's room, Muriel saw her so was stabbed. The murderess did not have time to conceal the knife, but was able to wipe her fingerprints clean. She killed Derek to stop the police getting involved.

25|$|Perhaps 1,500 LCAs {{survived the}} war in {{serviceable}} condition. But many of these LCAs were discarded, as when the LSI HMS Persimmon, returning to Britain from the Far East in 1946, <b>dumped</b> <b>her</b> lower deck LCAs overboard to lighten ship and make better speed. Many LCAs used in the Far East were not {{sent back to the}} United Kingdom. Damaged LCAs, along with other damaged landing craft, were sunk rather than repaired. In Cochin, India, at the shore establishment HMS Chinkara (home of the Landing Craft Storage, Section 21), many LCA were towed out to the 10 fathom mark and sunk by various means from axe to Bofors gun fire. In home waters, {{the end of the war}} meant the merchant ships and passenger liners that had served as LSIs were returned to their owners and refitted to civilian trim. This left an LCA surfeit that was sold off for civilian uses. They were popular acquisitions among riparian holiday-makers and canal enthusiasts in Britain. Their holds covered and ramps sealed, LCAs became charming little houseboats.|$|E

25|$|In March 1973, five fascists, commissioned—according to some rumors—by {{high-ranking}} {{officials in}} Milan's Carabinieri, abducted Rame, held her at gunpoint and <b>dumped</b> <b>her</b> in a van. They raped her, beat her, burnt her with cigarettes, slashed her with razor blades {{and left her}} in a park. Fo and Rame continued to tour around Lombardy and Veneto throughout that year, despite a split in La Comune; the short piece Mamma Togni dates from this time. In September 1973, after the suicide of Salvador Allende in Chile, Guerra di popolo in Cile (The People's War in Chile) was produced, and toured the country attracting great interest. This was particularly due to a part at the end that unnerved audiences, who thought a coup had been declared across Italy. According to Chiara Valentini, {{a member of the}} audience panicked during a performance in Turin and ate ten pages of what he thought might be compromising names, while in Merano a student broke the glass in an attempt to flee through a window. The actual police arrested Fo in Sassari in November 1973, leading to nationwide uproar when it emerged that under Italian law the police could not enter the theatre during the performance; the outcry served only to boost attendances at future performances.|$|E

500|$|By 19:00, Franchise had <b>dumped</b> <b>her</b> {{lifeboats}} {{and a large}} {{quantity of}} guns and supplies overboard, lightening the ship {{enough for her to}} far outstrip the pursuit. As night fell the French frigate made a full escape from the British force. Médée however had not escaped. Although Bombay Castle was many miles behind, only distantly visible on the horizon, Exeter had been able to follow the frigate closely. Meriton was aware that the French warship was much stronger than his own merchant vessel, but realized that as the frigate had made no effort to fight, her commander must believe Exeter to be a ship of the line. To reinforce this image in the rapidly approaching darkness, Meriton arranged lights behind every gunport, whether or not it contained a cannon, creating an effect described as [...] "a fearsome, leering jack-o'-lantern". As his ship drew level with the French frigate, Meriton hailed the enemy's deck, calling on them to surrender. Intimidated by this large and seemingly powerful enemy, Coudin decided that his only option was to strike his flag and come aboard the British ship to surrender formally. Arriving on board, he was astonished to see far fewer and smaller guns than a warship normally carried. When Coudin asked to whom he had surrendered, Meriton is said to have replied [...] "To a merchantman". Appalled, Coudin demanded to be allowed to return to his ship and conduct a formal naval battle, but Meriton refused.|$|E
