5000|$|<b>Heat-shrinkable</b> means just that, heat them up {{and they}} shrink, or more correctly, they recover in length. A <b>heat-shrinkable</b> sleeve starts out with a thick {{extruded}} poly olefin sheet (polyethylene or polypropylene) that is formulated to be cross-linkable. After extruding the thick sheet, it is taken to the “beam” where it is passed under a unit that subjects the sheet to electron irradiation. [...] The irradiation process cross-links the polyolefin. This improves the molecular structure such that the polyolefin will work {{as part of a}} <b>heat-shrinkable</b> sleeve and provide the required level of mechanical protection while in-service. It makes the polyolefin perform more like a tough, heat-resistant, elastic material or rubber, rather than like a plastic material.|$|E

5000|$|Wrapped {{optical fibre}} cable {{technology}} was developed independently in the UK and Japan in the early 1980s. In the UK, Raychem Ltd had a background in polymeric materials with resistance to high voltage environments; used for example in <b>heat-shrinkable</b> 33kV cable terminations and in polymer insulators. The initial development involved an all-dielectric fibre optic cable with a sheath made from tracking resistant material. The first installation was carried out on a 33kV overhead distribution line between sub-stations at Hartley and Goudhurst in Kent, UK in December 1982.The choice of a 33kV line indicates the expected market for the technology - building communication networks over local distribution lines when transmission and sub-transmission lines {{were expected to be}} equipped with OPGW. Over the next five years, installations were carried out in Norway, New Zealand, USA, India, Germany, France and Finland totalling about 180 km in both ground-wire and phase-conductor installations, and on both distribution and transmission lines. Raychem sold the wrapped {{optical fibre cable}} technology to Cookson Group plc in 1987.

5000|$|Flying models borrow {{construction}} techniques from full-sized aircraft {{although the}} use of metal is limited. These might consist of forming a frame using thin planks of a light wood such as balsa to duplicate the formers, longerons, spars, and ribs of a vintage full-size aircraft, or, on larger (usually powered) models where weight {{is less of a}} factor, sheets of wood, expanded polystyrene, and wood veneers may be employed. Regardless of the underlying structure, it is then skinned and subsequently doped to provide a smooth sealed surface. For light models, tissue paper is used. After it is applied, the paper is sprayed with a mist of water, which causes the paper to shrink when it dries. For larger models (usually powered and radio controlled) heat-curing or heat shrink covering plastic films or <b>heat-shrinkable</b> synthetic fabrics are applied to the model then heated using a hand held hair dryer, laundry iron or heat gun to tighten the material and adhere to the frame. Microfilm covering is used for the very lightest models and is made by bringing a wire loop up through water to pick up a thin plastic film on the surface made from a few drops of lacquer spread out over several square feet.For a more mass market approach, [...] "foamies," [...] or aircraft injection-molded from lightweight foam (sometimes reinforced) have made indoor flight more accessible to hobbyists.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the scheme {{for the study of}} the Bragg {{wavelength}} shift dependence on the applied tensile force. Samples of fiber Bragg gratings with different coatings have been studied: the restored acrylate coating, the heatshrinkable fusion splice protection sleeve without metal rod, the <b>heat-shrinkable</b> fusion splice protection sleeve with a metal rod, the metal capillary, polyvinylchloride tube. For different coatings of diffractive structure, dependences of wavelength shift for the Bragg grating resonance have been obtained on the tensile strength applied to the ends of an optical fiber. It was determined that the studied FBG coatings give the possibility to reduce the mechanical impact on the Bragg wavelength shift for 1. 1 - 15 times as compared to an uncoated waveguide. The most effective version of coated fiber Bragg grating is the heatshrinkable fusion splice protection sleeve with a metal rod. When the force (equal to 6 N) is applied to the 100 mm optical fiber area with the inscribed diffractive structure, the Bragg wavelength shift is 7. 5 nm for the unprotected sample and 0. 5 nm for the one coated with the <b>heat-shrinkable</b> fusion splice protection sleeve...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the minimum time necessary for equal distribution of salt in all parts of Reino cheese, from surface to center, and check if there was significant difference in this distribution in different ripening conditions. The cheeses of the same lot were subjected to two treatments, with different temperatures, relative humidity and with and without packaging. In the first treatment the cheese was ripened without <b>heat-shrinkable</b> packaging at a temperature of 18 °C to 22 ° C with 55 % - 65 % relative humidity. In the second treatment, the cheese was initially ripened without packaging (only the first five days) and under the same conditions as the first treatment and after this period was packaged in <b>heat-shrinkable</b> packaging and ripening at 5 °C - 10 °C with 70 % - 80 % relative humidity, until completing all the prescribed time maturation. The characterization of the salt distribution profile in Reino cheese was conducted by determining the percentage content of sodium chloride (w/w) in the central, intermediate and superficial portions. Analysis of variance indicated that {{there was no difference between}} treatments in the distribution of salt in Reino cheese, however, there were differences between cheese portion analyzed and maturation time, which showed dependence of the distribution of salt depending on these variables. It follows that from the 27 th day after manufacturing, salt is distributed equally in all parts of the Reino cheese, regardless of different ripening conditions used...|$|E

The axial pipe-soil interaction {{can be divided into}} three pipe sections: the sliding section, the fixed section and the starting friction section. Although limited to a relatively small length of the pipe, the pipe coats of the starting friction section would suffer much higher shear force caused by thermal expansion than those of the sliding section or the fixed section. Based on the axial equilibrium equation of this kind of insulated pipeline, we developed a method for checking the shear force on CIF coats and their interfaces. The typical example shows that starting friction effect should be taken into account when checking the lap shear strength of <b>heat-shrinkable</b> sleeves on CIF field joints.|$|E

The scour-induced free span can be monitored through different heat transfer behaviors of in-water and in-sediment scenarios during heating and cooling processes. Two sets of experiments, including exposing different lengths of the upper surface of the pipeline to water and creating free spans of various lengths, were carried out in laboratory. In both cases, the scour condition was immediately detected by the proposed {{monitoring system}}, which confirmed the system is robust and very sensitive.

40|$|Although various {{shape memory}} {{polymers}} (SMPs) or diverse applications {{have been widely}} reported, the SMPs based on rubbers have been rarely realized due to the low triggering temperature of rubbers. In another aspect, the SMPs based on sustainable substances are highly desired for the growing shortage in fossil resources. In the present study, we accordingly developed the sustainable SMPs with tunable triggering temperature, based on natural rubber (NR) and ferulic acid (FA) as the raw materials. Specifically, the SMPs {{are based on a}} crosslinked network of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) crosslinked by in situ formed zinc ferulate (ZDF) via oxa-Michael reaction. The excellent shape memory effect (SME) is found in these SMPs, as evidenced by the high fixity/recovery ratio and the tunable triggering temperature. With the incorporation of natural halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), the stress and recovery rate of the SMPs are found to be tunable, which widens the application of this kind of SMPs.

A degradation model for the changes of the mechanical properties of the sleeves in electron radiation environment was proposed. It is shown that the increase of irradiation degradation of the polyethylene causes the sleeves' mechanical properties. For the penetration depth of different energy electrons in polyethylene is different, only a shallow layer the sleeves is affected by 45 keV energy electrons, while 1 MeV and 2 MeV energy electrons are penetrated the sleeves and cause the sleeves great damage.

The proposed phantom consisted of glycerol base tissue equivalent material, vessel mimic tube, and blood mimic substances. The vessel mimic tube was placed inner glycerol phantom and it was filled with blood mimic substances. Blood-mimicked substances are prepared by adjusting the concentration of the glycerol solution to be similar to the acoustic properties of the blood, and vessel-mimicking materials are selected by measuring acoustic properties and thermal shrinkage of various materials in a <b>heat-shrinkable</b> tube. The blood vessels surrounding the tissue are replaced with the phantom similar to glycerol-based organization, and venous blood flow is implemented using a DC motor.

When fruit are exposed to temperatures below 5 – 6 °C chilling injury appears as pitting of the skin, browning of the white segments separating the arils and discoloration of the arils, and husk scald, which generally is more severe at temperatures of 6 – 10 °C. The main objective of this work {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of individual film packaging, applied as a stand alone treatment or in combination with fludioxonil, on reducing the occurrence of husk scald, weight loss and decay. Fruit were dipped in an aqueous mixture containing 600 mg L − 1 fludioxonil, wrapped or not wrapped with a polyolephinic <b>heat-shrinkable</b> film and stored at 8 °C and 90 % RH for 6 or 12 weeks plus one additional week of simulated shelf-life at 20 °C and 65 – 70 % RH. Respiration rate decreased both in cold storage and at 20 °C. Ethylene production was not detected during cold storage; its rate increased upon transfer to 20 °C, but results were inconsistent. Control fruit deteriorated at a very high rate, due to excessive weight loss, skin browning and decay. Film wrapping almost completely inhibited weight loss and husk scald and preserved fruit freshness for the whole storage time. There was no statistical difference in decay incidence between wrapped and control fruit after 6 or 12 weeks of storage and after the first shelf-life, while after the second shelf-life, wrapped fruit had significantly higher decay levels. By contrast, fludioxonil, both alone and in combination with wrapping, effectively controlled mold development, resulting in 50 – 67 % less decay than control fruit after 12 weeks at 8 °C plus one week shelf-life.
