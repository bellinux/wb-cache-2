40|$|Abstract. The present work {{investigates the}} effect of the {{detergent}} content diluted in the washing water on the friction coefficient of bare foot sliding against marble tiles during walking. Two types of deodorizers as well as a disinfectant were used. The static friction coefficient of bare foot at wet and dry sliding conditions was measured. The tested detergent was added into water in concentration varied from 0 to 0. 5 vol. %. The water was diluted by disinfectant of 2. 0 vol. % concentration before the tested tiles were replenished by the dilution. Experiments were carried out using a test rig designed and manufactured for these tests. Loads were applied up to 700 N. The normal and friction forces were measured to determine the static friction coefficient under wet and dry sliding conditions. Based on the experimental results, it was found that friction coefficient decreased with increasing the deodorizers content, where values of friction coefficient were relatively low so that the sliding conditions could be classified as unsafe walking. After <b>drying,</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient displayed relatively higher values than that observed by wet sliding. Besides, it was observed that friction coefficient decreased with increasing detergent content. The friction values were higher than that displayed by deodorizers. After <b>drying,</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient increased up to maximum then decreased with increasing detergent content. Diluting water by detergent and deodorizers showed drastic friction decrease for deodorizer (I). Significant friction increase was observed for deodorizer (II) at wet sliding condition. After <b>drying,</b> <b>friction</b> increased up to 0. 7 at 200 N load...|$|R

30|$|Sufficient {{conditions}} {{in terms of}} growth restrictions are given for the solvability of the Dirichlet boundary value problem to forced nonlinear differential equations involving the combination of viscous and <b>dry</b> <b>frictions.</b> Explicit estimates of solutions and their derivatives allow us to restrict ourselves to a sufficiently large neighbourhood of the origin, when formulating these effective conditions. In this way, the behaviour of nonlinearities outside of this neighbourhood can be quite arbitrary. In order to get optimal solvability criteria, the problems with one-term and complete linear differential operators will be treated separately by means of various Green’s functions. The obtained results are compared with some of their analogies of the other authors.|$|R

40|$|Simulations of <b>dry</b> sliding <b>friction</b> {{between a}} metal {{asperity}} and an incommensurate metal surface reveal unusual atomic processes. The lateral force exhibits a quasiperiodic variation with {{the displacement of}} an asperity; each period consists of two different stick-slip processes involving structural transitions. While one layer of asperity changes and matches the substrate lattice in the first slip, two asperity layers merge into a new one through a structural transition during the second slip. This leads to wear. The lateral force decreases abruptly during these slip stages, but it increases between two consecutive slips and resists the relative motion. The analysis of the order suggests that each structural transition {{is associated with a}} first-order phase transition. Nonadiabatic atomic rearrangements during these phase transitions involve a new kind of mechanism of energy dissipation in the <b>dry</b> sliding <b>friction...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of surface roughness magnitude and direction on <b>dry</b> static <b>friction</b> coefficient between two similar steel samples {{has been studied}} through an experiment. A testing apparatus has been designed and fabricated to measure the friction coefficient for a few forms of surface asperity. The average, maximum and minimum values of static friction coefficients among steel samples have been measured and numerically proposed in terms of some discrete values of the surface roughness, base and counter body angles. Correction coefficient defined as the ratio of maximum to minimum friction coefficient has been found on the result basis. According {{to the results of}} the experiments, <b>dry</b> static <b>friction</b> coefficient between two similar steel samples is affected by both magnitude and direction of surface roughness. Under the condition of static equilibrium, the Colomb- Amonton formula has been used to determine friction coefficient between samples.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the failure {{investigation of a}} tubular shaft {{that is part of}} a hammer drill assembly. The failure investigation was particularly challenging as the fracture surfaces were completely damaged during and subsequent to the failure process. However, careful examination of the component and its assembly revealed many clues that pointed to the root causes of failure. It was determined that the shaft was subjected to impact, fatigue, bending and torsional loads simultaneously at elevated temperatures. The basic failure mode was identified as a combination of torsional fatigue and rotating bending fatigue failure that originated on the inside diameter of the shaft. The root causes were determined to be operational overload in combination with rough machining marks on the bore surface and higher than necessary operating torque required to overcome the <b>dry</b> adhesive <b>friction</b> in the system. The preventative measures recommended were many-fold including improving surface finish on the bore diameter, reducing <b>dry</b> sliding <b>friction,</b> decreasing the overall level of dynamic loads by appropriate design changes and adding a surface strengthening heat treatmen...|$|R

[...] Amontons presented the nature of friction in terms of surface irregularities and the force required to raise the weight pressing the surfaces together.

A dynamic model has been prepared with four degrees of freedom which are the translational vibrations of the engine block in vertical and horizontal directions, the rotational vibration of the engine block around the crankshaft center and the fluctuation of crankshaft angular speed. The model comprises forces and moments caused by inertial effects, hydrodynamic and <b>dry</b> <b>frictions,</b> startup moment, external load, gas pressures and mount forces. Vibrations of the engine block and fluctuation of crankshaft speed were optimized by using practical values. The inertia moment of the flywheel {{was found to be}} the dominant factor to minimize the angular speed fluctuation of the crankshaft. The gas force and the mass of the pistons were found to be the prevalent parameters contributing to the rotational and translational vibrations of the block respectively. It is observed that the vertical vibration of the block could be adequately minimized by means of exposing counterweights to the crankshaft, however, the counterweight induces a horizontal vibration while diminishing the vertical vibration. Therefore, in minimization of the translational vibrations of engine block, in addition to exposing counterweights, the piston mass should be very well minimized...|$|R
