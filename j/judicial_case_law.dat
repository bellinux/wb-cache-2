40|$|The Wagner Act Model {{has formed}} the basis of Canada’s {{collective}} bargaining regime since World War II but has come under intense scrutiny in recent years because of legislative weakening of collective bargaining rights, constitutional litigation defending collective bargaining rights and declining union density. This article examines and assesses these developments, arguing that legislatively we have not witnessed a wholesale attack on Wagnerism, but rather a selective weakening of some of its elements. In the courts, it briefly appeared as if the judiciary might constitutionalize meaningful labour rights and impede the erosion of Wagnerism, but recent <b>judicial</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> suggests the prospects for this outcome are fading. While the political defence of Wagnerism may be necessary when the alternatives to it are likely worse, holding on to what we’ve got will not reverse the long-term decline in union density. The article concludes that at present there are no legal solutions to the labour movement’s problems and that innovative efforts to represent workers’ collective interests outside of formal collective bargaining provide a more promising alternative...|$|E

The main evidence and recommendations of the House of Commons Justice Committee inquiry into joint enterprise held in 2011 are summarised, with specific reference to how the complexity and inconsistency in application of the law, its use as a dragnet against gangs through police and prosecutorial over-charging, and convictions based on ‘foresight’ rather than criminal intent, can all lead to miscarriages of justice. The particular problems {{associated with the use of}} joint enterprise in relation to murder are described. The article concludes by examining the response of the UK authorities to the Justice Committee report, with specific reference to new draft prosecutorial guidance issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, which fails to clarify the law and in fact confirms the need for new legislation in this area...|$|E

40|$|While {{scholars}} have long probed the original understanding {{of judicial review}} and the early <b>judicial</b> review <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> this article presents {{a study of the}} <b>judicial</b> review <b>case</b> <b>law</b> in the United States before Marbury v. Madison that is dramatically more complete than prior work and that challenges previous scholarship on the original understanding of judicial review on the two most critical dimensions: how well judicial review was established {{at the time of the}} Founding and when it was exercised. Where prior work argues that judicial review was rarely exercised before Marbury (or that it was created in Marbury), this article shows that it was far more common than previously recognized: there are more than five times as many cases from the Early Republic as the leading historical account found. The article further shows that all of the cases in which statutes were invalidated fell into three categories: courts invalidated statutes that affected the powers of courts or juries, and they did so even when the legislation could plausibly be squared with constitutional text and prior practice; state courts invalidated state statutes for inconsistency with the federal constitution; and federal courts invalidated state statutes, and, again, they did so even when the statutes could plausibly be defended as constitutional. Scholars have missed this structural pattern, and the dominant view has been that only clearly unconstitutional statutes were invalidated. The article shows, instead, that the early <b>case</b> <b>law</b> reflects a structural approach to judicial review in which the level of scrutiny was closely linked to the nature of the challenged statute and that courts aggressively protected their power, the power of juries, and the power of the national government...|$|R

First is a monographic presentation of the Polish antimonopoly law. The considerations are not, however, limited to the antimonopoly act in force. Presentation of the current model of the competition law is preceded by the comprehensive theoretical study laying down the origins and basic definitions of contemporary Polish antimonopoly law. The second part is a selection of <b>judicial</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> in competition cases. Its role {{is to provide a}} reader with a practical insight into how the competition law is applied by the courts and what are the most important issues developed by the judiciary. The last part brings basic legal texts.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of constitutional jurisdiction, which subsequent to 19 th century beginnings in America has spread in several European countries {{since the end}} of the 1940 's and become a routine procedure after the changes in 1989 in Central and Eastern European countries, is a new product of development. Compared to dogmatically chiselled traditional administration of justice made more accurate by <b>judicial</b> <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> this new layer of law, which originally appeared in the form of human rights as the collection of ideological/ political requirements outside legal systems in operation, is characterised by highly different features. One such difference is that the normative content of constitutional rights and freedoms and fundamental principles is more abstract than the rules of traditional fields of law. The other difference is due to the fact that relations between particular rights are mostly irreconcilably strained, and a certain right can be enforced only at the expense of another right or principle. These features did not cause any problems while people had to fight with them as ideal requirements, setting human rights against actual conditions, for the transformation of prevalent conditions. Judicial decisions based on them as constitutional rights and freedoms used for being applied in cases, however, often lead to legal uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|National and {{international}} judicial systems are today in constant interaction. This interaction has been mainly studied by legal scholars, who termed it “transjudicial communication”. This communication {{manifests itself in}} case law and may also be of interest for linguists. The focus in this chapter is {{on one of the}} possible linguistic manifestations of transjudicial communication in the judgments delivered by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). They consist in “external cross-references”, i. e. references that point to sources of legislative or judicial law other than the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) and its Protocols or the ECtHR case law. The chapter presents a feasibility study conducted on a small corpus of three English judgments delivered by the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR. The aim of the study is first to develop a language-specific methodology for the semi-automatic extraction of cross-references and then to conduct a qualitative analysis of the extracted cross-references that fall within the category of “external cross-references”. These cross-references are analysed to identify both the type of sources they point to and the function they perform. As regards the sources, they are both <b>judicial</b> (<b>case</b> <b>law)</b> and normative (legislation); therefore, an alternative term to refer to the communication that emerges is proposed, namely “transnational legal communication”. The three functions cross-references are seen to perform are: (i) description of the factual background and the legal history of the case, (ii) recall of relevant domestic law or other legal provisions, and (iii) provision of a backbone for the legal reasoning and argumentation of the ruling...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} factors {{of law that}} {{have contributed to the}} {{development}} of law and which are regarded as the sources of law. Legal customs, Divine right, Natural and legal rights, human rights, civil rights, and common law are often implied and unwritten sources of law that have been established over decades or centuries. Canon law and other forms of religious law form the basis for law derived from religious practices and doctrines or from sacred texts; this source of law is important where there is a state religion. Historical or <b>judicial</b> precedent and <b>case</b> <b>law</b> can modify or even create a source of law.

40|$|The {{litigation}} proceeding in anti-discrimination disputes is {{a relatively}} new kind of special civil proceedings whose rules are prescribed in three separate legislative acts. The scarce <b>case</b> <b>law</b> in this area shows that the discriminated persons and other entities authorized to initiate anti-discrimination lawsuits are insufficiently informed about the content of these proceedings and/or insufficiently motivated to initiate such proceedings; on the other hand, the small number of cases points that courts are still reluctant and insufficiently prepared to tackle diverse discrimination issues, which would certainly be a strong and much needed impetus for providing relevant judicial protection against discrimination in civil law. This problem is particularly prominent in anti-discrimination disputes which involve claims for damages. In this paper, the author analyzes the course of an anti-discrimination lawsuit (initiated on the grounds of disability) and the respective decisions rendered by the first instance court, the second instance court and the Supreme Court of Serbia. The analysis yields a conclusion that courts are rather reluctant, apprehensive and even defiant when it comes to awarding non-pecuniary damages. They seem to disregard the fact that the primary purpose of this type of legal protection against discrimination is to provide just satisfaction to the injured party. In that context, it appears to be necessary to institute relevant judicial training in the field of anti-discrimination law, which would include not only the judges in large regional judicial centers but also those in smaller towns and in local judicial units. It would certainly contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the substance of anti-discrimination law, which could be further promoted by a periodic publication of judgments in this area. Ultimately, it would contribute to the popularization of anti-discrimination law and the consolidation of <b>judicial</b> practice (<b>case</b> <b>law)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{programs}} (more generally, software) {{have become}} {{an essential part of}} the contemporary (social, economic, juridical etc.) life. Nevertheless, an agreement regarding the extent of their protection has yet to be reached. Thanks to some international conventions, and in particular to the “TRIPs Agreement” (Art. 10), a certain kind of uniform protection was granted to software through copyright legislation. At the European level, such harmonization had also been anticipated by the so called “first software directive” (Directive 91 / 250 /EEC, subsequently amended by Directive 93 / 98 /EEC). After a long international debate, inventions regarding programs per computer and business methods (often reciprocally linked) are not considered inventions and/or are deemed not patentable by the great majority of national legislations and in particular by one of the most important international IP treaties: the “European Patent Convention (EPC) ”. The “TRIPs Agreement” is silent on the matter. However, it was argued from the very start that copyright protection was insufficient and/or inadequate for computer programs. Some scholars proposed that software had not only to be copyrightable but also patentable, while some others submitted that the best solution was to create an “ad hoc” intellectual property right for software-related products. While the theoretical debate was continuing, and still goes on, computer programs and the computer industry greatly evolved. As a consequence, administrative and <b>judicial</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> gradually began to adapt to the new market’s needs: software patents were granted and deemed to be valid. At the end of the Twentieth century, patenting software became common practice and the official guidelines of the most important Patent Offices began to be drawn accordingly. It is evident that software protection, far from having been confined to copyright (trade secret and trademark) law, increased year after year, while the legislative provisions and the international treaties remained unchanged. The aim of this dissertation is to establish the extent of software patentability in Europe and in the United States, with a brief reference, where necessary, to other legal systems. The dissertation also suggests that a harmonization at the international level with regard to software programs patent protection would be helpful in increasing legal certainty...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Judicial</b> {{precedent}} (aka: <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> or judge-made law) {{is based}} on the doctrine of stare decisis, and mostly associated with jurisdictions based on the English common law, but the concept has been adopted in part by Civil Law systems. Precedent is the accumulated principles of law derived from centuries of decisions. Judgements passed by judges in important cases are recorded and become significant source of law. When there is no legislature on a particular point which arises in changing conditions, the judges depend on their own {{sense of right and wrong}} and decide the disputes from first principles. Authoritative precedent decisions become a guide in subsequent cases of a similar nature. The dictionary of English law defines a judicial precedent as a judgement or decision of a court of law cited as an authority for deciding a similar state of fact in the same manner or on the same principle or by analogy. Another definition [...] declares precedent to be," [...] a decision in a court of justice cited in support of a proposition for which it is desired to contend".|$|R

Another aim of the diploma thesis is to highlight that the model of average consumer needs to be viewed differently depending on in which area of economic competition it is currently located at.

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} explores the {{relationship}} between the medical indications for surgery and the patient's right to self-determination, i. e. the right of a competent adult to make an informed decision about his/her medical treatment. In that context, the author points out to three practical questions. First, does the patient's right to self-determination imply the patient's participation in determining the medical indications for medical treatment, or is it only limited to the patient's authority to consent or not consent to the doctor's proposal? Second, can the patient's consent or insistence justify a surgery which is not medically indicated? Third, does the patient's right to self-determination imply that the patient assumes the risk associated with a surgery which is not medically indicated, thus excluding the doctor's professional responsibility (liability) ? Relying on the legal theory, legislative framework and <b>judicial</b> practice (<b>case</b> <b>law),</b> the author concludes that a surgery which is not medically indicated should be qualified as a wrongful act. The unlawful nature of this act cannot be excluded even by the patient's persistent demands to perform the surgery. The patient's right to self-determination implies only the possibility of accepting or refusing the medical treatment proposed by the doctor. The decision on the medical indication of a surgical procedure must be fully vested with the doctor, who is bound by the rules of medical science and medical ethics. In other words, a doctor should act in compliance with what he/she considers to be proper. Otherwise, the doctor may be held liable for medical malpractice. In principle, the doctor's liability for performing a surgery which is not medically indicated cannot be precluded by contracting a relevant doctor-patient agreement. The exception to this rule should be allowed only in cases when the patient is a medical expert who strongly believes that the medical intervention is medically indicated, in spite of the doctor's divergent opinion...|$|R
