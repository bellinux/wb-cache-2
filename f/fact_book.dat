25|$|A radical {{shift from}} past IHO {{practices}} (1928–1953) was also {{seen in the}} 2002 draft edition when the IHO delineated 'seas' as being subdivisions that lay {{within the boundaries of}} 'oceans'. While the IHO are often considered the authority for such conventions, the shift brought them into line with the practices of other publications (e.g. the CIA World <b>Fact</b> <b>Book)</b> which already adopted the principle that seas are contained within oceans. This difference in practice is markedly seen for the Pacific Ocean in the adjacent figure. Thus, for example, previously the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand was not regarded by the IHO as being part of the Pacific, but as of the 2002 draft edition it is.|$|E
