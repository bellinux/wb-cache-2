40|$|The use of {{synthetic}} food attractant lures for Tephritid fruit fly trapping is presently being incorporated into U. S. {{state and federal}} detection programs. These lures consist of ammonium acetate, trimethylamine hydrochloride and putrescine contained in individual packages that {{are attached to the}} inside (top) of plastic McPhail-type traps. Two chemical packets are placed in the traps for Anastrepha spp., where as three are attached for Ceratitis capitata. This report presents data on trap captures of the above species comparing the current (individually packaged) baits with a novel dispenser containing either two or three components into a single matrix. Tests were conducted in Florida and Hawaii using hand release of sterile Caribbean fruit fly (Caribfly), Anastrepha suspensa and the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (medfly) / aerially released medfly/ and wild caribfly populations (Florida) and wild medfly (Hawaii). Observations in the Florida study indicated that minor <b>formulation</b> <b>adjustment</b> should increase the efficacy of the Anastrepha attractant, whereas less of an adjustment may be required to capture Ceratitis capitata. Results in open field tests in Hawaii indicated that the three-component synthetic food attractant in a single cone unit was just as effective in capturing wild male and female Medflies as the same food attractants in individual packets. The single matrix has some advantages in handling and ease-of-use, especially with the Multilure trap...|$|E
40|$|Transformers {{are used}} to {{transfer}} power between different voltage levels or to regulate real or reactive flow through a particular transmission corridor. Most transformers come equipped with taps on the windings to adjust either the voltage transformation or the reactive flow through the transformer. Such transformers are called either load-tap-changing (LTC) transformers or on load tap-changing (OLTC) transformers. Another type of transformer {{is known as a}} phase-shifting transformer (or phase shifter). Phase-shifting transformers, which are less common than LTC transformers, vary the angle of the phase shift across the transformer in order to control the MW power flow through the transformer. This type of control can be very useful in controlling the flow of real power through a transmission system. The emphasis of this document is the modelling of different types of transformers in AC load flow. The first section is a short introduction in different types of transformer considered in such AC load flow, afterwards a comprehensive branch model and the expressions for line flows trough transformer are given. The summary of the previous work based on several references was given in the section Review of the Previous work. The succeeding sections contain the basic ideas, <b>formulations,</b> <b>adjustment</b> interactions and algorithm for tap adjustments based on AC sensitivity analysis. Small examples are given in the last two sections for the sake of practicality...|$|R

Mean Cmax, tmax, AUC(0, 24 h), AUC and tlag were significantly greater in fed compared with fasting subjects. Overall relative bioavailability of the two formulations (log AUC), was within the acceptable 80 – 125 % limits for bioequivalence both fed and fasting.

No statistically significant difference between OSR and MST was found for other parameters nor in the incidence of adverse events.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial {{was to determine if}} varying the nutritional composition of meat and bone meal (MBM) would impact broiler performance and yield compared to diets which provide a consistent quality of MBM. Twelve hundred day-old male broilers from the Cobb 500 female line were randomly allocated to 48 pens (25 chicks/pen; 22 square feet) and grown to 49 days of age. Starter, grower, and withdrawal diets were formulated to contain MBM at 10, 7. 5 and 5 % respectively using the Cobb nutritional standards. Four treatments provided were: 1) H. J. Baker proprietary blend, ProPlus 57 fed continuously; 2) MBM 50 formulated diet fed continuously; 3) MBM 50 specs used for formulation but starting day 14, the MBM was rotated between MBM 45, 50 and 55 with no <b>formulation</b> <b>adjustments</b> to compensate for any nutritional differences: 4) MBM 50 specs used in formulation but replaced with MBM 45 in the actual diet. Each pen was provided feed and water ad libitum throughout the grow-out period. Birds were weighed on days 0, 14, 28, and 49 and feed consumption data was also collected for each period. Birds were processed on day 50 and live weight, pre-chill, post chill, pectoralis major and minor, wings, leg quarters, and skeletal weights were collected from individual birds. Data was analyzed using PROC GLM with dietary treatment serving as the main effect in SAS. Treatment 3 and 4 weights were lower (P=. 0142) at day 49. There were no significant differences at days 0, 14, or 28. There was a significant difference in feed conversion at day 14 (P=. 0397) with treatment 4 being significantly worse than treatment 2 and 3. Also at day 28 (P= 0. 0003), with treatment 4 being significantly higher than all other treatments. Processing results showed no significant differences in yield except for the skeletal with treatment 1 being the heaviest (P=. 0352). These results suggest that while marginal variation in MBM does not influence early performance, as birds reached heavier weights, the MBM variability impacted performance. Processing results and live production results were then used to produce gross margin which treatment 1 was $ 0. 11 to $ 0. 14 per bird greater than any other treatment...|$|R

This paper reports on the results of a two-year English language teacher professional development programme following a Needs Analysis study conducted by Cambridge ESOL in 2012. Longitudinal research shows that in Russia English language teaching has several problems which exist throughout decades. This article focuses on some of them: class interaction mode; the use of native (Russian) language in class; error correction strategies employed by teachers. A new approach to evaluation was employed by asking students and teachers the same questions from different perspectives on areas identified during the needs analysis study. The results varied in significance, though some positive changes have been noticed in class interaction mode, little has changed in the error correction strategies, the use of Russian in the classroom seems to be quite reasonable and does not interfere with learning. Overall, the study may be useful for general audience, especially for the post-Soviet countries as it provides evidence of change management and their impact on ELT.

40|$|We derive a {{non-standard}} unit root {{serial correlation}} <b>formulation</b> for intertemporal <b>adjustments</b> {{in the labor}} force participation rate. This leads to a tractable three-error component model, which in contrast to other models embeds heterogeneity into the error structure. Unlike in the typical iid three-error component two-tier stochastic frontier model, our equation's error components are independent but not identically distributed. This leads to a complex nonlinear likelihood function requiring identification through a two-step estimation procedure, which we estimate using Current Population Survey (CPS) data. By transforming the basic equation linking labor force participation to the working age population, this paper devises a new method which can be used to identify labor market joiners and leavers. The method's advantage is its parsimonious data requirements, especially alleviating the need for survey based longitudinal data...|$|R

Given an initial approximate 3 D model, a popular refinement process is to perform a bundle adjustment of the estimated camera position, camera orientation, and scene points. Unfortunately, simultaneously solving for both camera position and camera orientation is an ill-conditioned problem. To address this issue, we propose an improved, cameraorientation independent cost function {{that can be used}} instead of the standard bundle adjustment cost function. This yields a new bundle <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulation</b> which exhibits noticeably better numerical behavior, but at the expense of an increased computational cost. We alleviate the additional cost by automatically partitioning the dataset into smaller subsets. Minimizing our cost function for these subsets still achieves significant error reduction over standard bundle adjustment.

40|$|Structure from motion (SFM) is {{the problem}} of reconstructing the {{geometry}} of a scene from a stream of images. In this problem, the geometry of the scene must be inferred from images, along with the camera pose parameters. Bundle Adjustment (BA) is a refinement method used to improve SFM solutions. It consists in simultaneously improving a set of initial estimates for all parameters (structure and camera pose) by minimizing a global cost function. It is generally considered to be highly accurate, and so is typically used as a last refinement step in most current SFM methods. Unfortunately, estimating the pose of the camera from a stream of images is an ill-conditioned problem.

In this paper, we point out that these incorrect matches, in fact, provide strong cues to the existence of symmetries and structural regularities in the unknown 3 D structure.

A set of structural constraints derived from the symmetries are imposed within a new constrained bundle <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulation,</b> where symmetry priors are also incorporated. Second, we show that the recovered symmetries enable us to choose a natural coordinate system for the 3 D structure where gauge freedom in rotation is held fixed. Furthermore, based on the symmetries, 3 D structure completion is also performed. Our approach significantly reduces drift through ”structural ” loop closures and improves the accuracy of reconstructions in urban scenes. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{last ten}} years have {{witnessed}} important advances in image stitching algorithms. Such advances have allowed the development of several commercial tools {{that are based on}} or incorporate image stitching. Amongst these tools there are well known image editing suites like Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft’s Image Composite Editor {{which is part of the}} web-based photo organization tool Photosynth, “dedicated” stitching software like Autostitch and its commercial counterparts AutoPano and AutoPano Giga, the image stitching functionality of the iOS from Apple, as well as the built-in stitching functionality of several off-the-shelf digital cameras. The widespread availability of stitching tools often leads to the impression that image stitching is a solved problem. The reality is: many of these tools often fail to produce convincing results when given non ideal data, i. e., images that deviate from fairly restrictive assumptions of image stitching; the main two being that the photos correspond to views that differ purely by rotation, or that the imaged scene is effectively planar. Such assumptions underpin the usage of 2 D projective transforms or homographies to align the photos. In the hands of the casual user, these conditions are often violated, yielding misalignment artifacts or “ghosting” in the results. Accordingly, many existing image stitching tools depend critically on post-processing routines to conceal ghosting. This thesis proposes a novel estimation technique called Moving Direct Linear Transformation (Moving DLT) that is able to “tweak” or fine-tune the projective warp to accommodate the deviations of the input data from the idealised conditions. This produces “as-projective-as-possible” image alignments that significantly reduce ghosting without compromising the geometric realism of perspective image stitching. The Moving DLT technique lessens the dependency on potentially expensive post-processing algorithms. In addition, this thesis also describes how Moving DLT can be performed in a “bundled” manner to simultaneously align multiple images in order to generate “long” panoramas while reducing the error propagation of the incremental stitching techniques. It is important to note that such a bundle <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulation,</b> which we call Bundled Moving DLT, is the first of its kind. There is no other bundle <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulation</b> that is able to simultaneously refine multiple non-rigid warps for image stitching. The experimental results show that Moving DLT (and Bundled Moving DLT) can produce much better results than current state-of-the-art image stitching software and other recent methods for image stitching.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this article was on {{theoretical}} proposition of Bank Portfolio Structure and Economic Absorption Theory of economic development. Specifically, the work sought to establish the basis of bank portfolio rigidity and to identify the causes of economic absorption problems and their implications on economic development. The theoretical and conceptual research designs were used. Existing literatures were reviewed using archival retrieval approach, library search and internet exploration. The information obtained was judgmentally, logically and qualitatively analyzed. It was discovered among others, that, bank portfolio rigidity stems from regulatory policy defects using inconsistent monetary policy tools such as high liquidity ratio and cash ratio, etc. and compelling the banks to adhere to the regulatory requirement, as well as lack of adequate and quality stock of infrastructure and technology as the basic causes of economic absorption problems. Above all, low level of economic absorption has been discovered to hinder effective contributions of banks to economic development. Following from above, it was therefore recommended that regulatory tools used by Central Banks should be aligned with the development needs of the economy and the direction of governments. The monetary policy tools such as liquidity and cash ratios should also be moderated and stabilized for stable bank portfolio performance as well as aggressive improvement in the stock and quality of infrastructure and technology within an economy. With the new theory, it is expected that policy <b>formulations</b> and <b>adjustments</b> concerning bank portfolio structure and management would be designed with adequate flexibility and focus on long term loans and investments coupled with improved stock and quality of infrastructure to enhance economic development.

In this {{paper we discuss a}} subpart of the total corpus (15 video recorded conversations out of 74), thereby zooming in on the institutional encounters where two service providers – non-Turkish nurses {{on the one hand and}} Dutch-Turkish bilingual family support workers on the other – collaborate in order to enhance service quality provided to Turkish-speaking mothers. The first part of the paper addresses the implications of the organization’s multilingual strategies, some of which are no longer suited to face the challenges posed by a growing superdiverse society. Analyzing institutional documents and interview content with key figures, we set out the institutional background of the family support workers and, most importantly, the current challenges they are facing due to changing contextual needs. In the second part of the paper we examine how the presence of a family support worker affects the spoken interaction. More precisely, we compare the intervention of family support workers and professional interpreters, in particular with regard to the five basic principles inscribed in the code of ethics for social interpreters active in Flanders. In order to achieve that, the 15 mediated interactions were analyzed from a micro-analytic perspective, concentrating thereby on the following analytical criteria: turn-taking (self-selection or allocated turns), length of verbal content (shorter or longer <b>formulations),</b> register <b>adjustments,</b> non-verbal interaction (eye-gaze, body position, facial gestures).

40|$|It appears {{difficult}} to explain the spatial organization of a major urban centre without referring to its transportation system just as travel demand analysis and transport planning cannot be dissociated from the understanding of urban structure. Moreover, in economics, transportation {{is seen as a}} demand resulting from economic activities while in geography, human interactions are considered as an organizing factor rather than a product of such activities. Consequently we are interested by a modelling framework which can conciliate both realities often analysed separately. Several fundamental hindrances are therefore encountered. Transportation system analysis must initially be integrated within its own components of demand and supply. As for the urban structure, we must seek a representation suited to apprehend the spatial distribution and the evolution of several interdependent activities. Unification also requires definitions of common or at least consistent principles, standardized <b>formulations</b> and an <b>adjustment</b> of temporal scales. This attempt of integration does not imply starting over but rather using all theoretical frameworks, approaches and models concerned by urban structure and transportation.

All chimeras grew to high titers [∼ 7 to 8 log 10, plaque-forming units (PFU) /ml] in Vero cells and were less neurovirulent than YF 17 D vaccine in mice. For monkey experiments, the dose of DEN 2 chimera was lowered to 3 log 10 PFU in the tetravalent mixture in an effort to reduce its dominant immunogenicity. The magnitude of viremia in ChimeriVax–DEN immunized monkeys was similar to that of YF-VAX, but significantly lower than those induced by wild-type DEN viruses. All monkeys developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against homologous (chimeras) or heterologous (wild-type DEN viruses isolated from different geographical regions) viruses after a single dose of monovalent or tetravalent vaccine. Administration of a second dose of tetravalent vaccine 2 months later increased titers to both homologous and heterologous viruses. A dose adjustment for dengue 2 chimera resulted in a more balanced response against dengue 1, 2, and 3 viruses, but a somewhat higher response against chimeric dengue 4 virus.

It could be concluded that the basic price of milk proposed based on the research was around IDR 4, 250 -IDR 4, 350 /L for 3 to 4 cows ownership. Increasing farmer income was expected to be obtained by entering the value of this risk in the calculation of production costs.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The plant Bridelia ferruginea Benth (Euphorbiaceae) {{has been}} known for its use in the {{management}} of oral thrush ethnomedicinally in various parts of Africa, a practice which has been justified by results of certain scientific studies. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an appropriate dosage formulation, a mouthwash and evaluate the antifungal potential of this dosage formulation against a major causative organism of oral thrush, Candida albicans. Extraction of the stem bark was carried out with boiled distilled water, the extract was formulated into mouthwashes at concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 %w/v. All formulations contained viscosity imparting agent, a sweetener and a preservative. Physical characterisation, viscosity, pH and palatability of the mouthwash formulations were determined. Agar-well diffusion method was used to assess antifungal activity of the formulations against Candida albicans and Nystatin oral suspension was used as reference compound. The results showed that Bridelia ferruginea stem bark extract mouthwash solutions were brown in colour, had agreeable odour and sweet astringent taste. The pH for all concentrations was in the range 5. 41 - 5. 63. The viscosity at spindle no 2, 60 rpm range between 0. 226 - 0. 238 Pa. S for all concentrations studied. The formulations had antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The highest concentration (2. 5 %w/v) gave mean zone of inhibition of 25. 50 ± 0. 71 mm that was comparable with Nystatin oral suspension 28. 00 ± 1. 41 mm, a reference compound. The foregoing suggests that with little modification in the <b>formulation</b> especially the <b>adjustment</b> of the pH, Bridellia ferruginea mouthwash solutions may be developed into commercially useful preparations...|$|R
40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{decline in}} the presence of farmland birds during recent decades has provoked much attention in agri-environmental policy and ecological research. However, the still limited understanding of the socio-economical mechanisms that govern the decline in bird presence hampers the <b>formulation</b> of effective <b>adjustments</b> in land-use and farming practices that could support the return of birds to farmland, i. e. the required fine-tuning of management practices. As a consequence, the existing agri-environmental schemes that offer financial compensation to farmers for implementing generally simple and rather crude measures to stimulate the presence of birds have been limited in their effectiveness and subject to much debate. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a sociological appraisal of farmers¿ experiences with meadow bird protection in a mainly dairy farming area in the Netherlands. The methodology combined visual map analysis, surveys, interviews with farmers and experts, and monitoring farmers¿ discussions. The results allowed an assessment of (i) farmers¿ views on historical changes in bird numbers in the area and the current distribution of bird nests, (ii) locally adjusted, fine-tuned management practices that were considered to be promising for protecting bird nests, (iii) the importance of farm management with `an eye for birds¿, i. e. farmers and/or birdwatchers paying additional attention to the presence of nests and chicks before carrying out farming activities, and (iv) the views of key experts in the socio-institutional network in the case study area. The paper concludes that there are various promising options for fine-tuning farm management so it offers better bird protection, but it is expected that such measures will predominantly be adopted on less intensively managed farms...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of Low Cost Carriers (LCC) and their {{simplified}} fare structures has created "semi-restricted" fare structures where lower classes are undifferentiated except for price, while higher fare classes are still differentiated by various advance purchase and booking restrictions. The problem this causes is two-fold: first, traditional revenue management systems, which operate {{based on the assumption}} of demand independence, will see demand "spiral down" into the lowest booking classes as passengers will buy the lowest available fare in the absence of fare restrictions. Second, airlines must maximize network revenues across two different fare structures, a more-restricted structure used on markets without an LCC presence, and the semirestricted structure for markets where LCC competition exists. This thesis describes methods of dealing with these two problems: Hybrid Forecasting (HF), which forecasts "product-oriented" demand using traditional forecasting methods while simultaneously forecasting "price-oriented" demand for those passengers who will buy the lowest available fare, and Fare Adjustment (FA), which is used at the booking limit optimizer level to account for the sell-up potential of passengers (probability a passenger will book in a higher class if his original booking class is denied). Fare Adjustment allows the airline to deal with multiple fare structures separately. The goal of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive summary of results when an airline uses HF and FA simultaneously in two different multiple fare structure, competitive networks. An alternate Fare <b>Adjustment</b> <b>formulation</b> will also be introduced and tested in these competitive environments. (cont.) Results from the Passenger Origin-Destination Simulator (PODS) demonstrate that in a more restrictive network, HF and FA used in conjunction with one another achieve revenue increases of approximately 2 - 4 % above traditional forecasting methods. In an environment with a fully unrestricted fare structure for LCC markets, HF and FA together generate revenue gains of over 20 % above traditional methods. by Matthew R. Kayser. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Baroclinic eddies are an {{important}} component of the General Circulation which regulate the extratropical climate by transporting heat and momentum. An idealization of this feedback is provided by baroclinic adjustment theories (Stone, 1978), which envision a linearly neutralized mean state. Based on the Charney-Stern condition, most baroclinic <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulations</b> propose basic states with homogenized potential vorticity. In this thesis we investigate the degree of potential vorticity homogenization in the extratropical troposphere. We show that homogenization is only observed across a shallow region around 700 mb, and propose an adjusted state with homogenized PV at the steering level alone. We demonstrate that this state can be neutral under certain conditions, and investigate its relevance for the equilibration of an idealized model. Because of the role of the PV flux as an eddy forcing of momentum, it is illuminating to describe the equilibration in terms of the redistribution of momentum. This affects both the PV gradient and the steering level of the waves, but the condition of homogenization at the steering level is very robust. In the 2 D problem, a local balance can be written between the dynamical and frictional forcing of momentum. However, in the 3 D problem there is an additional redistribution by a remotely forced meridional circulation. To circumvent this difficulty, we have developed a momentum-based formulation that exploits the interchangeability of momentum and temperature for quasi-balanced stratified rotating flow. By rewritting the thermodynamic equation as a momentum equation, we eliminate the forcing by the mean meridional circulation and formulate a local balance between the eddy PV flux and the non-conservative forcing of momentum. (cont.) This introduces a new variable, which we call potential momentum. The circulation can then be described in terms of the conversion between potential and physical momentum. A major simplification of this formulation is that temperature and momentum can be directly compared. For instance, the surface temperature gradient appears as a momentum source, which helps ellucidate the role of the momentum fluxes and the so-called "barotropic governor" (James, 1987) for the baroclinic equilibration. Our results suggest that mechanical friction might prevent thermal homogenization at the surface. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Rip {{currents}} are seaward directed {{flows of}} water that traverse the surf zone, {{and in many cases}} pose potentially dangerous conditions for swimmers and beach users. The present study is carried out focusing on Perranporth beach, UK, which is known to present quite strong rip current events that have been the culprits of large numbers of incidents or rescues (in some cases more than 65 in a single day) in the past (Scott et al., 2009). The main objective of this work is related to the forecasting of rip currents, particularly in helping to develop, calibrate, and validate an operational swimmer safety model for Perranporth beach, UK. This main objective is divided into several specific objectives, which look into answering both general scientific questions and specific details for the implementation of the model at the study site. The tool used for the estimation of bathymetries is the data-model assimilation scheme Beach Wizard, which uses video-derived information to adjust an initial bathymetry into an updated bathymetry. The Beach Wizard model is run with the numerical model XBeach, assimilating the hydrodynamic model output with video-derived measures of wave dissipation (imaps). Specific model formulations and parameters of Beach Wizard are varied and tested as {{to determine the effects of}} each, as well as to obtain the best working model for Perranporth, UK. Two systematic estimation errors that were originally pointed out by van Dongeren et al. (2008) are looked into, resulting in the implementation of a variation in the bed updating process, by introducing a time-dependent bed change factor. The changes applied to the model <b>formulations</b> and the <b>adjustments</b> of default parameters resulted in accurate estimations of bathymetries over a three month period (April-June 2011) during which video derived input and five measured bathymetries are available at Perranporth. The importance of video derived input (timex images) is analyzed in detail, by defining several criteria concerning the quality, quantity, and temporal regularity of images used as input. The quality criteria is divided into two separate indicators, in this manner differentiating between actual image quality (if the camera lens is clean or dirty, or if there is foggy conditions, etc.) and dissipation map (imap) quality (if the dissipation patterns are good or not). With this, it was found that imap quality stands over image quality, meaning that it is more important to have favorable wave breaking conditions than perfect image resolution. As well as this, image regularity was found to be important in maintaining the models predictive ability, due to large temporal gaps between consecutive images increasing the bed uncertainty significantly (resulting in very large, and possibly erroneous bed changes if the corresponding imap is not perfect). The final criteria looked at was image quantity, which turned out not to be of great importance as long as the image regularity is maintained; presenting even improved results for a case using a smaller total amount of input with the same temporal spacing. The estimated bathymetries computed with Beach Wizard were used to model nearshore flows in a non-stationary hydrodynamic XBeach model. It was found that very promising similarities are seen between said currents and the currents modeled over measured bathymetries. The use of estimated bathymetries show clear improvements over using an outdated measured bathymetry for the prediction of rip currents, essentially validating the use of the Beach Wizard tool in the eventual implementation of an operational rip current forecasting system at Perranporth beach.

40|$|Reactive {{supercritical}} fluid extrusion (RSCFX) {{is a novel}} integrated process for controlled chemical reactions and continuous generation of expanded extrudates of modified functionalities. Twin screw extruders are ideally suited for highly viscous materials due to their excellent mixing abilities which help maximize reaction rates. Beyond their superior nutritional qualities, whey proteins are also utilized for thickening, stabilization and emulsification of food <b>formulations</b> following pH <b>adjustment</b> and heat treatment to induce protein denaturation and aggregation. Creating cold-gelling and thickening functionalities in whey protein for use in food system where heating is undesirable remains a challenge. Also, replacing starch-based thickeners with a whey protein ingredient may be attractive to diet -conscious consumers. The aim of this work was to alter and quantify the functional properties of whey proteins by RSCFX proc essing to create novel dairy ingredients for food applications. Texturized whey protein concentrate (TWPC) at acidic condition (pH 3. 0) were made by RSCFX and the effect s of addition of starch, calcium (0. 3 and 0. 6 %, w/w), and extrusion temperature (50, 70 and 90 °C) on selected physicochemical properties of the modified protein were evaluated. TWPC exhibited 200 - to 300 -fold higher viscosities than non-texturized WPC at various concentrations (6 - 26 %, w/w TWPC) and formed cold-set gels at 20 % (w/w) upon reconstitution in water. Starch-containing samples (TWPC-S) were less soluble, consisted of larger protein aggregates (1. 527 [mu]m), but had 1. 2 - 1. 4 -fold higher apparent viscosity than TWPC alone because of synergistic interactions between the two biopolymers. TWPC without the starch and at lower calcium level (0. 3 %) ha d smaller protein aggregates (0. 996 [mu]m) with higher solubility. TWPC alone extruded at 50 °C (TWPC- 50) and 70 °C (TWPC- 70) formed soft-textured aggregates with high solubility in water (77 - 79 %) than that extruded at 90 °C (TWPC - 90) with a solubility of 24 %. Total free sulfhydryl contents and solubility studies in selected buffers indicated that non-covalent interactions were prevalent in stabilizing the TWPC aggregates. TWPC extruded at 90 °C showed an increase in aromatic hydrophobicity {{and a decrease in}} aliphatic hydrophobicity indicating changes in protein structures. Secondary gelation occurred in TWPC - 50 and TWPC- 70 when the cold-set gels were heated to 95 °C, while TWPC- 90 showed excellent thermal stability. Factors such as the degree of protein denaturation, exposure of hydrophobic groups, and cross -linking influenced the intermolecular associations and improved the cold-set and second-stage heat-induced gelation of TWPCs. Compared to non-texturized WPC, TWPC formed stable oil-in-water emulsions at lower protein concentrations. However, the presence of starch in TWPC impeded emulsifying properties. TWPCs were able to form cold-set emulsion gels containing 40 to 80 % (w/w) that were stabilized by 4 to 12 % (w/w) protein and had smaller mean droplet sizes as opposed to the non-texturized WPC. TWPC- 90 emulsions showed excellent stability during storage (30 days at 4 and 25 °C) and heating (70 - 90 °C for 20 min) due to the extensively denatured proteins. Heat treatment [GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 80 °C of non-texturized WPC and TWPC- 70 emulsions increased the droplet sizes and loss moduli (G'), indicating emulsion destabilization due to aggregation of native proteins. TWPC emulsions had higher adsorbed proteins (6. 0 - 23. 3 mg/mL) in contrast to the nontexturized WPC emulsions (2. 17 - 6. 33 mg/mL). SDS-PAGE of the adsorbed TWPC showed greater intensity of [alpha]-la ([alpha]-lactalbumin) and the presence of high molecular -weight protein aggregates. The adsorbed proteins of TWPC - 70 emulsions underwent time-dependent polymerization, but they remained stable in TWPC- 90 -based emulsions. The superiority of TWPC stabilized emulsions may be due to combinations of a stable protein gel matrix that formed the continuous phase of emulsion, greater surface hydrophobicity, and intra-film protein polymerization that conf erred strength to the protein interfacial layer. TWPC- 90 that contains a higher degree of denatured protein offers the best potential to serve as a novel, whey protein-based food emulsifier and stabilizer. The RSCFX process provides a new approach by which functional characteristics of TWPC ingredient may be advantageously designed by altering the formulation composition and extrusion operating parameters. These new ingredients may be utilized in different products requiring targeted physicochemical functionalities and a cleaner, all-dairy label. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
