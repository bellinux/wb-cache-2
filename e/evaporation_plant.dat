40|$|The {{growing concern}} for {{global climate change}} has put {{pressure}} on industry to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by reducing energy use. At a pulp mill the single largest energy consumer is the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant.</b> If there is unwanted accumulation of unwanted substances on the heat transfer surfaces, referred to as fouling, the efficiency decreases. This master’s thesis aims to investigating possible reasons for problems with black liquor fouling in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> at Södra Cell Värö. An <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> consists of several evaporation stages called effects and the effects studied in this thesis are effect 1 B and effect 2. The method used consists of studying the flow rate and composition of the black liquor {{in and out of}} effect 2 and 1 B in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant.</b> A study was also made to look at process parameters in the process control system relevant to fouling to find correlation with the fouling problems. The most apparent findings are that the fouling in effect 1 B is rapid and can be explained by salt precipitation of a mixture of burkeite and dicarbonate. As this precipitation takes place, the soap content in the black liquor has often been high. In effect 2 the fouling is not as rapid as in effect 1 B. In effect 2 the wetting degree is low and this could be an explanation for the fouling taking place in the effect. The calcium content of the black liquor is also high but {{does not seem to be}} the major contributor to the fouling problems. The results from the process parameter analysis show no clear correlation to the fouling problems...|$|E
50|$|Improvements in {{the design}} of the forced/natural {{circulation}} evaporators have had significant implications for industrial products and processes.

Further evidence can be extracted from the case study regarding the North Italy landfill, in which biogas in a single effect evaporator could not completely evaporate the leachate. As a result, a triple effect forced circulation evaporator was utilized.|$|R

40|$|Södra Cell Värö is a {{pulp mill}} that {{produces}} kraft pulp for sale. Kraft mills use {{large amounts of}} fuel energy and discharge a lot of hot wastewater. Improved heat exchanging {{where some of the}} heat content in the wastewater streams is used can decrease the fuel energy demand in the process. Another option for energy savings is to use the excess heat in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant,</b> which is a process that consumes a lot of energy. Recent studies show that excess heat can be used in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> to replace live steam, which leads to fuel savings or increased backpressure electricity production. A third option is to use the excess heat for production of district heating. The aim with this study was to explore the possibilities to make the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> and the entire mill more energy efficient. The possibilities to increase the production of district heating have also been explored. This was done by creating a computer model that simulates the evaporation at Södra Cell Värö and by performing a pinch analysis of the entire mill. The fuel supplied to a pulp mill is black liquor, bark and purchased fuel. An analysis of the fuel consumption at Södra Cell Värö shows that a decrease in steam consumption of more than 20 MW does not save any further fuel. This {{is due to the fact}} that the recovery boiler has to be in full operation to recover the chemicals. A 20 MW savings correspond to 11 MSEK/year. Suggestions how to improve the heat exchanger network using pinch analysis have been given and these together give total savings of about 3. 5 MW, which correspond to about 3 MSEK/year. This study shows that almost 22 MW of excess heat can be made available for process integrated evaporation. If the 22 MW is used in a process integrated <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> 26 MW will be saved, which exceeds the 20 MW that is the limit of fuel savings. The study shows that there is 46 MW of excess heat available for district heating if no excess heat is used in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant.</b> In the present situation the need for district heating is not of this magnitude. In conclusion measures in the heat exchanger network along with a combination of process integrated evaporation and increased district heating could be the most interesting solution from an economic point of view...|$|E

40|$|In the future, the {{technical}} and economic conditions for energy savings in the {{pulp and paper industry}} will change. More excess heat will be available in future mills above 80 °C than in existing mills, increasing the potential for process integration, and governmental actions for reducing CO 2 emissions and the deregulation of electricity markets will change the economic conditions for investments aimed at saving energy. Evaporation plants are some of the largest energy consumers in the pulp and paper industry, but also some of the most flexible unit operations. The objective of this thesis has therefore been to study the possibilities to save energy in future kraft pulp mills by integrating the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> {{with the rest of the}} process. The emphasis has been on quantifying the energy savings possible and understanding how they are influenced by different parameters on several system levels. Conventionally designed evaporation plants as well as evaporation plants that use excess heat and/or deliver low-pressure steam to the steam network have been simulated for different model mills. Using the simulation results, the energy efficiency and economics for the different designs have been compared at a wide range of conditions. The reductions in CO 2 emissions have also been calculated. The work presented in this thesis has been performed within a Swedish research program called the Eco-cyclic Pulp Mill. The simulation results show that the live steam demand in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> can be lowered by 22 - 93 % in the model mills evaluated if the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> is process integrated. They also show that the greatest reductions are achieved if the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> is designed to use both MP steam and excess heat. In general, the results from the economic parameter studies show that the process integrated evaporation designs also are interesting from an economic perspective. They are also favored by a low electricity price (unless condensing power is produced) and a high fuel price, since this increases the benefit of saving fuel. It is further concluded that all process integrated designs reduce CO 2 emissions; the size of the reduction, however, depends on how the saved fuel is used and how the marginal electricity production in society is generated...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} ways to design energy {{efficient}} evaporation plants in future {{pulp and paper}} mills are discussed.

If this heat is used for evaporation and/or if the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> is designed to use MP steam and deliver LP steam to the steam network, large amounts of steam can be saved. It is shown that these savings lead to reductions in CO 2 emissions; the largest reduction are achieved if assuming that oil can be saved or if biomass fuel is exported from the mill and used to replace oil elsewhere. It is also shown that the economic incentive for redesigning the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> depends on how the saved live steam is used and the economic conditions assumed. The largest savings are obtained if the live steam savings lead to decreased oil consumption.

40|$|The <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} steam {{consumers}} in kraft pulp mills, which are the dominant type of chemical pulp mill in Sweden. Previous studies have shown potential to decrease the live steam demand for the pulp process, e. g. by increasing the number of effects in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant,</b> or by heat integration of the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> with other parts of the process. This study is intended to provide a scientific basis for cost estimations for the design changes needed to accomplish the increased energy efficiency. An important part of the study was measurement of black liquor evaporation behaviour under controlled conditions in a one-effect research <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> built in cooperation with Metso Power AB. In the validation experiments with water as the evaporated fluid, the heat transfer coefficients obtained were mostly within ± 10 % of those calculated with the correlation for heat transfer in falling film evaporation from Schnabel and Schlünder (1980). From the experiments presented in this study, it is seen that the Nu number, for a specific Re number in the turbulent flow regime at each Pr number level, ceases to increase with increased Re number. Taking this observation into account, a new heat transfer correlation was developed, based on experimental data from the research evaporator. It was found that adding a dry solid content dependence to the new correlation improved the prediction for black liquor. Two comprehensive turbulence models for falling film hydrodynamics were studied, which provided increased qualitative understanding of the velocity, temperature and heat transfer profile in the evaporating black liquor falling film. The heat transfer coefficients calculated with the turbulence models were in agreement with the experimental heat transfer data for water. However, they did not agree with the experimental heat transfer coefficients for black liquor. Several possible reasons for the deviation were discussed. From studying the wave behaviour it was found that there were large local fluctuations in the film thickness. For the water falling film, existing correlations (Brötz’s and Brauer’s) were mostly within the 95 % confidence interval of the measured average film thickness. The black liquor film tends to be thicker than the film thickness calculated with the correlations, especially for higher Re numbers. Bubbles were observed in the evaporating falling film of black liquor. A combination of turbulent wave-breaking and effects due to surface-active compounds – surfactants – was found to be the most likely explanation for the bubble creation...|$|E

The sodium scales formed during evaporation are mainly in the form of double salts of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate. The ratio between the two salts is one important parameter affecting the crystallization and scaling.

In this work the possibilities to integrate the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> including strippers has been studied. The study is a part of a PhD-project at the Department of Heat and Power Technology at Chalmers University of Technology. The PhD-project is an investigation of the energy saving potential at Skoghall mill, Sweden.

An extra effect and an integrated stripper lower the energy demand of the plant by 13 % compared to a nonintegrated plant. The investment has also been shown to be profitable with the economic conditions set in this study. Purification of the CTMP-effluent by evaporating the effluent together with the black liquor is a profitable solution. The operating cost is approximately equal to when only black liquor is evaporated but the investment cost is slightly higher. Recovery of purified condensates is advisable due to unchanged operating cost...|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the production of}} pulp is of economic interest to many kraft pulp mills. However, significant increases in production generally require the recovery boiler to be debottlenecked: it must either be rebuilt or replaced. Both options require costly investments that can be avoided by extracting lignin from the black liquor before it is burnt in the boiler. This, in turn, requires changes being made in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant.</b> In the present study, simulations have been carried out based on a 25 % {{increase in}} the production of pulp. The evaporation plants are simulated with and without an integrated lignin separation plant to investigate the consequences of extracting lignin from black liquor. The results show that the evaporation plants with lignin extraction have investment costs that are 5 - 30 % higher than an equivalent plant without lignin extraction. Furthermore, the evaporation plants with lignin extraction require an evaporation capacity that is 7 % higher, since filtrates from the lignin separation plant are also evaporated here. This increases the steam demand by 9 - 12 % compared with a plant without lignin extraction.

40|$|In pulp mills, fouling {{can be a}} {{significant}} problem in the so-called black liquor <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant.</b> This is a multistage <b>evaporation</b> <b>plant</b> that actually works as a crystallizer because, as the black liquor becomes more concentrated, large amounts of sodium salts, particularly sodium carbonate and sodium sulphate, will saturate and precipitate from the solution.
