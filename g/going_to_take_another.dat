500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us to realize {{that we were going to}} make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes. What I said {{on impulse}} six months back I {{am about to}} carry out in cold blood. Nichola and I began in jest and ended in earnest. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> one <b>another</b> next month for good and all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Crewe coughed, {{and looked}} at his watch once, more. [...] "And now, having made that clear," [...] he said, [...] "and having only {{a quarter of an hour}} before I have to leave to keep an appointment, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up <b>another</b> subject. And I ask you to believe it is not done lightly, or without due consideration, but as the result of some years of thought." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} The World of Wallace and Gromit, {{original}} plans were that the film would be forty minutes long, including a sequence where Wallace and Gromit would discover a fast food restaurant on the Moon. Regarding the original plot, Park said:The original story was that Wallace and Gromit were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go to the Moon and there were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be a whole lot}} of characters there. One of them was a parking meter attendant, which {{was the only one that}} remained - the robot cooker character - but there were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be aliens, and all sorts. There was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a McDonald's on the Moon, and it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be like a spoof Star Wars. Wallace was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get thrown into prison and Gromit was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to get him out. By the time I came to Aardman, I had just started doing the Moon scene and somebody told me, [...] "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you <b>another</b> nine years if you do that scene!" [...] so I had to have a check with reality and cut that whole bit out. Somehow, I had to tie up the story on the Moon and finish the film.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, I know her,' said Maude. 'She {{asked me}} {{questions}} about all I did, {{and she did}} bother mamma so about a maid she recommended that we are never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> from her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on {{with more}} dirty work," [...] he told Grief. [...] "I'll {{overhaul}} the other chains {{if you say}} so. And you needn't worry about me any more. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> drop. I'm going to train up. You got my proud goat when you beat me, {{but let me tell}} you, you only got it temporarily. Train! I'm going to train till I'm as hard all the way through, and clean all the way through, as that chain is. And some day, Mister David Grief, somewhere, somehow, I'm going to be in such shape that I'll lick you as you licked me. I'm going to pulp your face till your own niggers won't know you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to go}} alone," [...] he said; [...] "I cannot go alone--I {{want you}} to go with me. Your uncle would surely consent; it is the only chance of saving your life. We all know that it is next to hopeless that a force {{sufficient}} to rescue us can be sent; there is just a chance, but that is all that can be said. We could be married at Allahabad. I would make for that town instead of Lucknow if you will go with me, and I could leave you there in safety till these troubles are over; I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> horse as well as my own, and two would be as likely to escape as one." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a quiet room in the elementary school attended by the children studied, following an authorization given by the School Principal. In accord with the classroom teacher, each child was invited <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in a graphic task that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place in <b>another</b> room. Once there, the child was asked whether he or she recognized the figure and then whether he or she could drawn it. The child was asked to reproduce the pattern as accurate and fast as possible in 25 trials. The criterion figure was presented at the top of each sheet serving as model to the children. The instructions stated that the king’s crown should present three tips and a rounded base. The experimenter asked the child to perform the task with his or her preferred hand and not the change hands during practice. The child had visual feedback about the spatial features of the patterns produced and also the time <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> perform it.|$|R
60|$|Well, if Fate insists in {{bringing}} New York to England for my special discomfiture, I suppose I {{have got to}} put up with it. I just let events take their course, and I have been drifting ever since. Two days ago I drifted here. Mr. Carmyle invited Fillmore--he seems to love Fillmore--and me to Monk's Crofton, and I hadn't even the shadow of an excuse for refusing. So I came, and I am now sitting writing to you in an enormous bedroom with an open fire and armchairs and every other sort of luxury. Fillmore is out golfing. He sails for New York on Saturday on the Mauretania. I am horrified to hear from him that, in addition to all his other big schemes, he is now promoting a fight for the light-weight championship in Jersey City, and guaranteeing enormous sums to both boxers. It's no good arguing with him. If you do, he simply quotes figures to show the fortunes other people have made out of these things. Besides, it's too late now, anyway. As far as I can make out, the fight is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place in <b>another</b> week or two. All the same, it makes my flesh creep.|$|R
40|$|Focusing on {{establishing}} {{and maintaining a}} stabilized approach and landing {{is a great way}} to avoid experiencing a loss of control. A stabilized approach is one in which the pilot establishes and maintains a constant angle glidepath towards a predetermined point on the landing runway. It is based on the pilot’s judgment of certain visual clues, and depends on the maintenance of a constant final descent airspeed and configuration. Whether you’re a CFI, a student pilot, or anything in between the GAJSC’s Loss of Control Working Group has some teaching points to help brush up on stabilized approach and landing techniques. One area where airmen seem to be experiencing loss of control is while flying in the pattern. A key factor may be crossed flight controls exacerbated by the effect of wind during the turn from base to final. Pilots tend to over shoot the extended centerline and increase bank to realign with the runway. This bank is combined with increased back pressure which is needed to maintain the desired descent rate. The increased bank and back pressure can put the airplane dangerously close to exceeding the critial angle of attack. To prevent this there are a few things we can do. Create your own personalized guidelines for a stabilized approach based on your skill and your aircraft (i. e. approach speeds, wind limits, a predetermined point to be stabilized on final). Next, <b>take</b> care <b>to</b> note the winds around the airport and consider how they will affect your pattern and approach. Also, try to get the aircraft properly configured for landing as early in the approach as practical. Next, try to focus on making small corrections to get on and stay on final. Also, set a point on the approach by which time you should be at a predetermined speed and altitude. Finally, if something’s not right, at any time, GO AROUND! There’s no shame in <b>going</b> back up <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> shot at it...|$|R
6000|$|DEAR SIR:--Your {{note about}} the little {{paragraph}} in the Republican was received yesterday, since which time I have been too unwell to notice it. I had not supposed you wrote or approved it. The whole originated in mistake. You know by the conversation with me that I thought {{the establishment of the}} paper unfortunate, but I always expected to throw no obstacle in its way, and to patronize it to the extent of taking and paying for one copy. When the paper was brought to my house, my wife said to me, [...] "Now are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> worthless little paper?" [...] I said to her evasively, [...] "I have not directed the paper to be left." [...] From this, in my absence, she sent the message to the carrier. This is the whole story.|$|E
5000|$|On July 20, Markle tricked a {{desk clerk}} at the Homewood Suites in Lexington, Kentucky into {{drinking}} another person’s urine. The prank started with a call to a guest. The guest was told it was the front desk calling and that a prior guest had tested positive for Hepatitis C. The guest was then told there was a doctor on site and a simple urine test could determine if the guest was infected. The urine was {{to be brought to}} the front desk in a simple drinking glass. Switching roles, Markle then called the front desk alleging to be an employee of Martinelli's Cider. He told the clerk that a representative from the company would like to come downstairs with a sample of their new drink. The guest from the previous call then arrived and handed the clerk his urine. Markle then coaxed the woman to try it. He asked how it tasted. [...] "Horrible," [...] she said. [...] "That does not taste like cider. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> sip, that's horrible." [...] Markle replied: [...] "Well, I need to inform you of something, ma'am. I want you to understand that you just drank that man's urine." [...] In its investigation, the Lufkin Police Department's cyber crimes division requested a subpoena for Markle's Skype activities. The police report classifies the Lexington incident as first-degree wanton endangerment, a Class D felony in Kentucky. [...] Markle was subsequently sentenced to a shock incarceration term of six months.|$|E

40|$|The {{fuel cell}} {{technology}} is an emerging technology for {{electric power generation}} for stationary, mobile and portable applications. While tremendous technological {{progress has been made}} in the last 10 years, it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>another</b> 10 years for commercialization and considerable penetration of power generation by fuel cell systems. The most promising fuel cell types are proton exchange membrane (PEMFC), molten carbonate (MCFC) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) while the phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC) are commercially available for up to about 200 kW units. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) are considered For portable power applications such as electronic devices. After a brief discussion of these fuel cell systems, the major challenges and research opportunities are outlined for automotive, stationary and portable power generation applications. This includes electrocatalysis, water and thermal management, modeling, and other challenges. The focus is on the R & D needs for each of these fuel cells starting at the cell level, followed by stack level, system level including combined gas turbine and cogeneration systems as well as fuel processing...|$|E
