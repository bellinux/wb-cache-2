25|$|He {{was imprisoned}} another time for being {{involved}} in Ukrainian separatist movements and affiliated publications in 1972. This time Chornovil was given six years of imprisonment and three more years of exile. His term he spent in Mordva camps for political prisoners in the villages of Ozernoye and Barashevo. Half of his term Chornovil spent in a penalized <b>isolation</b> <b>cell</b> and a room of cell type (PKT). Chornovil renounced his Soviet citizenship and {{decided to move to}} Canada in 1975, but was not permitted to do so. He joined the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, which helped to monitor and enforce the 1975 Helsinki Accords. In 1978 by train Chornovil was exiled to the village of Chappandu (Yakutia) where he worked as a laborer at a local state farm (sovkhoz), later as a supplier in Nyurba. In 1978 he was admitted to the International PEN society.|$|E
500|$|Sailors {{that did}} not escape, over 600 of them, were imprisoned on Ilha das Cobras, where João Cândido and {{seventeen}} others were transferred to an <b>isolation</b> <b>cell.</b> Of the eighteen, only two were left alive the next morning—the victim of a heat-producing chemical reaction between quicklime, used to disinfect the cell, and carbon dioxide. On the same day, a steamship named Satelite left Rio de Janeiro for the rubber plantations in the Amazon with over a hundred former sailors and nearly three hundred [...] "vagabonds" [...] on board. Nine were executed by the crew along the way, {{and many of the}} rest died shortly after while working in the hot tropical climate, conditions described by Rui Barbosa as [...] "a place where one only dies." [...] Meanwhile, João Cândido—stricken by hallucinations from his traumatic night—was sentenced to a mental hospital. It took eighteen months before he and nine sailors faced trial for their supposed anti-government actions taken during the December 9–10 revolts; the judges found them not guilty, and all were discharged from the navy.|$|E
2500|$|Boubacar Bah, a 52-year-old tailor from Guinea, {{was left}} in an <b>isolation</b> <b>cell</b> for more than 13 hours after falling and {{suffering}} a head fracture before an ambulance was called. His family was not notified for five days of his injury. A video shows Bah in the medical unit, before medical personnel {{sent him to the}} <b>isolation</b> <b>cell.</b> In the tape, his hands are handcuffed behind his back, he is face down, and he calls out repeatedly in his native language, Fulani: [...] "Help, they are killing me!" [...] Telephone and email records show that ten agency managers based in Newark and Washington discussed how to avoid the cost of his care and unwanted media attention. They considered sending Bah back to Guinea and reviewing his canceled work permit to see if {{it would be possible to}} get Medicaid or disability benefits. Eventually, they decided to release him to cousins in New York who objected that they had no way to care for Bah; however, days before this release was planned, Bah died.|$|E

2500|$|Dills {{had been}} in the drug program for 42 months when she went to court on October 8, 2008. The judge took Dills into {{chambers}} with the drug court staff and debated terminating Dills from the program, which would require her to serve 20–24 months in prison for the original forgery charges. Finally, Judge Williams told Dills to do 28 days in jail. After Dills was returned to jail, the judge phoned and ordered Dills to have [...] "no further contact", which meant no visitors, phone calls or mail. She was also placed in an <b>isolation</b> <b>cell.</b> When Dills asked if the isolation was for the full 28 days, the guard told her that the order had been changed to an [...] "indefinite sentence".|$|E
2500|$|That night, Andy {{dreams about}} forgetting his mother's face, so Tammy and Andy sneak {{out of the}} safe zone, and return to their former home, where they begin to collect family {{photographs}} and other mementos. To his shock, Andy finds Alice alive and uninfected in a semi-conscious, delirious state. The three are soon discovered by soldiers and taken back to District One. Alice is taken to a quarantine room, where she is tested and found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the rage virus. [...] Don makes an unauthorised visit to Alice in her <b>isolation</b> <b>cell,</b> begging her to forgive him. She accepts his apology and tells him she loves him. However, when they kiss, Don is infected, savagely kills her, and goes on a rampage.|$|E
2500|$|Sharansky {{appeared}} in a March 1990 edition of National Geographic magazine. The article, [...] "Last Days of the Gulag" [...] by Mike Edwards, profiles through photographs and text {{one of the few}} remaining Soviet prison labor camps. The article featured a photo of Natan Sharansky and his wife Avital in their home in Israel viewing photos of the same Gulag where he had been imprisoned, but as it {{appeared in}} 1990. Sharansky remarked in the article that after viewing images of the prisoner's faces he could discern that the protocol of oppression was still at work. The author also showed Sharansky a photo of the cold <b>isolation</b> <b>cell</b> where he had himself been confined. Sharansky commented with irony that conditions had improved slightly—the stark cell now featured a thin bench bolted to the middle of the floor. He said that if that bench had existed when he was there he could have utilized it to sleep, albeit uncomfortably.|$|E

50|$|<b>Isolation</b> <b>cells</b> {{are used}} to prevent short circuit current. As the name suggests, these cells isolate the power gated block from the normally-On block. <b>Isolation</b> <b>cells</b> are {{specially}} designed for low short circuit current when input is at threshold voltage level. Isolation control signals are provided by the power gating controller. Isolation of the signals of a switchable module is essential to preserve design integrity. Usually a simple OR or AND logic can function as an output isolation device. Multiple state retention schemes are available in practice to preserve the state before a module shuts down. The simplest technique is to scan out the register values into a memory before shutting down a module. When the module wakes up, the values are scanned back from the memory.|$|R

50|$|Timing-critical paths are {{constructed}} of short channel length cells, but for non timing-critical paths, the longer channel length cells {{can be used}} to trade off speed for lower leakage.

40|$|Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016. Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} distinctive motility and responses to extracellular cues of <b>cells</b> in <b>isolation,</b> <b>cells</b> collectively in groups, and cell fragments. Here we provide a protocol for generating cell sheets, isolated cells, and cell fragments of keratocytes from zebrafish scales. The protocol starts with a comprehensive fish preparation, followed by critical steps for scale processing and subsequent cell sheet generation, single <b>cell</b> <b>isolation,</b> and <b>cell</b> fragment induction, which can be accomplished in just 3 days including a 36 - 48 h incubation time. Compared to other approaches that usually produce single cells only or together with either fragments or cell groups, this facile and reliable methodology allows generation of all three motile forms simultaneously. With the powerful genetics in zebrafish our model system offers {{a useful tool for}} comparison of the mechanisms by which cell sheets, single cells, and cell fragments respond to extracellular stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Protein <b>isolation</b> from <b>cell</b> lysate can {{represent}} a significant challenge. The {{most efficient way}} to purify a protein is through the use of target-specific affinity ligands. Development of such affinity ligands, in most cases requires the availability of the target protein in a pure form. Thus, isolating the protein from the cell lysate requires affinity ligands, while developing affinity ligands requires a pure protein. Aptamer-facilitated Protein <b>Isolation</b> from <b>Cells</b> (AptaPIC) resolves this loop problem. AptaPIC is a technique that allows the development of aptamers for a protein in a context of a cell lysate, without any prior purification steps, and the subsequent utilization of the developed aptamers for protein <b>isolation</b> from the <b>cell</b> lysate...|$|R
