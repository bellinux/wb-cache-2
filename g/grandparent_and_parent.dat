However, {{the extent to which}} these effects persist into offspring in subsequent generations has received less attention. In this experiment, maternal and paternal {{effects on offspring}} and grand-offspring were investigated in the biparental burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, using a split-family design.

40|$|Declining {{marriage}} {{rates and}} the corresponding rise in single-parent families {{is associated with the}} increased likelihood that children spend at least part of their childhood living in poverty. Intergenerational kin networks, however, can serve as an important safety net for children whose parents are unable to provide appropriate instrumental or emotional support for their own children. This paper uses data from the Time, Love, and Cash Among Couples with Children (TLC 3) study, a longitudinal qualitative examination of parents who recently had a child together, to explore the processes that underlie these intergenerational relationships. Looking at unmarried mothers 2 ̆ 7 and fathers 2 ̆ 7 reports of their relationships with their parents, we build a typology of intergenerational relationships and solidarity that highlights the important role of grandchildren as a unifying element of intergenerational contact. The grandchild generation serves an important role in bringing all three generations into contact with one another, regardless of whether parents and grandparents have harmonious or tension-filled relationships. These results suggest that increased mutual understanding between <b>grandparent</b> <b>and</b> <b>parent</b> generations, especially of each others 2 ̆ 7 expectations regarding involvement with the grandchild, may lead to more harmonious intergenerational relationships that benefit all generations...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the health status of {{children}} aged between 6 and 12 years reared by <b>grandparent</b> <b>and</b> <b>parent,</b> including the factors affecting the develop-ment of both groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2 different caregiver groups, 160 children living with their grandparents and 160 children living with their parents in Phrae province. The samples were selected by cluster sampling and data were collected from March 10 to April 8, 2006 by questionnaire. The Test of Nonverbal Intelligence– 3 was used to test the child development. Data were analyzed by frequency distribution, percentage, χ 2 test, and mul-tiple logistic regression. The illness in the past 6 months and nutritional status of the children aged 6 to 12 years were not different between 2 groups, but the child development and appro-priateness of child rearing were different with statistical significance (P <. 05). Children who were reared by grandparents had a higher percentage (66. 7 %) of below normal development than those reared by parents (33. 3 %), and had inappropriate child rearing by a rate of 57. 7 % compared with 42. 3 %. In addition, the factors affecting the development of children reared by grandparents were both the level of the family income and the child rearing factor, whereas the child development in those who were reared by parents was affected only by the child rearing factor...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: In total five <b>grandparent</b> focus groups <b>and</b> three <b>parent</b> focus groups were conducted. The data were analysed using the constant comparative method. Findings: Though most grandparents enjoyed their grandparent roles, there were differences in the perception of the grandparent role between <b>grandparents</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents.</b> Both <b>grandparents</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> reported intergenerational conflicts on the management of the grandchildren, which was distressing for both parties.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{findings}} of an exploratory study of how <b>grandparents,</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> grandchildren view the role of grandparents in the divorced family, and what impact the divorce seems to have on that role. We analyse the findings in three ways. First, we consider {{the nature of the relationship}} between <b>grandparents</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandparents</b> <b>and</b> grandchildren, which we argue appears to be characterized by asymmetry. Second, we identify the two key norms that appear to underlie the way these relationships are operated – the norm of non‐interference and the norm of obligation. Third, we categorize the styles that different <b>grandparents</b> adopt, <b>and</b> suggest that they occupy places on three different continua – grandparent as <b>parent,</b> partisan supporter <b>and</b> adult–child focused. We argue that where any given set of grandparents is located along each of these is established before the parents' divorce, and that the divorce of itself does not fundamentally alter their approach to grandparenting. We conclude that the study suggests that grandparents' willingness to provide support to divorced <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> their children cannot be taken for granted, and that the claim that grandparents should be accorded specific legal rights by virtue of their status is not supported by the evidence obtained in this study...|$|R

40|$|Background: While {{risk for}} alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD) is correlated in twins, siblings and parent-offspring pairs, we know little {{of how this}} syndrome is transmitted across three generations. Method: We examined 685 172 individuals born in Sweden from 1980 to 1990 with four <b>grandparents,</b> <b>and</b> both <b>parents</b> alive in 1980. AUD was assessed in all these individuals from nationwide medical, criminal and pharmacy registries. Results: AUD was stably transmitted across three generations. Parent-child and grandparent-grandchild tetrachoric correlations equaled + 0. 25 and + 0. 12, respectively. Grandchild AUD risk did not vary {{as a function of}} the sex of the parent or grandparent. However, from <b>grandparents</b> <b>and</b> <b>parents,</b> transmission to grandchildren was stronger in same-sex than opposite-sex pairs. Compared with a grandchild with unaffected <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandparents,</b> risk for AUD with a grandparent but no parent affected, a parent but no grandparent affected or both affected increased approximately 70 % and 3 and 4 -fold, respectively. Grandchildren with ⩾ 2 grandparents affected had a 40 % greater AUD risk than those with only one affected. Tetrachoric correlations for AUD between offspring and great-aunts/uncles, and aunts/uncles equaled + 0. 06 and + 0. 13, respectively. Conclusions: The transmission of AUD in Sweden across three generations is relatively stable. An orderly pattern of resemblance is seen with correlations declining by approximately 50 % between first and second, and second and third-degree relatives. While the transmission of risk from affected male and female relatives does not differ, we find consistent evidence for greater resemblance in same-sex v. opposite-sex across generational pairs of relatives...|$|R
