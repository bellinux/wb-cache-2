25|$|Economic input–output LCA (EIOLCA) {{involves}} use of aggregate sector-level data on {{how much}} environmental impact {{can be attributed to}} each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors. Such analysis can account for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA; however, EIOLCA relies on sector-level averages {{that may or may not}} be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product and therefore is not suitable <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> environmental impacts of products.

25|$|Related to the ‘sustainable intensification’ of agriculture, an {{objective}} which in part is discussed controversially, efficiency of resource use becomes increasingly important today. Environmental impacts of agricultural production {{depend on the}} efficiency achieved when using natural resources and all other means of production. The input per kg of output, the output per kg of input, and the output achieved per hectare of land – a limited resource {{in the light of}} world population growth – are decisive figures <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> efficiency and the environmental impact of agricultural systems. Efficiency parameters therefore offer important evidence how efficiency and environmental impacts of agriculture can be judged and where improvements can or must be made.|$|E
25|$|A {{probationary}} {{condition that}} a defendant testify under oath on all {{questions as to}} his financial condition relating to amounts and locations of all assets was upheld as legal because the defendant made a blanket refusal to answer any questions, and therefore {{it could not be}} shown that his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was violated by any particular question. It was ruled that a court did not abuse its discretion in requiring, as a condition of supervised release, that the defendant report financial obligations in excess of $250 incurred by his wife. The condition was held to serve a legitimate monitoring purpose in light of the defendant's history of masking his income and ownership of assets, and the financial information was also deemed necessary <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> defendant's ability to meet his restitution schedule.|$|E
