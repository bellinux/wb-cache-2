He travels to meet Goku after {{learning}} that he had defeated Freeza, and easily defeated him despite his advanced stages of the Super Saiyan transformation. Beerus next travels to Earth, coming across partygoers of Bulma's birthday party, including Vegeta, who met Beerus during his youth and is fearful of him due to his superior strength. Although Beerus is disappointed that Vegeta does not know what a Super Saiyan God is, he stays at Bulma's party because he enjoys Earth's cuisine. Beerus is mostly calm until requesting some pudding from Majin Boo, who refuses to share, causing him to become enraged and easily beat Boo, Gotenks, Gohan, Android 18, Piccolo, and Tenshinhan in combat. Bulma slaps Beerus, who <b>he</b> <b>slaps</b> back and in doing so causes an angered Vegeta to grow in strength and seemingly surpass him. Beerus then easily defeats Vegeta after powering up, and moves to destroy the Earth until Goku pleads for him to allow the Earthlings time to find a way of making a Super Saiyan God appear. After the Saiyans perform a ritual, which sees Goku transform into a Super Saiyan God, Beerus duels him and though defeating him, spares him and the Earth. During Freeza's resurrection and subsequent battle with the heroes, Beerus observes the fight and worries Freeza that he will become involved until Beerus confirms he will not.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Ferreira walking towards a blue {{projector}} screen, wearing black sunglasses, a black {{jacket and a}} transparent, fishnet-pattern top. Ferreira stops and removes the jacket slowly {{as a group of}} voyeurs observes her. During her act, she continuously looks towards a man with shades and long hair, who sips a drink while watching Ferreira. Outside the nightclub, she is seen again with that man—her apparent love interest—as they kiss each other and involve themselves physically. They reencounter in a black room where Ferreira sticks an ice pick on his face; in response, <b>he</b> <b>slaps</b> her, to which she smiles and they start kissing again.
