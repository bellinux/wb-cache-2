500|$|Following {{a change}} in {{administration}} in Washington, in May 2017 {{it was reported that}} Cindy McCain was under consideration for a prominent role at the U.S. Department of State, possibly focusing on issues related to human trafficking. [...] In June 2017, there were further reports that after extensive recruiting by the chief executive following a recommendation from Ivanka Trump, she had agreed to become an Ambassador-at-Large dealing with matters of human trafficking, refugees, and humanitarian aid. [...] No official announcement has yet been made regarding this. [...] In July 2017 she faced the news that her husband had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. [...] She issued a public statement saying that, [...] "We as a family will face the next hurdle together. One thing <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> he is the toughest person I know. He is my hero and I love him with all my heart." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 7 November 2007 that Abra would again {{be returning to}} Holby City, in spring 2008. Edmondson revealed that [...] "Abra comes back as a patient because some trauma has happened in Africa {{and he will be}} sponging off Ric." [...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no one knows why. Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used to be a nice guy, but he’s horrible now. Something happened to him on his travels, though even I haven’t been told what it is yet. What <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> that Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror." [...] He has stated that this appearance in the show will last four or five months, and that he doesn't yet know how the character will be written out this time, beyond there being [...] "some kind of mental-health issue." [...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E
2500|$|Huckabee took stances {{opposed to}} the nature of the {{incumbent}} president, Barack Obama. In comments made March 1, 2011, on The Steve Malzberg Show, Huckabee said of Obama, [...] "I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough. And one thing that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, is very different than the average American." [...] (This is a reference to the Mau Mau Uprising against the colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1952; Obama himself has never lived in Kenya.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 20, 2013 a final article {{appeared}} on Groklaw, explaining {{that due to}} pervasive government monitoring of the Internet, there {{could no longer be}} an expectation of the sort of privacy online that was necessary to collaborate on sensitive topics. [...] Jones wrote [...] "I can't do Groklaw without your input.... and there is now no private way, evidently, to collaborate." [...] and [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> it's not possible to be fully human if you are being surveilled 24/7... I hope that makes it clear why I can't continue. There is now no shield from forced exposure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conference {{attendance}} gets {{much attention}} on Gerbic's bi-weekly segments on the Skeptic Society's Skepticality podcast. She stresses {{how important it}} is for skeptics to attend, and if there aren't conferences nearby, then to create a conference, be it a SkeptiCamp or a Skeptics in the Pub event. She insists that conference attendance is the first step towards activism. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> that the one-on-one contact recharges our batteries. People like Harriet A. Hall (Skepdoc), Lindsay Beyerstein (co-host of Point of Inquiry), and myself came from CSI’s Skeptic's Toolbox. We weren't primarily authors or lecturers, just people with a passion for the skeptical movement who decided it was our turn to step up. You can’t buy that fire, but sometimes you might have to kick the embers to keep us (and others) out there fighting what seems to be an insurmountable world of woo. Conferences are essential." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{related the}} {{experience}} of Donna Tagliaferri, who described [...] "a terrifying incident after meeting Cosby in the mid-1970s through tennis" [...] {{when she was in}} her early 20s. After playing tennis with Cosby a number of times, he invited her on a dinner date and then invited her up to his hotel room. Tagliaferri had a girlfriend accompany them. After showing them around the penthouse, [...] "things changed dramatically and quickly. He made it clear to me in a very aggressive way what his intentions were. He chillingly said to me, 'I will have you.' Those words are imprinted on my brain along with the evil I felt. My first thought was, 'No you will not.' Then shock took over, and when words wouldn't come a paralyzing feeling did." [...] At this point her girlfriend started talking and got them out of the situation: [...] "I {{have no way of knowing}} what would have happened if Wendy had not been there. What <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> his words were an assault to me never to be forgotten. And the betrayal of a friendship was staggering." ...|$|E

5000|$|Butler {{opened his}} memoirs {{by saying that}} his career had been split between academia, {{politics}} and India, and that his main regret was never having been Viceroy of India. He regarded the 1935 India Act and the 1944 Education Act as his [...] "principal legislative achievements". He also wrote {{that the way to}} the top was through rebellion and resignation, whereas he had gone for [...] "the long haul" [...] and [...] "steady influence". In an obvious dig at Home, he said in retirement [...] "I may never have known much about fishing or flower-arranging, but one thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>know</b> <b>was</b> how to govern the people of this country".|$|R
