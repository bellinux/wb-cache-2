Through these intermediates, aniline can be conveniently converted to -OH, -CN, or a halide via Sandmeyer reactions.

25|$|Alkenes {{engage in}} an acid catalysed {{hydration}} reaction using concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols. The hydroboration-oxidation and oxymercuration-reduction of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in halohydrin formation reaction.

25|$|A {{specific}} experiment {{example of}} an application of native gel electrophoresis is to check for enzymatic activity to verify {{the presence of the}} enzyme in the sample during protein purification. For example, for the protein alkaline phosphatase, the staining solution is a mixture of 4-chloro-2-2methylbenzenediazonium salt with 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2’-4’-dimethyl aniline in Tris buffer. This stain is commercially sold as kit for staining gels. If the protein is present, the mechanism of the reaction takes place in the following order: it starts with the de-phosphorylation of 3-phospho-2-naphthoic acid-2’-4’-dimethyl aniline by alkaline phosphatase (water is needed for the reaction). The phosphate group is released and replaced by an alcohol group from water. The electrophile 4- chloro-2-2 methylbenzenediazonium (Fast Red TR <b>Diazonium</b> salt) displaces the alcohol group forming the final product Red Azo dye. As its name implies, this is the final visible-red product of the reaction. In undergraduate academic experimentation of protein purification, the gel is usually ran next to commercial purified samples in order to visualize the results and make confusions of whether or not purification was successful.|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} of NanoPutian’s lower body begins with nitroaniline {{as a starting}} material. Addition of Br2 in acetic acid places two equivalents of bromine on the benzene ring. NH2 is an electron donating group, and NO2 is an electron withdrawing group, which both direct bromination to the meta position relative to the NO2 substituent. Addition of NaNO2, H2SO4, and EtOH removes the NH2 substituent. The Lewis acid SnCl2, a reducing agent in THF/EtOH solvent, replaces NO2 with NH2, which is subsequently replaced by iodine upon the addition of NaNO2, H2SO4, and KI to yield 3,5-dibromoiodobenzene. In this step, the Sandmeyer reaction converts the primary amino group (NH2) to a <b>diazonium</b> leaving group (N2), which is subsequently replaced by iodine. Iodine serves as an excellent coupling partner for the attachment of the stomach, which is executed through Sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene to yield 3,5-dibromo(trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene. Attachment of the legs replaces the Br substituents with 1-pentyne through another Sonogashira coupling to produce 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-(trimethylsilylethynyl) benzene. To complete the {{synthesis of}} the lower body, the TMS protecting group is removed by selective deprotection through the addition of K2CO3, MeOH, and CH2Cl2 to yield 3,5-(1′-Pentynyl)-1-ethynylbenzene.|$|E

Additionally, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor shows positive urease activity and a positive staining response when stained with <b>diazonium</b> blue B. <b>Diazonium</b> blue B is a technique used to classify asexual yeasts {{as members of the}} Zygomycota, Basidiomycota or Ascomycota. The major ubiquinone present is Q-10. The cell wall of S.salmonicolor contains fucose, mannose, glucose and galactose, however xylose is absent.

2500|$|Although of no {{commercial}} significance, {{many other}} routes to benzene exist. Phenol and halobenzenes {{can be reduced}} with metals. Benzoic acid and its salts undergo decarboxylation to benzene. [...] Via the reaction the <b>diazonium</b> compound with hypophosphorus acid aniline gives benzene.

50|$|The {{first use}} of <b>diazonium</b> salts was to produce water-fast dyed fabrics by {{immersing}} the fabric in an aqueous solution of the <b>diazonium</b> compound, followed by immersion in a solution of the coupler (the electron-rich ring that undergoes electrophilic substitution). The major applications of <b>diazonium</b> compounds remains in the dye and pigment industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{offers a}} wide scope for both <b>diazonium</b> component and arene component but yields are generally low following the original procedure (less than 40%), given the many side-reactions of <b>diazonium</b> salts. Several improvements have been suggested. One possibility is to employ <b>diazonium</b> tetrafluoroborates in arene solvent {{together with a}} phase-transfer catalyst, another is to use 1-aryl-3,3-dialkyltriazenes.|$|E
50|$|NO+ {{reacts with}} aryl amines, ArNH2, to give <b>diazonium</b> salts, ArN. The {{resulting}} <b>diazonium</b> group is easily displaced (unlike the amino group) {{by a variety}} of nucleophiles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Diazonium</b> {{compounds}} or <b>diazonium</b> salts are a {{group of}} organic compounds sharing a common functional group [...] where R can be any organic group, such as an alkyl or an aryl, and X is an inorganic or organic anion, such as a halogen. <b>Diazonium</b> salts, especially those where R is an aryl group, are important intermediates in the organic synthesis of azo dyes.|$|E
50|$|In their {{reactions}} with metal complexes, <b>diazonium</b> cations behave similarly to NO+. For example, low-valent metal complexes add with <b>diazonium</b> salts. Illustrative complexes are Fe(CO)2(PPh3)2(N2Ph)+ and the chiral-at-metal complex Fe(CO)(NO)(PPh3)(N2Ph).|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} forming <b>diazonium</b> {{compounds}} is called [...] "diazotation", [...] "diazoniation", or [...] "diazotization". The reaction was first reported by Peter Griess in 1858, who subsequently discovered several reactions {{of this new}} class of compounds. The most important method for the preparation of <b>diazonium</b> salts is treatment of aromatic amines such as aniline with nitrous acid. Usually the nitrous acid is generated in situ (in the same flask) from sodium nitrite and mineral acid. In aqueous solution <b>diazonium</b> salts are unstable at temperatures above 5 °C; the −N+≡N group tends to be lost as N2 (nitrogen gas). One can isolate <b>diazonium</b> compounds as tetrafluoroborate salts, which are stable at room temperature. Often, <b>diazonium</b> compounds are not isolated and once prepared, used immediately in further reactions. This approach is illustrated {{in the preparation of}} an arylsulfonyl compound: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{conversion}} of primary aromatic amines into its <b>diazonium</b> salt is called diazotization. <b>Diazonium</b> salts are important synthetic intermediates that can undergo coupling reactions to form azo dyes and electrophilic substitution reactions to introduce functional groups.|$|E
5000|$|Amines {{react with}} nitrous acid to give <b>diazonium</b> salts. The alkyl <b>diazonium</b> salts are of little {{synthetic}} importance {{because they are}} too unstable. The most important members are derivatives of aromatic amines such as aniline ("phenylamine") (A = aryl or naphthyl): ...|$|E
5000|$|Anilines and naphthylamines form {{more stable}} <b>diazonium</b> salts, {{which can be}} {{isolated}} in the crystalline form. <b>Diazonium</b> salts undergo a variety of useful transformations involving replacement of the N2 group with anions. For example, cuprous cyanide gives the corresponding nitriles: ...|$|E
50|$|Triazenes {{have been}} used as in situ <b>diazonium</b> source. Triazenes {{decompose}} in the presence of protonating or alkylating agents into quaternary amines and <b>diazonium</b> salts. A strategy for the protection and deprotection of sensitive secondary amines is based on this principle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most widely}} practiced {{reaction}} of <b>diazonium</b> salts is azo coupling. In this process, the <b>diazonium</b> compound is attacked by, i.e., coupled to, electron-rich substrates. When the coupling partners are arenes such as anilines and phenols, {{the process is}} an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution: ...|$|E
50|$|The second main {{route is}} the Sandmeyer reaction. Anilines (aryl amines) are {{converted}} to their <b>diazonium</b> salts using nitrous acid. For example, copper(I) chloride converts <b>diazonium</b> salts to the aryl chloride. Nitrogen gas is the leaving group, which makes this reaction very favorable. The similar Schiemann reaction uses the tetrafluoroborate anion as the fluoride donor. Gatterman Reaction {{can also be}} used to convert <b>Diazonium</b> salt to chlorobenzene or bromobenzene by using copper powder instead of copper chloride or copper bromide. But this must be done in the presence of HCl and HBr respectively.|$|E

5000|$|An azo {{coupling}} is {{an organic}} reaction between a <b>diazonium</b> compound and another aromatic compound that produces an azo compound. In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the aryldiazonium cation is the electrophile and the activated arene is a nucleophile.

50|$|Two {{important}} addition {{reactions of}} SWNT sidewall are: (1) Fluorination, and (2) Aryl <b>diazonium</b> salt addition. These functional groups on SWNT improve solubility and processibility. Moreover, these reactions allow for combining unique properties of SWNTs {{with those of}} other compounds.

50|$|<b>Diazonium</b> reagent and SWNT {{reaction}} has a {{two step}} mechanism. First, the <b>diazonium</b> reagent adsorbs noncovalently {{to an empty}} site on the nanotube surface, forming a charge-transfer complex. This is a fast, selective noncovalent adsorption and <b>diazonium</b> group in this complex partially dopes the nanotube, diminishing the tangential mode in the Raman spectrum. Desorption of A from nanotube is negligible (k−1 ~ 0). In second step complex B then decomposes to form a covalent bond with the nanotube surface. This is a slower step that need not be selective and {{is represented by the}} restoration of the G peak and increase in the D band.|$|E
