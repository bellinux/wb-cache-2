5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons <b>Environmental</b> <b>Audit</b> Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E

It will begin by reviewing the concept of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> and will then discuss sources of existing legal authority to require or encourage audits and their limitations. Next, the {{article examines}} EPA 2 ̆ 7 s existing audit policies and the rationale behind them.

First, it will consider portions of the Community Right-to-Know legislation adopted by Congress in 1986, which can be considered a limited form of mandatory <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing.</b> Then, <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> will be compared to the financial auditing process developed under the securities laws, which mandates broad financial auditing.

Lack of proper audit mechanisms by the AG on a regular basis negates the accountability requirement and can lead to inefficiency.

40|$|Purpose - The {{main purpose}} {{in this article}} is to {{highlight}} civil society activism that resulted in the inception of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> in the United States in the 1970 s. The General Motors (GM) campaign which is discussed in this article led towards major institutional changes for the implementation of corporate social responsibility (environmental) reporting originally referred to as social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission&# 039;s (SEC) role and actions are analysed in detail in order to highlight the direction of this Federal Agency in relation to the implementation of social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> Design/methodology/approach - A detailed analysis of literature from the early 1970 s is undertaken in order to identify the inception of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> and the types of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> as social auditing in its early stages. The case of the GM campaign is analysed in order to highlight the forms of historical institutionalism relevant to the critical stage of exogenous influences on companies to undertake social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> Findings - It is found that in the early 1970 s companies resisted the incorporation of corporate social responsibility initiatives and actions as part of their agendas. <b>Environmental</b> <b>Auditing</b> as a type of social auditing at that time referred to corporate social responsibility disclosures that included environmental disclosures. Due to public pressure and civil society activism companies had to adopt and undertake social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> The initial stages of environmental disclosures included reporting on environmental expenses and liabilities of the companies. The SEC imposed minimal disclosure requirements for <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing,</b> which were nevertheless adequate to undertake action against companies found to be providing misleading environmental information in their publicly available disclosures...|$|R
500|$|Critics of an {{expansionist policy}} {{consider}} the EU ETS {{to be too}} late and to price carbon too low to adequately mitigate the climate change impact of aviation emissions. Instead they advocate addressing these impacts by constraining demand for air travel. The study Predict and Decide - Aviation, climate change and UK policy, noting that a 10 per cent increase in fares generates a 5 to 15 per cent reduction in demand, recommends {{that the government should}} seek an alternative aviation policy based on managing demand rather than providing for it. This would be accomplished via a strategy that presumes [...] "… against the expansion of UK airport capacity" [...] and constrains demand by the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. In another study the levying of £9billion of taxes is calculated to constrain the forecast growth in demand by 2030 to 315million passengers, reducing the annual rate of growth to 2 per cent. The environmental message is echoed in the ninth report of the House of Commons <b>Environmental</b> <b>Audit</b> Select Committee, published in July 2006, which labels the government strategy a predict and provide model and expresses scepticism about the timescale and efficiency of the EU ETS. It recommends instead that the government rethinks its airport expansion policy and considers ways, particularly via increased taxation, in which future demand can be managed in line with industry performance in achieving fuel efficiencies, so that emissions are not allowed to increase in absolute terms.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{international}} claims that accountants and auditors are positioned {{to play a}} pivotal role in the design and conduct of <b>environmental</b> <b>audits,</b> empirical studies have indicated that in the early 1990 s few, if any, accounting professionals in New Zealand were actively involved in the conduct of independent external <b>environmental</b> <b>audits.</b> As the extent of environmental management practices adopted by organisations can be expected to have increased substantially since this time, there is reason to anticipate that the engagement of financial auditors with <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> may also have changed over the last decade.
