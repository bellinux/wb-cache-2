40|$|It is a {{daunting}} task to build institution and infrastructure over a short time period in developing countries. But {{in the absence of}} sound institutions and adequate infrastructure, it is difficult for economic transformation to take place. An alternative is to facilitate existing industrial clusters or build <b>industrial</b> <b>parks</b> by creating an enabling environment in a limited place. This paper reviews the commonly used strategies to build effective clusters and <b>industrial</b> <b>parks.</b> Clusters and <b>industrial</b> <b>parks</b> are location specific. Because they have an informational advantage, local governments are in a better position than the central government to identify and solve the bottlenecks that affect clusters and <b>industrial</b> <b>parks.</b> As clusters and <b>industrial</b> <b>parks</b> evolve, new bottlenecks emerge, thereby requiring new solutions. This in turns calls for continuous tinkering by local governments. It is important to place local governments and business communities in the driver’s seat of local economic growth so that they can watch out for and adjust to the bumps in the road ahead.
