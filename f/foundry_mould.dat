40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the process of}} thermal evaporation of a foundry pattern. At several research-development centres, studies {{have been carried out}} to examine the physico-chemical phenomena that take place in <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> filled with polystyrene pattern when it is poured with molten metal. In the technique of evaporative patterns, the process of mould filling with molten metal (the said mould holding inside a polystyrene pattern) is interrelated with the process of thermal decomposition of this pattern. The transformation of an evaporative pattern (e. g. made from foamed polystyrene) from the solid into liquid and then gaseous state occurs {{as a result of the}} thermal effect that the liquid metal exerts onto this pattern. Consequently, at the liquid metal-pattern-mould phase boundary some physico-chemical phenomena take place, which until now have not been fully explained. When the pattern is evaporating, some solid and gaseous products are evolved, e. g. CO, CO 2, H 2, N 2, and hydrocarbons, e. g. styrene, toluene, ethane, methane, benzene [16, 23]. The process of polystyrene pattern evaporation in <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> under the effect of molten metal is of a very complex nature and depends on many different factors, still not fully investigated. The kinetics of pattern evaporation is also affected by the technological properties of <b>foundry</b> <b>mould,</b> e. g. permeability, thermophysical properties, parameters of the gating system, temperature of pouring, properties of pattern material, and the size of pattern-liquid metal contact surface...|$|E

The individual elements of process {{history of the}} alloy fabrication included: type of mould (sand or metal mould), modification process, and type of heat treatment (solutioning and ageing). Basing on a multivariance MANOVA test, {{it was possible to}} determine not only the effect of the main parameters, like <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> type, modification and heat treatment, but also an interaction ofthese effects.

40|$|Purpose: Metal reoxidation {{causes a}} number of iron {{castings}} defects, particularly when pouring them in green-sand moulds. One of them is pinholes the occurrence of which is explained by several hypotheses. One of possible causes is reoxidation processes in the <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> cavity. During its flowing in the gating system and in the mould cavity the liquid metal gets into contact with oxygen from air and water vapour. Secondary oxidation of elements takes place in sequence of their affinity to oxygen. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore the authors were aimed at cast irons. Besides indirect methods the reoxidation was researched mainly by direct measurement of oxygen activity during filling of a mould up to solidus temperature. Findings: The use of oxygen activity measurement for direct study of changes caused by reoxidation processes is limited {{and that it is}} more suitable for study of the influence of different factors on cast iron crystallization and graphite morphology. Practical implications: Obtained results have confirmed that oxygen activity measurement can serve to the casting quality control. But it is little sensitive for explanation of processes running in a cavity during metal casting. Originality/value: Continuous monitoring of oxygen activity changes in a <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> is an original solution since other authors have done their measurements only in a furnace with disposable sensors...|$|E

40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of research on the development of composite zones in castings based on the intermetallic phase of Ni 3 Al. Composite zones were obtained by placing packets with substrates for the reaction of titanium carbide in a <b>foundry</b> <b>mould.</b> To provide a variable carbides content in the composite zone, two compositions of the packets were prepared. The first packet contained only substrates for the reaction of TiC synthesis; the second one also contained a filler. The resulting composite zones in castings were examined for the filler effect on changes in the volume fraction, size and morphology of carbides in the zone. In addition, the effect of filler on the mechanical properties of the zone was verified, observing changes of Vickers hardness in this area. It was found that the presence of filler in the composition of the packet for synthesis reduced the content of carbides, as well as their size and morphology. Lower surface content of carbides reduced hardness of the zone, which enabled smooth control of the mechanical properties. At the same time, the use of the selected filler did not disturb the course of the TiC carbide synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Possibilities {{of making}} hybrid foundry {{patterns}} of bevel gears for investment casting process are presented. Rapid prototyping of gears with complex tooth forms is {{possible with the}} use of modern methods. One of such methods is the stereo-lithography, where a pattern is obtained as a result of resin curing with laser beam. Patterns of that type are applicable in precision casting. Removing of stereo-lithographic pattern from <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> requires use of high temperatures. Resin burning would generate significant amounts of harmful gases. In case of a solid stereo-lithographic pattern, the pressure created during gas burning may cause the mould to crack. A gas volume reduction may be achieved by using patterns of honeycomb structure. However, this technique causes a significant worsening of accuracy of stereo-lithographic patterns in respect of their dimensions and shape. In cooperation with WSK PZL Rzeszów, the Machine Design Department of Rzeszow University of Technology carried out research on the design of hybrid stereo-lithographic patterns. Hybrid pattern consists of a section made by stereo-lithographic process and a section made of casting wax. The latter material is used for stereo-lithographic pattern filling and for mould gating system. The hybrid pattern process consists of two stages: wax melting and then the burn-out of stereolithographic pattern. Use of hybrid patterns reduces the costs of production of stereolithographic patterns. High dimensional accuracy remains preserved in this process...|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} work {{discusses the}} influence of material of <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> {{on the effect of}} modification of AlSi 11 alloy. For this purpose castings were produced in moulds made of four various materials. Castings of the first type were cast in a metal die, the second ones in the conventional mould of bentonite-bound sand, those of the third type in the sand mould with oil binder, the last ones in a shell mould where phenol-formaldehyde resin was applied as a binder. All the castings were made of AlSi 11 alloy modified with strontium. For a purpose of comparison also castings made of the non-modified alloy were produced. The castings were examined with regard to their microstructures. The performed investigations point out that the addition of strontium master alloy results in refining of the alloy structure, particularly of the α-phase, causes some morphological changes in the alloy and the refinement of eutectics. The advantageous influence of modifier on the structure of the examined silumin was observed particularly in the case of alloy cast either in the conventional oil-bound sand mould or in the shell mould. The non-modified alloy cast into a metal die exhibits a structure similar to those of modified alloy solidifying in the other moulds. The improvement in both tensile strength and unit elongation suggests that the modification was carried out correctly. The best mechanical properties were found for the alloy cast in a metal die, both with and without modification treatment...|$|E
40|$|A {{contactless}} {{method of}} measuring a <b>foundry</b> <b>mould</b> filling degree in course of its pouring with liquid metal is suggested. The concept {{is based on}} infrared radiation of molten metal appearing in venting and flow-off holes. As the detector, an infrared channel receiving diode is applied. Three solutions were tested. In the first solution, the diode is placed at the calculated distance from the radiation source, in a housing that suppresses the scattered signal. The housing contains the electronics, while power supply and control signals are delivered by conductors. A diode actuation threshold is established {{in order to obtain}} high resolution and repeatability of the results. On the output, a miniature relay transmits the signal to the control system. In the second solution, the measuring system is supplied with a battery and the signal in transmitted through a plastic optical fibre. In the third solution, the optical fibre serves as an energy carrier. The optical system focuses the infrared radiation and introduces the energy to the optical fibre. On {{the other end of the}} fibre, a phototransistor amplifies the signal, forms it and transmits to the control system. Some experiments were carried out.

Methodology: Experiments were done on castings of stepped bars moulded in green bentonite mixtures with s graduated moisture and withuse of two types of carbonaceous matters. Metal was melted in a 100 kg induction furnace from the same charge. Inoculation was done ina ladle after pouring out from the furnace. Aluminium was dosed in the ladle in some cases and the inoculator kind was changed too. Results: Pinholes were present on castings as small flat pits; on horizontal surfaces sooner singly, on casting edges in clusters. Theformation of pinholes wasn’t caused by high moisture of moulds but the defect was sensitive to aluminium content in metal. In castingswith high aluminium content > 0. 01 % the pinholes were present in great numbers, and namely both under low, and also high moi stures ofmoulding mixtures. In melts with low content of Al < 0. 01 % the pinholes occurred less extensively only. Practical implications: Conclusions from literature about influence of Al on pinholes occurrence were confirmed in such a way.
