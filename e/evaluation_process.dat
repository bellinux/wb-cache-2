40|$|A {{fundamental}} premise which underpins much of {{the study}} of cross-cultural consumer behaviour, is that there exist significant differences in consumer behaviour between the domestic and foreign markets. Further, {{it can be argued that}} such differences •in the behaviour of foreign and domestic consumers can be attributed to differences in culture. This paper explores this question by examining, firstly, whether differences in product <b>evaluation</b> <b>processes</b> exist between consumers in different geographical regions of China and, secondly, if such differences, if any, can be attributed to differences in the cultural orientations of these consumers from different regions of China. Specifically, therefore, it examines the question of whether differences in cultural orientation among Chinese consumers are associated with differences in product <b>evaluation</b> <b>processes.</b> From a sample of consumers in three Chinese locations (Hong Kong, Shanghai and Chongqing), groups displaying varying levels on Hofstede's cultural indices were examined for differences, if any, in their product <b>evaluation</b> <b>processes.</b> The product chosen was domestic air-conditioners.

500|$|To be {{registered}} as a Finnhorse, a horse must either have parents registered as Finnhorses, or be verified to be descended {{from at least}} three generations of Finnhorses. To qualify for the Finnhorse stud book as a breeding animal, a horse must prove itself by meeting or exceeding the breed standard set for various qualities: performance ability, conformation, disposition, and in some cases, quality of offspring. Any horse offered for the Finnhorse studbook {{must be at least}} 4 years old, a stallion or a mare, and registered a Finnhorse. The stud book evaluation board considers the performance of horses in their desired discipline: riding, driving, harness racing, or workhorse events. Horses to {{be registered}} in the stud book are tested for performance at the stud book registration inspection. With the exception of the trotter section, they are also evaluated on [...] "type"; the suitability of the horse's overall build for the section for which it is offered. Individuals that do not qualify for the studbook on their own merits during the stud book <b>evaluation</b> <b>process</b> may be accepted later, based on the quality and accomplishments of their offspring. For this to occur, a horse's offspring are evaluated by their competitive history or their stud book evaluation, and if of high enough quality, their parent then is also granted acceptance into the stud book. Conversely, a horse may be removed from the studbook if its offspring are found to have any inherited flaw or condition. A stallion may also be removed if his offspring are clearly below the average level in competitive success or stud book evaluations.|$|E
500|$|During this <b>evaluation</b> <b>process,</b> {{three key}} {{constraints}} were pinned {{down for the}} developers to face. The first was hardware related, as the Wii had a limited lifespan as a viable console; the second was the requirement of a subscription, a necessity to make the game profitable; and the third was a natural reticence against playing an online-only title. The Wii had been chosen as the game's platform due to its large install base and popularity in Japan, but it would inevitably be left behind for newer consoles, so {{it was decided to}} create future versions of Dragon Quest X for other viable platforms. To combat the monetary concerns, the team looked at the typical flat rate subscription, which at the time was between ¥1200 (US$12) and ¥2000 (US$20), then set it at ¥1000 (US$10) so it would be attractive to more casual gamers while still being profitable. Despite the low fee, Fujisawa felt that this might turn away long-term fans who were not hardcore gamers. The solution was [...] "Kid's Time", which despite the name was intended as a means for people of all ages to have free access to the game. Regardless of its online approach, the opening of the game was designed as an offline introductory experience. This caused technical issues for the developers: online game processing was divided between online servers and the hardware, while the opening relied entirely on the hardware, resulting in slowdown issues that needed addressing. [...] "Kid's Time" [...] offered a solution to the third constraint. The game made use of Square Enix's Crystal Tools game engine, making it the only Square Enix game outside the Final Fantasy series to make use of it. Cloud saves were used in place of USB storage as that would have taken up too much space on the Wii hardware and made it potentially impossible for players to store either saves or other downloaded games.|$|E
