This descriptive analysis indicates that the <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> of the major integrated oil companies are lower, on average, during periods of extremely high gas and oil prices (and, in fact, are even lower than in times of extremely low gas and oil prices). Large oil companies are most profitable during periods of moderate gasoline prices.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the structural {{consequences of the}} post- 1980 outward-orientation on the market concentration and accumulation patterns in the Turkish manufacturing industries. Using various panel data procedures over twenty-nine subsectors of Turkish manufacturing for the 1980 - 1996 period, we focus on three sets of issues: (1) the effect of openness {{on the extent of}} market concentration as measured in CR 4 ratios; (2) the behavior of <b>gross</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> (markups) in relation to openness, concentration ratios, and real wage costs; and (3) the behavior of sectoral real investments (by destination) in relation to the <b>profit</b> <b>margins,</b> real wage costs, and the openness indicator. Our results suggest very little structural change in the sectoral composition and nature of market concentration and behavior of <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> under the post- 1980 structural adjustment reforms and outward-orientation. We find that, contrary to expectations, "openness" had very little impact, if any, on <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> (markups), and, within manufacturing, the trade-adjusting sectors reveal a positive relationship between the <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> and openness. <b>Profit</b> <b>margins</b> are found to be positively and significantly related to concen- © 2002 M.

The dependence of optimal competitive effort allocations on {{factors such as}} <b>gross</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margins,</b> relative effectiveness of effort, and attraction elasticity of effort is studied. Two versions of the model are developed. In the first version, effort budgets of both competitors are exogenously fixed. In the second, the competitors each choose both budget levels and allocations. In each version of the model, an important function of the parameters, called the competitive advantage ratio, indicates when it is optimal to either increase or decrease effort allocated in a market in response to changes in various measures of effectiveness. Implications of differences in the cost associated with each competitor's budget on equilibrium allocations are derived. market share attraction game, Nash equilibrium, sensitivity analysis...|$|R
