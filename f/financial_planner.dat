Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified <b>Financial</b> <b>Planner</b> Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $20million in debt.|$|E
5|$|Turley {{began working}} as a <b>financial</b> <b>planner</b> in 1957, by selling life insurance. He also {{operated}} a bowling alley in Bel Air, Maryland, and an insurance firm in Baltimore. In 1977, Turley joined with Arthur L. Williams, Jr. and five others to found A. L. Williams & Associates, an insurance company. At A. L. Williams, agents advised clients to purchase term life insurance, rather than cash value life insurance, and invest the money they saved in mutual funds. The company became Primerica Financial Services, and was later bought out by Citigroup in 1989. He retired from the business in 2001, and sold half of his business to his son {{and the other half}} to Lynn Webb, a senior national sales director.|$|E

From Perth, Scarff made his first-class debut in a Sheffield Shield match against Victoria in February 1970, the last match of the 1969–70 season.

Scarff's three other first-class matches came early in the following Sheffield Shield season. Elevated to the opening position with Chadwick, he failed to score heavily, and did not play at state level again. At grade cricket level, Scarff played for Melville, and served as the club's captain-coach for the 1974–75 season. After retiring from playing, {{he worked for a}} time as a <b>financial</b> <b>planner,</b> and later moved to Geraldton, where he opened a management training and consulting firm.|$|E

25|$|In {{a famous}} murder case, the Rolex on Ronald Platt's wrist {{eventually}} led to the arrest of his murderer, Albert Johnson Walker—a <b>financial</b> <b>planner</b> who had fled from Canada when he was charged with 18 counts of fraud, theft, and money laundering. When the body was found in the English Channel in 1996 by a fisherman named John Coprik, a Rolex wristwatch was the only identifiable object on the body. Since the Rolex movement had a serial number and was engraved with special markings every time it was serviced, British police traced the service records from Rolex and identified the owner of the watch as Ronald Platt. In addition, British police were able to determine the date of death by examining the date on the watch calendar. Since the Rolex movement was fully waterproof and had a reserve of two to three days of operation when inactive, they were able to determine the time of death within a small margin of error.|$|E

There he was tasked with acquiring properties, but having arrived at the height of what he identified as a real estate bubble, he argued that, [...] "at that price we should be selling, not buying". In 1988, he helped to negotiate the sale of the chain for $2.3 billion in cash (a price to earnings ratio of 52) to the Saison Group, in what he later described as [...] "the deal of the decade". Even before the bubble burst, it was suggested that the Japanese company was overpaying for the chain; one analyst described their valuation of Intercontinental as [...] "off the chart". Saison sold the chain in 1998 for $2.8 billion, having added a further 87 hotels.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Job {{satisfaction}} {{has been}} the subject of a considerable body of research. In this study, the authors examine job satisfaction among <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> in Australia, a relatively new profession which {{has been the}} subject of very little research. Method/Approach - A national survey of <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> was conducted, using a sample of convenience drawn from websites of two large organisations in the financial and insurance industry employing, or having agency agreements with, <b>financial</b> <b>planners.</b> A job satisfaction questionnaire designed for Australian conditions was used. Findings - Based on a literature review, hypotheses were examined regarding the relationship between job satisfaction and age, job tenure, gender and type of employing organisation, and between job satisfaction and motivation. Results of this survey indicated little correlation between job satisfaction and age, gender, tenure or type of employing organisation. On the other hand, a positive relationship between job satisfaction and motivation was evident. Practical implications – Respondents comments helped elucidate reasons for <b>financial</b> <b>planner’s</b> job satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Observations provided indicators that may help management nurture a positive job response among employees. Value of this paper – Practically, this paper contributes to an underdeveloped area of research. It highlights scope for future research in two particular fields. Firstly, in-depth case studies to explore more thoroughly issues of job satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Secondly, with access to a larger number of employed <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> a comparative study between those and self-employed <b>financial</b> <b>planners</b> on the subject of job satisfaction may enlighten managers and the profession generally. <br /...|$|R
