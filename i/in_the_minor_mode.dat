These sections begin on an E minor chord, which, in Roman numeral analysis, represents a v minor in the tonic of A and an iv minor {{in the new}} key.

500|$|... "Good Vibrations" [...] begins without {{introduction}} in {{a traditional}} verse/refrain format, opening with Carl Wilson singing the word [...] "I", a triplet quaver before the downbeat. The sparse first verse contains a repetition of chords played on a Hammond organ filtered through a Leslie speaker; underneath is a two-bar Fender bass melody. This sequence repeats once (0:15), but {{with the addition of}} two piccolos sustaining over a falling flute line. For percussion, bongo drums double the bass rhythm and every fourth-beat is struck by either a tambourine or a bass-drum-and-snare combination, in alternation. The beat projects a triplet feel despite being in 4/4 time; this is sometimes called a [...] "shuffle beat" [...] or [...] "threes over fours". The chord progression used is i–VII–VI–V, also called an Andalusian cadence. Although the verses begin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> <b>mode</b> of E, the mode is not used to express sadness or drudgery. Occurring {{at the very end of}} these verses is a passing chord, D.|$|E

40|$|Western-enculturated {{listeners}} {{use different}} tonal schemas when listening to major versus <b>minor</b> <b>mode</b> (e. g., C. L. Krumhansl and E. J. Kessler, 1982, Tracing <b>the</b> dynamic changes <b>in</b> perceived tonal organization in a spatial representation of musical keys, Psychological Review, Vol. 89, pp. 334 – 368). To avoid possible tonal ambiguity, {{one might expect}} composers to attempt to disambiguate or clarify the mode soon after a work begins. The major mode {{is the most common}} tonal schema in Western music, so listeners might expect that an unknown work will be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major mode. This suggests that composers might tend to cue listeners sooner when presenting works <b>in</b> <b>the</b> (rarer) <b>minor</b> <b>mode.</b> <b>In</b> this article, we report on 2 studies that test the hypothesis that mode-defining pitches occur earlier for minor-mode works. Surprisingly, the studies do not support this hypothesis: in fact, mode-defining scale tones (mediant and submediant) appear significantly later in notated music than in scrambled versions of the same scores, regardless of the mode. Repercussions of the results are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> US <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> <b>mode</b> or {{scale is}} {{considered}} a variant of <b>the</b> major, while <b>in</b> German theory it is often considered, per Riemann, the inversion of <b>the</b> major. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 18th and early 19th centuries {{a large number of}} symmetrical chords and relations were known as [...] "dualistic" [...] harmony. The root of a major chord in root position is its bass note, but, symmetrically, the 'root' of a minor chord in root position is the fifth (for example CEG and ACE). The plus and degree symbols, + and , are used to denote that the lower tone of the fifth is <b>the</b> root, as <b>in</b> major, +d, or <b>the</b> higher, as <b>in</b> <b>minor,</b> d. Thus, if the major tonic parallel is the tonic with the fifth raised a whole tone, then <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> tonic parallel is the tonic with the US root/German fifth lowered a whole tone.|$|R

But not so, when this light shines downward into the understanding; for there it is always, more or less, refracted, and differently in every different individual; and it must be re-converted into life to rectify itself, and regain its universality, or 'all-commonness, Allgemeinheit', as the German more expressively says. Hence in faith and charity the church is catholic: so likewise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fundamental articles of belief, which constitute the right reason of faith.

5000|$|<b>In</b> music theory, <b>the</b> key of a {{piece is}} a group of pitches, or scale upon which a music {{composition}} is created in classical, Western art, and Western pop music. The group features a tonic note and its corresponding chords, also called a tonic or tonic chord, providing a subjective sense of arrival and rest and also has a unique relationship to the other pitches of the same group, their corresponding chords, and pitches and chords outside the group. Notes and chords other than <b>the</b> tonic <b>in</b> a piece create varying degrees of tension, resolved when the tonic note or chord returns. The key may be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major or <b>minor</b> <b>mode,</b> although major is assumed in a phrase like [...] "this piece is in C". Popular songs are usually in a key, and so is classical music during the common practice period, around 1650-1900.

Obesity-associated phenotypes, which included the level of BMI, plasma glucose, hemoglobin A 1 c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure, were not associated with the rs 7566605 genotype.

50|$|From the Baroque to the Romantic period, {{augmented}} sixth chords {{have had}} the same harmonic function: as a chromatically altered predominant chord (typically, an alteration of ii, IV, vi7 or their parallel equivalents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> <b>mode)</b> leading to a dominant chord. This movement to the dominant is heightened by the semitonal resolution of both 6 to 5 and 4 to 5; essentially, these two notes act as leading-tones. This characteristic has led many analysts to compare the voice leading of augmented sixth chords to the secondary dominant V of V {{because of the presence of}} 4, the leading-tone of V, in both chords. In the major mode, the chromatic voiceleading is more pronounced because of the presence of two chromatically altered notes, 6, as well as 4, rather than just 4 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{functional}} {{single nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) 309 T/G within mouse double minute 2 (MDM 2) gene {{has been linked to}} onset and outcome of disease in tumors. Two published studies have shown discordant results regarding the effect of this SNP on age at diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma (CM) in Caucasian female populations. Here, we examined the age at diagnosis and clinical associations of CM with SNP 309 and the related polymorphism, p 53 Arg 72 Pro, in an Italian population (249 CM patients and 291 cancer-free controls) composed of women and men. MDM 2 intronic region of 294 bp was directly sequenced, whereas Arg 72 Pro SNP was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. No associations were found among the SNP 309, Arg 72 Pro, risk of CM, age at diagnosis and presence of metastasis in total subjects and when stratified according to the gender. The SNP 309 was significantly associated with tumor Breslow thickness. <b>The</b> P-value <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> allele recessive <b>mode</b> was 0. 02, and the odds ratio (OR) adjusted for gender and age was 3. 11 (95 % confidential interval (CI) = 1. 21 - 8. 00).

5000|$|The tenor recitative {{is again}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> <b>mode,</b> {{this time to}} {{describe}} the fragility of man.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the propagation of}} electromagnetic waves in a cylindrical waveguide with an arbitrary cross section filled with a nonlinear material.

50|$|Contrastingly, {{changes of}} mode, which would involve the {{alteration}} of the third, and mode mixture, are often analyzed as minor or trivial changes unless structurally supported because the root and overall key and tonality remain unchanged. This {{is in contrast}} with, for instance, transposition. Transposition is done by moving all intervals up or down a certain constant interval, and does change key, but does not change mode, which requires the alteration of intervals. The use of triads only available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> <b>mode,</b> {{such as the use}} of A-major in C major, is relatively decorative chromaticism, considered to add color and weaken sense of key without entirely destroying or losing it.|$|E
50|$|The {{augmented}} sixth interval {{is typically}} between the sixth degree {{of the minor}} scale (henceforth 6) and the raised fourth degree (henceforth 4). With standard voice leading, the chord is followed directly or indirectly by some form of the dominant chord, in which both 6 and 4 have resolved to the fifth scale degree (henceforth 5). This tendency to resolve outwards to 5 is why the interval is spelled as an augmented sixth, rather than enharmonically as a minor seventh (6 and 5). Although augmented sixth chords are more common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> <b>mode,</b> they are also used {{in the major mode}} by borrowing 6 of the parallel minor scale.|$|E
5000|$|... "Mediant" [...] also {{refers to}} a {{relationship}} of musical keys. For example, relative to the key of A (natural) minor, the key of C major is the mediant, and often serves as a mid-way point between I and V (hence the name). Tonicization or modulation to the mediant is quite common in pieces written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minor</b> <b>mode,</b> and usually serves as the second theme group in sonata forms, since {{it is very easy}} to tonicize III in minor (no need to alter notes). Tonicization of III in major is quite rare in classical harmony, compared with, say, modulation to the V in major, but mediant tonicization in major is an important feature of late romantic music.|$|E
