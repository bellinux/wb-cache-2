5000|$|Grips {{are usually}} made of firm or soft plastic, foam, gel, or {{sometimes}} leather, depending on expected use or desired price. They may be simply smooth and round or molded {{to fit the}} shape of a human hand better. Foam grips can be applied by submerging them under water and then inflate them with [...] air while massaging them onto the handlebar. A quick way of fitting foam grips is to spray the ends of the bars liberally with hair spray and then slide on the grips and adjust their rotation quickly; leaving them alone, the hair spray will soon fix them in position. Plastic grips can be heated in water and punched onto the handlebar. Finally, a small amount of <b>isopropyl</b> (rubbing) <b>alcohol</b> may be applied to the bar surface during removal or installation of grips in order to provide lubrication, which when allowed to dry, leaves no residue.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{oleaginous}} {{composition and}} alcohol used in transesterification have substantial impact on biodiesel properties. This study involves palm oil and its crystallization fractions, olein and stearin oils, with methyl, ethyl, <b>isopropyl</b> and benzyl <b>alcohols,</b> as {{we seek to}} investigate {{the influence of the}} alcohol on the cold properties, thermal stability, density and viscosity of the resulting biofuel. The products were characterized by GC and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Biofuels produced from the olein oil fraction have superior cold properties compared to those synthesized from palm oil and the palm stearin oil fraction; these properties are attributable to the higher unsaturated contents, which cause the isopropyl biodiesel from palm to exhibit a higher cold filter plugging point (0. 3 °C). The use of benzyl alcohol yields a biofuel with high thermal stability but also high viscosity and density values that do not adhere to any international specifications for biodiesel...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in metal/ceramic bonding {{for a wide range}} of applications from electronic packaging to biomedical implants. In this research work, results are reported for direct bonding of copper to ceramic (e. g., Al 2 O 3 and ZrO) in a furnace under inert atmosphere (e. g., N 2 and Ar 2). Other, metals such as Cu, Ni, SS- 316 were directly bonded to ceramics (e. g., α- Al 2 O 3, sapphire) using laser heating (e. g., 247 nm and 10. 6 μm wavelengths) in the presence of N 2 atmosphere. Cu flakes have bean bonded to industrial alumina ceramic and sapphire in the presence of methyl, ethyl and <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> using a CO 2 laser. All these experiments were performed by heating the metal or metal-organic media member for a sufficient time in order to create a metal-metal oxide eutectic melt at the interface with the ceramic substrate. ^ Thermal wave imaging (TWI) was used to investigate the bonding at the metal/ceramic interface. It was found that the method of direct bonding of metals to ceramics using lasers performed better than the furnace. The properties of the copper bonded layer on alumina ceramic was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Also, the elemental distribution at the metal/ceramic interface was analyzed, using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). With the help of x-ray diffraction (XRD), the phase present at the copper/industrial alumina ceramic interface was determined to be CuAl 2 O 4. This was different from the CuAlO 2 phase found at the copper/sapphire interface for the furnace bonding case. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was also used to investigate the aspects of metal/ceramic interfaces. It was found that the samples processed by furnace heating and by laser beam heating have a diffused transition interface. The electron diffraction patterns revealed the phase present at the interface (Cu/α- Al 2 O 3) to be a cubic one, with the CuAl 2 O 4 crystallographic structure. The TEM images show that the samples heated using excimer laser have an amorphous top copper layer. The HRTEM images of the samples heated with the excimer laser beam under N 2 atmosphere revealed that the inter-atomic spacing at the Cu/α Al 2 O 3 interface region to be 0. 365 nm in average. In order to investigate inter-diffusion between the copper layer and the sapphire and also to measure the percentage of diffused of copper in sapphire, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) was performed. Based on heat transfer theory and on diffusion theory, a model was derived to explain and predict the behavior of furnace and laser beam bonding of metals to ceramics. The predictions of the model were in agreement with the experimental percentage values of diffused copper in sapphire obtained in the RBS investigations. Experimental investigations and the theoretical model concluded that the direct bonding phenomenon is a thermal effect. The direct bonding phenomenon is similar to transient liquid phase bonding (TLP). The major advantage of direct bonding is that no filler element is required between the metallic member and the ceramic substrate. Finally, the method of direct bonding of metals to ceramics using laser beam is capable of directly drawing a metallic pattern on a ceramic substrate. ...|$|R

40|$|As optical, active, {{semiconductor}} devices are miniaturized to the wavelength scale, many applications of cavities, lasers, and detectors become possible. In {{order to make}} such devices useful in real-world applications one must first understand how these devices behave when they are reduced in size and what technological barriers must be overcome. In this dissertation several thrusts are presented toward the investigation and application of microscale active semiconductor cavities. Work is divided into four thrusts: fluid sensing based on surface sensitive quantum cascade lasers, hybridization of surface plasmon modes and waveguide modes as well as lasing in near-infrared subwavelength microdisks, quantum dot based cavities for strong coupling, and nascent work on optomechanical tuning of active cavities. In all four thrusts design and fabrication techniques are used to overcome challenges and capitalize on reduced scale. Progress in fabrication, design, and testing of surface sensitive quantum cascade lasers is presented. Work focuses on increasing surface sensitivity by modifying the metal contacts on top of active material originally intended {{to be used with}} a surface plasmon waveguide. An experiment where <b>isopropyl</b> and ethyl <b>alcohol</b> is differentiated based on laser behavior is carried out. Work toward integration of semiconductor lasers with fluidic delivery systems is explored. Work then turns to the intimate and advantageous inclusion of metal into subwavelength strained quantum well microdisk lasers in the near-infrared. Optical and thermal characteristics are simulated. Hybridization of surface plasmon mode and waveguide whispering-gallery modes is simulated and experimentally verified. Lasing behavior of such small devices is investigated. In parallel, work toward improving the probability of achieving a strongly coupled quantum dot microdisk cavity system is carried out. Improvements in fabrication techniques and potential metal integration makes this project a natural extension of the subwavelength microdisk laser project. Finally, a new project is discussed where the above projects are combined with investigation of optomechanical systems currently ongoing in our lab. Work toward the combination of active optical cavities with optomechanical devices will lead to wide band wavelength tuning functionality. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{haloform}} reaction {{can also}} occur inadvertently in domestic settings. Bleaching with hypochlorite generates halogenated compounds in side reactions; chloroform {{is the main}} byproduct.

They used peroxyacetic acid, quaternary ammonium compound, <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> refrigeration gel and a granular compound to disinfect the parts of the apparatuses.

25|$|Although the {{cassettes}} {{themselves were}} relatively durable, the players required regular maintenance to perform properly. Head cleaning may {{be done with}} long swabs, soaked with <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> or cassette-shaped devices that could be inserted into a tape deck to remove buildup of iron-oxide from the heads, tape-drive capstan, and pinch-roller. Some otherwise normal recording tapes included sections of leader that could clean the tape heads. One of {{the concerns of the}} time however was the use of abrasive cleaning tape. Some of the cleaning tapes actually felt rough to the touch and were considered damaging to the heads. Similarly shaped demagnetizers used magnets to degauss the deck, which kept sound from becoming distorted (see Cassette demagnetizer).|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these degradation products in the fuel tank, fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components {{makes it harder to}} start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup {{may or may not be}} eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits, <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, or other additives. Fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is seasonal (low to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.|$|E
25|$|In {{electron}} beam lithography (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist is exposed to a beam of high-energy electrons. There is {{the choice of a}} positive or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists. Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to follow along the surface of the material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as electron scattering in the resist and backscattering from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, {{as is the case in}} tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation. To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, <b>isopropyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patters in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and solvent casting. In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2µm wide and 400 and 800nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.|$|E
