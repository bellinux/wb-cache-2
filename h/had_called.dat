5|$|Despite Nerva's {{measures}} to remain {{popular with the}} Senate and the Roman people, support for Domitian remained strong in the army, which <b>had</b> <b>called</b> for his deification immediately after the assassination. In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard, Nerva had dismissed their prefect Titus Petronius Secundus—one of the chief conspirators against Domitian—and replaced him with a former commander, Casperius Aelianus.|$|E

Prosecutor Camporini reported at the trial that the building had experienced several gas leaks before the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{for a new}} two-tier {{stand to}} the north and east were {{presented}} next. The plans <b>had</b> <b>called</b> for 24,500 sitting places in the new and south stands, and 5,500 standing places in the west stand. However, in 1989, the plans were modified, as the FIFA made new rules, requiring that only seating places could be used for international qualification matches from 1992. It was thereby decided that Ullevaal would become an all-seater.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{proposal}} <b>had</b> <b>called</b> for 22units, {{to replace}} {{all of the}} Kolsås and Holmenkoll Line stock. However, the Sognsvann and Røa Line was upgraded to metro standard between 1992 and 1995, and could start using T1000 stock with only third-rail support. At the time, the eastern network used third-rail, while the western network used overhead wire. The upgrade used non-utilised stock, so the order for T2000 was reduced to 12units.|$|E

5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff <b>had</b> <b>called</b> on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough {{and that they would}} have to make terms.|$|E

At 1:30pm, following two failed counter-attacks, South Vietnamese units in Phuoc Lam deserted from the battlefield. In the mean time, however, South Vietnamese troops in Tien Phuoc could bare held their ground with support from two A-37 bombers, after South Vietnamese commanders on the ground <b>had</b> <b>called</b> for reinforcement from Chu Lai. By 4:00pm, Tien Phuoc was captured by the VPA 2nd Division.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Rhine Campaign of 1795 the {{two sides}} <b>had</b> <b>called</b> a truce. Despite the truce, both sides planned for war. In a decree on 6 January 1796, Lazare Carnot gave Germany {{priority}} over Italy as a theater of war. The First French Republic's finances were in poor shape so its armies would be expected to invade new territories and then live off the conquered lands. Knowing that the French planned to invade Germany, on 20 May 1796 the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May, and prepared for invasion.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, 239 {{political}} parties {{at both the}} state and national level had pledged some form of direct election, and 33 states had introduced the use of direct primaries. Twenty-seven states <b>had</b> <b>called</b> for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.|$|E

5|$|By May 1942, Conant {{felt that}} the S-1 Committee had become too unwieldy. It had not met since the March meeting. When he needed expert advice in May, he <b>had</b> <b>called</b> upon a smaller group, and he {{recommended}} that this supervise the OSRD work, mainly the technical and contractual aspects of the project, while the Army handled engineering, construction and site selection. Procurement was an OSRD responsibility, but it could turn to the Army for help in case of difficulties. Bush obtained the president's approval for this, and on June 19, 1942, he abolished the S-1 Section {{and replaced it with}} the S-1 Executive Committee. Conant was appointed as its chairman, and Briggs, Compton, Lawrence, Eger Murphree, and Urey as its other members.|$|E
5|$|Hasan {{proceeded}} to bombard Acre, and Zahir's Maghrebi artillerymen responded with cannon fire, damaging two of Hasan's ships. The following day, Hasan's fleet fired roughly 7,000 shells against Acre without returning {{fire from the}} city's artillerymen; al-Dinkizli <b>had</b> <b>called</b> on his Maghrebi forces to refrain from returning fire because as Muslims they were forbidden from attacking the sultan's military. Realizing his long-time deputy commander's betrayal, he attempted to flee Acre on 21 August or 22 August. As he departed its gates, he was fired on by Ottoman troops, with a bullet striking his neck and causing him to fall off his horse. A Maghrebi soldier then decapitated him. Zahir's severed head was subsequently delivered to Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|In the Politburo Podgorny {{could count}} on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Podgorny was {{constantly}} in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues in the Politburo. When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, Podgorny was pleased about his position within the leadership, and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 <b>had</b> <b>called</b> {{for the expansion of}} Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E

50|$|The Stop Coal {{campaign}} <b>has</b> <b>called</b> for {{a moratorium}} {{on the construction of}} any new coal plants and for the phase out of all existing plants, citing concern for global warming.
