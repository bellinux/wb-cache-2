Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy. It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate might be very low.|$|E

Information on seed biology and germination cues of keystone species is lacking, particularly in arid Australia; a major zone for mining developments. This study investigated seed characteristics and germination of 18 common species required for rehabilitation of disturbed areas at Shark Bay Salt in the Shark Bay World Heritage Area, Western Australia. Untreated seeds of seven species (Aphanopetalum clematideum, Atriplex bunburyana, Austrostipa elegantissima, Melaleuca cardiophylla, Pembertonia latisquamea, Rhagodia baccata, Salsola tragus) exhibited high <b>germination</b> <b>percentages.</b> Seeds of two species (Acacia tetragonophylla, Stylobasium spathulatum) had low imbibition, which increased with hot-water treatment, hence require scarification for germination.

50|$|The {{results of}} a {{germination}} test are commonly expressed as germinative capacity or a <b>germination</b> <b>percentage,</b> which is the percentage of seeds that germinate {{during a period of}} time, ending when germination is practically complete. During extraction and processing, white spruce seeds gradually lost moisture, and total germination increased. Mittal et al. (1987) reported that white spruce seed from Algonquin Park, Ontario, obtained the maximum rate (94% in 6 days) and 99% total germination in 21 days after 14-week pre-chilling.

50|$|Spot seeding of {{coniferous}} seed, including white spruce, has had occasional success, {{but several}} constraining factors commonly limit germination success: the drying {{out of the}} forest floor before the roots of germinants reach underlying moisture reserves; and, particularly under hardwoods, the smothering of small seedlings by snow-pressed leaf litter and lesser vegetation. Kittredge and Gervorkiantz (1929) determined that removal of the aspen forest floor increased <b>germination</b> <b>percentage</b> after the second season in seed spots of both white pine and white spruce, in 4 plots, from 2.5% to 5%, from 8% to 22%, from 1% to 9.5%, and from 0% to 15%.|$|E

Effects of seed production environments on germination salt tolerance were also studied using F₂ generations of 12 sorghum hybrids produced under full-season irrigation, limited irrigation, and double-cropping conditions. Germination tests were conducted in a growth chamber, on trays, while the emergence test was conducted in a greenhouse in flats filled with sand. The experiments were conducted under non-saline and saline conditions in randomized complete block designs. Artificial seed aging resulted in significant reductions in <b>germination</b> <b>percentages</b> under both non-saline and saline environments.

We investigated whether robustness or plasticity in response to environmental cues were more commonly exhibited by exotic than native species during germination, evidenced by (1) exhibiting consistently greater germination rate {{under a variety of}} conditions (robustness), or (2) increasing germination rate more strongly than native species in response to favorable conditions (plasticity). We conducted growth chamber germination trials of 12 native and 12 exotic species common to coastal sage scrub, a shrub-dominated Mediterranean-type ecosystem in California. Time to <b>germination</b> and <b>percentage</b> <b>germination</b> were recorded in response to variation in three environmental cues: temperature, day length, and soil moisture. Exotic species, especially annuals, displayed consistently higher <b>germination</b> <b>percentages</b> and more rapid germination than native species. Exotic <b>germination</b> <b>percentages</b> also responded more strongly when conditions were favorable (warm temperatures and high soil moisture), and germinated earlier than natives when conditions were indicative of typical growing season conditions in Mediterranean ecosystems (short day length and cool temperatures). Exotic species had more rapid and prolific germination across a variety of environmental cues and in response to increased resource availability compared with native species, indicating both germination plasticity and robustness. These traits may enable colonization of novel environments, particularly if they allow exotic species to establish earlier in the growing season than native species, setting the stage for seasonal priority effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Acacia melanoxylon (Mimosoideae or Mimosaceae) is a {{high quality}} timber tree with an {{extensive}} natural distribution in Australia and a wide genetic and phenotypic diversity. Seeds from three widely differing provenances in Tasmania were tested {{to determine whether they}} had different responses to various dormancy-breaking treatments. All provenances had limited germination (< 11 %) if seeds were untreated and between 85 % and 91 % germination after 40 days if the seeds were nicked. For all provenances short (60 s) exposure to boiling water gave high <b>germination</b> <b>percentages.</b> These values were generally lower, although usually not significantly so, than the <b>germination</b> <b>percentages</b> following nicking. <b>Germination</b> <b>percentages</b> decreased with increasing time of exposure to boiling water, although one provenance had a significantly greater tolerance to one of the longer (20 min) treatments. Nicked seeds germinated quickly and uniformly, whereas those subjected to the boiling-water treatments germinated after a longer period andmore gradually. In untreated seeds, the lenswas a low, elliptically shaped dome (~ 110 – 135 mmwide, 140 – 190 mmlong). Inmore than 99 %of the seeds examined, the structure of the lens was markedly altered after a 10 -s exposure to boiling water. A wide diversity of altered lens structure was found, from a circular hole between the macrosclereids, to a short fissure where themacrosclereids did not separate to their bases. Nicked seeds had a 200 – 375 times greater area for water uptake than a fully disrupted lens and this was probably the principal reason why the nicked seeds germinated sooner and more rapidly...|$|R
