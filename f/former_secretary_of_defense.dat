25|$|In July 2000, Pataki's name {{surfaced}} on {{the short}} list to be the running mate for Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, along with the names of Governor John Engler of Michigan, Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, former Senator John Danforth of Missouri, and former U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina. Bush eventually selected the man {{who was in charge of}} scouting vice presidential candidates, <b>former</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> Dick Cheney. Pataki had strongly campaigned for Bush including an unsuccessful effort to keep John McCain off the New York primary ballot (which Bush ultimately won).|$|E
25|$|Bush asked <b>former</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> Dick Cheney {{to head up}} a team to help {{select a}} running mate for him, but ultimately, Bush decided that Cheney himself should be the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not {{specifically}} disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it does prohibit electors from casting both {{of his or her}} votes for persons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney—who had been a resident of Texas for nearly 10 years—changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush would have forfeited their electoral votes from the Texas electors.|$|E

Rumsfeld stated that he believed LaRouche had had no influence whatsoever on the program, and surmised that Baluyevsky must have obtained the information off the Internet.

25|$|The {{military}} {{increased its}} presence on campus to churn out recruits from the officer training corps.

25|$|Incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton was ineligible {{to serve}} a third term due to term {{limitations}} in the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution, and Vice President Gore was able to secure the Democratic nomination with relative ease.

Bush chose <b>former</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> Dick Cheney as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his. Both major party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Clinton and Gore often did not campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from the Lewinsky sex scandal two years prior.|$|E
