5|$|As the {{existing}} supply of M2A3 gun shields was <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> meet {{requirements for the}} production of the M3, the Ordnance Department developed the M5 gun shield, which replaced the M2A3. The new design was designated as the M3A1 Gun Motor Carriage.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the nature}} of memorial, the {{surrounding}} hills are a popular summer hiking and winter sledding and skiing location. Although Germany supplies annual funding for memorial maintenance, it is <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> fund regular police patrols and surveillance. The memorial and gravestones have been vandalised several times, each time attracting media attention.|$|E

5|$|Evidence is <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> support use of many {{of these}} compounds, {{including}} echinacea, eleuthero, L-lysine, zinc, monolaurin bee products, and aloe vera. While a number of small studies show possible benefit from monolaurin, L-lysine, aspirin, lemon balm, topical zinc, or licorice root cream in treatment, these preliminary studies have not been confirmed by higher-quality randomized controlled studies.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{termination}} of the Army's evaluation, Radioplane, as a private venture, conducted an improvement program for the RP-77D, fitting the aircraft with a larger wing, along with other modifications that improved {{the performance of the}} drone. However these improvements were <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> produce a renewed interest from the Army.|$|E
5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the Oval {{was bombed}} in the Belfast blitz, {{destroying}} both grandstands and leaving a crater in the pitch. As a result, {{the ground was}} flooded repeatedly by the Connswater River; the water pumps were <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> drain the pitch. Grosvenor Park {{was used as a}} temporary home for Glentoran, until August 1949. In 1953 the main grandstand was built.|$|E
25|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation, {{which is}} a somewhat well established treatment for depression, has been proposed, and used, {{as a treatment for}} autism.

5|$|The Aruban prosecutor's office {{attempted}} {{to obtain an}} arrest warrant for Van der Sloot based on the tapes; however, a judge denied the request. The prosecutor appealed the denial, but the appeal failed on February 14, 2008.

5|$|The {{conscription}} of German men at {{the start}} of the war created a manpower shortage in German factories important for the war effort. From 1915, the Germans encouraged Belgian civilians to enlist voluntarily to work in Germany but the 30,000 recruits of the policy proved <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> meet demands.|$|E

5|$|The {{deportation}} of Belgian workers proved <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> meet German industrial {{needs and}} had little effect economically.

In late 1917, under pressure from neutral powers, most of the Belgian deported workers were returned.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem was}} known about before the accident; {{a letter from the}} {{infrastructure}} company Railtrack in December 1999 warned that the existing Railtrack Line Specification was <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> guard against this type of fatigue.

5|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{junctions}} on the A303. These range from motorway-style free-flowing junctions such as that with the A36 near Wylye, to simple forks on the single carriageway sections. Some junctions, such as the Countess Roundabout with the A345 near Amesbury, are known congestion hotspots because they are <b>insufficient</b> <b>to</b> cope with traffic.|$|E

A fourth complaint was then also considered and Alistair Webster again reported (on 22 December 2013) that there was <b>insufficient</b> evidence <b>to</b> proceed any further.
