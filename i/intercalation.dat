40|$|In {{zebrafish}} early development, blastoderm cells undergo extensive radial <b>intercalations,</b> triggering {{the spreading}} of the blastoderm over the yolk cell and thereby initiating embryonic body axis formation. Now reporting in Developmental Cell, Song et al. (2013) demonstrate a critical function for EGF-dependent E-cadherin endocytosis in promoting blastoderm cell <b>intercalations...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{vertebrate}} gastrulation, convergence {{and extension}} (C&E) movements narrow and lengthen the embryonic tissues, respectively. In zebrafish, regional differences of C&E movements have been observed; however, the underlying cell behaviors are poorly understood. Using time-lapse analyses and computational modeling, we demonstrate that C&E of the medial presomitic mesoderm {{is achieved by}} cooperation of planar and radial cell <b>intercalations.</b> Radial <b>intercalations</b> preferentially separate anterior and posterior neighbors to promote extension. In knypek;trilobite noncanonical Wnt mutants, the frequencies of cell <b>intercalations</b> are altered and the anteroposterior bias of radial <b>intercalations</b> is lost. This provides evidence for noncanonical Wnt signaling polarizing cell movements between different mesodermal cell layers. We further show using fluorescent fusion proteins that during dorsal mesoderm C&E, the noncanonical Wnt component Prickle localizes at the anterior cell edge, whereas Dishevelled is enriched posteriorly. Asymmetrical localization of Prickle and Dishevelled to the opposite cell edges in zebrafish gastrula parallels their distribution in fly, and suggests that noncanonical Wnt signaling defines distinct anterior and posterior cell properties to bias cell <b>intercalations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Similar to graphite, various molecules, such as NH3 or alkali metals, can be {{intercalated}} into hexagonal boron nitride, that {{is inserted}} between its layers. Both experiment and theory suggest the <b>intercalation</b> {{is much more}} difficult for BN than for graphite.|$|E
5|$|The planar {{aromatic}} chromophore {{portion of}} the molecule intercalates between two base pairs of the DNA, while the six-membered daunosamine sugar sits in the minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the <b>intercalation</b> site, as evidenced by several crystal structures.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by <b>intercalation</b> and {{inhibition}} of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E

30|$|Unit 1 (comprising {{the upper}} approx. 51 cm) was {{composed}} mostly of silty sand with <b>intercalations</b> of sandy silt. Laminations were poorly preserved and shells were less abundant {{than in the}} lower unit. No distinct boundary was observed between the units, and the lower boundary was selected in conjunction with changes in geochemistry. The {{upper part of the}} unit contains sandy <b>intercalations</b> of several cm-thick. The lowest sand content was found at a depth of 20 – 30 cm.|$|R
5|$|Hapticity {{is a term}} to {{describe}} the coordination {{of a group of}} contiguous atoms of a ligand bound to the central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character eta, η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were bound to a d0-metal center through a η7-hapticity. Vaporization of the graphite <b>intercalation</b> compounds graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C82. Electron spin resonance studies indicated the formation of Y3+ and (C82)3− ion pairs. The carbides Y3C, Y2C, and YC2 can be hydrolyzed to form hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Uncommon {{magnetic}} properties (spin glass state) {{were observed in}} diamond nanocrystals intercalated with potassium. Unlike paramagnetic host material, magnetic susceptibility measurements of intercalated nanodiamond revealed distinct ferromagnetic behavior at 5 K. This is essentially different from results of potassium <b>intercalation</b> in graphite or C60 fullerene, and shows that sp3 bonding promotes magnetic ordering in carbon. The measurements presented first experimental evidence of intercalation-induced spin-glass state in a nanocrystalline diamond system.|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called <b>intercalation.</b> Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at evidencing {{the thesis}} that Markan interpretative <b>intercalations</b> are a {{narrative}} structure that manifests profound theological engagement of the evangelist. This device is defined as an entanglement of two storylines in the A 1 –B–A 2 pattern which by using the notions of simultaneity, contrast, irony, similarity, etc. offers a wholly novel meaning of the stories. Six <b>intercalations</b> of the St Mark’s gospel – 3 [*]:[*] 20 – 35; 5 [*]:[*] 21 – 43; 6 [*]:[*] 7 – 31; 11 [*]:[*] 12 – 23; 14 [*]:[*] 1 – 11, 53 – 72 – merge different episodes with distinct theological purposes and as such cannot be reduced {{to the rank of}} a literary or redactional device. All of them are concerned with the most essential topics of the Markan theology, such as Christology, especially in relation to suffering, requirements of true discipleship, vision of the future ecclesiastical community. St Mark in his <b>intercalations</b> reveals his elaborated, clear-cut theology, as well as narrative ingenuity and mastery...|$|R

30|$|The basal Belaga Formation is of Upper Cretaceous–Upper Eocene. It is lithologically {{characterized}} by thick shale unit with thin sandstone <b>intercalations.</b> Liechti et al. (1960) estimated its thickness {{to range from}} ca. 5000 – 8000 m. It {{is believed to be}} deposited in a deep-marine environment, owing to the presence of well-developed shale rock (Peng et al. 2004; Bakar et al. 2007). Sia and Abdullah (2012 a) described the sandstone <b>intercalations</b> present within the Belaga Formation as deepwater turbidites, thereby justifying its marine environment of deposition (EOD). Five distinctive end members of the Belaga Formation; the Layar, Kapit, Pelagus, Metah, and Bawang members have been identified and mapped (Fig.  4).|$|R

25|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>intercalation</b> marked an important break from Islam, as under the Islamic calendar {{the practice of}} <b>intercalation</b> had been specifically prohibited in the Qur'an.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many stories to {{interpret}} the <b>intercalation,</b> a period of 22 or 23 days is always ¾ synodic month. Obviously, the month beginning shifts forward (from the new moon, to the third quarter, to the full moon, to the first quarter, back the new moon) after <b>intercalation.</b>|$|E
25|$|These <b>intercalations</b> were {{determined}} at meetings {{of a special}} committee of the Sanhedrin. But Constantius II, following the precedents of Hadrian, prohibited the holding of such meetings {{as well as the}} vending of articles for distinctly Jewish purposes.|$|R
25|$|Rabbinic {{tradition}} ascribes to him an enactment {{which proved}} of incalculable benefit to his coreligionists {{of his own}} and of subsequent generations. The Jewish calendar is lunisolar. That is, its months are synchronized with the phases of the moon, but its average year length approximates the mean length of a solar year. The purpose of the latter is to ensure that the festivals, all of which occur on fixed dates of the lunar months, are also observed each year in the seasons designated for them in the Bible. To ensure the former, occasional <b>intercalations</b> of a day in a month were required; to ensure the latter, occasional <b>intercalations</b> of an extra month in a year were required.|$|R
5000|$|If {{too many}} <b>intercalations</b> were omitted, as {{happened}} after the Second Punic War and during the Civil Wars, the calendar would drift out of alignment with the tropical year. Moreover, because <b>intercalations</b> were often determined quite late, the average Roman citizen often {{did not know the}} date, particularly if he were some distance from the city. For these reasons, the last years of the pre-Julian calendar were later known as [...] "years of confusion". The problems became particularly acute during the years of Julius Caesar's pontificate before the reform, 63-46 BC, when there were only five intercalary months (instead of eight), none of which were during the five Roman years before 46 BC.|$|R

25|$|Interestingly, {{different}} from other alkali metals, the amount of Na <b>intercalation</b> is very small. Quantum-mechanical calculations show that this originate from a quite general phenomenon: among the alkali and alkaline earth metals, Na and Mg generally have the weakest chemical binding to a given substrate, compared with the other elements in {{the same group of}} the periodic table. The phenomenon arises from the competition between trends in the ionization energy and the ion–substrate coupling, down the columns of the periodic table. However, considerable Na <b>intercalation</b> into graphite can occur in cases when the ion is wrapped in a solvent shell through the process of co-intercalation.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{tries to}} {{characterize}} and evaluate clay, lacustrine and diatomaceous earth deposits of Lake Ashenge basin, near Koram, northern Ethiopia {{and comment on}} its industrial implications. The country rocks are dominantly basalts and basaltic agglomerates overlain by minor amounts of rhyolite and ignimbrite. Sedimentary deposits, clays and associated sediments include 1) <b>intercalations</b> of lacustrine diatomaceous earth, other lacustrine and clays with channel deposits (gravel, pebbly sand and silt); 2) <b>intercalations</b> of diatomaceous earth, peat and clays with channel deposits exposed; and 3) <b>intercalations</b> of clay with channel deposits. X-ray diffractometer analysis of clay samples indicates kaolinite as a dominant clay mineral among others. On {{the basis of the}} abundance of different minerals, the clays are subdivided into four groups, 1) Kaolinite (K), 2) Microcline-Kaolinite (MK), 3) Muscovite-Kaolinite (MuK), and 4) Muscovite-Microcline-Kaolinite (MuMK). Other minor mineral phases include quartz, vermiculite, low-high albite, calcite and calcite magnesia. Diatomaceous clays are almost free from kaolinite. Kaolinite, being the dominant clay mineral varies from 6 % in light brown to 77 % in light grey clays. Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 dominate the clay geochemistry among other oxides an...|$|R

25|$|Pseudocapacitance – Storage is {{achieved}} by redox reactions, electrosorbtion or <b>intercalation</b> {{on the surface of}} the electrode or by specifically adsorpted ions that results in a reversible faradaic charge-transfer. The pseudocapacitance is faradaic in origin.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{effect of}} ethidium bromide on trypanosomas {{is caused by}} shift of their kinetoplastid DNA to Z-form.

25|$|In sum, {{both systems}} are about 24 minutes per year {{ahead of the}} actual {{tropical}} year; the systems' methods of <b>intercalation</b> fixes only their internal error; and Thandeikta slightly accelerates the annual drift. The accumulating error means the New Year's Day which used to fall near the vernal equinox at its launch in 638 now falls on 17 April in 2013—a drift of 15 days, (after adjusting to the Julian and Gregorian calendar switch). Burmese calendarists {{have dealt with the}} issue by using apparent reckoning and periodically modifying the <b>intercalation</b> schedule in the Metonic cycle.
