5|$|Crawford {{established}} {{a reputation as}} an outstanding cricketer while still a schoolboy. He played Test cricket for England before he was 21 years old, and successfully toured Australia with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1907–08. He played only 12 matches for England, although critics believed {{he had a great}} <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sport and was a potential future England captain. In two successive English seasons, he completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in first-class games.|$|E
5|$|Martha was {{described}} as being friendly, feisty and fun loving. Martha's appearance has evolved throughout her time in the show: she was initially a tomboy who loved sport, but she later became a stylish woman. Upon her return in March 2005, Martha's storylines saw her surviving a helicopter crash, having an abortion and a miscarriage, battling alcoholism, being {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} and becoming a widow after her husband was shot. In a controversial storyline Martha worked as a pole dancer; the scenes were criticised by the broadcasting regulator for their content. Whilst playing Martha, Gordon {{was at the center of}} a number of personal scandals, which put her <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> show in doubt. In January 2010, it was announced that Gordon was leaving the show and Martha departed on 9 June 2010.|$|E

5|$|On 4 April 1718 England, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) {{selected}} Don Carlos of Spain, {{the elder}} child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir (with {{no mention of}} Anna Maria Luisa). By 1722, the Electress was not even acknowledged as heiress, and Cosimo {{was reduced to a}} spectator at the conferences for Tuscany's <b>future.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> midst of this, Marguerite Louise, Anna Maria Luisa's mother, died.

5|$|Smuts's {{religious}} observance was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook was based exclusively upon Biblical teachings {{and who was}} destined for a <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Church. Yet, though religion continued to serve in this central role, his studies at Stellenbosch, with their decidedly scientific bias, led Smuts towards a more critical examination of his faith.

5|$|The {{events of}} Mortal Kombat II, {{along with the}} first Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat 3 (including its expansions), were later retold in the 2011 {{fighting}} game Mortal Kombat, which was as an effective reboot of the series. In it, Raiden uses time travel to revisit the tournaments from the original games in the series in order to change the <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of Armageddon. The ladder/arcade mode of this game can follow the same order of bosses as in MKII (with Shang Tsung, Kintaro and Shao Kahn as the final three opponents, although Goro will often be the ninth opponent instead of Kintaro) and its controls and Fatality system are most reminiscent of MKII. Classic costumes from MKII were also brought back as alternate outfits for female ninja characters in the PlayStation Vita version.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} <b>future,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year 2039, where humans have begun deep space exploration. A {{distress}} call is transmitted from a crippled ship near an alien planet. The game's protagonist, a special soldier, responds to the call. Upon boarding the ship, the soldier discovers it has been overrun by hostile aliens. The aliens have captured the human crew for an unknown purpose. The story has sections that take place aboard the space craft and on the planet's surface. The protagonist's overall goal is to rescue as many human hostages as possible, eliminate the alien threat, and escape the space craft.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} {{subsequently}} visited by many government and whaling ships sailing between New South Wales and Norfolk Island {{and across the}} Pacific, including many from the American whaling fleet, so its reputation as a provisioning port preceded settlement, some ships leaving goats and pigs on the island as food for future visitors. Between July and October 1791 the Third Fleet ships arrived at Sydney and within days the deckwork was being reconstructed for a <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lucrative whaling industry. Whale oil was to become Australia's most profitable export until the 1830s, {{and it was the}} whaling industry that shaped Lord Howe Island's early history.|$|E

To many Social Credit MLAs, Aberhart's greater offense was bypassing them, the people's elected representatives. This was especially irksome in view of social credit's political philosophy, which favoured technocratic rule and held that elected representatives' only legitimate function was channelling the public desire; by appealing directly to Social Credit members, Aberhart appeared to be denying the MLAs even this role. In the legislature, Conservative leader David Duggan called for Aberhart's resignation; {{in a move that}} Brennan reports shocked the assembly, his call was endorsed by Social Credit backbencher Albert Blue.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, Harvey {{was facing}} serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal {{had died in}} 1903 and was interred in a {{mausoleum}} in Monte Ne. His other son, Tom, had left in 1908 never to return. The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend William Jennings Bryan failed {{to find a place}} for him in the new Woodrow Wilson administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also gone out of business. Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning that the end of civilization was at hand. In February 1920, he published Common Sense, in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a pyramid.|$|E
5|$|By March 1808, Jennings {{believed}} that his <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Harrison-dominated {{western part of}} the territory was bleak. By November he had left Vincennes and moved to Jeffersonville, in Clark County, Indiana Territory, before settling in nearby Charlestown. Jennings may have believed his political future would have more success {{in the eastern part of}} the territory. Settlements in the southeast and eastern portion of the territory opposed slavery and Harrison's aristocratic manner, which were similar to Jennings's beliefs, while the western portion of the territory and Vincennes area remained proslavery. Although petitions to allow slavery were received before the formation of the Indiana Territory, the issue attracted widespread attention in 1807 when Harrison and his supporters in the territorial legislature revived efforts to allow slavery in the territory. Jennings and his supporters who opposed slavery wrote writing articles appearing in the Vincennes Western Sun newspaper attacking Harrison's administration, its pro-slavery sentiments, and aristocratic policies.|$|E

He is assisted by Lt Cdr Jenny Howard (played by Emily Hamilton), who is initially his temporary XO, but eventually accepts Brooke's offer to stay on the ship. Lieutenant Commander William Lewis, the Marine Engineering Officer (played by Ian Bartholomew), is the superior of Charge Chief Marine Engineering Artificer (CCMEA) Andy Fellows (played by Steve Speirs) and Lewis's refusal to give the engines full maintenance regularly infuriates him, though not as much as LMEA Dave Finnan (played by Paul Chequer) who has just had a baby with his daughter Teresa (played by Chloe Howman).

5|$|Dickinson {{went through}} knee surgery during the offseason, {{but there was}} still concern about whether he had a <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL. That was set aside when he was {{considered}} to be progressing well in his recovery as of early July 1977. During the Buccaneers' offseason, the quarterbacks on the roster changed entirely, with Dickinson being the only holdover; Gary Huff was now the starter, and Dickinson was fighting for a backup role alongside Mike Boryla and Randy Hedberg. After the Buccaneers lost Boryla and Huff to injuries, the former for the season, Dickinson ended up being the starting quarterback for the team's final preseason game against the Bills. In the game, Dickinson completed 2 of 12 passes for -2yards and was sacked three times in a 176 loss. A week after the game against the Bills, Dickinson was released by the Buccaneers along with four other players. The Buccaneers re-signed him after Huff got injured in late October, but Dickinson was again released a couple weeks later.|$|E
5|$|In Bergkamp's {{second season}} at Inter, the club changed {{managers}} again, appointing Ottavio Bianchi. Bergkamp endured a disappointing campaign, troubled with stress injuries and fatigue from the 1994 World Cup. He managed to score 5 goals in 26 appearances. Off the field, Bergkamp's {{relationship with the}} Italian press and fans became uncomfortable. His shy persona and his propensity to go home after matches was interpreted as apathy. Because of his poor performance on the pitch, one Italian publication renamed their award given to the worst performance of the week, L'asino della settimana (Donkey of the Week) to Bergkamp della settimana. Inter ended the league season in sixth position and failed to retain the UEFA Cup, with the club eliminated in the second round. In February 1995, the club was purchased by Italian businessman and fan Massimo Moratti, who promised to invest heavily in the squad. Bergkamp's <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first team was uncertain following the signing of Maurizio Ganz {{a month after the}} takeover.|$|E

5|$|Jan Smuts {{was born}} in 1870, the second son of a {{traditional}} Boer farming family. By rural tradition, the eldest son {{would be the only}} child to receive a full formal education; however, on the death of his elder brother in 1882, 12-year-old Jan was sent to school for the first time. After four years of education he had made exceptional progress, gaining admission to study at Victoria College in Stellenbosch. He graduated in 1891 with first-class honours in Literature and Science. With this strong academic background, he applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study, electing to read Law at Christ's College, Cambridge. After further academic success, and the recipient of many prestigious academic awards, he graduated in 1894 with double First-class honours. After graduating, Smuts passed the examinations for the Inns of Court, entering the Middle Temple. In 1895, despite the prospect of a bright <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, the homesick Smuts returned to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to operate out of Genoa, intercepting and inspecting merchantmen and cutting-out suspicious vessels in both enemy and neutral harbours. Nelson formulated ambitious plans for amphibious landings and naval assaults to frustrate {{the progress of}} the French Army of Italy that was now advancing on Genoa, but could excite little interest in Hotham. In November Hotham was replaced by Sir Hyde Parker but the situation in Italy was rapidly deteriorating: the French were raiding around Genoa and strong Jacobin sentiment was rife within the city itself. A large French assault at the end of November broke the allied lines, forcing a general retreat towards Genoa. Nelson's forces were able to cover the withdrawing army and prevent them from being surrounded, but he had too few ships and men to materially alter the strategic situation, and the British were forced to withdraw from the Italian ports. Nelson {{returned to}} Corsica on 30 November, angry and depressed at the British failure and questioning his <b>future</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> navy.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1950 {{there was}} no widely {{accepted}} fossil evidence of life before the Cambrian period. When Charles Darwin wrote The Origin of Species he acknowledged {{that the lack of}} any fossil evidence of life prior to the relatively complex animals of the Cambrian was a potential argument against the theory of evolution, but expressed the hope that such fossils would be found in the <b>future.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1860s there were claims of the discovery of pre-Cambrian fossils, but these would later be shown not to have an organic origin. In the late 19th century Charles Doolittle Walcott would discover stromatolites and other fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life, but at the time the organic origin of those fossils was also disputed. This would start to change in the 1950s with the discovery of more stromatolites along with microfossils of the bacteria that built them, and the publication of a series of papers by the Soviet scientist Boris Vasil'evich Timofeev announcing the discovery of microscopic fossil spores in pre-Cambrian sediments. A key breakthrough would come when Martin Glaessner would show that fossils of soft bodied animals discovered by Reginald Sprigg during the late 1940s in the Ediacaran hills of Australia were in fact pre-Cambrian not early Cambrian as Sprigg had originally believed, making the Ediacaran biota the oldest animals known. By the end of the 20th century, paleobiology had established that the history of life extended back at least 3.5 billion years.|$|E
