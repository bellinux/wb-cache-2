5|$|A {{number of}} Holden's early designs were for hospitals, which Adams' {{practice}} specialised in. At {{this early stage}} in his career, he produced <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> a variety of architectural styles as circumstances required, reflecting the influences {{of a number of}} architects. Holden soon took charge of most of the practice's design work. From 1900 to 1903, Holden studied architecture in the evenings at the Royal Academy School. He also continued to produce <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> his spare time for his brother-in-law and Jonathan Simpson.|$|E

5|$|The simpler {{roots of}} <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> Generation I {{prompted}} greater complexity in later games. <b>Designs,</b> <b>in</b> general, {{have become increasingly}} complex and thematic in newer games. Sneasel, for example, draws inspiration from the Japanese yōkai kamaitachi, mythical creatures with fast, razor-sharp claws that hunt in packs. These elements are all found in Sneasel's design and characteristics. New Pokémon introduced in Generation VI, for example, are heavily influenced by the culture and fauna of Europe (namely France). However, by the release of X and Y in 2013, Sugimori stated he wishes for Pokémon design {{to return to the}} simpler roots of the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Chrisye {{chose his}} own costumes {{and at times}} experimented with {{different}} colours and <b>designs.</b> <b>In</b> all his music videos he preferred to wear the same style of shirt, quipping {{in an interview with}} Kompas that he would only wear a different one if he had fallen into a ditch.|$|E
5|$|Early <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> the 1940s and 1950s {{started by}} using steel as a {{resonator}} material. This {{has given way}} to nickel-iron alloys, primarily to maximise the Q since this is often the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter resonators and their Q are shown in the table.|$|E

5|$|Given its mythical {{connection}} with sailing and orchids, the name Pleione is {{often associated with}} grace, speed and elegance. Some of the finest <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> racing yachts have the name Pleione, and the recent Shanghai Oriental Art Center draws its inspiration from an orchid. Fat Jon in his new album Hundred Eight Stars has a prismatic track dedicated to 28 Tauri.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accuracy}} {{was important}} to many British designers, resulting {{in the use of}} genuine military equipment as models for memorials, and long discussions with committees over the details to be incorporated into <b>designs.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, the British interest in accurately depicting real weaponry from the war was far less common on German monuments, where usually stylised medieval weapons and armour were used.|$|E
5|$|The Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, {{submitted}} three <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> early April 1892 and {{the smallest}} one was chosen on 11 April.

It was the first battleship to use Harvey armour, which allowed the secondary casemates to be armoured, {{the first to use}} a sloping armour deck and the first to provide armoured shields over the main armament.|$|E

5|$|The Forth Valley Royal Hospital was {{designed}} by Equion, a subsidiary of Laing O'Rourke, and Keppie <b>Designs</b> <b>in</b> cooperation with builders Laing O'Rourke.

5|$|Though {{the ships}} were poorly armored {{compared}} to foreign <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> general, the ships' underwater protection {{was the greatest}} weakness in the armor scheme. The torpedo bulkhead was placed {{too close to the}} outer hull, which reduced its ability to absorb damage. This weakness {{played a central role in}} the loss of both España to grounding in 1923 and the sinking of Alfonso XIII by a single mine in 1937.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern <b>designs,</b> <b>in</b> many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|E

The writing materials in a scholar's private study, including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood, were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal.|$|E
5|$|Decades {{of efforts}} to {{eradicate}} or simply thin the rat population in the system have been unsuccessful. In March 2009, the Transit Authority announced a series of changes to its vermin control strategy, including new poison formulas and experimental trap <b>designs.</b> <b>In</b> October 2011, the MTA announced a new initiative to clean 25 subway stations, along with their garbage rooms, of rat infestations. Also in October 2011, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in the subways by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative is being tested at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations. As of March 2016, stations along the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and various other stations had their garbage cans removed due {{to the success of}} the program.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
