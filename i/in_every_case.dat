5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted Bede's report of Coenred's and Offa's abdications, but Barbara Yorke {{has suggested that}} they may not have relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery. On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then the apparently friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his overlord, makes it clear that the relationship between an overlord and his underking was not hostile <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) {{is found}} <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>case</b> of PD, and {{is due to}} {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>case,</b> peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|E

25|$|Bertrand's {{point in}} {{constructing}} this example {{was to show}} that merely counting cases is not always proper.

25|$|MSA usually {{progresses}} {{more quickly}} than Parkinson's disease. There is no remission from the disease. The average remaining lifespan after the onset of symptoms in patients with MSA is 7.9 years.

Rate of progression differs <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>case</b> and speed of decline may vary widely in individual patients.|$|E
25|$|For instance, in Joule's experiment, {{the initial}} {{system is a}} tank of water with a paddle wheel inside. If we isolate the tank thermally, and move the paddle wheel with a pulley and a weight, we can relate the {{increase}} in temperature with the distance descended by the mass. Next, the system is returned to its initial state, isolated again, and {{the same amount of}} work is done on the tank using different devices (an electric motor, a chemical battery, a spring,...). <b>In</b> <b>every</b> <b>case,</b> the amount of work can be measured independently. The return to the initial state is not conducted by doing adiabatic work on the system. The evidence shows that the final state of the water (in particular, its temperature and volume) is the same <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>case.</b> It is irrelevant if the work is electrical, mechanical, chemical,... or if done suddenly or slowly, {{as long as it is}} performed in an adiabatic way, that is to say, without heat transfer into or out of the system.|$|E
