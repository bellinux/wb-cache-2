50|$|Money {{is usually}} not seen as a {{qualification}} that {{is attached to a}} specific person as token money is taken to have a value on its own.

Credentials are a proof of qualification that is attached to a person. E-Coins are given to individuals, who cannot pass them on to others, but can only spend them with merchants. As long as they spend a coin only once, they are anonymous, but should they spend a coin twice, they become identifiable and appropriate actions can be taken by the bank. This commonality, the binding to an individual, is why <b>digital</b> <b>cash</b> and digital credentials share many commonalities.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theoretical framework}} for exploring the role of new technologies for ‘banking’ the poor via mobile banking (m-banking) for financial inclusion in developing countries. It extends the literature beyond previous studies that examined m-banking through a technological or economic lens from the provider’s perspective, or from a collective national or regional level focussing on the individual user’s perspective. Thus {{the aim of the}} paper is to bridge the theoretical and methodological gap by justifying the application of Orlikowski’s Duality of Technology, as a socio-technical lens to evaluate how the social construction of m-banking enables and constrains poor women to access government-to person (G 2 P) payments, or <b>digital</b> social <b>cash</b> in Pakistan- a country that has been previously under researched. By shifting the level of analysis to the organisational level, the structuration framework helps us investigate the social and economic impact of m-banking in the restructuring of poor households for financial inclusion in Pakistan, and the effect of external and internal institutional forces in the redesign of emerging new technologies and financial practices. Furthermore, the paper debates why the socio-materiality of technology fails to provide a conceptual framework for this research. To conclude the paper highlights how the Duality of Technology contributes to new knowledge through a socio-technical perspective that underpins the philosophical orientation of the research to study the complex relationship between m-banking, households structures and social actors that provide an interpretive frame within the case study of the Benazir Income Support Programme in Pakistan...|$|R

MMT simpliﬁes banking relationships and facilitates ﬁnancial inclusion, and, therefore, is rapidly expanding all around the world, especially in developing countries. MMT systems {{are subject to the}} same controls as those required for ﬁnancial institutions, including the detection of Money Laundering (ML) - a source of concern for MMT service providers. In this paper we focus on an often practiced ML technique known as micro-structuring of funds or smurﬁng and introduce a new method for detection of fraud chains in MMT systems. Whereas classical detection methods are based on machine learning and data mining, this work builds on Predictive Security Analysis at Runtime (PSA@R), a model-based approach for event-driven process analysis. We provide an extension to PSA@R which allows us to identify fraudsters in an MMT service monitoring network behavior of its end-users. We evaluate our method on simulated transaction logs, containing approximately 460, 000 transactions for 10, 000 end-users, and compare it with classical fraud detection approaches.
