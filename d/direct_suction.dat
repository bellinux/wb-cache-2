500|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is {{the most}} common approach in unblocking the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a fiberoptic tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of Vater and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making a cut in the sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the common bile duct; alternatively or additionally, the common bile duct orifice can be dilated with a balloon. Stones may be removed either by <b>direct</b> <b>suction</b> or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical lithotriptor in order to crush the stone prior to removal. Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. This technique uses acoustic shock waves administered outside the body to break down the stones.

40|$|Meconium {{staining}} of {{amniotic fluid}} (MSAF) {{is a common}} problem occurring in 11 to 22 % of all deliveries. Meconium aspiration Pneumonia (MAP) complicates approximately 2 % of these deliveries with a reported mortality rate of as high as 405. Hypoxia in utero provokes a diving reflex, by which blood flow is redistributed toward vital organs, with corresponding decrease in blood flow to gut. Ischemia of the gut results in hyperperistalsis and relaxation of anal sphincter that results passage of meconium. As long as the fetus dose not become acidetic, aspiration does not occur. However, if there is more severe hypoxia, gasping in utero will lead to aspiration of meconium. If meconium is not removed form trachea after delivery, {{with the onset of}} respiration it will migrate from the central airways to the periphery of the lung. MAP consist of a triad of a) Meconium stained liquor, b) Presence of meconium in trachea, and c) Radiological changes. In patients with thin meconium staining and a normal fetal heart rate, oro-and naso-pharynx should be suctioned by the obstetrician prior to delivery of the shoulders; visualization of pharynx and intubation will not be necessary.

A media consumption theory is presented based on velocity distribution in both <b>direct</b> and <b>suction</b> peening. Beads at velocities greater than that which is optimum for imparting compressive stresses to the part being peened, will fracture. Thus, adjustment in velocity distribution patterns at equivalent mass media flow rate could reduce both peening times and media consumption.

40|$|SummaryThe {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to report a rare case with a large brain abscess related to central nervous system immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and to discuss the operative strategy for it. Brain abscess with HIV co-infection {{is considered to be}} a critical infectious condition that requires neurosurgical intervention. The presentation of IRIS may worsen the patient’s condition after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, especially in IRIS of the central nervous system. Only a few cases of IRIS-related brain abscess have been reported in the current literature, with discussion of the operative strategy. A 30 -year-old man was diagnosed with HIV infection in 2007 and he developed right-sided convulsion episodes in 2008. His first brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed two intracranial cysts, and his symptoms were well controlled by anticonvulsant treatment. He also initiated antiretroviral therapy in the same year. However, his neurological conditions gradually worsened with sensory loss, weakness, visual impairment on the right side, as well as motor aphasia. A CT scan in 2011 revealed a well-encapsulated, hypodense 8  cm ×  9  cm intracranial lesion in the left frontal parietal lobe with a 3 -cm midline shift. Surgery was performed with a combination of <b>direct</b> <b>suction</b> and quick-suturing of the incision. The abscess capsule was enucleated completely. After surgical removal, he recovered well and remains functional at work in the following year with only minor neurological sequelae. In conclusion, this case illustrates well the clinical course of brain abscess resulting from IRIS in Swaziland, where the prevalence rate of HIV infection is relatively high and delay in diagnosis and treatment is common. The use of a modified excision method for HIV co-infection brain abscess may be considered the operative strategy, with a probable good outcome in such a resource-limited area as Swaziland...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the use of Tono-Pen XL in measuring IOP during the application of a suction ring in rabbit eyes with manometrically controlled IOP. Methods Tono-Pen XL was calibrated against direct manometry in 10 rabbit eyes. A suction ring was then applied in 4 rabbit eyes and the IOP was determined manometrically during suction ring application at 350 mmHg vacuum pressure. Finally, in 6 catheterized rabbit eyes the IOP was measured with Tono-Pen XL during suction ring application at suction vacuum from 350 to 650 mmHg, while keeping actual IOP stable at 30 mmHg and 60 mmHg. Results Linear regression analysis revealed that the Tono-pen XL was reliable for IOPs between 10 and 70 mmHg (R 2 = 0. 9855). <b>Direct</b> manometry during <b>suction</b> ring application showed no statistically significant variation of Tono-Pen XL readings when the incanulation manometry intraocular pressure changed from 30 mmHg to 60 mmHg and no statistically significant correlation between suction vacuum and IOP measurements.

The patients studied included 18 with bullous pemphigoid (BP), nine with cicatricial pemphigoid (CP), three with acquired epidermolysis bullosa (EBA) and 7 hybrid cases. The patterns of IMF in the suction blisters were: BP, epidermal 1, dermal 1, combined 4, negative 12; CP, epidermal 1, dermal 2, negative 6; EBA, dermal 2, negative 1; and 'hybrid' patients, epidermal 3, negative 4. The different patterns of suction blister staining {{could not be}} correlated with the clinical features of the patients in respect of mucous membrane involvement, scars or milia or a history of skin fragility.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to apply combined experimental and computational modeling to investigate unsteady sheet/cloud cavitating flows. In the numerical simulations, a filter-based density corrected model (FBDCM) is introduced to regulate the turbulent eddy viscosity in both the cavitation regions on the foil and in the wake, which is shown to be critical in accurately capturing the unsteady cavity shedding process, and the corresponding velocity and vorticity dynamics. In the experiments, high-speed video and particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique are used to measure the flow velocity and vorticity fields, as well as cavitation patterns. Results are presented for a Clark-Y hydrofoil fixed at an angle of attack of α = 8 deg at a moderate Reynolds number, Re = 7 × 105, for both subcavitating and sheet/cloud cavitating conditions. The results show that for the unsteady sheet/cloud cavitating case, the formation, breakup, shedding, and collapse of the sheet/cloud cavity lead to substantial increase in turbulent velocity fluctuations in the cavitating region around the foil and in the wake, and significantly modified the wake patterns. The turbulent boundary layer thickness is found to be much thicker, and the turbulent intensities are much higher in the sheet/cloud cavitating case. Compared to the wetted case, the wake region becomes much broader and is <b>directed</b> toward the <b>suction</b> side instead of the pressure side for the sheet/cloud cavitation case. The periodic formation, breakup, shedding, and collapse of the sheet/cloud cavities, and the associated baroclinic and viscoclinic torques, are shown to be important mechanisms for vorticity production and modification.

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of applying unsaturated soil mechanics to geotechnical engineering design {{has been well}} understood. However, the consumption {{of time and the}} necessity for a specific laboratory testing apparatus when measuring unsaturated soil properties have limited the application of unsaturated soil mechanics theories in practice. Although methods for predicting unsaturated soil properties have been developed, the verification of these methods {{for a wide range of}} soil types is required in order to increase the confidence of practicing engineers in using these methods. In this study, a new permeameter was developed to measure the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils using the steady-state method and directly measured suction (negative pore-water pressure) values. The apparatus is instrumented with two tensiometers for the <b>direct</b> measurement of <b>suction</b> during the tests. The apparatus can be used to obtain the hydraulic conductivity function of sandy soil over a low suction range (0 – 10 kPa). Firstly, the repeatability of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurement, using the new permeameter, was verified by conducting tests on two identical sandy soil specimens and obtaining similar results. The hydraulic conductivity functions of the two sandy soils were then measured during the drying and wetting processes of the soils. A significant hysteresis was observed when the hydraulic conductivity was plotted against the suction. However, the hysteresis effects were not apparent when the conductivity was plotted against the volumetric water content. Furthermore, the measured unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions were compared with predictions using three different predictive methods that are widely incorporated into numerical software. The results suggest that these predictive methods are capable of capturing the measured behavior with reasonable agreement...|$|R
40|$|A {{vast amount}} {{and variety of}} mine {{tailings}} are produced around the world each day. In the gold¬mining industry in South Africa the residue of crushed are is disposed of in large tailings or hydraulic fill dams. The outer walls of these dams are built up of layers of material, {{each of which is}} allowed to dry before the next layer is placed. In order to study the stability of these walls, the appropriate engineering properties of the tailings must be ascertained. Due to the construction technique used in tailings dam construction, the outer walls are in an unsaturated state, which also means that suctions are generated within the tailings. Various techniques exist to measure suction, most of which are indirect methods. The recent development of the mid-¬plane suction probe at the University of Pretoria created the opportunity of measuring suctions directly on desiccating samples of gold mine tailings. A test method has been developed from which soil mechanics parameters can be derived from suction measurements. The experimental programme consisted of a series of these newly developed tests on fine and coarse samples of gold mine tailings, as well as on different particle size ranges. The experimental results were used {{in the development of a}} new method of predicting the air-entry value, with only the grading of the tailings known. A new method of predicting the soil-water characteristic curve up to the air-entry value was also proposed. The results of the research showed that the tailings remain saturated up to the air-entry value. The clay, fine silt and medium silt sized tailings was found to be the controlling particle size ranges in the development of suctions. The vast amount of parameters and information gained through the use of the proposed test method clearly indicates its effectiveness in studying the performance and characteristics of a material drying from saturation.

40|$|Early {{ontogeny}} {{is a time}} {{of rapid}} anatomical and behavioral development in most organisms. The degree of synchrony between form and function during this period, and the concomitant performance consequences, can strongly impact individual survival. Understanding the development of feeding during early ontogeny is important because nutrient acquisition universally influences organismal biology. A one-year, longitudinal feeding study was conducted for two elasmobranch species that were selected for their disparate morphology, behavior, and habitat: the whitespotted bambooshark Chiloscyllium plagiosum and the leopard shark Triakis semifasciata. To quantify changes in cranial morphology, external attributes of the feeding apparatus were measured weekly. Additionally, specimens were dissected to examine trends in the growth of select muscles and the volume of the buccal cavity. To quantify feeding behavior, individuals were observed weekly using high-speed digital cameras as they consumed various food types. Suction performance was evaluated using particle image velocimetry and <b>direct</b> measurements of <b>suction</b> pressure. The cranial morphology of C. plagiosum exhibited primarily isometric growth while the cranial morphology of T. semifasciata was dominated by allometric growth. Allometric increases were noted in the cross-sectional area of every muscle examined in both species, though the primary hyoid depressor, the coracohyoideus, hypertrophied to a greater degree in C. plagiosum. Although intra-individual differences throughout ontogeny complicated comparison, modulation in response to food attributes was clearly evident in T. semifasciata but broadly absent in C. plagiosum. Over ontogeny C. plagiosum generated allometrically greater suction while T. semifasciata generated relatively less. The shape of the parcel of water ingested during feeding did not change over ontogeny in either species. The capacity to perform diverse feeding behaviors thro ughout ontogeny is not constrained in T. semifasciata but tends to be stereotyped and accompanied by enhanced performance in C. plagiosum. A functionally generalized feeding apparatus and repertoire may benefit T. semifasciata by allowing the use of diverse feeding behaviors in variable environments, such as estuaries, over ontogeny. Morphological and behavioral conservation of the feeding apparatus throughout ontogeny, however, may allow C. plagiosum to exploit taxonomically varied crevice-dwelling reef organisms using a single specialized behavior...|$|R
40|$|On linear and {{nonlinear}} {{instability of}} the incompressible swept attachment-line boundary layer VASSILIOS THEOFILIS a 1 a 1 DLR, Institute for Fluid Mechanics, Division Transition and Turbulence, Bunsenstraße 10, D- 37073 Göttingen, Germany Abstract The stability of an incompressible swept attachment-line boundary layer flow is studied numerically, within the Görtler–Hämmerlin framework, {{in both the}} linear and nonlinear two-dimensional regimes in a self-consistent manner. The initial-boundary-value problem resulting from substitution of small-amplitude excitation into the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and linearization about the generalized Hiemenz profile is solved. A comprehensive comparison of all linear approaches utilized to date is presented and it is demonstrated that the linear initial-boundary-value problem formulation delivers results in excellent agreement with those obtained by solution of either the temporal or the spatial linear stability theory eigenvalue problem for both zero suction and a layer in which blowing is applied. In the latter boundary layer recent experiments have documented the growth of instability waves with frequencies in a range encompassed by that of the unstable Görtler–Hämmerlin linear modes found in our simulations. In order to enable further comparisons with experiment and, thus, assess {{the validity of the}} Görtler–Hämmerlin theoretical model, we make available the spatial structure of the eigenfunctions at maximum growth conditions. The condition on smallness of the imposed excitation is subsequently relaxed and the resulting nonlinear initial-boundary-value problem is solved. Extensive numerical experimentation has been performed which has verified theoretical predictions on {{the way in which the}} solution is expected to bifurcate from the linear neutral loop. However, it is demonstrated that the two-dimensional model equations considered do not deliver subcritical instability of this flow; this strengthens the conjecture that three-dimensionality is, at least partly, responsible for the observed discrepancy between the linear theory critical Reynolds number and the subcritical turbulence observed either experimentally or in three-dimensional numerical simulations. Further, the present nonlinear computations demonstrate that the unstable flow has its line of maximum amplification in the neighbourhood of the experimentally observed instability waves, in a manner analogous to the Blasius boundary layer. In line with previous eigenvalue problem and <b>direct</b> simulation work, <b>suction</b> is observed to be a powerful stabilization mechanism for naturally occurring instabilities of small amplitude...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to understand the interactions between liquid and gas flow at high degrees of saturation, as this could {{have a significant effect on}} the effectiveness of landfill remediation by flushing. Particular attention is paid to two key parametric functions that are believed to control the simultaneous flow of leachate and gas in waste materials. These are the relationship between capillary pressure or suction and the degree of leachate saturation or volumetric moisture content, known as the moisture retention characteristic; and the relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and moisture content. The thesis starts with a review of previous work on moisture retention characteristic curves and relative permeability functions for waste materials. New data from a drainage column experiment, pressure plate apparatus and hanging water column tests on mechanically and biologically treated (MBT) waste specimens are then presented and compared. The results from the drainage experiments have been interpreted using the unsaturated flow model HYDRUS- 1 D (Šim?nek et al., 2005) and the University of Southampton Landfill Degradation and Transport model LDAT (White et. al 2004). These results give support to the modelling concepts and the integrity of the code for both models and highlight the capabilities of single and dual porosity models. Use of the van Genuchten (1980) type curves to represent the moisture retention characteristics was found to be fruitful. The values of the parameters that control the shapes of these curves, and therefore the shape of the relationships between capillary pressure and moisture content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and moisture content, are reviewed using both results from the literature and results from the experimental work described in the thesis. The sensitivity of the shapes to the values of the parameters is examined as is the sensitivity of the results of numerical modelling that is based on the parameter values. The relationship of the parameter values to the material dry density is also explored. Whilst the flow in the gas phase is not central to the subject of the thesis, it has been possible to make observations on the relationship between unsaturated gas permeability and moisture content. The thesis draws attention to the fact that different experimental techniques can lead to significantly different estimates of the moisture retention characteristics. Hanging column tests show an apparently sensible variation of moisture retention curve with density and are self-consistent. However a partial or full interruption of the liquid phase within the specimen, or between the specimen and the hanging column porous plate will inhibit the drainage of liquid from the specimen, resulting in an increase in the retained moisture content at a given applied external suction. This has significant implications for the study of liquid movement in unsaturated wastes. A key recommendation from the work is that the moisture retention characteristic curve for a waste is perhaps better determined from <b>direct</b> measurements of <b>suction</b> and moisture content, as in the drainage column apparatus for the suction range 0 - 10 kPa. For higher suctions carefully set up pressure plate tests are advisable...|$|R
