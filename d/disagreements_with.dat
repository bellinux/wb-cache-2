5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should have because of <b>disagreements</b> <b>with</b> Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous <b>disagreements</b> <b>with</b> her nephew.
