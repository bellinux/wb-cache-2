5000|$|Edge Maverick is {{a member}} of the Space Reconnaissance Force (SRF). Along with {{childhood}} friend Reimi Saionji, he embarks on the first interstellar travel conducted by humanity to discover other hospitable worlds and possibly another home for <b>humanity.</b> Edge's <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> Crowe Almedio, is a Captain in the SRF and is also assigned on the mission. Departing the Lunar base, Reimi and Edge are assigned as crew members on board the [...] "Calnus", while Crowe is given command of the [...] "Aquila". Shortly after launch, the ships shift into hyperspace. However, there is a meteor shower in the middle of the path and all ships, except the Aquila, crash-land on the planet Aeos. The Captain of the Calnus, Grafton, gives Edge and Reimi the assignment of exploring the planet and searching for the other ships. While searching, the two discover a downed SRF ship and a dying crew member. He warns the two about a meteor fragment his team collected, saying that he had to kill his team because of it. Shortly after, a large monster materializes. With the help of an unknown man, they defeat the creature. The man introduces himself as be Faize Sheifa Beleth, an Eldarian and an ally of Earth. The trio head back to the Calnus, where a large base has been built by the Eldarians. It is revealed that the Eldarians and Earth have been allies for several years, and the Eldarians actually gave Earth the interstellar travel technology. With a lot to clean up, Captain Grafton gives command of his ship to Edge, with Reimi and Faize accompanying him. With a repaired Calnus, the trio head outward.|$|R
50|$|However, {{there are}} {{negative}} results {{of having a}} cross-platform <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> during adolescence. Malow-Iroff (2006) found that adolescents with a cross-platform <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> partake in smoking and drinking at higher rates than their peers who have a same-sex <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> The study discovered that individuals with cross-platform <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> find their <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> to be more accepting of substance use than those who have same-sex <b>best</b> <b>friends.</b> cross-platform <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> during adolescence may increase safety and health risks because of the higher likelihood they will use alcohol or cigarettes.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} whether age, <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> delinquency, {{and adolescent}} self-concept clarity {{were related to}} adolescents’ delinquency, and whether age and self-concept clarity moderated the relation between adolescent and <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> delinquency. Dutch adolescents (N = 497, Mage Wave 1 = 13 years, 287 boys) and their <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> participated across six waves, reporting annually on adolescent and <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> delinquency, and adolescent self-concept clarity. Adolescent delinquency linearly declined, and whereas adolescents’ and best friends' delinquency levels were related, developmental change in delinquency was not. Self-concept clarity significantly affected delinquency development between ages 16 - 18. Age and self-concept clarity did not significantly moderate the relation between adolescent and <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> delinquency, and thus did not affect adolescent susceptibility to <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> influence...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that people compare themselves with routine standards—such as their best friend—during self–evaluations (Mussweiler & Rüter, 2003). In these past studies, the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was more accessible than a former friend subsequent to self–evaluations. We therefore con-cluded that the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> {{was used as a}} routine standard. However, spreading activation from the self to the more closely associated <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> would provide an alternative explanation. In the present research, we want to rule out this possibility and demonstrate that comparison processes are responsible for the <b>best</b> <b>friend’s</b> increased accessibility. In Study 1, we con-trasted comparative self–evaluations with absolute ones. In Study 2, partic-ipants engaged either in comparative self–evaluations or in self–descriptions. Afterwards the accessibility (Study 1) or the facilitation of judgments (Study 2) of the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was assessed. Both studies support the assumption that the <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> was used as a routine standard during comparative self–evaluations...|$|R

40|$|In this three-wave {{longitudinal}} survey, {{we investigated}} bi-directional longitudinal associations between <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> and adolescents' alcohol consumption. Additionally, since {{the relation between}} <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> and adolescents' drinking may be stronger if adolescents have not consumed alcohol yet, we examined this relation not only with regard to continuation but also {{with regard to the}} initiation of adolescent drinking. We also hypothesized that low levels of self-esteem and self-control in youths would be related to a higher susceptibility to the impact of their best friends' drinking. Data were used from 433 adolescents and their <b>best</b> <b>friends.</b> Results of SEM analyses did not provide evidence for bi-directional associations between <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> and adolescents' alcohol use over time. Nevertheless, the results of additional growth curve analyses indicated that adolescents and best friends' drinking does seem to develop in a similar fashion over time. Adolescents' self-esteem, self-control, and gender did not moderate longitudinal associations between <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> and adolescents' drinking. The discussion focuses on methodological and theoretical explanations for the absence of significant longitudinal relations between <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> and adolescents' drinking...|$|R
