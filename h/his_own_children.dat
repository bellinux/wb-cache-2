5|$|Bob {{receives}} a package containing his childhood toys, which consist of {{nothing more than}} a scouring pad, a rusted spatula, and a dog-shaped soap bar. The toys make Bob recall memories of constantly working at his father's restaurant, and he realizes that his job deprived him of a normal childhood. Worried that he is doing the same to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation. In their place, he hires newly released bank robber Mickey, whom the family had previously befriended, to do various jobs around the restaurant, in exchange for free meals and shelter in the basement.|$|E
5|$|Djajakusuma {{had never}} married, but left behind several {{nieces and nephews}} whom he had raised as <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children.</b> After his death, {{newspapers}} throughout Jakarta carried obituaries by such cultural and film figures as Alisjahbana, the producer Misbach Yusa Biran, and the Perfini cameraman Soemardjono. These obituaries emphasised Djajakusuma's {{role in the development}} of the Indonesian film industry and the preservation of traditional culture. In a ceremony commemorating the fifth anniversary of Djajakusuma's death, all his documents and books were donated to the IKJ library.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children. To {{compensate}} for the lack of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> he became a doting uncle, showering gifts on his nieces and nephews. He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and their daughters to live in the home. He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.|$|E
6000|$|<b>His</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child!</b> He {{never doubted}} the tale; {{he felt it}} was true; knew it as well, now, {{as if he had been}} privy to it all along. <b>His</b> <b>own</b> <b>child!</b> And dead too. Dying beside Nicholas, loving him, and looking upon him as {{something}} like an angel. That was the worst! ...|$|R
60|$|He mused, {{and young}} Caddles and <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> and Cossar's brood mingled in his musing.|$|R
60|$|Then {{his father}} {{bowed his head}} in shame that <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> should teach him wisdom.|$|R
5|$|Of {{particular}} emphasis was the children's fascination with Maurice Richard. Montreal's star player from 1942 until 1960, Richard was a prolific goal scorer. In the 1944–45 season– {{one year before}} the events of The Hockey Sweater– Richard became the first player in National Hockey League history to score 50 goals in a 50-game season. Richard attended the 1980 premiere of The Sweater in Montreal, and according to Carrier, was moved to tears by the film. Richard also requested copies {{so that he could}} show it to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tolkien never {{expected}} his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident {{a book called}} The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children,</b> came in 1936 {{to the attention of}} Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication. When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} two verses presented {{a pair of}} observations which showed how a human father would not callously mistreat <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child.</b> This verse extends the same observations to God's response to prayer. If a flawed human father looks out for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> {{then there is no}} reason to doubt that the perfectly good God will not have the best interest of his followers in heart.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{interrupted}} Susan Nipper. 'Not once since, and he hadn't hardly set {{his eyes}} upon her before that {{for months and}} months, and I don't think he'd have known her for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> if he had met her in the streets, or would know her for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> if he was to meet her in the streets to-morrow, Mrs Richards, as to me,' said Spitfire, with a giggle, 'I doubt if he's aweer of my existence.' ...|$|R

60|$|Maurice, as usual, was provoking. He had no {{notion of}} giving up his godchild, he said, {{and he had no}} doubt that Edmund Kendal could manage <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> way.|$|R
6000|$|TARLETON. Youre not. Youre {{laughing}} at me. Serve me right! Parents and children! No man should know <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child.</b> No child should know its own father. Let the family be rooted out of civilization! Let {{the human race}} be brought up in institutions! ...|$|R

25|$|Charles Chesnutt's {{most famous}} work, The Conjure Woman, is {{strongly}} influenced by the Uncle Remus tales; he features Uncle Julius as the main character and storyteller. Chesnutt read the Uncle Remus stories to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two of Cui Yan's ex-classmates, Gongsun Fang (公孫方) and Song Jie (宋階), {{who studied}} {{together}} with him under Zheng Xuan, died early. Cui Yan adopted {{their children and}} treated {{them as if they}} were <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rod Steiger as Juan Miranda, an amoral Mexican peon {{leading a}} band of outlaws {{composed}} mostly of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children.</b> He does not care about the revolution at first, but becomes involved after his encounter with John.|$|E
6000|$|The father {{kissed his}} daughter, {{and pressed her}} to his heart; but still he said nothing: {{it was so hard}} to him to speak of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> sorrows; he was so shy a man even with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child!</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The baby (MGR) who {{was with}} the mother, escapes from their claws by the {{intervention}} of a farmer (V. Gopalakrishnan), who raises the <b>child</b> as <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> by naming him Manickam.|$|R

25|$|However, Ron Howard did {{not appear}} in this episode (in fact, no guest voices were used at all in this episode).

25|$|The {{accompanying}} {{photographs in}} this installation entitled The Labours I-X, show the naked artist bracing as she lifts {{each of the}} sculptures. The title refers to the mythical labours of Hercules that he is sentenced to after he kills <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> {{in a fit of}} rage. Chadwick's use of it suggests that attempting to encapsulate personal history is a Herculean task, requiring great strength and courage.|$|E
60|$|It had a {{separate}} being, {{but it was}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child.</b> <b>His</b> flesh and blood vibrated to it. He caught the baby to his breast with his passionate, clapping laugh. And the infant knew him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Sureflint--a parent {{would not}} know <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child,</b> when he saw {{him for the first}} time. If I am owner here, you will {{remember}} that this is my first visit to the spot." ...|$|R
50|$|Rogers took {{no offense}} to the parody. On the contrary, {{he found it}} amusing and affectionate. The parody was also {{initially}} broadcast {{at a time of}} night when <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>child</b> audience was not likely to see it.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} founders gave no {{consideration to}} the question of whether Antioch should admit students of color, neither forbidding nor explicitly allowing it. The associated preparatory school admitted two African American girls during the mid-1850s, an action one trustee responded to by resigning and removing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> from the school. His opinion was apparently the minority one, though, as the black students were not withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|During World War I he {{had been}} elected Librarian at King's College, but never took up the appointment. After the war Knox {{intended}} to resume his research at King’s, but was persuaded by his wife to remain at his secret work; indeed, so secret was this work that <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>children</b> had no idea, until many years after his death, {{what he did for}} a living, and his contribution to the war effort.|$|E
