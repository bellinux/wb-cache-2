5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about <b>how</b> <b>a</b> man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god.

The authors suggest that the effectiveness of GPS satellites for detecting nuclear explosions enhances the ability to verify compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, giving the United States more reason to ratify it.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about <b>how</b> <b>a</b> taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E

5|$|Caltech did not spell {{an end to}} Bacher's {{service in}} Washington. He served two terms {{as a member of}} the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) under President Dwight D.

During his first term he testified on behalf of his old friend at the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing in 1954. During his second, he worked with James L.

5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew <b>how</b> <b>a</b> program might learn so much information.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and <b>how</b> <b>a</b> drug or an agonist might inhibit the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not {{the last}} word on <b>how</b> <b>a</b> test-taker will do in life, nor are they the only {{information}} to be considered for placement in school or job-training programs. There is still a dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores. For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ must also be part of an individual assessment.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Einstein {{returned}} {{to the question of}} quantum mechanics. He considered <b>how</b> <b>a</b> measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other.

5|$|In 2015, Smartsheet started {{introducing}} closer integrations with Microsoft Office products, in part {{thanks to}} changes Microsoft was making in {{their products to}} work better with third-party software. In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Microsoft's identity management software Azure Active Directory, which allowed users to log into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login. Users can also now make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook. In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as <b>how</b> <b>a</b> team is performing against key performance indicators.|$|E
