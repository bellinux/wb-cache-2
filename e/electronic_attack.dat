The Global Strike Command indicated that one {{requirement for the}} bomber is to carry a weapon of similar effect to the Massive Ordnance Penetrator. In addition to the strategic bombing, tactical bombing, and prompt global strike roles typical for a bomber, the aircraft is {{to be part of}} a family of systems responsible for ground surveillance and <b>electronic</b> <b>attack.</b> The Obama Administration in its 2012 budget request asked for $197 million and a total of $3.7 billion over five years to develop the bomber, including modular payloads for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), <b>electronic</b> <b>attack</b> (EA), and communications.

25|$|GPS {{compasses}} {{share the}} main advantages of gyrocompasses. They determine true North, {{as opposed to}} magnetic North, and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth's magnetic field. Additionally, compared with gyrocompasses, they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone {{to be affected by}} mechanical vibration, and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an <b>electronic</b> <b>attack</b> or by the effects of a severe solar storm. Gyrocompasses remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses are useless), but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.|$|E

500|$|The first combat-capable Block 3.0 {{aircraft}} first flew in 2001. Increment 2, {{the first}} F-22 upgrade program, was implemented in 2005 and enables the aircraft to employ Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). Increment 3.1 provides improved ground-attack capability through {{synthetic aperture radar}} mapping and radio emitter direction finding, <b>electronic</b> <b>attack</b> and the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB); testing began in 2009 and the first upgraded aircraft was delivered in 2012. Increment 3.2 is a two-part upgrade process; 3.2A focuses on electronic warfare, communications and identification, while 3.2B will allow the F-22 to fully exploit the AIM-9X and AIM-120D missiles. The subsequent Increment 3.3 may include the adoption of an open avionics platform and air traffic control updates. Upgrades due in 2015 will allow the F-22 to employ the AIM-9X and have full Link 16 reception and transmission capability. The F-22 fleet is planned to have 36 Block 20 training and 149 Block 30/35 combat aircraft by 2016. The Increment 3.2B upgrade planned for 2018 will include a new stores management system to show the correct symbols for the AIM-9X Sidewinder and AIM-120D AMRAAM with improved control of them. [...] In 2017, the USAF is defining requirements for next-generation sensors for the F-22, which involves designing new hardware and antennas. Subsequent upgrades are also focusing on an open avionics platform to enable faster future upgrades.|$|E

A comprehensive understanding of attackers, their motives, and their methods is a prerequisite for digital crime investigation. The range of possible cyber attacks is almost unlimited, but many attacks generally follow the basic steps of reconnaissance, gaining access, and coverup. We highlight common methods and tools used by attackers in each step. In addition, attacks are not necessarily directed toward specific targets.

5000|$|Key {{revocation}} can {{be added}} to the system by requiring a new certificate to be issued as frequently as the level of security requires. Because the certificate is [...] "public information", it {{does not need to be}} transmitted over a secret channel. The downside of this is the requirement for regular communication between users and the certificate authority, which means the certificate authority is more vulnerable to <b>electronic</b> <b>attacks</b> (such as denial-of-service attacks) and also that such attacks could effectively stop the system from working. This risk can be partially but not completely reduced by having a hierarchy of multiple certificate authorities.|$|R

Also, on 16 Feb 2010, Captain Scott Conn, the CVW-11 deputy commander, became the 325th naval aviator to successfully complete 1,000th carrier-arrested landing (trap) when he landed his F/A-18F Super Hornet on board the Nimitz.|$|E

[...] In December 2003, the US Navy awarded a development contract for the EA-18G to Boeing. As primary contractor, Boeing was to construct the forward fuselage, wings and perform the final assembly. Northrop Grumman was the principal airframe subcontractor and they would supply the center and aft fuselage as well as the principal electronic combat system. In 2003, the Navy expected to receive 90 EA-18Gs.|$|E
2500|$|Boeing {{is looking}} into other {{potential}} upgrades; the ALQ-99 radar jamming pod may be replaced in the future, and the company {{is looking into}} adding weapons and replacing the satellite communications receiver. The Growler is the initial platform for the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) which uses Active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology to focus jamming power exactly where needed. The NGJ was to be implemented on the F-35. However, in May 2012, the U.S. Navy decided to focus NGJ integration on the EA-18G for an expected in-service date of 2020, and defer work for the F-35.

40|$|Nowadays {{the words}} such as cyber and <b>electronic</b> <b>attacks</b> are heard of {{more than any other}} ones.

Concentrating on the relevant weaknesses and overcoming them, we can achieve a secure and stable system.

As part of a series of reviews we have performed at the request of Members of Congress, we have examined and reported on the adequacy of the steps that financial market participants have taken to reduce their vulnerability to attacks and to be better able to recover from such events when they occur. In addition to taking steps to reduce the likelihood that physical attacks will damage their facilities, financial market organizations must also implement protections to reduce the potential for <b>electronic</b> <b>attacks</b> to disrupt their operations. <b>Electronic</b> <b>attacks</b> can be the result of individuals (such as hackers) or groups, such terrorist organizations or foreign governments, attempting to gain unauthorized access to a specific organization's networks or systems or from malicious computer programs or codes, such as viruses or worms, that seek to damage data or deny access to legitimate users. Given the importance of this topic, Congress asked us to review the measures taken by selected critical financial market organizations, including exchanges, clearing organizations, and payment system processors, to protect themselves from attacks and we reported our results in September 2004. At the time we prepared that report, we were still completing our reviews of the seven selected organizations' information security protections.
