2500|$|Zinner {{eventually}} cut {{the film}} down to 18,000feet. Cimino later fired Zinner {{when he discovered}} that Zinner was editing down the wedding scenes. Zinner eventually won Best Editing Oscar for The Deer Hunter. Regarding the clashes between him and Cimino, Zinner stated: [...] "Michael Cimino and I had our differences at the end, but <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> when we both got Academy Awards." [...] Cimino later commented in The New York Observer, [...] " [...] was a moron... I cut Deer Hunter myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|From first grade, Bow {{preferred}} {{the company of}} boys, stating, [...] "I could lick any boy my size. My right arm was quite famous. My right arm was developed from pitching so much... Once I hopped a ride on behind a big fire engine. I {{got a lot of}} credit from the gang for that." [...] A close friend, a younger boy who lived in her building, burned to death in her presence after an accident. In 1919, Bow enrolled in Bay Ridge High School for Girls. [...] "I wore sweaters and old skirts...didn't want to be treated like a girl...there was one boy who had always been my pal... <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me...</b> I wasn't sore. I didn't get indignant. I was horrified and hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse {{was taught}} at home {{until she was}} eight and a half, and then entered the school kept by the Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux. Thérèse, taught well and {{carefully}} by Marie and Pauline, found herself {{at the top of}} the class, except for writing and arithmetic. However, because of her young age and high grades, she was bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl of fourteen who did poorly at school. Thérèse suffered very much as a result of her sensitivity, and she cried in silence. Furthermore, the boisterous games at recreation were not to her taste. She preferred to tell stories or look after the little ones in the infants class. [...] "The five years I spent at school were the saddest of my life, and if my dear Céline had not been with me I could not have stayed there for a single month without falling ill." [...] Céline informs us, [...] "She now developed a fondness for hiding, she did not want to be observed, for she sincerely considered herself inferior." [...] On her free days she became more and more attached to Marie Guérin, the younger of her two cousins in Lisieux. The two girls would play at being anchorites, as the great Teresa had once played with her brother. And every evening she plunged into the family circle. [...] "Fortunately I could go home every evening and then I cheered up. I used to jump on Father's knee and tell him what marks I had, and when <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> all my troubles were forgotten...I needed this sort of encouragement so much." [...] Yet the tension of the double life and the daily self-conquest placed a strain on Thérèse. Going to school became more and more difficult.|$|E
5000|$|Much later, {{there is}} the oft-quoted verse from the Song of Songs: May <b>he</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> with the <b>kisses</b> of his mouth,for your love is better than wine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take a fatherly good night, my dear," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>kissing</b> <b>me</b> on the forehead, [...] "and so to rest. These are late {{hours for}} working and thinking. You {{do that for}} all of us, all day long, little housekeeper!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{will you}} tie up my frock? and may I put the flowers into the broth?' chattered Rayonette. 'And why did <b>he</b> <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> and hug me so tight? {{and how did}} he know what you say over me as we fall asleep?' ...|$|R
60|$|Again, as <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> painful {{thoughts}} darkened his aspect.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He saw we had. He {{ripped out}} a fathom {{and a half}} o' {{brimstone}} Spanish, and he swung down on our rail, and <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> before all his fine young captains. His men was swarming out of the lower ports ready to unload us. When he saw how I'd considered all his likely wants, <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> again.|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. So imperious. (She is {{suddenly}} panic-stricken.) Susan, I think <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> once.|$|E
60|$|I shrunk out of {{the room}} the moment <b>he</b> had <b>kissed</b> <b>me,</b> and went and hid myself in the garden.|$|R
60|$|Then, before I {{could prevent}} him, <b>he</b> had <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b> Let me be honest, though, here, at any rate. Did I {{really try to}} prevent him? I think not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{you don't}} know what I am!' she cried. 'I had a lover once; but now he's gone! 'Twasn't I who deserted him. He has deserted me; because I am ill <b>he</b> wouldn't <b>kiss</b> <b>me,</b> though I wanted him to!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> in a hurried startled way, {{and gave}} me his arm to walk back.|$|E
60|$|I didn't {{gloss over}} anything, but just confessed the whole truth. Jack heard me through in silence, and then <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{clasping}} {{me in his}} arms, <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> warmly on both cheeks, {{and before}} I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ROBERTS: 'Did <b>he?</b> Well, <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> again, then, Edward. And now do go, dear. M-m-m-m.' The inarticulate endearments {{represented}} by these signs terminate {{in a wild}} embrace, protracted halfway across the room, in the height of which Mr. Willis Campbell enters.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I--I didn't {{think about}} how I was altered!' said the conscience-stricken girl. 'I used to <b>kiss</b> him, and <b>he</b> used to <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> before <b>he</b> went away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>he</b> {{tried to}} <b>kiss</b> <b>me,</b> that's what for!" [...] said Felicity, turning very red. [...] "As if I would let a hired boy <b>kiss</b> <b>me!</b> I guess Master Peter won't try {{anything}} like that again in a hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} it's my fault," [...] she began. [...] "I couldn't help it because <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b> I never dreamed he would attempt it." ...|$|E
60|$|Then while I {{filled the}} saddle-bags Jan {{swallowed}} some meat, {{and a fresh}} horse having been brought <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> and rode away in the twilight.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time since I had known him he seemed to have {{expressed}} a doubt of my word. Before we parted I told him that I would undeceive her, start the {{first thing in the morning}} for Richmond and there let her know that he had been blameless. At this <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> again. I would expiate my sin, I said; I would humble myself in the dust; I would confess and ask to be forgiven. At this <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> once more.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{stopped to}} <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh. For I {{felt as if}} I could not bear the painful delight of his praise.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned my}} face up and <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> {{squarely}} on the mouth. <b>He</b> had never <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> since the summer before he went away to college. Somehow it didn't seem a bit {{the same as it}} used to; it was--nicer now.|$|R
60|$|But the {{photographer}} {{had ceased to}} listen. He came over and took my {{head in his hands}} and twisted it sideways. I thought <b>he</b> meant to <b>kiss</b> <b>me,</b> and I closed my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "'You're quite right,' says she, 'that's {{just what}} happened. And then <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> {{for the first}} and last time, and now he's on his way to America.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> {{before we}} left the room. [...] "One word more, Helena," [...] he said, [...] "and I have done. Let there be no more talk between us about Elizabeth Chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{ought to}} have {{suspected}} something," [...] continued Mrs. Stobell, [...] "because <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me</b> this morning. I can see now that he meant it for goodbye! Well, I can’t say I’m surprised. Robert always does get his own way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, is it, Jane? I {{have not}} allowed Sir Charles {{to fall in}} love with me yet, but I can do so very easily. What will you wager that <b>he</b> will not <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> before to-morrow evening?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah me! yes--for {{the last}} time. <b>He</b> did <b>kiss</b> <b>me.</b> I feel his lips now upon my brow. And then I {{told him that}} I loved him; loved none but him; could love none other. Then I bade him begone; and he went. Now, sir, I think you know it all. You {{seem to have had}} two {{accounts}} of the interview; I hope they do not disagree?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{this never}} has happened--never will happen. It {{is not in}} his nature to inflict {{suffering}} on others. Not a hard word, not a hard look, escapes him. It is only at night, when I hear him sighing in his sleep, and sometimes when I see him dreaming in the morning hours, that I know how hopelessly I am losing the love he once felt for me. He hides, or tries to hide, it in the day, for my sake. He is all gentleness, all kindness; but his heart is not on his lips when <b>he</b> <b>kisses</b> <b>me</b> now; his hand tells me nothing when it touches mine. Day after day the hours that he gives to his hateful writing grow longer and longer; day after day he {{becomes more and more}} silent in the hours that he gives to me.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned and}} faced him. The blood rushed to my cheek. 'Harold!' I cried, darting forward. My joy overcame me. He folded {{me in his}} arms. I allowed him, unreproved. For the first time <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b> I did not shrink from it.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{so pleased}} that <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b> Yes! the most fondly affectionate kiss {{that he had}} given me, for weeks past, was my reward for {{submitting}} to Mrs. Tenbruggen. She {{is old enough to}} be his mother, and almost as ugly as Miss Jillgall--and she has made her interests his interests already! ...|$|E
6000|$|The Invisible Presence read my thought. I felt my lips touched, as my husband's lips used {{to touch}} them when <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>me.</b> And that was my answer. A thought came to me again. I would have said, if I could have spoken: [...] "Are you here {{to take me to}} the better world?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BURGESS (a little shamefaced and {{doubtful}} of his reception). How ors you, Candy? (She, {{still in}} Morell's arms, offers him her cheek, which <b>he</b> <b>kisses.)</b> James and <b>me</b> is {{come to a}} unnerstandin'--a honourable unnerstandin'. Ain' we, James? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said she, [...] "and don't {{you ever}} dare {{to treat me}} as a young lady. Why, Pa, he's {{blushing}} like a girl. I know. <b>He's</b> ashamed to <b>kiss</b> <b>me</b> now. <b>He's</b> going to be married at last to that Creole girl in New Orleans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{my cousin}} sleeps {{in the other}} room. He is weak and worn out. All the same, Allan, <b>he</b> wanted to <b>kiss</b> <b>me.</b> So I told him at once how matters stood between you and me, {{and that we were}} to be married in six months." ...|$|R
