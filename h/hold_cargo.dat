25|$|The {{airport is}} one of the largest in terms of cargo in the United States, and is the primary {{connecting}} point for cargo between Latin America and the world. Ninety-six different carriers are involved in shifting over two million tons of freight annually and ensuring the safe travel of over 40 million passengers, according to the Miami International Airport corporate brochure. It was first in International freight and third in total freight for 2008. In 2000, LAN Cargo opened up a major operations base at the airport and currently operates a large cargo facility at the airport. Most major passenger airlines, such as American Airlines use the airport to carry <b>hold</b> <b>cargo</b> on passenger flights, though most cargo is transported by all-cargo airlines. UPS Airlines and FedEx Express both base their major Latin American operations at MIA.|$|E

50|$|Intracellular {{transport}} {{is unique}} to eukaryotic cells because they possess organelles enclosed in membranes {{that need to be}} mediated for exchange of cargo to take place. Conversely, in prokaryotic cells {{there is no need for}} this specialized transport mechanism because there are no membranous organelles and compartments to traffic between. Prokaryotes are able to subsist by allowing materials to enter the cell via simple diffusion. Intracellular transport is more specialized than diffusion, it is a multifaceted process which utilizes transport vesicles. Transport vesicles are small structures within the cell consisting of a fluid enclosed by a lipid bilayer, that have the capacity to <b>hold</b> <b>cargo.</b> These vesicles will typically execute cargo loading and vesicle budding, vesicle transport, the binding of the vesicle to a target membrane and the fusion of the vesicle membranes to target membrane. To ensure that these vesicles embark in the right direction and to further organize the cell, special motor proteins attach to cargo-filled vesicles and carry them along the cytoskeleton. It is helpful to think of these vesicles as cars and the components of the cytoskeleton as the roadways they travel upon. The selectivity of these vesicles is a key component in keeping the cell organized, for example they have to ensure that lysosomal enzymes are transferred specifically to the Golgi Apparatus not to another part of the cell which could lead to deleterious effects.|$|E

40|$|In {{the coming}} years the Arctic Ocean will become navigable for {{significant}} periods of time. Now {{is the time to}} consider the legal regime that will govern the arctic region, and the recent Polar Code is a major international step in that direction. Among the areas that need further attention before the Arctic becomes a major commercial highway is shipping liability. In particular, Canadian law may <b>hold</b> <b>cargo</b> owners liable for ship owners’ mistakes, errors, and omissions leading to oil spills in the Canadian Arctic. This peculiar cargo owner liability may be an uninsurable risk, and is therefore potentially destabilizing to firms that may not even appreciate their risk. Rather than getting rid of this protection entirely, however, this article proposes a solution to bring this facet of Canadian law into harmony with the Polar Code, preserving the additional protection afforded by cargo owner liability, while tempering it with principles from the Polar Code itself...|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{devised a}} new test {{involving}} a <b>cargo</b> <b>hold</b> with {{conditions similar to}} the conditions of Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms.

40|$|Protein cages are spherical hollow supramolecules {{that are}} {{attractive}} nanoscale platforms for constructing cargo delivery vehicles. Using ferritin {{isolated from the}} hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf_Fn), we developed a multifunctional protein cage-based delivery nanoplatform that can <b>hold</b> <b>cargo</b> molecules securely, deliver them to the targeted sites, and release them to the targeted cells. The release is triggered by cleavage induced by the protease, thrombin. The thrombin cleavage peptide (GGLVPR/GSGAS) was inserted into the flexible loop region of Pf_Fn, which is located at a 4 -fold axis of symmetry exposed {{on the surface of}} protein cages (Thr-Pf_Fn). Subsequently, the C-terminal glycine, which is situated in the interior cavity, was substituted with cysteine (G 173 C) to permit site-specific conjugation of cargo molecules. The introduced cysteine (G 173 C) was labeled with a fluorescent probe (F 5 M-Thr-Pf_Fn) for cell imaging and cargo release monitoring. The surface of F 5 M-Thr-Pf_Fn was further modified with biotins (F 5 M-Thr-Pf_Fn-NPB) as targeting ligands. The specific binding of dual functionalized F 5 M-Thr-Pf_Fn-NPB to the MDA MB 231 cell line, which overexpresses biotin-specific receptors on its surface, was confirmed by fluorescence microscopic analyses. The inserted thrombin cleavage peptides were effectively cleaved by thrombin, resulting in the release of the C-terminal helix in buffer and on the targeted cells without disruption of the cage architecture. Protein cage scaffolds that combine genetic and chemical modifications may serve as stimulus-responsive delivery nanoplatforms and provide opportunities for developing new types of theranostic nanoplatforms. close 7...|$|E
