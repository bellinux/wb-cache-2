40|$|To {{assess the}} status of avian {{leukosis}} virus subgroup J (ALV-J) in <b>wild</b> <b>ducks</b> in China, we examined samples from 528 <b>wild</b> <b>ducks,</b> representing 17 species, which were collected in China over the past 3 years. Virus isolation and PCR showed that 7 ALV-J strains were isolated from <b>wild</b> <b>ducks.</b> The env genes and the 3 'UTRs from these isolates were cloned and sequenced. The env genes of all 7 <b>wild</b> <b>duck</b> isolates were significantly different {{from those in the}} prototype strain HPRS- 103, American strains, broiler ALV-J isolates and Chinese local chicken isolates, but showed close homology with those found in some layer chicken ALV-J isolates and belonged to the same group. The 3 'UTRs of 7 ALV-J <b>wild</b> <b>ducks</b> isolates showed close homology with the prototype strain HPRS- 103 and no obvious deletion was found in the 3 'UTR except for a 1 bp deletion in the E element that introduced a binding site for c-Ets- 1. Our study demonstrated the presence of ALV-J in <b>wild</b> <b>ducks</b> and investigated the molecular characterization of ALV-J in <b>wild</b> <b>ducks</b> isolates...|$|R

50|$|Wild Man's dam, <b>Wild</b> <b>Duck,</b> was bred by George Keays at Newton House, Nenagh. His dam, <b>Wild</b> <b>Duck,</b> was a half-Thoroughbred sired by the {{registered}} Thoroughbred stallion Sheldrake (seventh in the 1877 St. Leger) {{out of an}} unraced half-breed mare. <b>Wild</b> <b>Duck</b> was sold as a four-year-old with the foal Wild Man at foot to J.J Maher. Maher won several steeplechases with <b>Wild</b> <b>Duck,</b> notably the Ward Hunt Cup, before selling her to E. Richardson in 1891, who sold her shortly afterward to a German buyer. Wild Man is <b>Wild</b> <b>Duck's</b> only recorded foal. Maher retained Wild Man until 1893, using him as a hunter initially as a three-year-old and then entering him in steeplechases beginning in April 1892. Wild Man was trained by James Gatland at his Wingrove Stables in Alfriston, Sussex.|$|R

40|$|The risk of <b>wild</b> <b>ducks</b> {{exposure}} to heavy metals {{in the environment}} was assessed by analyzing 20 <b>wild</b> <b>ducks</b> shot in the hunting area at the fish farm in Donji Miholjac, Eastern Croatia. Liver samples obtained from 10 Mallards and 10 Common Pochards were examined for heavy metals (Cd, Pb, As, Hg) by using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Significant difference in heavy metal content between analyzed species was confirmed only for Cd (P≤ 0. 01), and {{no differences were found}} between genders within species. The results obtained suggest the importance of <b>wild</b> <b>ducks</b> as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution, especially Common Pochard for Cd, and Mallard for Pb accumulation...|$|R
