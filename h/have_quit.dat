Charlotte is no exception, and when she makes Arthur soup, she is rewarded by him throwing it in her face. In spite of this, Charlotte tries her best, drawing strength from her belief that to give in is giving in to the Devil.|$|E

500|$|Hill {{decided to}} come back into drag racing for 1985. He {{purchased}} Dan Pastorini's Top Fuel car and salvaged the drag boat engine {{from the bottom of}} the lake.

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1926, Tracy was offered his third shot at Broadway: a role in a new George M. Cohan play called Yellow.

Tracy was nervous about working with Cohan—one {{of the most important}} figures in American theatre—but during rehearsals Cohan announced, [...] "Tracy, you're the best goddamned actor I've ever seen!" [...] Yellow opened on September 21; reviews were mixed but it ran for 135 performances. It was the beginning of an important collaboration for Tracy: [...] "I'd <b>have</b> <b>quit</b> the stage completely," [...] he later commented, [...] "if it hadn't been for George M. Cohan." [...] Cohan wrote a part specifically for Tracy in his next play, The Baby Cyclone. It opened on Broadway in September 1927 and proved to be a hit.|$|E
500|$|Over the years, several {{theories}} {{emerged as}} to why the game was called Final Fantasy. In 2015, Sakaguchi stated that, from the beginning, the team had wished for a name that could be shortened to that way, the game's title could be abbreviated in the Latin script and pronounced in four syllables in the Japanese language. The original working title for Sakaguchi's RPG concept was Fighting Fantasy, but it was changed to avoid issues with a tabletop game of the same name that had already been released. The reason for choosing the word [...] "final" [...] to form the eventual title of Final Fantasy was explained as twofold by Uematsu: for one thing, it stemmed from Sakaguchi's personal situation, as he would <b>have</b> <b>quit</b> the game industry and gone back to university had the game not sold well, and for another, Square was under the threat of bankruptcy at the time, which meant the game could have been the company's last. Although Sakaguchi confirmed some of the theories, he later downplayed the rationale for choosing the word [...] "final", saying that [...] "it was definitely a back-to-the-wall type situation back then, but any word that starts with an 'F' would have been fine".|$|E

500|$|In the mid-1980s, Square {{entered the}} Japanese video game {{industry}} with simple RPGs, racing games, and platformers for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System. In 1987, Square designer Hironobu Sakaguchi chose {{to create a}} new fantasy role-playing game for the cartridge-based NES, and drew inspiration from popular fantasy games: Enix's Dragon Quest, Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda, and Origin Systems's Ultima series. Though often attributed to the company allegedly facing bankruptcy, Sakaguchi explained that the game was his personal last-ditch effort in the game industry and that its title, Final Fantasy, stemmed from his feelings at the time; had the game not sold well, he would <b>have</b> <b>quit</b> the business and gone back to university. Despite his explanation, publications have also attributed the name to the company's hopes that the project would solve its financial troubles. In 2015, Sakaguchi explained the name's origin: the team wanted a title that would abbreviate to [...] "FF", which would sound good in Japanese. The name was originally going to be Fighting Fantasy, but due to concerns over trademark conflicts with the roleplaying gamebook series of the same name, they needed to settle for something else. As the word [...] "Final" [...] was a famous word in Japan, Sakaguchi settled on that. According to Sakaguchi, any title that created the [...] "FF" [...] abbreviation would have done.|$|E
