5|$|While wrestling in Puerto Rico, LeDuc {{was booked}} {{in his final}} {{championship}} reign. He defeated Hercules Ayala on January 6, 1986 to win the World Wrestling Council's North American Heavyweight Championship. He held the belt for <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> months before dropping it to Al Perez on March 7.|$|E
5|$|Asashōryū {{returned}} to Mongolia after the May tournament to receive {{treatment for a}} bruised chest suffered in his defeat to Harumafuji. In June he received the Hero of Labour Award from outgoing Mongolian President Nambaryn Enkhbayar, the highest government award in Mongolia and equivalent to the Japanese People's Honour Award. He performed poorly in the July tournament with a 10–5 record, his worst finish in <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years.|$|E
5|$|The {{story that}} the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's {{meteoric}} rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years. Before his 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's sporting idol {{at the height of}} the Great Depression.|$|E
50|$|In Abeyasekera's {{second and}} final {{first-class}} match, he scored <b>just</b> three runs <b>over</b> <b>two</b> innings.|$|R
500|$|The Glastonbury Canal ran <b>just</b> <b>over</b> [...] through <b>two</b> locks from Glastonbury to Highbridge {{where it}} entered the Bristol Channel {{in the early}} 19th century, but it became uneconomic {{with the arrival of}} the railway in the 1840s.|$|R
50|$|Waddell's spell {{can only}} {{be seen as a}} unique achievement. In <b>just</b> little <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years he had {{enforced}} discipline and order to the club. This in turn brought European success and broke the dominance of Celtic, if only in the League Cup. Waddell also oversaw the recovery after the second Ibrox disaster, helping {{the families of the victims}} and forging strong links with supports' clubs.|$|R
5|$|With <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> {{minutes left}} the Giants punted {{the ball to}} the Colts, pinning them on their own 14yard line. The Colts put {{together}} one last, desperate drive. The star of this drive was receiver Raymond Berry, who caught three passes for 62yards, the last one for 22yards to the Giant 13–yard line. With seven seconds left in regulation, Steve Myhra kicked a 20–yard field goal to tie the score 17–17, sending the game to overtime {{for the first time in}} NFL history.|$|E
5|$|Cairano's career covers <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> decades (circa 1490–1510), a {{relatively}} short period, during which, moreover, the majority of works produced is concentrated in the latter decade. Among these, nearly three-quarters are religious commissions, executed {{mainly because of the}} greater funding available from such sources and the increased likelihood of their conservation over time. Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private commissions, especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles such as that of the Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano in this field. Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensity}} of the situation, Texas put to sea on 13 May and headed directly to operational duty without benefit of the usual shakedown cruise and post-shakedown repair period. After a five-day stop at Hampton Roads from 14–19 May, she joined Rear Admiral Fletcher's force off Veracruz on 26 May. She remained in Mexican waters for <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> months, supporting the American forces ashore. On 8 August, she left Veracruz and set a course for Nipe Bay, Cuba, and from there steamed to New York, where she entered the Navy Yard on 21 August.|$|E
50|$|He {{scored a}} total of <b>just</b> 18 goals <b>over</b> <b>two</b> seasons (1992-1994) playing with the Hamilton Canucks farm team in the AHL. In the AHL playoffs in 1993-94, he scored no goals in three games during Hamilton’s four-games first-round loss to Cornwall.|$|R
25|$|He {{played in}} the first ODI against South Africa but was not {{required}} to bat, instead <b>just</b> bowling <b>two</b> <b>overs</b> and conceding 11 runs. England won the match by 20 runs.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Ortiz started slowly after {{suffering}} a wrist injury which caused him to miss several weeks. He played {{in a total of}} 109 games and finished the season with 23 home runs and 89 RBIs while batting [...]264. Despite his struggles, Ortiz was named to his fifth All-Star team. In the playoffs, Ortiz batted <b>just</b> [...]186 <b>over</b> <b>two</b> rounds as the Red Sox ultimately fell to the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2008 American League Championship Series.|$|R
5|$|In December 2005, Wallhead fought Welshman Paul Jenkins. This was Wallhead's first title {{fight in}} mixed martial arts, as they competed for the House of Pain Welterweight title {{in front of}} Jenkins' home crowd of Cardiff, Wales. Wallhead won the fight via {{majority}} decision after five rounds, giving him the title. <b>Just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years to that day, Wallhead rematched Jenkins in a kickboxing bout (thus not counting towards his pro-MMA record); this time in Wallhead's hometown of Nottingham. Wallhead showed effective low kicks and combinations which earned him a unanimous decision victory.|$|E
5|$|Mickey Vernon {{became the}} first manager of the Texas Rangers in 1961, serving for <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> seasons. Ron Washington has managed more games and seasons than any other manager in Rangers history. Before 2010, the only Rangers manager to have led the team to the playoffs was Johnny Oates, who also won the 1996 Manager of the Year Award with the Rangers. Ted Williams is the only Rangers manager to have been {{inducted}} into the Baseball Hall of Fame; Whitey Herzog, who {{was elected to the}} Hall in 2009 and will be inducted in July 2010, will become the only Rangers manager to earn induction as a manager (Williams was inducted for his playing career).|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 1915, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) {{landed on}} the western side of the Gallipoli Peninsula, at what {{thereafter}} became known as Anzac Cove. The first Turkish attempts to recapture the ANZAC beachhead were two unsuccessful attacks in April. <b>Just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> weeks later, the Turks had gathered a force of 42,000 men (four divisions) to conduct their second assault against the ANZAC's 17,300 men (two divisions). The ANZAC commanders had no indication of the impending attack until the day before, when British aircraft reported a build-up of troops opposite the ANZAC positions.|$|E
50|$|In 29 {{games at}} Oklahoma, Mitchell {{recorded}} 219 tackles (145 solos) with six sacks, 32 tackles-for-losses, two fumble recoveries, five forced fumbles and eleven passes defensed. Despite playing <b>just</b> a little <b>over</b> <b>two</b> seasons at Oklahoma, his 32 tackles-for-losses rank fifth among Sooner linebackers in a career.|$|R
50|$|MacKinnon's tenure {{with the}} Gulls was largely {{interrupted}} through injury, limiting him to <b>just</b> 32 games <b>over</b> <b>two</b> seasons. On June 7, 2017, MacKinnon left the AHL {{as a free}} agent and signed his first contract abroad with German club, Straubing Tigers of the DEL, on a one-year agreement.|$|R
25|$|He was {{subsequently}} {{taken on the}} 2005–06 tour to India. He played in the second Test at Mohali, replacing Ian Blackwell in the side. However, he was largely unimpressive, taking only one wicket and scoring <b>just</b> one run <b>over</b> <b>two</b> innings. He was replaced by James Anderson for the third Test.|$|R
5|$|The {{purchases}} of the diaries continued throughout {{mid to late}} 1981: Gruner + Jahr gave Heidemann 345,000DMs on 29 July, and a further 220,000DMs a week later, which brought the total up to 1.81millionDMs {{since the start of}} the year. This sum had purchased 18 diaries for the company. Schulte-Hillen, the new managing director, signed an authorisation for a further million DMs for future purchases. <b>Just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> weeks later he signed a further authorisation for 600,000DMs after Heidemann told him that the cost of the diaries had now risen to 200,000DMs each; Heidemann also passed on the news that there were more than 27 diaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} written in six parts, but Davies excised {{a large portion}} of the fifth episode because the crew expressed concerns with its pacing. The series was filmed in late 2003 under the direction of Sheree Folkson and Tim Whitby, and utilised many areas of Swansea that Davies was familiar with since his childhood. It aired as four-hour-long episodes and a ninety-minute finale on Thursday nights preceding Christmas 2003. Eventually, Mine All Mine would be his least successful series and ended its run with <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> million viewers, which he later blamed on the series' high eccentricity.|$|E
5|$|After {{his earlier}} crash Downie retired {{on the third}} lap with a broken wheel, while Thornycroft, who had also had first lap trouble, was forced to stop with a broken rear axle. Over the final two laps a number of cars ran out of fuel, and of the 42 {{starters}} only 18 completed the race. The first car to finish was the Rolls Royce of Percy Northey. He had started twenty minutes ahead of Napier's Arrol-Johnston so Napier had to finish within twenty minutes of Northey in order to win. He did so, passing the finish line eighteen minutes later, having run the fastest lap of the race at the end to win by <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> minutes. Napier's time was 6 hours 9 minutes 14.6 seconds, followed by Northey in 6:11:23 and Norman Littlejohn in a French Vinot-Deguingand, in 6:14:32.4. The three drivers had been consistently the quickest throughout the race and were separated by just over five minutes. The next quickest driver was E. J. C. Roberts in {{the second of the}} Arrol-Johnstons, but he was over 25 minutes behind his victorious team-mate.|$|E
50|$|In February 2012, he {{was once}} again loaned, this time to Mega Vizura {{until the end of}} season. Over the course of season, he {{averaged}} 9.1 points and 6.4 rebounds in the Basketball League of Serbia. He played <b>just</b> ten games <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years in all competitions with Caja Laboral.|$|R

25|$|The club won the cup {{again in}} 1969 but {{achieved}} no further success for thirty years. The late eighties and early nineties were particularly difficult for Colne, {{with the club}} finishing bottom of the league in five out of six seasons {{and at one point}} winning <b>just</b> three matches <b>over</b> <b>two</b> seasons.|$|R
5|$|After the Japanese {{captured}} the Malayan Peninsula, both ships moved to Singapore harbour. On 8 February, the Japanese launched an amphibious assault across the Strait of Johore and following heavy fighting, many ships began evacuating from the harbour. By 11 February Gnat and Grasshopper were the largest vessels left. The two ships left Singapore for Batavia at 21:00 on 13 February, having taken on other personnel to evacuate them. Amongst these was Commander Ian Forbes, {{formerly of the}} battleship , which had been sunk by the Japanese <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> months earlier. By the following morning {{they could hear the}} attacks by Japanese aircraft on other vessels in the distance. As they were sailing south, they were attacked by Japanese bombers. During the initial pass, Grasshopper was hit by a single bomb. When the planes returned, Dragonfly was hit three times and sank quickly. Grasshopper was hit twice and was set on fire. The order to abandon ship was given as the fire spread to compartments adjacent to an ammunition store.|$|E
5|$|County {{finished}} the 2007–08 season {{fourth in the}} league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He did as a manager what he could never do as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3–2 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself {{as one of the}} most highly rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for £750,000 – a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years previous.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{the first}} statewide {{competition}} was held, and <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years later, {{the newly formed}} United States Academic Decathlon Association held the first national competition in April 1982 at Loyola Marymount University in California—200 high schools from 16 states and the District of Columbia competed {{for the chance to}} attend. Peterson, inspired by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event. At the 1984 Nationals, 32 states as well as Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and South Korea fielded teams. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. There was no more international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, only a handful of international schools have competed.|$|E
50|$|Following their grand final {{appearance}} in 1979, the West Torrens Eagles entered the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1980. The team changed names in 1981 to the Forestville Eagles, but success did not follow; they won <b>just</b> 12 games <b>over</b> <b>two</b> seasons, {{and as a}} result, {{they returned to the}} SA State League in 1982.|$|R
50|$|Langton turned {{professional}} in 2008 {{when he signed}} {{to play for the}} Pittsburgh Riverhounds in the USL Second Division, but played <b>just</b> seven minutes <b>over</b> <b>two</b> games in his debut season.. He made his first professional start for the 'Hounds on April 17, 2009 in the team's 2009 season opener against Crystal Palace Baltimore.|$|R
5000|$|Set in a {{stand-up}} comedy show in Israel {{that takes place}} <b>over</b> <b>just</b> <b>two</b> hours, the novel recounts {{the tale of a}} comic who faces a personal crisis while performing his routine, leading to a series of candid and chilling revelations about his past.|$|R
5|$|Lynch's {{original}} {{rough cut}} ran for approximately four hours. He was contractually obligated {{to deliver a}} two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts {{at the request of}} the MPAA. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the Blu-ray disc release of the film. The final cut of the film runs at <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> hours.|$|E
5|$|Macartney hit 105 as Australia amassed 7/708 {{declared}} against Hampshire {{and then}} made 193 as Australia compiled 621 and defeated Northamptonshire by an innings and 484 runs. The two matches were separated by a match against Surrey, which Macartney missed due to injury. In the latter match, Macartney came in at first drop after the hosts took a wicket from the first ball of the match, and he scored 193 of the 318 runs scored {{while he was in}} the middle. Macartney took only 135 minutes and hit 31 fours as Australia added more than 300 in <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> hours of batting. Such was the dominance of Macartney and the rest of Armstrong's men that they disposed of Northamptonshire in less than two days. However, his most famed innings was yet to come.|$|E
5|$|Romas keel {{was laid}} by the Italian {{shipbuilder}} Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico on 18 September 1938, {{and she was}} launched on 9 June 1940. After <b>just</b> <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years of fitting-out, the new battleship was commissioned into the Regia Marina on 14 June 1942. She arrived in the major naval base of Taranto on 21 August, and {{was assigned to the}} Ninth Naval Division. Although Roma took part in training exercises and was moved to various bases including Taranto, Naples, and La Spezia, in the next year, she did not go on any combat missions as the Italian Navy was desperately short of fuel. In fact, by the end of 1942, the only combat-ready battleships in the navy were the three Vittorio Venetos because the fuel shortage had caused the four modernized battleships to be removed from service. When combined with a lack of capable vessels to escort the capital ships, the combat potential of the Italian Navy was virtually non-existent.|$|E
50|$|Hillary Scott and Sex Z Pictures parted ways <b>just</b> {{a little}} <b>over</b> <b>two</b> years into a five-year {{exclusive}} performing / directing contract, {{and she is}} now represented by LA Direct Models.

The historic setting, stable residential population, railroad, and access to major highways make this community unique in Ventura County.|$|R
25|$|In all matches for Ireland, Kelly scored 808 runs at {{an average}} of 21.26, scoring four half-centuries, the highest of which was an innings of 82 against Wales in August 1923.
