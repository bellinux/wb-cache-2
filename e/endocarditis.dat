5|$|Olds {{was briefly}} a stepbrother of author Gore Vidal after Olds' father married {{for the fourth}} time in June 1942, to Nina Gore Auchincloss. His father died of {{pneumonia}} on April 28, 1943, after hospitalization for constrictive pericarditis and Libman-Sacks <b>endocarditis,</b> at the age of 46, just prior to Olds' graduation from West Point.|$|E
5|$|Syers {{retired from}} {{competitive}} skating after the Olympics due to fading health. She and Edgar co-authored a second book together, The Art of Skating (International Style), published in 1913. She {{died of heart}} failure caused by acute <b>endocarditis</b> on 9 September 1917 {{at her home in}} Weybridge, Surrey, aged 35.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, and <b>endocarditis</b> among others. It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may also be used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness. Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout {{the body of the}} loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause <b>endocarditis</b> and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of <b>endocarditis</b> and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E
5|$|Infection, {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial infection. The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. Risk of infection is greatest among those with congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective <b>endocarditis,</b> hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking corticosteroids. In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an infection from a nipple piercing. Viral infections may include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by piercing. While rare, infection due to piercing of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{emotional}} distractions, {{during the summer of}} 1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony, completing the Adagio and drafting four more movements. He and Alma returned to New York in late October 1910, where Mahler threw himself into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours. Around Christmas 1910 he began suffering from a sore throat, which persisted. On 21 February 1911, with a temperature of 40°C (104°F), Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at Carnegie Hall, with a program of mainly new Italian music, including the world premiere of Busoni's Berceuse élégiaque. This was Mahler's last concert. After weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with bacterial <b>endocarditis,</b> a disease to which sufferers from defective heart valves were particularly prone, and for which the survival rate in pre-antibiotic days was almost zero. Mahler did not give up hope; he talked of resuming the concert season, and took a keen interest when one of Alma's compositions was sung at a public recital by the soprano Frances Alda, on 3 March. On 8 April the Mahler family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS Amerika bound for Europe. They reached Paris ten days later, where Mahler entered a clinic at Neuilly, but there was no improvement; on 11 May he was taken by train to the Löw sanatorium in Vienna, where he died on 18 May.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic cellulitis, but {{has been known to}} cause <b>endocarditis,</b> meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E
25|$|Candida albicans, a yeast, is {{associated}} with <b>endocarditis</b> in IV drug users and immunocompromised patients. Other fungi demonstrated to cause <b>endocarditis</b> are Histoplasma capsulatum and Aspergillus. <b>Endocarditis</b> with Tricosporon asahii has also been reported in a case report.|$|E
25|$|Another form of <b>endocarditis</b> is healthcare-associated <b>endocarditis</b> {{when the}} infecting {{organism}} {{is believed to}} be transmitted in a health care setting like hospital, dialysis unit or a residential nursing home. Nosocomial <b>endocarditis</b> is a form of healthcare associated <b>endocarditis</b> in which the infective organism is acquired during stay in a hospital and it is usually secondary to presence of intravenous catheters, total parenteral nutrition lines, pacemakers, etc.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{distinction}} between native-valve <b>endocarditis</b> and prosthetic-valve <b>endocarditis</b> is clinically important. Prosthetic valve <b>endocarditis</b> can be early (< 60 days of valvular surgery), intermediate (60 days to 1 year) or late (> 1 year following valvular surgery).|$|E
25|$|Regardless of cause, {{left-sided}} <b>endocarditis</b> is {{more common}} in both IV drug users and non-drug users than right-sided <b>endocarditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Among {{people who}} do use {{intravenous}} drugs and have a fever {{in the emergency room}}, there is about a 10% to 15% prevalence of <b>endocarditis.</b> This estimate is not substantially changed by whether the doctor believes the patient has a trivial explanation for their fever. Weisse found that 13% of 121 patients had <b>endocarditis.</b> Marantz also found a prevalence of <b>endocarditis</b> of 13% among such patients in the emergency room with fever. Samet found a 6% incidence among 283 such patients, but after excluding patients with initially apparent major illness to explain the fever (including 11 cases of manifest <b>endocarditis),</b> there was a 7% prevalence of <b>endocarditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{microorganisms}} {{can cause}} infective <b>endocarditis.</b> These are generally isolated by blood culture, where the patient's blood is removed, and any growth is noted and identified. The term bacterial <b>endocarditis</b> (BE) commonly is used, reflecting {{the fact that}} most cases of IE are due to bacteria; however, infective <b>endocarditis</b> (IE) has become the preferred term.|$|E
25|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{the annual}} incidence of infective <b>endocarditis</b> is 3 to 9 cases per 100,000 persons. The male to female case ratio is over 2:1. There is an increased incidence of infective <b>endocarditis</b> in persons 65 {{years of age}} and older, which is probably because people in this age group have a larger number of risk factors for infective <b>endocarditis.</b> In recent years, over one third of infective <b>endocarditis</b> cases in the United States were healthcare-associated. Another trend observed in developed countries is that chronic rheumatic heart disease accounts for <10% of cases. Although a history of valve disease has a significant association with infective <b>endocarditis,</b> 50% of all cases develop in people with no known history of valvular disease.|$|E
25|$|Among {{people who}} do not use {{intravenous}} drugs and have a fever in the emergency room, there is a less than 5% chance of occult <b>endocarditis.</b> Mellors in 1987 found no cases of <b>endocarditis</b> nor of staphylococcal bacteremia among 135 febrile patients in the emergency room. The upper confidence interval for 0% of 135 is 5%, so for statistical reasons alone, there is up to a 5% chance of <b>endocarditis</b> among these patients. In contrast, Leibovici found that among 113 non-selected adults admitted to the hospital because of fever there were two cases (1.8% with 95%CI: 0% to 7%) of <b>endocarditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{case reports}} of infective <b>endocarditis</b> caused by unusual organisms have been published. Few {{examples}} include: Propionibacterium sp., which are normal skin flora, {{have been responsible}} for infective <b>endocarditis</b> sometimes leading to deaths due to the indolent course of this abscess producing infection.Tropheryma whipplei has caused <b>endocarditis</b> without gastrointestinal involvement. Citrobacter koseri was found in an immunocompetent adult. Neisseria bacilliformis was found in a patient with a bicuspid aortic valve.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also used}} to prevent {{bacterial}} <b>endocarditis</b> in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent Streptococcus pneumoniae and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax. The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious <b>endocarditis</b> prophylaxis. These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious <b>endocarditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|SLE {{may cause}} {{pericarditis}} - {{inflammation of the}} outer lining surrounding the heart, myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle, and/or <b>endocarditis</b> - inflammation of the inner lining of the heart. The <b>endocarditis</b> of SLE is non-infectious, and is also called (Libman–Sacks <b>endocarditis).</b> It involves either the mitral valve or the tricuspid valve. Atherosclerosis also occurs more often and advances more rapidly than in the general population.|$|E
25|$|High risk: atrial {{fibrillation}} and paroxysmal {{atrial fibrillation}}, rheumatic {{disease of the}} mitral or aortic valve disease, artificial heart valves, known cardiac thrombus of the atrium or ventricle, sick sinus syndrome, sustained atrial flutter, recent myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial infarction together with ejection fraction <28 percent, symptomatic congestive heart failure with ejection fraction <30 percent, dilated cardiomyopathy, Libman-Sacks <b>endocarditis,</b> Marantic <b>endocarditis,</b> infective <b>endocarditis,</b> papillary fibroelastoma, left atrial myxoma and {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery.|$|E
25|$|In {{a patient}} with Turner syndrome, these {{left-sided}} cardiovascular malformations can result in an increased susceptibility to bacterial <b>endocarditis.</b> Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should be considered when procedures with {{a high risk of}} <b>endocarditis</b> are performed, such as dental cleaning.|$|E
25|$|Damaged {{valves and}} endocardium {{contribute}} to the development of infective <b>endocarditis.</b> Specifically, the damaged part of a heart valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic <b>endocarditis</b> (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as part of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective <b>endocarditis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Infective <b>endocarditis</b> is {{associated}} with 18% in-hospital mortality.|$|E
25|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{followed}} by Streptococci of the viridans group and coagulase negative Staphylococci {{are the three}} most common organisms responsible for infective <b>endocarditis.</b> Other Streptococci and Enterococci are also a frequent cause of infective <b>endocarditis.</b> HACEK group of microorganisms and fungi are seen less frequently in North America.|$|E
25|$|Osler's triad: {{association}} of pneumonia, <b>endocarditis,</b> and meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Infective <b>endocarditis</b> {{is a form}} of <b>endocarditis.</b> It is an {{inflammation}} of the inner tissues of the heart, the endocardium, usually of the valves. It is caused by infectious agents, or pathogens, which are largely bacterial but a few other organisms can also be responsible. Before the age of modern antibiotics it was almost universally fatal.|$|E
25|$|Late {{prosthetic}} valve <b>endocarditis</b> {{is usually}} due to community acquired microorganisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{risk factors}} for infective <b>endocarditis</b> provide a more {{extensive}} list of conditions that can damage the heart.|$|E
25|$|As the Duke {{criteria}} {{rely heavily}} {{on the results of}} echocardiography, research has addressed when to order an echocardiogram by using signs and symptoms to predict occult <b>endocarditis</b> among patients with intravenous drug abuse and among non drug-abusing patients. Unfortunately, this research is over 20 years old and it is possible that changes in the epidemiology of <b>endocarditis</b> and bacteria such as staphylococci make the following estimates incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Osler-Libman-Sacks {{syndrome}} is an atypical, verrucous, nonbacterial, valvular and mural <b>endocarditis.</b> Final stage of systemic lupus erythematosus.|$|E
25|$|A more virulent {{organism}} (such as Staphylococcus aureus) {{can cause}} infective <b>endocarditis</b> by infecting even a normal heart valve.|$|E
25|$|Early {{prosthetic}} valve <b>endocarditis</b> {{is usually}} due to intraoperative contamination or a postoperative bacterial contamination {{which is usually}} nosocomial in nature.|$|E
25|$|In {{subacute}} <b>endocarditis,</b> where patient's hemodynamic {{status is}} usually stable, antibiotic treatment can be delayed till the causative microorganism can be identified.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, the American Heart Association {{no longer}} {{recommends}} antibiotics for <b>endocarditis</b> prophylaxis before certain procedures {{in patients with}} aortic insufficiency. Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent <b>endocarditis</b> before gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures is no longer recommended for any patient with valvular disease. Cardiac stress test is useful in identifying individuals that may be best suited for surgical intervention. Radionuclide angiography is recommended and useful when the systolic wall stress is calculated and combined to the results.|$|E
25|$|Moxifloxacin is used {{to treat}} a number of infections, including: {{respiratory}} tract infections, cellulitis, anthrax, intraabdominal infections, <b>endocarditis,</b> meningitis, and tuberculosis.|$|E
