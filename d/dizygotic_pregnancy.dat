40|$|Fetal {{chylothorax}} (FC) {{is a rare}} condition {{characterized by}} lymphocyte-rich pleural effusion. Although its pathogenesis remains elusive, it may involve inflammation, since there are increased concentrations of proinflammatory mediators in pleural fluids. Only a few hereditary lymphedema-associated gene loci, e. g. VEGFR 3, ITGA 9 and PTPN 11, were detected in human fetuses with this condition; these cases had a poorer prognosis, due to defective lymphangiogenesis. In the present study, genome-wide gene expression analysis was conducted, comparing pleural and ascitic fluids in three hydropic fetuses, one with and two without the ITGA 9 mutation. One fetus (the index case), from a <b>dizygotic</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (the cotwin was unaffected), received antenatal OK- 432 pleurodesis and survived beyond the neonatal stage, despite having the ITGA 9 mutation. Genes and pathways involved in the immune response were universally up-regulated in fetal pleural fluids compared to those in ascitic fluids. Furthermore, genes involved in the lymphangiogenesis pathway were down-regulated in fetal pleural fluids (compared to ascitic fluid), but following OK- 432 pleurodesis, they were up-regulated. Expression of ITGA 9 was concordant with overall trends of lymphangiogenesis. In conclusion, we inferred that both the immune response and lymphangiogenesis were implicated in the pathogenesis of fetal chylothorax. Furthermore, genome-wide gene expression microarray analysis may facilitate personalized medicine by selecting the most appropriate treatment, according to the specific circumstances of the patient, for this rare, but heterogeneous disease...|$|E

40|$|We {{performed}} prenatal diagnoses for {{cystic fibrosis}} in 32 high risk (1 : 4) couples (including a <b>dizygotic</b> <b>pregnancy).</b> Chorionic villi sampling {{did not cause}} abortion or fetal malformation in any case. The preliminary analysis of 9 short tandem repeats always excluded maternal contamination of the DNA extracted from chorionic villi and confirmed paternity. Twenty-two prenatal diagnoses were made by direct analysis of the mutations. In seven cases diagnosis {{was made by the}} analysis of intragenic polymorphisms; in three cases, we analyzed two extragenic polymorphisms. The prenatal diagnosis (including genetic counselling) was completed within 24 h from the sampling. Seven prenatal diagnoses revealed an affected fetus; all couples opted for therapeutic abortion. In 17 cases the fetus was heterozygote, and in seven cases it was non carrier of mutated alleles. In the twin pregnancy, mutations were DeltaF 508 /N 1303 K. Direct analysis of the DNA extracted from the two independent samples of chorionic villi revealed one fetus non carrier of mutated alleles and the other a carrier of the N 1303 K mutation. Analysis of the HPRT locus predicted both the fetuses as males. Furthermore, the genotype of each fetus was defined after birth.

40|$|With the {{increased}} use of artificial reproductive technologies, there are ever greater numbers of multifetal pregnancies. The increased incidences of monozygotic twins and triplet gestations can be attributed to several factors. It is important to differentiate the chorionicity in the management of multifetal pregnancies because monochorionic gestations lead to an increased risk of prematurity, twin-to-twin transfusion, morbidity, and mortality. In a <b>dizygotic</b> triplet <b>pregnancy,</b> increased risks of obstetric complications result from the monozygotic twins, such as twin-to-twin transfusion, {{as well as from the}} presence of triplets. Fetal reduction can lower these risks. During the first trimester, a "lambda sign " on ultra-sound can differentiate between monozygotic twins and a separate fetus. In this paper, we present selective fetal reduction of 1 of the monozygotic twins in order to reduce the risks resulting from either monozygotic twins or from triplets.

40|$|Monochorionic (MC) {{dizygotic twins}} (DZT) are rarely {{conceived}} naturally [1].

40|$|A 36 -year-old {{single woman}} {{presented}} at the out-patient clinic in March 2000 requesting donor insemination. Between May 2000 and May 2001 she underwent six cycles of intrauterine insemination with donor sperm after clomiphene citrate stimulation without achieving a pregnancy. In January 2002, ICSI was performed; two embryos were transferred on day 3 and a <b>dizygotic</b> bichorionic <b>pregnancy</b> was achieved, which ended in a miscarriage at 21 weeks of gestation. After a second unsuccessful ICSI attempt in which a single embryo transfer was performed, she embarked upon her third attempt in March 2003 at 39 years of age. Two blastocysts were transferred after ICSI, resulting in a quintuplet gestation consisting of a monochorionic biamniotic pregnancy and a monochorionic tri-amniotic pregnancy. The current case report indicates that monozygotic pregnancies consisting of both twins and triplets are possible after treatment by assisted reproductive technologies. An association between extended culture, manipulation of the zona pellucida, ovarian stimulation and occurrence of monozygotic pregnancies has been suggested by retrospective studies.

40|$|We {{present a}} series of monozygous {{multiple}} gestations achieved following in vitro fertilization (IVF) : one case of monochorionic triplet pregnancy and six cases of <b>dizygotic</b> triplet <b>pregnancy.</b> From September 2000 to December 2006, all patients achieving clinical pregnancy by ART were reviewed (n = 2433). A 37 year-old woman who delivered a healthy singleton after IVF returned two years later for FET, and a single blastocyst was transferred. This also resulted in pregnancy, but TV-USG revealed a single gestational sac with three distinct amniotic sacs, each containing a distinct fetal pole with cardiac activity. This pregnancy was electively terminated at nine weeks' gestation. An additional six cases of dizygotic triplets established after fresh embryo transfer (no ICSI or assisted hatching) are also described. Of these, one resulted in a miscarriage at eight weeks' gestation and five patients have an ongoing pregnancy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of {{the natural}} cycle for IVF offers the {{advantage}} of a patient-friendly and low-risk protocol. Its effectiveness is limited, but may be improved by using a GnRH antagonist to prevent untimely LH surges. METHODS: In this pilot study, minimal stimulation IVF with late follicular phase administration of the GnRH antagonist cetrorelix and simultaneous substitution with recombinant FSH was applied for a maximum of three cycles per patient. Main outcome measures were pregnancy rates per started cycle and cumulative pregnancy rates after three cycles. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients completed 119 cycles (2. 4 per patient). Fifty-two embryo transfers resulted in 17 ongoing pregnancies [14. 3 % per started cycle; 32. 7 % per embryo transfer; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 7. 9 - 20. 7 % and 19. 7 - 45. 7 %, respectively]. One <b>dizygotic</b> twin <b>pregnancy</b> occurred after transfer of two embryos, the other pregnancies were singletons. The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate after three cycles was 34 % (95 % CI 20. 6 - 47. 4 %). Live birth rate was 32 % per patient (95 % CI 18. 8 - 45. 2 %). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy rates after IVF with minimal, late follicular phase stimulation are encouraging.

40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized study comparing single {{embryo transfer}} with double embryo transfer after in-vitro fertilization or {{intracytoplasmic sperm injection}} (IVF/ICSI) was carried out. First, top quality embryo characteristics were delineated by retrospectively analysing embryos resulting in ongoing twins after double embryo transfer. A top quality embryo was characterized {{by the presence of}} 4 or 5 blastomeres at day 2 and at least 7 blastomeres on day 3 after insemination, the absence of multinucleated blastomeres and < 20 % cellular fragments on day 2 and day 3 after fertilization. Using these criteria, a prospective study was conducted in women < 34 years of age, who started their first IVF/ICSI cycle. Of 194 eligible patients, 110 agreed to participate of whom 53 produced at least two top quality embryos and were prospectively randomized. In all, 26 single embryo transfers resulted in 17 conceptions, 14 clinical and 10 ongoing pregnancies [implantation rate (IR) = 42. 3 %; ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR) = 38. 5 %] with one monozygotic twin; 27 double embryo transfers resulted in 20 ongoing conceptions with six (30 %) twins (IR = 48. 1 %; OPR = 74 %). We conclude that by using single embryo transfer and strict embryo criteria, an OPR similar to that in normal fertile couples can be achieved after IVF/ICSI, while limiting the <b>dizygotic</b> twin <b>pregnancy</b> rate to its natural incidence of < 1 % of all ongoing pregnancies. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To present first-trimester {{molecular}} {{diagnosis of}} complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) associated with <b>dizygotic</b> twin <b>pregnancy</b> conceived by intrauterine insemination. Materials and methods: A 32 -year-old woman {{presented to the}} hospital with a huge complex cystic mass measuring about 8. 5  cm ×  4. 1  cm in the uterine cavity and a living co-existing fetus with fetal biometry equivalent to 9  weeks. She underwent chorionic villus sampling at 13  weeks of gestation, and microsatellite genotyping for molar pregnancy test was applied. A molar pregnancy test was performed by a short tandem repeat (STR) identifier polymerase chain reaction (PCR) polymorphic marker analysis. The pregnancy was terminated at 14  weeks of gestation. Postnatal polymorphic DNA marker analysis of the placenta by quantitative fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR) was performed. Analysis of maternal blood total β-human chorionic gonadotropin revealed a high level of 551, 600  mIU/mL at 10  weeks of gestation and a level of 1. 0  mIU/mL at 15  weeks postpartum. The woman was doing well at 4  months after delivery. Results: The results of STR identifier PCR polymorphic marker analysis showed androgenic conception in the complex cystic mass and biparental conception in the living fetus. Pathological analysis of the cystic mass confirmed the diagnosis of CHM. The results of QF-PCR showed biparental inheritance in the normal fetus and complete paternal homozygosity in the CHM of the abnormal fetus in all STRs, indicating dizygotic twinning and CHM of monospermy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{trends in}} {{multiple}} pregnancies not explained {{by changes in}} maternal age and parity patterns. DESIGN: Trends in population based figures for multiple pregnancies in Denmark studied from complete national records on parity history and vital status. POPULATION: 497, 979 Danish women and 803, 019 pregnancies, 1980 - 94. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: National rates of multiple pregnancies, infant mortality, and stillbirths controlled for maternal age and parity. Special emphasis on primiparous women > or = 30 years of age, {{who are most likely}} to undergo fertility treatment. RESULTS: The national incidence of multiple pregnancies increased 1. 7 -fold during 1980 - 94, the increase primarily in 1989 - 94 and almost exclusively in primiparous women aged > or = 30 years, for whom the adjusted population based twinning rate increased 2. 7 -fold and the triplet rate 9. 1 -fold. During 1989 - 94, the adjusted yearly increase in multiple pregnancies for these women was 19 % (95 % confidence interval 16 % to 21 %) and in <b>dizygotic</b> twin <b>pregnancies</b> 25 % (21 % to 28 %). The proportion of multiple births among infant deaths in primiparous women > or = 30 years increased from 11. 5 % to 26. 9 % during the study period. The total infant mortality, however, did not increase for these women because of a simultaneous significant decrease in infant mortality among singletons. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively small group of women has drastically changed the overall national rates of multiple pregnancies. The introduction of new treatments to enhance fertility has probably caused these changes and has also affected the otherwise decreasing trend in infant mortality. Consequently, the resources, both economical and otherwise, associated with these treatments go well beyond those invested in specific fertility enhancing treatments...|$|R

40|$|Whereas {{there are}} many {{hypotheses}} on the causes of senescence of the body, {{it has not yet}} been elucidated whether the placenta, which is to be delivered from the mother after pregnancy for ten months, is also subjected to senescent changes. Namely, is the senescence already started in the placenta of late pregnancy, as it is a matured placenta?　In this paper, a gene, early population doubling level cDNA- 1 /pigment epithelium-derived factor(EPC- 1 /PEDF), was used as a marker to examine senescent changes. This gene has already been used as an ageing marker for tissues although its expression level is fluctuated according to cell cycle, ageing, cell differentiation, etc. We noticed that, when the expression of EPC- 1 /PEDF mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, its level was decreasing in the placenta of pregnant mice as pregnancy progressed. Next we performed real-time quantitative PCR to detect EPC- 1 /PEDF mRNA in 19 cases of human placentas at 27 - 40 weeks of gestation, obtained upon elective cesarean deliveries done prior to the onset of labor. Its expression was decreased as pregnancy progressed. The 8 cases of vaginal delivery and the 5 cases of emergency cesarean deliveries after onset of labor gave lower values than the cases subjected to elective cesarean delivery. In cases of 8 <b>dizygotic</b> twins <b>pregnancy</b> at 32 - 38 weeks of gestation including two cases of discordant twins, the expression of EPC- 1 /PEDF mRNA was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The placentae from the smaller neonates gave extremely lower values than the normal placentae from the lager ones. 　These findings indicated that the placenta is an organ subjected to senescent changes. The onset of labor may be related with ageing of the placenta. In addition, it was suggested that the placentas with intrauterine growth retardation could show placental dysfunction accompanying senescent changes in the uterus...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} risk of Down syndrome (DS) {{in multiple}} relative to singleton pregnancies, and compare prenatal diagnosis rates and pregnancy outcome. DESIGN: Population-based prevalence study based on EUROCAT congenital anomaly registries. SETTING: Eight European countries. POPULATION: 14. 8 million births 1990 - 2009; 2. 89 % multiple births. METHODS: DS cases included livebirths, fetal deaths from 20 weeks, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA). Zygosity is inferred from like/unlike sex for birth denominators, and from concordance for DS cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risk (RR) of DS per fetus/baby from multiple versus singleton pregnancies and per pregnancy in monozygotic/dizygotic versus singleton pregnancies. Proportion of prenatally diagnosed and pregnancy outcome. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Poisson and logistic regression stratified for maternal age, country and time. RESULTS: Overall, the adjusted (adj) RR of DS for fetus/babies from multiple versus singleton pregnancies was 0. 58 (95 % CI 0. 53 - 0. 62), similar for all maternal ages except for mothers over 44, {{for whom it}} was considerably lower. In 8. 7 % of twin pairs affected by DS, both co-twins were diagnosed with the condition. The adjRR of DS for monozygotic versus singleton pregnancies was 0. 34 (95 % CI 0. 25 - 0. 44) and for <b>dizygotic</b> versus singleton <b>pregnancies</b> 1. 34 (95 % CI 1. 23 - 1. 46). DS fetuses from multiple births {{were less likely to}} be prenatally diagnosed than singletons (adjOR 0. 62 [95 % CI 0. 50 - 0. 78]) and following diagnosis less likely to be TOPFA (adjOR 0. 40 [95 % CI 0. 27 - 0. 59]). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of DS per fetus/baby is lower in multiple than singleton pregnancies. These estimates can be used for genetic counselling and prenatal screening...|$|R
40|$|Background.   Methods.     Results.     ! 30 years, {{and were}} more likely to undergo in vitro {{fertilization}} (IVF). Combined grain farming and seaso nal late blight warnings did not influence the prevalence of DZ pregnancies. Unexpectedly, the same climate variable, in combination with horticulture, was negatively associated with DZ pregnancies (PR 0. 3; 95 % confidence interval 0. 1 – 0. 7). Conclusion.     Active Norwegian farmers seem to have a somewhat higher natural occurrence of DZ pregnancies than mothers in non-farming sectors of the agricultural population. After the late 1970 s this situation was reversed, mainly because the latter group consisted of more older first-time mothers, and probably with a higher need of assisted fertility treatment. Interpretations are difficult concerning the inverse relation between DZ pregnancy and climatic conditions in horticulture. We identified 2, 131 (11. 2 per 1, 000) multiple pregnancies, 1, 322 (6. 9) were classified as DZ. The prevalence of DZ pregnancies was declining until the late 1970 s, and increased thereafter. The agricultural population of Norway is heterogeneous along two dimensions, with a difference between farmers and nonfarmers (mainly engaged in forestry), and a difference according to degree of maternal work input on the farm holding. Farmers, in particular active farmers, had more DZ pregnancies than non-farmers early in the study period; this ratio was reversed late in the study period. Non-farmers had a much higher temporal increase in the proportion of first-time mothers who were   By record linkage of national registers in Norway, we identified 246, 043 farm holders and spouses born between 1925 and 1971 in agricultural censuses and the population register. In this population, 190, 258 pregnancies were recorded in the Medical Birth Registry 1967 - 91. The prevalences of multiple pregnancy, subdivided in DZ and monozygotic (MZ) pregnancies, were examined in strata of several determinants. Exposure, defined as the combination of grain farming and categories of seasonal fungal warnings, was based on data on farm activity and on local fungal warnings in the growth seasons. Adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) served as estimates of association. SUMMARY   The worldwide occurrence of <b>dizygotic</b> (DZ) multiple <b>pregnancies</b> has increased since 1980 as a consequence of assisted fertilization techniques. An opposite influence by environmental factors yet unidentified has been a suspected explanation of decreased multiple pregnancies in several countries during 1960 - 1980. The aim of our study was to describe multiple, in particular DZ, pregnancy patterns in the Norwegian agricultural population between 1967 and 1991, and to investigate the hypothesis that grain production under climatic conditions favoring fungal growth causes a decline in DZ pregnancies. </span...|$|R
