25|$|These {{experiments}} mostly {{use either}} cryogenic or noble liquid detector technologies. Cryogenic detectors operating at temperatures below 100mK, detect the heat produced when a particle hits an atom in a crystal absorber such as germanium. Noble liquid detectors detect scintillation {{produced by a}} particle collision in liquid xenon or argon. Cryogenic detector experiments include: CDMS, CRESST, EDELWEISS, EURECA. Noble liquid experiments include ZEPLIN, XENON, <b>DEAP,</b> ArDM, WARP, DarkSide, PandaX, and LUX, the Large Underground Xenon experiment. Both of these techniques focus strongly {{on their ability to}} distinguish background particles (which predominantly scatter off electrons) from dark matter particles (that scatter off nuclei). Other experiments include SIMPLE and PICASSO.|$|E

500|$|Liquid argon {{is used as}} {{the target}} for {{neutrino}} experiments and direct dark matter searches. The interaction between the hypothetical WIMPs and an argon nucleus produces scintillation light that is detected by photomultiplier tubes. Two-phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP–nucleus scattering. As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation light yield (about 51 photons/keV), is transparent to its own scintillation light, and {{is relatively easy to}} purify. Compared to xenon, argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile, which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils. [...] On the other hand, its intrinsic beta-ray background is larger due to [...] contamination, unless one uses argon from underground sources, which has much less [...] contamination. Most of the argon in the Earth’s atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long-lived [...] ( [...] + e− → [...] + ν) present in natural potassium within the Earth. [...] The [...] activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through the knockout reaction (n,2n) and similar reactions. [...] The half-life of [...] is only 269years. [...] As a result, the underground Ar, shielded by rock and water, has much less [...] contamination. [...] Dark-matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include DarkSide, WArP, ArDM, microCLEAN and <b>DEAP.</b> [...] Neutrino experiments include ICARUS and MicroBooNE, both of which use high-purity liquid argon in a time projection chamber for fine grained three-dimensional imaging of neutrino interactions.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{key factors}} to obtain large {{displacements}} and high efficiency with dielectric electroactive polymer (<b>DEAPs)</b> actuators is to have compliant electrodes. Attempts to scale <b>DEAPs</b> down to the mm or micrometer range have encountered major difficulties, mostly due {{to the challenge of}} micropatterning sufficiently compliant electrodes. Simply evaporating or sputtering thin metallic films on elastomer membranes produces <b>DEAPs</b> whose stiffness is dominated by the metallic film. Low energy metal ion implantation for fabricating compliant electrodes in <b>DEAPs</b> presents several advantages: a) it is clean to work with, b) it does not add thick passive layers, and c) it can be easily patterned. We use this technology to fabricate <b>DEAPs</b> micro-actuators whose relative displacement is the same as for macro-scale <b>DEAPs.</b> With transmission electron microscope (TEM) we observed the formation of metallic clusters within the elastomer (PDMS) matrix, forming a nano-composite. We focus our studies on relating the properties of this nano-composite to the implantation parameters. We identified the optimal implantation parameters for which an implanted electrode presents an exceptional combination of high electrical conductivity and low compliance...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric ElectroActive Polymers, or <b>DEAPs,</b> are devices with coupled {{electrical}} and mechanical responses that resemble stretchable parallel plate capacitors, that {{can act as}} actuators, sensors, or electrical generators. Currently, the electrode layers {{on the top and}} bottom are generally conductive carbon grease, which is dirty and also causes curing issues for certain polymers. This thesis explores several polymers and conductive fillers to identify a conductive nanocomposite material, to replace the grease electrode with a solid material and eliminate issues associated with grease electrodes. It then characterizes the mechanical and electric properties and how they change during cyclic loading, while augmenting an equibiaxial tensile testing machine and advancing the knowledge of equibiaxial characterization. The most promising polymer/filler combination was found to be EcoFlex 30, a platinum cure silicone rubber, containing seven volume percent of nickel nanostrands and three volume percent of 0. 1 mm length nickel-coated carbon fiber. Using two conductive fillers of different sizes resulted in much higher conductivity than a single filler alone, and an enormous piezoresistive effect. This material gave weak conductivity at no load, increasing several orders of magnitude as strained and well surpassing the benchmark of 1. 2 S/m set by conductive carbon grease. Elastomer materials were found to have conductivities as high as 275 S/m under peak strain, and changing the nickel-coated carbon fiber length allowed for strains over 120 %. Equibiaxial stress-strain curves were also analyzed for energy lost through hysteresis, in order to compare to published results for <b>DEAPs</b> used as Dielectric Energy Generators. Results and recommendations are presented for using and further improving the materials for applications of <b>DEAPs</b> used as energy harvesters and capacitive sensors, using the material alone as a piezoresistive sensor, and improving the equibiaxial characterization process...|$|R
