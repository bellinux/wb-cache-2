5|$|Already before this, in 1430, FitzAlan had {{departed}} for France, where {{he held a}} series of important command positions. He served under John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle of the eight-year-old King Henry VI. FitzAlan was involved in recovering fortresses in the Île-de-France region, and in suppressing local rebellions. His military career ended, however, at the Battle of Gerbevoy in 1435. Refusing to retreat in the face of superior forces, Arundel was shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and captured. His leg was later amputated, and he died shortly afterwards from the injury.

The New York Gazette of December 15, 1812, reported that, of Lieutenant Angus’s 35 sailors who assaulted the Red House, 28 were killed or wounded, 2 were captured and only 5 escaped unscathed. Captain King (who was slightly wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot)</b> and 38 other prisoners were taken by the British, The British reported that King and Angus’s detachment left 12 killed behind them at the Red House (4 of whom were presumably from Angus's naval detachment) and that 18 American dead were recovered altogether.|$|E

His mother became so concerned at her son's fragile and still grief-stricken state that she employed a dancer at Drury Lane, Mary Bristow, to care for him full-time during those weeks. They formed a close friendship, which resulted in a loving relationship, and they married on 24 December 1801.|$|E

5|$|Silkies {{are also}} known for their polydactyly, usually manifesting as an {{additional}} 1-2 digits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> The genetic cause of this extra digit formation {{has been shown to}} be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene, called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS). This causes ectopic SHH expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud, leading to increased tissue growth and digits. Interestingly, while the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly, the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic FGF4 expression in the AER, with ectopic SHH a secondary effect.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Mounted Division {{was joined}} {{a few hours}} later by the Yeomanry Mounted Division which had left Huj early in the morning.

However, AlexanderI produced proof of an Argead royal genealogy showing ancient Argive Temenid lineage, a move that ultimately convinced the Olympic Hellanodikai authorities of his Greek descent and ability to compete. By {{the end of the}} 5thcenturyBC, the Macedonian king ArchelausI was crowned with the olive wreath at both Olympia and Delphi (in the Pythian Games) for winning chariot racing contests. PhilipII allegedly heard of the Olympic victory of his horse (in either an individual horse race or chariot race) on the same day his son Alexander the Great was born, on either 19 or 20July 356BC. In addition to literary contests, Alexander the Great also staged competitions for music and athletics across his empire.|$|E

5|$|ZANLA {{had planned}} for four attacks {{to take place}} {{simultaneously}} but in the event only Nhongo's men did so. According to historian Elaine Windrich, Nhongo was a former employee of the tobacco farm's 37-year-old owner, Marc de Borchgrave, and held a grudge against him. The cadres shot up the farm house with AK-47 assault rifles and threw grenades through the windows, then retreated and hid amongst the local population. Nobody {{was killed in the}} attack but the farmer's eight-year-old daughter, Jane, was wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> The isolated house had no telephone or any other means of contacting neighbours, and de Borchgrave was wary of being ambushed should he drive his car out, so after a short time comforting the children he set out across country on foot to seek help and alert the authorities. This done, he returned and took his wife and children to another farm nearby, Whistlefield, which was owned by Archie Dalgluish and his family.|$|E

5|$|After {{leading his}} state to another Sheffield Shield title and {{a win over}} England, Miller {{replaced}} Morris as the vice-captain for the tour of the West Indies that started in early 1955. Australia was looking for its first series win against any team in three years, having lost two consecutive series to England. Australia batted first in the opening Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica. Miller came to the wicket at 2/137 {{and put on a}} 224-run partnership with Harvey. Both ended with centuries and Miller scored his highest Test score of 147, striking 15fours. When Valentine and Ramadhin had conceded 100runs, he respectively shook their hands. Australia finished at 9/515. Johnson had been injured when hit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> by a yorker so Miller was left in charge of the team on the field with Australia one bowler short. Miller attempted to unsettle the batsmen by placing many men close to the bat in an attempt to insult their batting capabilities. He took the new ball at 5/239 and the hosts collapsed to be all out for 259. Miller had taken 2/36, and enforced the follow-on, which was questioned as paceman Ron Archer had broken down. With Australia two bowlers short, the West Indies moved to 1/114. When Weekes arrived at the crease, Miller unsettled him with delaying tactics, and he was out for one. He then placed two silly points and two silly mid-ons in an attempt to unsettle Walcott, who fell to Lindwall soon after. Miller then took two wickets and the hosts had lost three wickets in as many overs. The West Indies were bowled out and Australia won by nine wickets. Miller had taken 3/62 in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{returned}} to action on 22 August replacing Gotthard Handrick as Geschwaderkommodore of JG 26. Galland's appointment made {{no impact on}} his successes. From 25 August—14 September 1940, Galland filed claims for victories 23–32. This included three claims on 31 August 1940 for two Spitfires and a Hurricane to take his tally to 27. His 25th victim may have been from 19 Squadron which was claimed 20 kilometers south of Cambridge at 09:42. Klaus Mietusch also accounted for one for his 7th victory. Three 19 Squadron Spitfires were shot down in the morning near North Weald. Pilot Officer R.A.C Aeberhardt {{was killed in a}} crash-landing in Spitfire R6912 while Flying Officer T.J.B Coward was wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and F.N Brinsden was unhurt. He bailed out of R6958. On 6 September, Galland claimed his 30th victory over a 610 Squadron Hurricane. JG 26 claimed two more of them shot down that morning. 610 lost four Hurricanes; Flying Officer W.H Rhodes-Moorehouse and C.R Davis were killed while Flying Officer J. Toplnicki and Pilot Officer H.T Gilbert were wounded.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, 1862, Colonel Crook's 3rd Brigade routed rebel {{infantry}} in {{a conflict}} where the shooting lasted for only 27 minutes. Rebel casualties were 72 men killed, over 100 wounded, and 157 men taken prisoner. They also lost four cannon, 300 small weapons, and 25 horses. Crook's brigade lost 13 killed, 50 wounded (including Crook, who was shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot),</b> and 6 missing. The feat was accomplished {{by taking advantage of}} aggressive rebel soldiers and a hostile town. Crook had learned that a large rebel infantry under the command of General Henry Heth was moving toward Lewisburg. Crook positioned his brigade {{at the far end of}} the town, and sent a small group of pickets to the opposite end where the rebels would approach. Heth's rebels raced into town after the pickets, urged on by the pro-rebel local population. The rebels were quickly ambushed in a short action that ended after a charge by Union infantry and cavalry. The 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry battalion had been held out of the fighting, but was used to chase the fleeing rebels. The rebels escaped by burning the Greenbrier Bridge.|$|E

5|$|The manus was {{composed}} merely {{of the five}} metacarpalia, which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle. Carpal bones were missing, as in other titanosaurs. Finger bones and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs, these bones were still present though extremely reduced in size. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> the talus bone was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia. In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of phalanges (digit bones) beginning with the innermost digit, is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides Opisthocoelicaudia, completely preserved examples are known only from Epachthosaurus and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur, whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, Ophistocoelicaudia was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution.
