Since the 1970s various plans to alleviate the congestion had been put forth, some involving ballot initiatives decided by the voters of the city and/or county.

McMaster, who urged a more direct debate between civilians and the military on defense policy and actions, and Summers, who argued for a clear separation between civilians and the military, both pointed out controversies over the proper roles of civilian and military leaders.|$|E

25|$|They {{designed}} experiments {{involving the}} codification of colors. In their first experiment, they investigated whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> speakers of English to remember color shades {{for which they}} had a specific name than to remember colors that were not as easily definable by words. This allowed them to compare the linguistic categorization directly to a non-linguistic task. In a later experiment, speakers of two languages that categorize colors differently (English and Zuni) were asked to recognize colors. In this way, it could be determined whether the differing color categories of the two speakers would determine their ability to recognize nuances within color categories. Brown and Lenneberg found that Zuñi speakers who classify green and blue together as a single color did have trouble recognizing and remembering nuances within the green/blue category. Brown and Lenneberg's study began a tradition of investigation of linguistic relativity through color terminology.|$|E
25|$|In another {{paper with}} Simon Johnson at Massachusetts Institute of Technology called The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors use a natural {{experiment}} {{in history to}} show that different institutions result in different levels of economic growth. The paper examines institutional choices {{during the colonial period}} of several nations in relation to the same nations' economic development today. It found that in countries where the disease environment meant that it was hard for colonizers to survive (high mortality rate), they tended to set up extractive regimes, which resulted in poor economic growth today. In places where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> colonizers to survive (low mortality rates), however, they tended to settle down and duplicate institutions from their country of origin—especially from Britain, as {{we have seen in the}} colonial success of Australia and United States. Thus, the mortality rate among colonial settlers several hundred years ago has determined the economic growth of today's post-colonial nations by setting institutions on very different paths.|$|E

Simon Woodroffe stated that he had Barrie in mind when writing the scripts, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> him to do so when thinking of an actor he knew speaking the lines. It cost around £3000 per day to hire Barrie. Woodroffe said that there was [...] "no hesitation" [...] in doing a talkie version, and that it was [...] "the next big thing". Simon the Sorcerer used the visual and interface designs from LucasArts' games, and Woodroffe stated that this was because they had set a standard, and that Adventure Soft's focus was humour and story-telling.|$|E

500|$|Two years later, in May 2016, game {{developer}} Tyler Hogle {{was finding}} himself bored between jobs. He had previously worked on ports for two other Digital Pictures games, Double Switch (1993) and Quarterback Attack (1995). A friend suggested that Hogle recreate Night Trap and post it online anonymously {{to see what}} interest it gathered. Inspired by the idea, Hogle worked quickly {{and was able to}} recreate all of disc one to play on a smart phone within three days. He posted a short video of his work online, and some gaming websites published stories on the video and contacted Tom Zito to ask if he was involved. Hogle got into contact with Zito, and the two began working towards a full release. The original source code and 1987 master footage is lost. Riley, however, possessed a copy of the timed master footage and provided it to Hogle. Because the footage was already timed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> Hogle to develop, however he had to replay the original game multiple times to learn what actions triggered which scenes.|$|E
500|$|On 24 June, Pirlo {{produced}} a Man of the Match {{performance in the}} quarter-finals against England, as Italy won 4–2 on penalties after the game had finished 0–0 in extra time.

Following the match Pirlo spoke of his eloquent penalty, stating, [...] "At the moment I saw the goalkeeper making strange movements, so I waited for him to move and hit it like that... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> me to chip it at that stage. Maybe my effort put some pressure on England." [...] Pirlo completed more passes than the entire England midfield, as he managed 131 passes, the most of any player during the match, and the second most in a single match {{in the history of the}} European Championship, behind Xavi, with an 87% pass completion rate, as Italy finished the match with 63% ball possession. He also ran 11.58 kilometres throughout the match, covering more distance than any England player.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the Variety Map Pack in March 2017, Activision was condemned for deciding that the downloadable content would not be available for free. Common complaints were that the publisher had already generated additional revenue for Remastered by bundling it with Infinite Warfare (increasing its cost to more than an individual game) and by including microtransactions; and that as a remaster, which often includes all previously-released DLC, the map pack should have been released alongside it. Many also argued that selling the DLC for a higher price than its original release was an unprincipled move. Sterling further slated Activision for charging for the DLC, stating that it was [...] "incomprehensible" [...] and that to increase its cost highlighted [...] "just how far [...] can mock its customers and get away with it", labeling it as the latest scam to befall the game. Erik Kain of Forbes similarly argued that the DLC should have been available free of charge, maintaining his belief that charging for map packs [...] " [...] a huge mistake". However, he felt he could also sympathize with Activision, writing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> them to set price points for early and late buyers. He also noted that the remaster was cheap in its contribution to the overall price for two bundled games and so further costs for the DLC were justified.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, John {{fiercely}} guarded his independence, and {{was prepared}} to ally himself with Latin powers hostile to Palaiologos, namely Charles of Anjou and the Duchy of Athens. He soon emerged as [...] "the more dangerous and the more actively hostile" [...] of the minor Greek rulers against Michael VIII. As Donald Nicol writes, he [...] "was {{a man of great}} resource and ambition, and was clearly in touch with the Emperor's opponents in Constantinople. His stronghold of Neopatras was uncomfortably close to the Latin-occupied parts of Greece, particularly the Duchy of Athens and Thebes [...] with which he was in alliance; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> troublemakers and refugees from the capital to make their escape to Thessaly than to Epirus". This is well illustrated by the affair of John's son-in-law, Andronikos Tarchaneiotes: angered at the Emperor's preference for his younger brother Michael, he provoked a Tatar raid into Thrace, and in the confusion sought refuge at John's court. The first documented contacts between John and Michael's arch-enemy, Charles of Anjou, also date to the same time (April 1273). A commercial treaty was concluded, allowing the export of silk to Apulia and the import of horses, {{but it is clear that}} these contacts were also the first steps for John joining the coalition being prepared by Charles against Michael. Michael VIII sought to counter the threat of a new crusade, led by Charles of Anjou and aiming at the restoration of the Latin Empire, by negotiating a [...] "Union of the Churches", concluded at the Council of Lyons in 1274, at which the Emperor's representatives were forced to recognize Papal primacy. This decision aroused passionate opposition from the people, the clergy, and even within the imperial family itself. Michael's sister Eulogia, and her daughter Anna, wife of John's half-brother Nikephoros, were among the chief leaders of the anti-Unionists. Nikephoros, John, and even the Emperor of Trebizond, John II Megas Komnenos, soon joined the anti-Unionist cause and gave support to the anti-unionists fleeing Constantinople.|$|E
