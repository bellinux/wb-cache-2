500|$|The {{recording}} and release of Neighborhoods was delayed multiple times. The recording's delay {{was due to}} the way the band chose to work — in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios — in addition to each member's busy schedules. The album was recorded at both DeLonge's studio in San Diego and in Los Angeles by Hoppus and Barker. [...] Recording in separate studios was DeLonge's idea, and ideas were exchanged via e-mail. Various engineers met up in person to trade files on hard drives. Although the three musicians were rarely in the same room while recording, opting to work on their parts individually, DeLonge asserted that the method of recording was a more efficient way of working considering the schedules, not {{due to a lack of}} unity within the band. In addition, Barker was releasing a solo record, DeLonge was involved in Angels & Airwaves, and Hoppus had to fly to New York City once a week to film his television show, Hoppus on Music. The record was the band's first to be self-produced, due to the death of long-time producer Jerry Finn in 2008. Not only did Finn helm their last three studio albums, but he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound. [...] "I honestly still feel like he’s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> because for me, personally, everything that was about {{recording and}} being in a studio, I learned from Jerry," [...] said Hoppus. Instead of a producer, each band member had their own dedicated sound engineer. DeLonge, who was against using a producer after self-producing most of his Angels & Airwaves records, described the band situation as [...] "very democratic," [...] noting that he learned during the recording process to [...] "let go and be okay with not being able to control everything." ...|$|E

When we went to Japan, Keith {{went back to the}} studio unknown to us and came up with 'Commercial Zone' from all the stuff we had done before we went on the tour. Some of the final mixes were the roughs that we did before we left ... Yes, I did expect the record to be released. I {{consider}} 'Commercial Zone' the closest to where we were going - but definitely not finished ... I have a copy of the tracks that were first sent to Virgin Records as a guide to what we were up to (and remember Richard Branson spending some time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> <b>us),</b> what I call the official real tracks which only were on the 'Commercial Zone' album.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Life Is Hard: [...] "'Life Is Hard' was {{referred}} to as the worst song on the record by everybody. That song could have been replaced by any of four songs. I was doing an interview with Musician magazine; the guy was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> I was in New York, doing mixing. I said, [...] "What {{do you think is the}} worst song on the record?" [...] I've known this guy a long time. He wouldn't make a commitment. So I said, 'I think 'Life Is Hard' is the worst song, so let's work on that.' I have to tip my hat to Junior. Junior saved that song. In a matter of two hours, it went from not going to make the record to one of my favorite songs on the record. He put a couple of loops on there and then we all sat there - me and Mike and Junior and Andy - and started cutting up these weird holes in the song. It was all Junior's inspiration." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The Lazy Song" [...] {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} songs {{composed}} and produced by The Smeezingtons for Mars' debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans. In an interview with Sound on Sound, fellow Smeezington Ari Levine explained how they came up with the song [...] "It was a very tough song to write, even though it is so simple. That song began one day when we were hanging around the studio and hadn’t written a song for a few days and we were kind of burnt out and didn’t feel like working. We felt lazy. 'K’naan' was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> and the four of us suddenly came up with this idea." [...] He added, [...] "After that we had a really hard time getting the groove and the drums to sit right. Once you have one piece of the puzzle, like when you realise that a drum track is good, you can add other things in after that." [...] Mars affirmed that they were trying to be [...] "magical and historic" [...] thus creating a track [...] "that was better than the Beatles". Due to the frustration {{of not being able to}} do so, Mars said [...] "Today I don't feel like doing anything at all", which according to him was an eye-opener.|$|E
5000|$|... "We weren't even in {{the same}} room ...We were barely talking; we were in {{different}} studios. No one really commented on each other's parts, no one pressed anyone's buttons. Everyone was on eggshells." [...] — Tom DeLonge, reflecting on the album's production in 2012 The band began recording demos of new material in 2009. All three members brought song ideas that they worked on for years. As the band got back together, Barker said that the trio immediately [...] "got inspired" [...] by practicing their old songs and listening to them again, and they decided to record demos. There were four demos done, and only one was near completion, [...] "Up All Night". The trio wanted to release it as a single then, but quickly they realized that it was too ambitious to complete it before their reunion tour began in July. Sessions were stalled by the summer 2009 reunion tour, during which the band reconnected musically and emotionally. During the tour, Barker got the phone call that DJ AM had overdosed and died in New York, which heavily affected him. In addition to the tragedy regarding DJ AM, DeLonge was diagnosed with skin cancer the following year, but it eventually was cleared. The band did a large amount of writing before leaving on tour, but upon completion of the tour, they took time off to [...] "take a couple of months and chill and do other stuff," [...] with intentions to regroup in 2010. In June and July 2010, the band spent time at their rehearsal spot, and their intention was to wrap up touring by September, and stay in the studio {{for the rest of the}} year until the album was finished. The album sessions were to be partially documented in The Blinkumentary, which was scrapped in 2012.The recording and release of Neighborhoods was delayed multiple times.
