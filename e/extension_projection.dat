40|$|In the pan {{geographic}} information age, {{with the development}} of the SoLoMo (social, local and mobile) modes in the mobile internet industry, how to effectively manage massive location-based data, social network and geospatial data has become a major challenge in the moving object databases field of research. In this paper, a spatial-temporal integrated data model for moving object trajectories and social relationships, called the Geo-Social-Moving (GSM) model, is proposed to manage both moving object geographical locations, trajectories and social relationships in an integrated framework. We define a series of common operations including interception, <b>extension,</b> <b>projection</b> and multi-dimensional projection. Then, the GSM model is implemented based on a graph database system. We conducted detailed experiments with two free location-based social network datasets from Brightkite and Gowalla to verified the effectiveness of the GSM model. Results show that the proposed GSM model can avoid query inefficiency caused by relational database table joins with the efficiency and stability to provide support for location-based social network applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For a finite-dimensional Banach space V {{we define}} its Lipschitz {{extension}} constant, LE(V), {{to be the}} smallest constant c such that for every compact metric space (Z, ρ), every X ⊂ Z, and every f: X → V, there is an extension, g, of f to Z such that L(g) ≤ cL(f), where L denotes the Lipschitz constant. Our main theorem is that LE(V) = PC(V) where PC(V) is the well-known projection constant of V. We obtain some consequences, especially when V = Mn(C). We also discuss what happens if we also require that ‖g‖ ∞ = ‖f‖∞. In my exploration {{of the relationship between}} vector bundles and Gromov–Hausdorff distance [13] I {{need to be able to}} extend matrixvalued functions from a closed subset of a compact metric space to the whole metric space, with as little increase of the Lipschitz constant as possible. There is a substantial literature concerned with extending Lipschitz functions, but I did not find there the facts which I need. The purpose of this paper is to show that there is a very strong relationship between the Lipschitz extension problem and what is referred to as the “projection constant ” for finite-dimensional vector spaces. This permits us to bring to bear on the Lipschitz extension problem the quite substantial literature concerning projection constants. This then provides substantially more of the facts which I need, as well as providing other interesting facts. In Section 1 we will give the definition of what we call the Lipschitz extension constant, LE(V), of a finite-dimensional Banach space V. I have not found exactly this definition in the literature, although there are definitions very close to it. We also recall the definition of the projection constant, PC(V), of a finite dimensional Banach space V. Our main theorem is that LE(V) = PC(V) for any V. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46 B 20; 26 A 16. Key words and phrases.
