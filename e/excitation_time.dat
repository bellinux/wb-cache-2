40|$|We {{present a}} {{combined}} experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} effects of Rydberg interactions on Autler-Townes spectra of ultracold gases of atomic strontium. Realizing two-photon Rydberg excitation via a long-lived triplet state allows us to probe the regime where Rydberg state decay presents the dominant decoherence mechanism. The effects of Rydberg interactions are observed in shifts, asymmetries, and broadening of the measured atom-loss spectra. The experiment is analyzed within a one-body density-matrix approach, accounting for interaction-induced level shifts and dephasing through nonlinear terms that approximately incorporate correlations due to the Rydberg blockade. This description yields good agreement with our experimental observations for short <b>excitation</b> <b>times.</b> For longer <b>excitation</b> <b>times,</b> the loss spectrum is altered qualitatively, suggesting additional dephasing mechanisms beyond the standard blockade mechanism based on pure van der Waals interactions...|$|R

40|$|High Power Laboratory in Ludvika has {{facilities}} for short-circuit testing of high voltage equipment like circuit breakers, disconnectors, surge arresters, transformers, switchgear cubicles, etc.; simulating the test conditions as in real power transmission network. In {{order to provide}} such an extremely high short-circuit current up to 100 kA, two specially designed turbo-generators are being used with a total capacity of 4000 MVA. Each of generators during the short-circuit test is excited by a separate driven exciter to provide the excitation current. Flying excitation method {{which is used to}} provide the right value of test current and voltage is described more in detail in Chapter 2. The excitation system has to be properly set in order to satisfy requirements of short-circuit testing. Therefore correct value of <b>excitation</b> <b>time</b> and an exciter voltage has to be chosen in advance to fulfil the criteria of short-circuit testing. The no-load characteristics of generators have been measured and an analysis of obtained data was made to get the needed <b>excitation</b> <b>time</b> characteristics. The study of collected data from previous single-phase short-circuit tests showed that it is best to use the same excitation times for the operating sequences open (O), open-close-open (O-CO) and close-open (CO) in order to provide the correct short-circuit current at interruption for a given connection of generator winding, and frequency. For operating sequence close (C) is also recommended to use the same <b>excitation</b> <b>time</b> determined in the study for whole range of short-circuit current at the generator side within the same generator winding connection, frequency and use of the generators. The final program for calculation of excitation parameters has been developed to visualise the particular <b>excitation</b> <b>time</b> characteristics obtained from the no-load measurements as well as easily and accurately determine the right values of parameters for excitation of the generator, such as exciter voltage and generator output rms voltage, for a certain short-circuit test. Recommended excitation times can be also easily found in the program by various combinations of the input parameters like generator, frequency, winding connection and operating sequence...|$|E

By judiciously differencing measurements {{that are related to}} the location of the antennas and their <b>excitation</b> <b>times,</b> the problem is converted from the initial spherical nonlinear form to a system of linear equations. In the linear formalism, the source location and time-of-occurrence is viewed geometrically as an intersection of hyperplanes in the four-dimensional Minkowski space (x,y,z,t). The linear equations are solved to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the location and time variables. Retrieval errors are not interpreted with conventional Geometrical Dilution of Precision (GDOP) arguments as discussed by Holmes and Reedy (1951), but with more recent inversion analyses considered by Twomey (1977).
