A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> subsequent seizures.|$|E

25|$|The medical {{historian}} Jacalyn Duffin {{has argued}} that the invention of the stethoscope marked a major step in the redefinition of disease from being a bundle of symptoms, to the current sense of a disease as a problem with an anatomical system <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no noticeable symptoms. This re-conceptualization occurred in part, Duffin argues, because prior to stethoscopes, there were no non-lethal instruments for exploring internal anatomy.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to have added tone chords {{with more than one}} added note. The most commonly encountered of these are 6/9 chords, which are basic triads with the 6th and 2nd notes of the scale added. These can be confusing because of the use of 9, yet the chord does not include the 7th. A good rule of thumb is that if any added note is less than 7, then no 7th is implied, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some notes shown as greater than 7.|$|E
25|$|Starvation ensues {{when the}} fat {{reserves}} are completely exhausted and protein {{is the only}} fuel source available to the body. Thus, after periods of starvation, the loss of body protein affects the function of important organs, and death results, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> still fat reserves left unused. (In a leaner person, the fat reserves are depleted earlier, the protein depletion occurs sooner, and therefore death occurs sooner.) The ultimate cause of death is, in general, cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest brought on by tissue degradation and electrolyte imbalances.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{insurance}} bet {{is susceptible to}} advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card {{has more than a}} chance of one in three of being a ten. Advantage play techniques can sometimes identify such situations. In a multi-hand, face-up, single deck game, it is possible to establish whether insurance is a good bet simply by observing the other cards on the table after the deal; <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> just 2 player hands exposed, and neither of their two initial cards is a ten, then 16 in 47 of the remaining cards are tens, which is larger than 1 in 3, so insurance is a good bet. This is an elementary example of the family of advantage play techniques known as card counting.|$|E

Youth unemployment is also very high, primarily due to lack of education system in providing necessary training under TVET programs.|$|E

2500|$|Carboxylic acids are {{commonly}} identified using their trivial names, and usually have the suffix -ic acid.

For nomenclature of complex molecules containining a carboxylic acid, the carboxyl can be considered position one of the parent chain <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> other substituents, for example, 3-chloropropanoic acid.

[...] "Although the Judæo-Christian sect of the Ebionites protested against this apotheosis of Jesus, the great mass of Gentile Christians accepted it." [...] This began to differentiate the Gentile Christian views of God from traditional Jewish teachings of the time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} cost of trauma includes both {{the amount of}} money spent on treatment and the loss of potential economic gain through absence from work. The average {{financial cost}} for the treatment of traumatic injury in the United States is approximately [...] per person, making it costlier than the treatment of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. One reason for the high cost of the treatment for trauma is the increased possibility of complications, which leads to the need for more interventions. Maintaining a trauma center is costly because they are open continuously and maintain a state of readiness to receive patients, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> none.
