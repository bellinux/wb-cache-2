5|$|Historians {{of science}} {{differ in their}} views of the {{significance}} of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was the driving force behind these scientific achievements.|$|E

An Anglicised interpretation of Islamic architecture is <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> the Brighton Royal Pavilion, completed in 1823, and the Sezincote House, completed a few years earlier. Both these buildings drew heavily on the Islamic motifs, which were later to be evident at the Vorontsov Palace and were new and novel designs {{at the time of the}} Prince's visit to England.|$|E

Singing and playing musical instruments are common pastimes among the resident population, who take pride in the traditions and role of music in cultural life.|$|E

5|$|One {{approach}} to sustainable living, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> small-scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages, seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of simple living, which maximize self-sufficiency particularly in food production.

5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid art, as <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E

Its Γ-limit is the limit of the Γ-limits of the original problems. This result not only provides a common basic principle {{for a number of}} linearization and homogenization results in elasticity theory. It also allows for new applications as we <b>exemplify</b> <b>by</b> proving that geometric linearization and homogenization of multi-well energy functionals commute...|$|R
5|$|Parthian art, {{with its}} {{distinct}} use of frontality in portraiture, was lost and abandoned with the profound {{cultural and political}} changes brought by the Sassanid Empire. However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there. This is <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> the early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the Dura-Europos synagogue, a temple {{in the same city}} dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local Mithraeum.|$|E

Our framework elegantly solves the motion retargeting problem and produces realistic non-rigid surface deformation with minimal user interaction. Realistic animations can easily be generated from a variety of input motion descriptions, which we <b>exemplify</b> <b>by</b> applying our method to both marker-free and marker-based motion capture data...|$|R
5|$|The Umayyad Caliphate had conquered Syria, Egypt, and North Africa {{from the}} {{predominantly}} Christian Byzantine Empire, and Hispania from the Visigothic Kingdom. In North Africa, the Umayyad empire eventually collapsed {{and a number}} of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the Aghlabids, who attacked Italy in the 9th century. Pisa, Genoa, and the Principality of Catalonia began to battle various Muslim kingdoms for control of the Mediterranean Basin, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> the Mahdia campaign and battles at Majorca and Sardinia.|$|E
5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} rich in Christian iconography, which {{reflects}} the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, <b>exemplified</b> <b>by</b> the Devotio Moderna movement.
