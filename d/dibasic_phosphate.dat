The results were compared with those for pure water. Three thermodynamic solubility models were tested using the Aspen Simulation PlusTM software: 1) Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS), where the a and b parameters were evaluated with the Wong and Sandler mixing rules (PRWS) and the activity coefficients were defined using the functional groups with the modified UNIFAC method 2) Electrolytic non-random two liquids (ELECNRTL) with the Redlich-Kwong equation of state for aqueous and mixed solvent applications 3) The completely predictive Soave-Redlich-Kwong (PSRK) equation of state. CO 2 solubility was a strong function of sodium <b>dibasic</b> <b>phosphate</b> concentrations. The predictions of the PRWS EOS agreed well with the experimental data in the pressure and temperature ranges tested.

40|$|Atomic {{basis of}} the {{exquisite}} specificity of phosphate and sulfate transport receptors. We have determined, by the method of x-ray crystallography, the 1. 7 Å resolution three-dimensional structures of the ligand-bound form of the phosphate receptor {{as well as the}} sulfate receptor. These protein structures provide an unprecedented atomic-level understanding of the mechanism governing the exquisite specificity of each receptor. Although they lack amino acid sequence homology, both receptors have very similar three-dimensional structure. The structure consists of two globular domains separated by a deep cleft which contains the ligand-binding site. The bound phosphate and sulfate are totally devoid of water of hydration. The bound phosphate is tightly held in place by 12 hydrogen bonds, 11 with donor and 1 with acceptor groups. The acceptor group (an Asp carboxylate side chain) plays three key roles. It confers specificity by directly recognizing one proton of either the monobasic or <b>dibasic</b> <b>phosphate.</b> It also assists in the recognition of another proton of the monobasic phosphate. Finally, because of charge repulsion, it disallows binding of fully ionized sulfate. The sulfate bound to the sulfate receptor makes seven hydrogen bonds with uncharged polar groups exclusively.

All diets contained equivalent amounts of calcium. The occurrence of tibial dyschondroplasia was determined by visual scoring of the epiphyseal growth plate in the distal end of the tibiotarsus. None of the anions added to the diet at levels of 160 meq/kg or less affected body weight or feed consumption.

40|$|The etiology, {{clinical}} presentation, {{and management}} of hypophosphatemia are reviewed. Phosphorus is a major intracellular anion and {{plays an important role}} in many biochemical pathways relating to normal physiologic functions. Approximately 60 to 90 % of the 1 to 1. 5 g of daily dietary phosphorus intake is absorbed, and of that amount, about two thirds is excreted in the urine. The overall incidence of hypophosphatemia is about 2 to 3 % of all hospitalized patients. Factors associated with hypophosphatemia include phosphate-binding antacid therapy, nasogastric suction, liver disease, sepsis, alcoholism, and acidosis associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. Patients receiving parenteral nutrient solutions were also at higher risk for hypophosphatemia before the routine supplementation of these formulations with phosphate. Patients with hypophosphatemia may be asymptomatic or may experience weakness, malaise, anorexia, bone pain, and respiratory arrest. The major systems involved include the neuromuscular, hematologic, and skeletal systems. Phosphorus-containing products used to treat hypophosphatemia are a combination of monobasic and <b>dibasic</b> <b>phosphate</b> salts. Therefore, it is essential to calculate doses in millimoles rather than milligrams or milliequivalents to more accurately reflect the phosphorus concentration and to avoid potentially serious dosage errors. Normal daily requirements are readily maintained by dietary sources of phosphorus such as milk products or may be supplemented by phosphate-containing products administered orally or intravenously.

Statistically significant differences were found among the drug release profile from different classes of polymeric matrices. Higher polymeric content (40 %) in the matrix decreased the release rate of drug because of increased tortuosity and decreased porosity.

On the other hand, replacement of Emcompress or anhydrous <b>dibasic</b> calcium <b>phosphate</b> for mannitol significantly retarded the release rate of baclofen, except for E-L 100 (pH-dependent polymer).
