50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>glues</b> usually {{consist of}} one base {{material}} with various additives. The composition is usually formulated {{to have a}} glass transition temperature (onset of brittleness) below the lowest service temperature and a suitably high melt temperature as well. The degree of crystallization should {{be as high as}} possible but within limits of allowed shrinkage. The melt viscosity and the crystallization rate (and corresponding open time) can be tailored for the application. Faster crystallization rate usually implies higher bond strength. To reach the properties of semicrystalline polymers, amorphous polymers would require molecular weights too high and, therefore, unreasonably high melt viscosity; the use of amorphous polymers in <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesives is usually only as modifiers. Some polymers can form hydrogen bonds between their chains, forming pseudo-cross-links which strengthen the polymer.|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} 70’s simple system for <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> <b>glue</b> binding within the office market started to appear {{but the market}} was fragmented, some {{companies}} produced the machines and others produced the supplies. Bindomatic was founded in 1974 {{under the name of}} Semotex and it started as a supplier within the graphic industry. When Semotex started to import and sell the hot melt systems, the idea came up to introduce hot melt office binding as a system, where both machines and supplies can be purchased from one supplier and where the two parts are tested and proven to work in combination to provide a good final product. After the invention of the Bindomatic System by Sture Wiholm, the company owner, and Jan Sabelström, the technical manager, Semotex more or less turned over to only produce and sell hot melt office binding. The first binding machine was the Bindomatic 2000.|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{analysis is}} reported of reduction opportunities for {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) emissions in manufacturing office furniture partitions, aimed at contributing to {{efforts to improve the}} sustainability of the process. A pollution prevention methodology is utilized. The purpose is to provide practical options for VOC emissions reductions during the manufacturing of office furniture partitions, but the concepts can be generally applied to the wood furniture industry. Baseline VOC emissions for a typical plant are estimated using a mass balance approach. The feasibility analysis expands on a preliminary screening to identify viable pollution prevention options using realistic criteria and weightings, and is based on technical, environmental and economic considerations. The measures deemed feasible include the implementation of several best management practices, ceasing the painting of non-visible parts, switching to <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> backwrapping <b>glue,</b> application of solvent recycling and modification of the mechanical clip attachment. Implementation, measurement and control plans are discussed for the measures considered feasible, which can enhance the sustainability of the manufacturing of office furniture partitions. Reducing VOC emissions using the measures identified can, in conjunction with other measures, improve the sustainability of the manufacturing process. sustainability; volatile organic compound; VOC; manufacturing; office furniture; pollution prevention; emissions...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{dispersion}} is molecular {{dispersion of}} drug in a polymer matrix {{which leads to}} improved solubility and hence better bioavailability. Solvent evaporation technique was employed to prepare films of different combinations of polymers, plasticizer, and a modal drug sulindac to narrow down on a few polymer-plasticizer-sulindac combinations. The sulindac-polymer-plasticizer combination that was stable with good film forming properties was processed by <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> mixing, a technique close to <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion, to predict its behavior in a <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion process. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> mixing is not a substitute to <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion but is an aid in predicting the formation of molecularly dispersed form of a given set of drug-polymer-plasticizer combination in a <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> extrusion process.

50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> {{adhesive}} (HMA), {{also known}} as hot glue, {{is a form of}} thermoplastic adhesive that is commonly supplied in solid cylindrical sticks of various diameters, designed to be melted in an electric hot glue gun. The gun uses a continuous-duty heating element to <b>melt</b> the plastic <b>glue,</b> which the user pushes through the gun either with a mechanical trigger mechanism on the gun, or with direct finger pressure. The glue squeezed out of the heated nozzle is initially hot enough to burn and even blister skin. The glue is tacky when hot, and solidifies in a few seconds to one minute. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesives can also be applied by dipping or spraying.|$|R

Bees wax and cetyl alcohol were evaluated as <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> coating materials for taste masking. Drug containing pellets were prepared and coated using <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> technique. Threshold bitterness concentrations of drugs and taste evaluation of <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> coated pellets were determined by panel method. The pellets of all the formulation batches were in the size range of 825 to 995 μ after <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> coating. Pellets exhibited uniformity of content in the range of 97. 6 – 101. 1 %. Threshold bitterness concentration of both the drugs was found to be about 300 µg/ml. Amount of drug released from all pellets batches was less than threshold bitterness concentration for first 5 minutes indicating that taste of the drug was completely masked. Taste evaluation study of <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> coated pellets by panel method revealed that about 80 % of the volunteers sensed no bitter taste even at 2 and 3 % coating level whereas none of the volunteer reported bitter taste for pellets coated at 5 %w/w level.

40|$|Hot-melt {{adhesives}} {{have been}} commercially {{available for a}} long time and they are used in a wide range of applications. In recent years, packaging industry prefers to use <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive based on polyolefin because polyolefin provide ease of processing, low off-taste, low smell and heat seal ability. In this research, it is intended to develop the formulation for Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive with the same properties of polyolefin based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive since EVA offers low cost than polyolefin. To develop new formulation of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive (HMA), EVA copolymers with various melt index were blended together with resin, wax and antioxidant in the molten state. The performance of new formulations was compared with commercial polyolefin <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive. Three formulations of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive have been developed. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature and melt viscosity were studied by using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Brookfield Viscometer. From DSC curve, the result indicated that three new formulations and commercial polyolefin has a glass transition temperature between - 20 0 C and - 25 0 C. Implying, the EVA copolymer blend with resin is compatible. The peak observed on the heating curve corresponded to the melting point, Tm. EVA-HMA 1 and EVA-HMA 3 is comparable with commercial polyoelfin based on identical broad peak. The melt viscosity of all EVA HMA formulation and commercial polyolefin HMA decrease with increasing the temperature. <b>Hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive with lower viscosity will have more flexibility to flow out, indicating that it has better wetting properties when applied to the substrate. EVA-HMA 3 have the best performance to be made the <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive for the packaging industry because of comparable thermal properties and viscosity at desired temperature with commercial polyolefin adhesive. Further research needs to be conducted on EVA-HMA 3 for other properties to confirm its viability in replacing the commercial polyolefin based <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesive in packaging industry...|$|R
40|$|Several {{thermoanalytical}} {{methods were}} used to assess the compatibility of EBA (copolymer of ethylene and n-butyl acrylate) <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> containing tackifiers of different nature (pentaerythritol rosin ester, polyterpene resin, aliphatic hydrocarbon resin, aromatic hydrocarbon resin, and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon resin). The influence of the compatibility of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad tackifier compatibility, even though aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> were obtained with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion. EBA containing aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifier was exceptional because of even being incompatible, it showed high tack. Financial support by REPSOL (Móstoles, Madrid, Spain) is acknowledged...|$|R

Although {{the influence of}} the addition of microcrystalline and Fischer-Tropsch waxes on the properties of ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> has been studied, the addition of polypropylene wax has not been considered yet. In this study, different polypropylene waxes (polypropylene wax – PP, – maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene wax – PPMA – copolymer of polypropylene and 10. 9 [*]wt. % polyethylene wax – PP-E) were added to EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> and they were characterized by Brookfield viscosity, softening point measurement, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, plate–plate rheology, tack, and single-lap shear adhesion. The viscosities of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melts</b> containing polypropylene waxes were relatively high, the highest viscosity corresponded to the formulation containing PP-E wax which also showed pseudoplasticity. The change in viscoelastic properties (i. e., from dominantly viscous to dominantly elastic) was produced at lower temperature in EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> containing PP-E wax, this adhesive exhibited the highest tack. On the other hand, the addition of acrylic PPMA wax increased the adhesion of EVA <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> but lower tack was obtained. Finally, the PP-E wax was more compatible with EVA copolymer than the other polypropylene waxes...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePrecision {{assembly}} of hybrid micro systems requires {{not only a}} high precision handling and adjusting of the parts but also a highly accurate and fast bonding technique. In this field adhesive technology {{is one of the}} major joining techniques. At the Collaboration Research Center 516, a batch process based on a joining technique using <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesives was developed. This technique allows the coating of micro components with <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> in a batch. The coating process is followed by the joining process. Due to this, the time between coating and joining can be designed variably. Because of the short set times of <b>hot</b> <b>melt</b> adhesives short joining times are possible. For this assembly process adapted heat management and adapted gripper systems are very important. Primarily, the conception and construction of suitable grippers, which realize the complex requirements of the heat management, meet a high challenge.
