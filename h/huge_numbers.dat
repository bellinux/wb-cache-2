5|$|Sport {{has been}} both {{one of the most}} unifying {{cultural}} forces in Northern England and, thanks to local rivalries such as the Lancashire–Yorkshire Roses rivalry, one of the most divisive. As <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of people moved into recently-built cities with little cultural heritage, local sports teams offered the population a sense of place and identity that was otherwise absent.|$|E

5|$|The {{shooting}} {{down of the}} plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours. An interim government took over, headed by de facto-leader Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, which began ordering the systematic killing of <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of Tutsi, {{as well as some}} politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed.|$|E
5|$|By nightfall on 18 August, the North Korean 4th Division {{had been}} annihilated; <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of deserters had {{weakened}} its numbers during the fight, {{but by that}} time, Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by the U.S. forces. Scattered groups of North Korean soldiers fled back across the Naktong, pursued by American planes and artillery fire. The next day, the remains of 4th Division had withdrawn across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left {{a large number of}} artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans later pressed into service.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to other}} parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the {{development}} of the Argentine economy, mostly because of the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations, which would have demanded <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of slave workers. Colonial Brazil, for example, imported as many as 2.5 million Africans in the 18th century. By contrast, an estimated 100,000 African slaves arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many were destined for Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of {{newcomers}} were driving Native Americans {{out of their}} traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E
5|$|NGC 2613 is {{a spiral}} galaxy of {{magnitude}} 10.5 which appears spindle-shaped {{as it is}} almost edge-on to observers on Earth. Henize 2-10 is a dwarf galaxy which lies some 30 million light-years away. It is notable for having a black hole around a million solar masses at its centre. Known as a starburst galaxy due to very high rates of star formation, it has a bluish colour due to the <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of young stars within it.|$|E

These may include vagrant rarities, including a western sandpiper in 2012, a displaying great snipe in 2011, a trumpeter finch in 2010 and a collared pratincole in 2009. In order to maintain a good habitat, parts of the reed bed are cut and sold for thatch each year to establish a mosaic of plants of different ages.|$|E
5|$|They {{encountered}} Native Americans, {{who would}} sometimes demand provisions for passage, but none were given {{and none of}} the incidents ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting bison, which roamed the Great Plains in <b>huge</b> <b>numbers.</b> Despite being a source of food, the bison were a danger as their stampedes could destroy property and kill irreplaceable stock. In southeastern Idaho, the California Trail separated from the Oregon, and Buck and some {{of the rest of the}} party split off there; they settled in California and remained friends with Meeker until their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings can eat <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of berries, each bird {{sometimes}} consuming {{several hundred}} a day, {{more than double}} its own weight. One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster berries in six hours, and defecating every four minutes. Waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds. Waxwings forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century the {{population}} and physical extent of London grew greatly. The increasing resident population and the development of a commuting population arriving by train each day led to a high level of traffic congestion with <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of carts, cabs, and omnibuses filling the roads and up to 200,000 people entering the City of London, the commercial heart, each day on foot. By 1850 there were seven railway termini around the urban centre of London: London Bridge and Waterloo to the south, Shoreditch and Fenchurch Street to the east, Euston and King's Cross to the north, and Paddington to the west. Only Fenchurch Street station was within the City.|$|E
5|$|Jun and Six are {{dispatched}} on {{a covert}} mission {{to assess the}} Covenant's strength and discover an invasion force gathering on the planet. The following morning, Noble Team assists UNSC forces in assaulting a Covenant ground base. When a massive Covenant super-carrier joins the fight, Jorge and Six {{take part in a}} plan to destroy the super-carrier using a makeshift bomb. The Spartans use starfighters to infiltrate a smaller Covenant corvette, prepare the bomb and set the corvette on a docking course with the carrier, but the bomb's timer is damaged. Left with no choice, Jorge stays behind and sacrifices himself to destroy the super-carrier. Moments later, <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of Covenant ships arrive at Reach and begin a full-scale invasion.|$|E

However, it is better known for its food stalls in the evening, which sell local street food. It is named after the Hindu saint Baba Maneknath. Parts of Ahmedabad are known for their folk art. The artisans of Rangeela pol make tie-dyed bandhinis, while the cobbler shops of Madhupura sell traditional mojdi (also known as mojri) footwear. Idols of Ganesha and other religious icons are made in <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> in the Gulbai Tekra area. The shops at the Law Garden sell mirror work handicraft.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} side, {{there were still}} <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of Roman Catholics. Some conformed, bending with the times, hoping {{that there would be}} a fresh reverse. Vestments were still hidden, golden candlesticks bequeathed, chalices kept. The Mass was still celebrated in some places {{alongside}} the new Communion service but was more difficult than before. Both Roman Catholic priests and laity lived a double life, apparently conforming, but avoiding taking the oath of conformity. Only as time passed did recusancy—refusal to attend Protestant services—became more common. Jesuits and seminary priests, trained in Douai and Rome to make good the losses of English priests, encouraged this.|$|E
5|$|The spells of the Book of the Dead {{made use}} of several magical {{techniques}} which {{can also be seen}} in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. Everyday magic {{made use of}} amulets in <b>huge</b> <b>numbers.</b> Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value. A number of spells also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva.|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} of the Chilean Andes are an early group of eruptions, dated from the Oligocene and the Early Miocene (33.3–20.2mya). The scale of the eruptive events that {{produced}} these features remains unclear. Further east, in the actual range, are <b>huge</b> <b>numbers</b> of eruptions. Between 15.3 and 6.4mya, widespread volcanism took place, followed by extensive folding; this process then repeated itself from 18.4 to 13.7 mya during the Miocene. Beginning 6.4 mya the Chilean Andes were quiet, though whether or not this quiet period took place throughout all of the Andes remains unknown. Central Chilean volcanoes became active once again around 2.5mya, and have erupted almost continuously since.|$|E
