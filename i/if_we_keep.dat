500|$|Having conferred with McAuliffe {{at length}} the {{previous}} evening, Middleton left Bastogne after full daylight on 19 December, {{and set up}} headquarters in a school building in Neufchâteau, 17miles to the southwest. [...] For the next several days, Bastogne was defended by the 101st, along with elements of CCR and some corps artillery assets that Middleton was able to supply. McAuliffe had units scattered in towns surrounding Bastogne, which bore the brunt of attacks by the Panzer Lehr Division and Second Panzer Division. At one point on 19 December, some of McAuliffe's units wanted to fall back, and McAuliffe concurred, calling Middleton for his approval. Middleton's response was, [...] "we can't hold Bastogne <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> falling back" [...] and the units were ordered to stay.|$|E
500|$|Johnson was {{candid about}} his performance: [...] "We had a decent car and {{ran in the}} top five and top 10 but just didn't end up {{finishing}} there." [...] Harvick was somewhat more upbeat, saying, [...] "We didn't have a great day. We didn't have a great weekend, honestly, and (fifth) says a lot about this team. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> doing that on our bad days, we will be in good shape." [...] The race result left Hamlin leading the Drivers' Championship with 5,230 points. Bowyer, who finished first, moved to second on 5,195, ten points ahead of Harvick and twenty-seven ahead of Kyle Busch. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 197 points. Toyota remained second with 165 points. Ford followed with 123 points, fourteen points ahead of Dodge in fourth. 3.68 million people watched the race on television. The race took two hours, fifty-eight minutes and twenty-two seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.477 seconds.|$|E
500|$|The comic {{efficacy}} of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He {{has a low}} intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as [...] "creatively brilliant in his stupidity". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and [...] "is devoted to his stomach". His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to [...] "change ... his mind when things go badly". Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode [...] "Duffless" [...] (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short [...] "Family Portrait". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation, because doing so [...] "seems sadistic. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> it that he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily." [...] Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would [...] "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped. Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.|$|E

Policymakers can start this critical process by examining {{the findings of the}} Homeland Security Committee Task Force’s Final Report on Combating Foreign Fighter Travel." [...] D'Amato concluded, [...] "While the Homeland Security Committee report does not offer any lasting solutions to the crisis we are in, one thing is certain: <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> doing what we are doing, we will most certainly be further away from that vision of a world without terrorist organizations than we were a few years ago." [...] The report became a resource cited by the Brookings Institution which noted terrorist entities use tools online in order to promote violent extremism via the Web to their followers and for recruitment purposes.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 May, one {{day after}} the {{violence}} in Medan ended, President Suharto left the country for a Group of 15 summit in Cairo, Egypt. Prior to his departure, he called on the public to end the protests. To the Suara Pembaruan daily newspaper, he said, [...] "I judge that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> going like this there will be no progress." [...] He later returned to Indonesia earlier than scheduled on 14 May, when violence in Jakarta reached its worst. The campus of Trisakti University in Grogol, West Jakarta, became the site of a gathering of 10,000 students on 12 May. They had planned on marching south toward the Parliament building, but security forces refused to allow them to leave the campus. When the students conducted a sit-in outside the campus gates, shots broke out after rocks were allegedly thrown at police. In the ensuing chaos, four students were killed.|$|E
