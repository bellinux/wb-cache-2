40|$|Abstract- To build {{a digital}} to analog converter, that only {{receives}} digital signal that can only receives digital signal and produces only analog signal. A converter in which <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> signals are changed to essentially proportional analog signals. Abbreviated DAC a device for converting information in the forms of combination of discrete(usually binary) states or signal to information {{in the form of}} combinations of discrete(usually binary) states or signal to information in the form of value or magnitude of some characteristics of signal, in relation to standard or reference signal. Digital-toanalog (D/A) converters (sometimes called DACs) are used to present the results of digital computation, storage, or transmission, typically for graphical display or for the control of devices that operate with continuously varying quantities. D/A converter circuits are also used in the design of analog-to-digital converters that employ feedback techniques, such as successive-approximation and counter-comparator types. In such applications, the D/A converter may not necessarily appear as a separately identifiable entity. The fundamental circuit of most D/A converters involves a voltage or current reference; a resistive “ladder network ” that derives weighted currents or voltages, usually as discrete fractions of the reference; and a set of switches, operated by the <b>digital</b> <b>input,</b> that determines which currents or voltages will be summed to constitute the output. The output of the D/A converter is proportional to the product of the <b>digital</b> <b>input</b> value and the reference. In many applications, the reference is fixed, and the output bears a fixed proportion to the <b>digital</b> <b>input.</b> In other applications, the reference, as well as the <b>digital</b> <b>input,</b> can vary; a D/A converter that is used i...|$|R
