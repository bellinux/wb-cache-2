40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper reports {{quantitative}} {{mechanical characterization}} of silicon carbide (SiC) nanowires (NWs) via in situ tensile tests inside {{scanning electron microscopy}} using a microelectromechanical system. The NWs are synthesized using the vapor−liquid−solid process with growth direction of ⟨ 111 ⟩. They consist of three types of structures, pure face-centered cubic (3 C) structure, 3 C structure with an <b>inclined</b> <b>stacking</b> fault (SF), and highly defective structure, in a periodic fashion along the NW length. The SiC NWs are found to deform linear elastically until brittle fracture. Their fracture origin is identified in the 3 C structures with inclined SFs, rather than the highly defective structures. The fracture strength increases as the NW diameter decreases from 45 to 17 nm, approaching the theoretical strength of 3 C SiC. The size effect on fracture strength of SiC NWs is attributed to the size-dependent defect density rather than the surface effect that is dominant for single crystalline NWs...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of GaN layers {{grown by}} metal organic vapour phase epitaxy on (0001) sapphire substrates using a novel precursor for deposition of AlN buffer layers {{has been investigated}} and compared to layers grown using low temperature GaN buffer layers and state-of-the-art material. It {{has been shown that}} the quality of layers grown using the novel precursor is comparable to the state-of-the-art material. TEM analysis has been performed of multiple quantum wells of InGaN grown within GaN epitaxial layers by metal organic vapour phase epitaxy. Elementally sensitive TEM techniques have been used to determine the spatial distribution of In and Ga within these structures. Fluctuations in In sensitive images are observed on the nm-scale. Clear evidence of segregation of In during layer growth has been seen. Models of the In segregation are in good agreement with experimental results. Elementally sensitive techniques have been used to investigate the elemental distributions in TiAl and NiAu contacts to GaN. Annealing of TiAl contacts has been seen to result in the formation of a thin interfacial Ti rich phase, and of N depletion at the surface of the GaN layer to the depth of tens of nm. Annealing NiAu contacts at 700 deg. C was seen to result in the formation of Ga-rich interfacial phases, of both crystalline and amorphous structure. ZnS and ZnCdS layers grown on (001) GaP supplied by the University of Hull have been investigated. ZnS layers were found to contain a high density of <b>inclined</b> <b>stacking</b> faults throughout the layer, originating from the interface with the substrate. Energy sensitive techniques have been used to investigate ZnCdS quantum well structures. The use of a ZnCdS superlattice structure around a ZnCdS quantum well to approximate a reduced barrier was seen to result in less thickness variations than when no barrier was used.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} growth and examination of thin Si and Ge films. These were deposited by sublimation and evaporation techniques in UHV, using apparatus constructed by the author, The source of deposited material was heated by electron bombardment, while the substrates were heated either directly by the passage of an electric current or indirectly upon a Si bar, depending upon their electrical conductivity. The various substrates used were Si and the insulators sapphire, diamond and β-SiC. The grown films were studied by use of the optical microscope, the transmission electron microscope and the scanning electron microscope. The main object of the work was to investigate the structural perfection of these films, to deduce information concerning their growth mechanisms and to compare the observations with suitable theoretical models. The initial growth of Si films on unpreheated (111) Si substrates, held at temperatures around 900 °C, was deduced to have been by nucleation (after an initial induction period), since irregular Si growth centres were produced. These eventually overlapped to give a channelled film containing few crystallographic defects. The dependence of the number density of Si growth centres upon deposition conditions was correlated with different theoretical relationships derived separately by Joyce et al (1967) and Logan (1969). It was deduced that the smallest stable nuclei contained 3 Si atoms, and that the activation energy for surface diffusion of Si was ~ 0. 55 eV (Joyce et al) or ~ 1. 1 eV (Logan). These observations and deductions were compared with analogous results obtained by Joyce et al, who grew Si films by silane pyrolysis. All the results were discussed in relation to initial growth processes, and various suggestions were put forward to account for certain unexpected features. Possible impurity effects were considered in detail and related to observed film growth characteristics. When (111) Si substrates were cleaned using heat treatment at 1250 °C in UHV surface steps were generated, and these moved across the substrates in a [1 &# 773; 1 &# 773; 2] type direction. When Si deposition was initiated the direction of step motion reversed as growth took place. The steps were pinned in many places by impurity particles, which caused the production of deep pits in the grown films. Transmission electron energy loss analysis showed that the particles were SiC. The dependence of the Si film growth upon deposition conditions, the state of the substrate surface and the presence of contaminating gases was also investigated. The nature of both sublimation and growth step motion across substrate surfaces was analysed using theoretical models, and this showed that in the absence of pinning effects, the motion was generally that expected for a clean surface. Ge films were deposited on to (111) Si substrates at temperatures around 800 °C. The thinnest films were composed of growth centres which were mostly triangular in shape, and this showed that initial growth had been by nucleation. A tentative comparison of experimental data with theoretical models indicated that the smallest stable Ge nucleus may have been composed of 4 atoms. TEM examination of the Ge films showed that they grew with the same crystallographic orientation as their Si substrates. However, the films contained many crystallographic defects, and some of the most prominent were continuous networks of misfit dislocations, which occurred over each entire Ge/Si interface. The spacings of the dislocations in such networks were non-ideal, and this was taken to indicate that considerable Ge/Si alloy formation had taken place. Deposition of Si on to heated (0001) sapphire substrates gave films which grew by initial nucleation with the epitaxial relationships (111) Si //(0001) Al 2 O 3 and [11 &# 773; 0] Si //[112 &# 773; 0] Al 2 O 3. The thinnest films were composed of equal proportions of two 60 ° rotational twins, and often contained large numbers of planar defects. However, films a substantial fraction of a micron in thickness contained misorientations of a more general nature, and with increasing thickness ultimately became polycrystalline. High resolution TEM studies provided no evidence of an interfacial misfit dislocation network, but instead indicated that a chemical reaction had taken place between the Si and the sapphire during deposition. Si films were also grown upon both (111) diamond and (111) βSiC substrates, and once again initial growth was by nucleation. Thicker films on diamond substrates exhibited significant orientation retention despite the very large crystallographic mismatch. Work was also carried out involving the high resolution TEM studies of closely spaced misfit edge dislocation networks at the Ge/(111) Si interface. It was generally possible to obtain either fringe or structural images depending upon the nature of the diffraction conditions, and this behaviour was examined in detail and discussed with special reference to the work of Thölén (1970). Use of the weak-beam technique (Cockayne et al, 1969) enabled the network structures to be investigated in detail. While it was observed that all the intrinsic dislocation nodes had a relatively uniform extension, the extrinsic nodes had mostly a much smaller extension and approximately half appeared to be completely contracted. Also, using 111 &# 773; type Bragg reflections, the intensity of the TEM contrast exhibited by the different kinds of node stacking fault were markedly dissimilar, and depended upon the sense of the deviation from the exact Bragg position. These studies were extended to observations of dislocation networks produced by deformation in single crystal Si. Measurements of the dimensions of intrinsic nodes, which were all extended, yielded values for the intrinsic stacking fault energy in Si of ~ 58 or ~ 71 ergs cm - 2, depending upon the type of measurement employed. Only half the extrinsic nodes were extended, and this behaviour was interpreted in terms of an energy barrier to node extension. Using 111 &# 773; type reflections, the node contrast behaviour was analogous to that observed in the Ge/(111) Si system. This was correlated with the contrast behaviour of <b>inclined</b> <b>stacking</b> faults, and the image intensity appeared to depend upon the sign of (g. R) s. Using 224 &# 773; type reflections, dissociated dislocation contrast was interpreted in terms of interactions between the strain fields of the bounding partial dislocations. In conclusion, suggestions were put forward concerning possible extensions of the present work, and these involved both film growth studies and investigations of TEM contrast behaviour. </p...|$|E

It rattled on Jimmy’s slickers and stung his face, but the cold was mild by {{comparison}} with what he had endured in the North, and he sat in the shelter of the coaming, glancing up the Sound every now and then. Presently a sleet-storm broke upon him, and when it blew away a blinking white light and a colored one broke out of the driving cloud. Jimmy lighted a blue flare and, starting the engine, headed for the end of the island. When he stopped, the steamer was close ahead, a lofty, gray mass, banded with rows of lights. She rolled as she crossed the tide-stream, and he could see the foam about her big side-wheels and the smoke that swept from her <b>inclined</b> <b>stacks.</b> It did not look as if she were stopping, and he was about to get out of her way when a deep blast of her whistle broke through the turmoil of the sea. In another minute he was abreast of the gangway and caught the rope thrown down, though he kept the launch off at a few yards’ distance.|$|R

The bridge is made of identical floating modules. The modules are composed of prefabricated elements: two trusses, a pontoon and the footpath. The height of the trusses is integrated with the handrail. The sides of the pontoons are <b>inclined</b> to <b>stack</b> these elements during transport. The modules are assembled at the site. A completed module is fastened to the other modules of the bridge. The completed bridge is floated into position. Thanks to the combination of trusses and pontoons, the deformations under expected loadings are reduced considerately. Structurally the pontoons can be considered as flexible supports for the trussed bridge, spanning between the river banks...|$|R
40|$|Precipitation of {{metastable}} θ′ {{phase is}} a well known process that underlies age-hardening of Al-Cu alloys. The strength acquired is very sensitive to the morphology and spatial distribution of θ′, with the peak hardness corresponding to a fine distribution of precipitates with high length-to-thickness aspect ratio. Therefore, {{an understanding of the}} transformation mechanism between the matrix and θ′ and the factors affecting the nucleation barriers associated with its formation are crucial for an effective alloy design. Although the behaviour of the Al-Cu system has been a focus of intensive research for the large part of a century, the need still exists to elucidate the atomic mechanism of transformation. θ′ was traditionally considered to be a purely diffusional transformation product; however, several mechanisms have been proposed (Dahmen and Westmacott, Nie and Muddle) that recognised the existence of lattice correspondence between the Al-Cu matrix and θ′. The important feature of these mechanisms was a large shear component in the transformation strain, suggesting that the transformation may be diffusional-displacive in nature. This project was undertaken to investigate the special mode of transformation, autocatalytic nucleation, which features distinctive clusters of precipitates arranged into linear <b>inclined</b> <b>stacks</b> and cross-like arrays. The hypothesis tested was that such clustering of precipitates is the result of interaction between the shear component of the strain of the nucleus with the pre-existing microstructure, and that autocatalytic structures potentially reveal the nature of transformation strain. The thesis presents an assessment of the nucleation barriers associated with the formation of platelike inclusions, representative of a wide class of strengthening precipitates (θ′ and T 1 in Al-Cu and Al-Cu-Li, γ/γ′ in Al-Ag). It is demonstrated that existing estimates of interfacial energies and chemical driving forces do not explain the difficulty of precipitation in these systems, and that the influence of the shear component on the magnitude of the nucleation barrier is crucial and must be accounted in the model of the transformation mechanism. Further, a simple elastic interaction model based on earlier work of Perovic, Purdy and Brown is employed to demonstrate that the elastic interaction energy between the sheared nucleus and pre-existing large precipitate has the symmetry consistent with the distribution of θ′ in autocatalytic arrays. Finally, a diffuse interface phase field model is developed for the coherent nucleation and microstructure evolution in Al-Cu. The model takes into account the effect of local stress on the nucleation rate in an attempt to dynamically track how the nucleation of subsequent precipitates is facilitated by elastic interaction with the pre-existing microstructure. It is demonstrated that the traditional model of purely tetragonal transformation strain rules out the possibility of strain induced nucleation, due to weak interaction and the effective suppression of driving forces by matrix depletion. In the case of a sheared nucleus {{it was not possible to}} answer conclusively whether autocatalysis may be caused by the elastic interaction. Some precipitate clustering was evident, but characteristic linear stacks and cross-like arrays observed in experiments were not reproduced in the simulations. The results suggest that inhomogeneous distributions, when they occur, are the product of association with inhomogeneities, such as dislocations or grain boundaries, rather than a self-stimulating chain of strain induced nucleation events...|$|R
