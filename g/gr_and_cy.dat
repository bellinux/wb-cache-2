40|$|Type II {{antifreeze}} proteins (AFP), which {{inhibit the}} growth of seed ice crystals {{in the blood of}} certain fishes (sea raven, herring, and smelt), are the largest known fish AFPs and the only class for which detailed structural information is not yet available. However, a sequence homology has been recognized between these proteins and the carbohydrate recognition domain of C-type lectins. The structure of this domain from rat mannose-binding protein (MBP-A) has been solved by X-ray crystallography (Weis WI, Drickamer K, Hendrickson WA, 1992, Nature 360 : 127 - 134) and provided the coordinates for constructing the three-dimensional model of the 129 -amino acid Type II AFP from sea raven, to which it shows 19 % sequence identity. Multiple sequence alignments between Type II AFPs, pancreatic stone protein, MBP-A, and as many as 50 carbohydrate-recognition domain sequences from various lectins were performed to determine reliably aligned sequence regions. Successive molecular dynamics and energy minimization calculations were used to relax bond lengths and angles and to identify flexible regions. The derived structure contains two alpha-helices, two beta-sheets, and a high proportion of amino acids in loops and turns. The model is in good agreement with preliminary NMR spectroscopic analyses. It explains the observed differences in calcium binding between sea raven Type II AFP and MBP-A. Furthermore, the model proposes the formation of five disulfide bridges between <b>Cys</b> 7 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 18, <b>Cys</b> 35 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 125, <b>Cys</b> 69 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 100, <b>Cys</b> 89 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 111, <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 101 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 117.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{synthetic}} gene encoding human As(III) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyltransferase (hAS 3 MT) was expressed, and the purified enzyme was characterized. The synthetic enzyme is considerably more active than a cDNA-expressed enzyme using endogenous reductants thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin reductase (TR), NADPH, and reduced glutathione (GSH). Each {{of the seven}} cysteines (the four conserved residues, Cys 32, Cys 61, <b>Cys</b> 156, <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 206, <b>and</b> nonconserved, <b>Cys</b> 72, <b>Cys</b> 85, <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 250) was individually changed to serine. The nonconserved cysteine derivates were still active. None of the individual C 32 S, C 61 S, C 156 S, and C 206 S derivates were able to methylate As(III). However, the C 32 S and C 61 S enzymes retained the ability to methylate MAs(III). These observations suggest that <b>Cys</b> 156 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 206 play a different role in catalysis than that of <b>Cys</b> 32 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 61. A homology model built {{on the structure of}} a thermophilic orthologue indicates that <b>Cys</b> 156 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 206 form the As(III) binding site, whereas <b>Cys</b> 32 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 61 form a disulfide bond. Two observations shed light on the pathway of methylation. First, binding assays using the fluorescence of a single-tryptophan derivative indicate that As(GS) 3 binds to the enzyme much faster than inorganic As(III). Second, the major product of the first round of methylation is MAs(III), not MAs(V), and remains enzyme-bound until it is methylated a second time. We propose a ne...|$|R

We {{have studied the}} mechanism of their mutual inhibition in normal endothelial cells (HUVEC) in response to hypoxia, a physiological stress, and mitomycin C, which damages DNA. Dexamethasone (Dex) stimulates the degradation of endogenous <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> p 53 by the proteasome pathway in HUVEC under hypoxia and mitomycin C treatments, and also in hepatoma cells (HepG 2) under normoxia.

30|$|Recently, {{graphene}} (<b>GR)</b> <b>and</b> graphene oxide (GO) {{are widely}} used in fabricating advanced composites to provide elevated mechanical performance, excellent electrical properties, etc, due to their outstanding physiochemical properties [1 – 6]. Among them, many studies also demonstrate that <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> GO are promising flame retardants, which can act as barriers reducing the heat released, insulating against the transfer of combustion gases, and increasing residual char [7 – 9]. However, for <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> GO, achieving an excellent flame retardancy usually needs a little high loading [10]. Moreover, bare <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> GO possess a propensity to aggregate because of strong van der Waals attractions and π-π attraction between the nanosheets, resulting in decreasing their flame retardancy and deteriorating mechanical properties of polymer matrix. Therefore, the use of GR or GO alone as the flame retardant still remains a challenge.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMitochondrial {{thioredoxin}} (Trx 2) is an antioxidant, antiapoptotic factor, {{essential for}} cell viability. The cytoplasmic thioredoxin (Trx 1) is a cofactor and regulator of redox sensitive transcription {{factors such as}} the glucocorticoid receptor (<b>GR)</b> <b>and</b> NF-κB. Both transcription factors have been detected in mitochondria and a role in mitochondrial transcription regulation and apoptosis has been proposed. Here, we show using surface plasmon resonance <b>and</b> immunoprecepitation that <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> the p 65 subunit of NF-κΒ are Trx 2 interacting proteins. The interaction of Trx 2 with GR is independent of the presence of <b>GR</b> ligand <b>and</b> of redox conditions. The p 65 subunit of NF-κB can interact with Trx 2 in the oxidized, but not the reduced form. Using HEK 293 cell lines with increased or decreased expression of Trx 2, we show that Trx 2 modulates transcription of <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> NF-κB reporter genes. Moreover, Trx 2 overexpression modulates the mRNA levels of the mitochondrial COX I, and Cyt b, whose expression is known to be regulated by <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> NF-κB. Increased expression of Trx 2 differentially affects the expression of Cyt b. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone potentiates the expression of Cyt b, whereas TNFα downregulates it.

The time {{problem that}} {{concerns}} the General Relativity (<b>GR)</b> <b>and</b> Quantum Mechanics (QM) (contrary to QM, in GR {{is not a}} distinguished physical time) suggests that the irreversible separation of <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> QM during the inflation is the good idea- just there was created the two-component spacetime with very different properties of the two components. One component is directly associated with gravitational fields whereas the second with the Standard-Model interactions and particles. It causes that unification of <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> QM within the same methods is impossible. The separation of <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> QM follows from the succeeding phase transitions of the superluminal Higgs field that existence results from the extended GR (the phase transitions are described within the unique Scale-Symmetric Theory (SST)). The SST shows that both theories, i. e. <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> QM, start from correct but incomplete sets of initial conditions. It causes that, generally, they lead to experimental data so both are the correct theories but due to the incompleteness, there appear as well the not numerous incorrect solutions i. e. solutions that cannot be realized by Nature. The Scale-Symmetric Theory limits the <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> QM {{in such a way}} that there do not appear infinities, indeterminate mathematical forms, approximations, mathematical tricks and free parameters. Nature on lower and lower levels should be simpler and simpler, not more and more complex as it is in the not unique Loop Quantum Gravity or the not unique string/M-theory. We do not need new differential equations to solve the tremendous number of unsolved basic problems- we need a very simple theory that limits the <b>GR</b> <b>and</b> QM and describes the scales below the Planck scale and solves all problems above this scale and SST is such a theory.

ABCA 1 contains disulfide bond(s) between its N- and C-terminal halves, but it remains unclear whether disulfide bond formation is important for the functions of ABCA 1 and which cysteines are involved in disulfide bond formation. To answer these questions, we constructed > 30 ABCA 1 mutants in which 16 extracellular domain (ECD) cysteines were replaced with serines and examined disulfide bond formation, apoA-I binding, and HDL formation in these mutants. From the single cysteine replacements, two cysteines (<b>Cys</b> 75 <b>and</b> <b>Cys</b> 309) in ECD 1 were found to be essential for apoA-I binding.
