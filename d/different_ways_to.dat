5|$|Monster Inc. is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} and markets about 6,000 products, but {{is best known}} for audio and video cables. It also produces speakers, headphones, power strips, mobile accessories and audio devices for automobiles. The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince the industry that audio cables made a difference in audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that were attracted to the cable's profit margins.|$|E

5|$|There are <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} {{the value of}} c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} {{detailed}} study of common descent with modifications by expanding {{on the theme of}} coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sisimpur {{aired in}} Bangladesh. This co-production's {{goal was to}} improve school {{achievement}} and decrease drop-out rates for children before the third grade. This difficult co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street. Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present the languages of the region more evenly. Instead of showing words on screen, children were challenged to label objects verbally, thus learning that there are <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> say the same thing. The Workshop worked in conjunction with UNICEF to produce this show, {{to aid in the}} peace process between Albanians and Serbs. One of its goals was to demonstrate to Albanian and Serbian children that their counterparts were like them.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism in Lepidoptera is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} and the P. rebeli caterpillar is no exception as it displays polymorphism in its larval form. The P. rebeli caterpillars have two strategies for living and growing underground: to exist as fast-developing larvae (FDL) or slow-developing larvae (SDL). After the ant brood adopts the FDL, which comprise approximately 25% of the total P. rebeli larvae, the FDL complete growth the following spring and eclose (emerge as an adult from the pupa) in early summer to complete their life cycle. The SDL, which comprise 75% of P. rebeli larvae, do not grow much during the first year, but grow rapidly during {{the early part of}} the second summer and remain a second winter within the ant colonies. While both larva types ultimately form similar-sized pupae, their polymorphic growth rates could indicate alternative fitness strategies and <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> exploit the M. schencki food resources.|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} contains quests and puzzles {{that the}} player must solve. There are <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> complete quests, all {{with their own}} pitfalls. Peaceful resolutions {{can be made with}} characters and factions, though these can have ill effects, such as releasing secrets or worsening relations with other factions. Violent completion of quests may be faster, though they can result in the weakening of alliances between the player and the factions. In some of the puzzle sections, the player directs lasers to hit designated targets; others require the player to build with blocks, as in Minecraft. Puzzle sections were not featured in the base game. Upon completion of quests, the assisted factions reward the protagonist with Nuka-Cola bottle caps, one of the fictional currencies found throughout the Fallout series. The player character also gains experience points. Some of the quests include investigating minor mysteries, retrieving missing items, solving disagreements, and clearing out monster-infested areas.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} nonlinear gameplay, allowing multiple <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> achieve objectives. This includes travelling {{between different}} areas {{in an open}} world and making choices that determine the dialogues and order of events as well as alternative endings depending on who the player identifies as the culprit. However, {{only one of the}} characters is the true culprit, while the others are red herrings; if the player closes the case with the wrong culprit, then the player will face criticism from the police chief and need to re-open the case. The game includes a phone {{that could be used to}} manually dial any number, which is needed to contact several non-player characters. The game also features an inventory system requiring the examination and collection of items, which could be used as evidence later in the game.|$|E
5|$|Within the Southern Hemisphere {{tropical}} cyclones generally form on {{a regular}} basis between the African coast and the middle of the South Pacific. Tropical and Subtropical Cyclones have also been noted occurring in the Southern Atlantic Ocean at times. For various reasons including where tropical cyclones form, there are several <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> split the area between the American and African coasts. For instance the World Meteorological Organization define three different basins for the tracking and warning of tropical cyclones. These are the South-West Indian Ocean between the African Coast and 90°E, the Australian region between 90°E and 160°E and the South Pacific between 160°E and 120°W. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the whole region, but splits it at 135°E into the South Pacific and the Southern Indian Ocean.|$|E

Soon after Dreams From My Father was published he went into politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> improve {{their own lives and}} to serve their country.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and {{widespread}} poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialization, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see 1981 Brixton riot, 1981 Toxteth riots). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in the economic depression that hit the country before the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|E
5|$|The game's design also {{received}} acclaim. Carter from Destructoid {{thought that the}} fortress and the outpost system provided players {{with a sense of}} accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from Far Cry 3 and was uninspiring. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of Polygon praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.|$|E

5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E
