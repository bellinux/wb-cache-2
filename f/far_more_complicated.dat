Byzantine manuscripts, ivories, gold, silver and luxurious textiles were distributed throughout the West.

[...] Although the royal court had grown tired of the tragedy (preferring the more-escapist tragicomedy), the theatergoing public preferred the former. [...] This would change in the 1630s and 1640s when (influenced by the long baroque novels of the period) the tragicomedy—a heroic and magical adventure of knights and maidens—became the dominant genre.
