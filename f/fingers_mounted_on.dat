Rather than a chain moving continuously in one direction, the characters were on <b>fingers</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a bar that moved left-to-right and then right-to-left {{in front of the}} paper. An example was the IBM 1443.|$|E
25|$|Two {{versions}} of Kong's {{right hand and}} arm were constructed of steel, sponge rubber, rubber, and bearskin. The first hand was non articulated, <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a crane, and operated by grips for the scene in which Kong grabs at Driscoll in the cave. The other hand and arm had articulated <b>fingers,</b> was <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a lever to elevate it, and {{was used in the}} several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann. A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a crane, and used to stomp on Kong's victims.|$|R
50|$|The general {{process for}} scale age {{analysis}} preparation is as follows. During collection, {{it is important}} to make sure to sample the same area {{on the same side of}} each individual. Insert the scale into a scale envelope, then press on acetate slides or it can be washed in distilled water and rubbed between the <b>fingers.</b> <b>Mount</b> the scale <b>on</b> glass slides and dry in moderate heat, 37˚C or 100˚ F. The annuli may be counted using a microscope, microfilm reader, or other such magnification device.|$|R

40|$|A {{prosthetic}} device {{has been developed}} for below-the-elbow amputees. The device consists of a cuff, a stem, a housing, two hook-like fingers, an elastic band for holding the fingers together, and a brace. The <b>fingers</b> are pivotally <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a housing that is secured to the amputee's upper arm with the brace. The stem, which also contains a cam, is rotationally mounted within the housing and is secured to the cuff, which fits over the amputee's stump. By rotating the cammed stem between the fingers with the lower arm, the amputee can open and close the fingers...|$|R
40|$|Hemiparetic patients, such as stroke survivors, {{have limited}} {{functionality}} {{in one of}} their hands and must constantly face challenges in completing simple bimanual tasks of daily living. A new type of wearable robot, namely Supernumerary Robotic Fingers (or SR Fingers for short), was developed to augment the capability of the human hand such that a variety of prehensile and manipulation tasks can be performed single handedly. These wearable robotic fingers may provide chronic hemiparetic patients with the assistance they need to lead independent and productive lives. The aim of this thesis, besides designing a lightweight prototype to emulate the functionality of a second hand, is to address fundamental challenges associated with performing tasks with a single hand assisted by the SR Fingers. First, the robot must follow and support the human hand as the control decision evolves. A postural synergy-based control algorithm is developed to integrate the grasping motion of the SR Fingers with that of the human fingers so the users can control the robot in an implicit and intuitive manner as if it were part of their own body. Second, unlike a robot sitting on a table, the SR <b>Fingers</b> are <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> the human forearm and, thereby, the human hand motion during manipulation disturbs the position and orientation of the robot. A data-driven latent space impedance control method is used to compensate for this disturbance such that the robot can secure the object {{and at the same time}} allow natural human movement to be carried out during manipulation. Simulations and experiments have demonstrated that a pair of robotic fingers can assist the user in performing single-handed grasping and manipulation tasks without requiring explicit commands. by Faye Y.

5000|$|Lenses are not labeled or sold {{according}} to their angle of view, but rather by their focal length, usually expressed in millimeters. But this specification is insufficient to compare lenses for different cameras because field of view also depends on the sensor size. For example, a 50 mm lens <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a Nikon D3 (a full-frame camera) provides approximately the same field of view as a 32 mm lens <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a Sony α100 (an APS-C camera). Conversely, the same lens can produce different fields of view when <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> different cameras. For example, a 35 mm lens <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a Canon EOS 5D (full-frame) provides a slightly wide-angle view, while the same lens <b>mounted</b> <b>on</b> a Canon EOS 400D (APS-C) provides a [...] "normal" [...] or slightly telephoto view.|$|R
