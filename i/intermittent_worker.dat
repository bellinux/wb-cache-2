40|$|Background: Retirement from {{paid work}} is an {{occupational}} transition, which {{can have a}} profound impact on a person's life. This review explored occupational therapy's contribution to and involvement in the work-to-retirement transition process in Australia. Methods: An integrative literature review was undertaken using seven article repository databases. PRISMA guidelines informed searches. Articles were included if participants were Australian; researchers' discussed retirement from an occupational perspective or the scope of practice of occupational therapists; and publication was from 1994 to June 2015 in a peer-reviewed journal. Articles were critically appraised and thematic analysis explored: (i) occupational perspective, (ii) occupational therapy scope of practice, (iii) theory and (iv) retirement definitions. Results: Eight articles met the review criteria. Three occupational perspective themes were identified: retirement intention influences, retirement preparation and retirement roles and activities. No articles on the current scope of practice of occupational therapy were found. Three articles discussed potential occupational therapy approaches. Three themes on what retirement is were identified: complete cessation, gradual transition and <b>intermittent</b> <b>worker.</b> Four theory themes were identified: occupational therapy, ageing, identity and work. Conclusion:Occupational therapy {{has the potential to be}} involved in improving health and well-being for people in the work-to-retirement transition process. It is suggested that future research explore not only people's experiences but also the approaches of occupational therapy in assisting people through this occupational transition. The use of theory to guide Australian occupational therapy practice on retirement should also be explored. The use of consistent retirement definitions will assist in understanding research...|$|E

They come with golden dreams, expecting in many cases to build homes, rear families, become substantial American citizens. After a few weeks, their savings gone, the single men grow restless and start moving; a few weeks more and the married men bid their families good-by. They take to the road hunting for jobs, planning to send for their families when they find steady work. Some of them swing onto the freight-trains and beat their way to the nearest town, are broke when they get there, find the labor market oversupplied, and, as likely as not, are thrown into jail as vagrants.

40|$|Les déficits auditifs dus au bruit comptent parmi les premières {{maladies}} professionnelles dans {{les pays}} industrialisés, que ce soit en nombre ou en coût de compensation financière, car ces atteintes sont irréversibles. En France, ce sont en moyenne 6, 8  % des travailleurs qui sont soumis à des bruits nocifs. Sur les 5  millions de Français ayant des problèmes auditifs, 2  millions sont âgés de moins de 55 ans. Les signes de souffrance auditive ou d’alerte sont notamment des difficultés à la compréhension en milieu bruyant qui peuvent s’ajouter aux effets de la presbyacousie. Une récente directive européenne, applicable dès février 2006, abaisse le niveau maximum de bruit admissible de 90 à 87 dBA (soit une intensité sonore diminuée de moitié), et introduit un niveau déclenchant un plan de prévention à 80 dBA. Enfin, le tableau relatif aux surdités professionnelles a été récemment modifié. Cette modification du calcul de l’indicateur médico-légal sera susceptible de multiplier par 4 le nombre de surdités professionnelles qui pourraient bénéficier d’une compensation financière. Noise-induced hearing losses (NIHL) {{are among the}} most often encountered occupational diseases in many industrial countries. This is true {{in terms of the number}} of exposed workers and in the amount of health insurance or State health care compensations. These handicaps are not reversible. In order to understand why this is, we will explain how high levels of noise pressure can affect the ear, by describing the three parts of the ear, including some details about the inner ear and its sensitive cells. Several epidemiological surveys indicate that an average of 6. 8  %, French employees are exposed to dangerous levels of noise with vast differences according to their sector of activity. The most exposed are found in the wood and paper industries (37. 4  %), in large plants and amongst <b>intermittent</b> <b>workers.</b> Males are five times more exposed than females, but they are much more numerous in these industries. About 5  million French people suffer from hearing disorders; 2  million of them are under 55 years of age. The Labour Ministry controls the occupational medicine services where exposed workers are subjected to a special check-up, which includes an audiometric examination at least every two years. But for the others, it is useful to know the danger signs of hearing disorders, like hearing fatigue (TTS), tinnitus or difficulties in understanding with background noise. Aging also affects hearing capabilities: this is called presbyacusis, which can be a confusing factor in the assessment of NIHL in older workers. In order to improve the protection of all workers in the EC, a recent European Directive will decrease the maximum level of tolerated noise (from the current 90 dBA) to 87 dBA before March 2006. In addition, the level at which a preventive programme has to be developed (hearing conservation programme) will start at 80 dBA instead of the current 85. The French compensation system for workers suffering from NIHL has also recently been modified. Such a modification will increase the number of compensations (probably by 4 times). The annual cost of the aforementioned compensations was 100  million Ð in 2003...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} Australia abolishes tax {{concessions}} for superannuation {{and create a}} universal (non-means-tested) age pension. Summary As Australia’s population ages, government policies that assist retirement {{will become even more}} essential. Superannuation tax concessions and the age pension are the two key government policies that assist the ageing, but they are becoming increasingly expensive. Increasing costs have prompted the Treasurer, Mr Joe Hockey to suggest the pension age be increased to 70. This suggestion is part of an austerity narrative being used by the government to justify broader spending cuts to health, education and welfare support. This paper shows super tax concessions, most of which are being claimed by people able to afford early retirements if they choose, will soon cost more than the age pension. The age pension currently costs $ 39 billion and superannuation tax concessions will cost the budget around $ 35 billion in 2013 - 14. These concessions are projected to rise to $ 50. 7 billion in 2016 - 17, an increase of around 12 per cent per annum. By this time superannuation tax concessions will be the single largest area of government expenditure. The overwhelming majority of this assistance flows to high income earners. Low income earners receive virtually no benefit. The combined cost of these two policies will be $ 74 billion in 2014 alone. With an ageing population the dual pension/superannuation system will become increasingly expensive. The government’s own projections are that the cost of super tax concessions as a share of GDP will exceed that of the age pension by 2016 - 17. This paper presents an alternative model that could produce a fairer, more adequate and more sustainable retirement system. It proposes that we abolish tax concessions for superannuation and create a universal (non-means-tested) age pension. This proposed system is similar to the approach taken in New Zealand where labour force participation among older people is higher than in Australia. A subsequent paper will outline how the proposed universal age pension model could be implemented. A universal age pension would be particularly beneficial to those groups whose superannuation balances are low, such as low income, seasonal or <b>intermittent</b> <b>workers,</b> the self-employed or those who have long periods of time out of the workforce (e. g. predominately women who care for children/ageing parents). A universal pension would create a level playing field amongst income groups and reduce the inequality in Australia’s retirement system. Superannuation could then act as a top-up for those who can afford it. It is suggested that the single pension be lifted from 30 per cent of male total average weekly earnings to 37. 5 per cent, with a consequent lift in the partnered rate. This would raise the pension rate for singles from $ 21, 018 per annum to $ 26, 273 per annum and the pension rate for couples from $ 31, 689 per annum to $ 39, 611 per annum. This system would cost $ 52 billion a year, almost 30 per cent less than we spend on both the pension and superannuation tax concessions. This paper uses a 15 to 25 years phase-in period for illustrative purposes only; the precise phase-in method can be varied to suit policy objectives. The proposed transition options mean that the immediate cost of the new scheme is a lot less than the immediate revenues flowing from abolition of tax concessions. Revenues are brought forward whereas costs flow on many years down the track. This produces the interesting result that, whereas the scheme is revenue neutral in the long term, it produces a large net saving to the government in the short term. This must be of some interest to governments facing budget stringency caused by the slowing of the mining boom. Such an increase in the pension rate would help to alleviate poverty among the aged. Additionally, government assistance by income class would become more progressive than it currently is. Whereas the present system of tax concessions for superannuation contributions favours high income earners the new system would more closely reflect the existing taxation rates applicable at each income level. Although the cost of a universal age pension will rise over time, the cost of the existing combination of age pension and superannuation tax concessions will cost more. On that basis the policy proposed in this paper is more sustainable...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis poster aims to {{describe}} issues encountered whilst structuring a corpus of tweets compiled from {{the key word}} <b>intermittent</b> (arts <b>worker)</b> in order to analyse a discursive topic related to the controversy surrounding the status of French arts workers. This corpus {{is part of the}} CoMeRe project (CoMeRe, 2014) : it aims to build a kernel corpus of computer-mediated communication (CMC) genres with interactions in the French language. Three key words characterize the project: variety, standards and openness. A variety of interactions was sought: public or private interactions as well as interactions from informal, learning and professional situations. The CoMeRe project structured the corpora in a uniform way using the Text Encoding Initiative format (TEI, Burnard & Bauman, 2013) and described each corpus using Dublin Core and OLAC standards for metadata (DCMI, 2014; OLAC, 2008). The TEI model was extended in order to encompass the Interaction Space (IS) of CMC multimodal discourse (Chanier et al., 2014). The term 'openness' also characterizes the project: The corpora have been released as open data on the French national platform of linguistic resources (ORTOLANG, 2013) in order {{to pave the way for}} scientific examination by partners not involved in the project as well as replicative and cumulative research. This poster presentation aims to give an overview of the corpus building process using, as a case study, a corpus of tweets cmr-intermittent (Longhi et al., 2016). The following steps led to the choice of tweets: 1) In 2015, with the creation of a threshold of at least 10 tweets with the #intermittent (s), we identified 215 accounts, each of which had produced at least 10 tweets explicitly referenced as contributing to this theme (in order to have representative accounts). 2) By gathering all of the tweets sent by those 215 people, we collected 586, 239 tweets. 3) 10, 876 of the 586, 239 tweets contained the #: #intermittent(s) : the #intermittent corpus corresponds to these 10, 876 tweets. The poster will focus, firstly, on how features that are specific to Twitter were included and structured in the interaction space TEI model. We will exemplify how certain features are accounted for in TEI. These include hashtags that label tweets in order that other users can see tweets on the same topic and at signs that allow users to mention or reply to other users. Secondly, the poster will evoke some of the ethical and rights issues that had to be considered before publishing this corpus of tweets. Finally, the workflow and multi-stage quality control procedure adopted during the corpus building process will be illustrated...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIHypoxia induces several {{responses}} at cardiovascular, pulmonary {{and reproductive}} levels, which {{may lead to}} chronic diseases. This is relevant in human populations exposed to high altitude (HA), in either chronic continuous (permanent inhabitants) or <b>intermittent</b> fashion (HA <b>workers,</b> tourists and mountaineers). In Chile, {{it is estimated that}} 1. 000. 000 people live at highlands and more than 55. 000 work in HA shifts. Initial responses to hypoxia are compensatory and induce activation of cardioprotective mechanisms, such as those seen under intermittent hypobaric (IH) hypoxia, events that could mediate preconditioning. However, whenever hypoxia is prolonged, the chronic activation of cellular responses induces long-lasting modifications that may result in acclimatization or produce maladaptive changes with increase in cardiovascular risk. HA exposure during pregnancy induces hypoxia and oxidative stress, which in turn may promote cellular responses and epigenetic modifications resulting in severe impairment in growth and development. Sadly, this condition is accompanied with an increased fetal and neonatal morbi-mortality. Further, developmental hypoxia may program cardio-pulmonary circulations later in postnatal life, ending in vascular structural and functional alterations with augmented risk on pulmonary and cardiovascular failure. Additionally, permanent HA inhabitants have augmented risk and prevalence of chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy and cardiopulmonary remodeling. Similar responses are seen in adults that are intermittently exposed to chronic hypoxia (CH) such as shift workers in HA areas. The mechanisms involved determining the immediate, short and long-lasting effects are still unclear. For several years, the study of the responses to hypoxic insults and pharmacological targets has been the motivation of our group. This review describes some of the mechanisms underlying hypoxic responses and potential therapeutic approaches with antioxidants such as melatonin, ascorbate, omega 3 (Omega 3) or compounds that increase the nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide an {{alternative}} means to represent where and how creativity manifests in the urban context, in response to shortcomings with orthodox creative industry mapping methods. Inspired by recent conceptual developments in cultural geography (that move away from static conceptions of space to consider how spatialisations are produced in the tactile spaces of the city), it draws on the outcomes of an Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage research project that sought to map creative industries in Darwin, the small and remote capital of Australia’s Northern Territory. The context of Darwin posed numerous conceptual hurdles: how to map creativity in a city typified by small population and low urban density, coupled with {{a high incidence of}} creative workers in unpaid, part-time or <b>intermittent</b> work (<b>workers</b> missing from statistical measures such as census data that are skewed towards formalised, persistent employment). The hallmarks of often-cited creative city examples from Europe or North America (frequently de-industrialising cities with populations of over 1 million) were patently not evident here. Destroyed on multiple occasions by war and cyclone, Darwin has no legacy of historic inner-city development; it has no ex-warehouse industrial districts ripe for creative regeneration – nor an inner-ring of medium-density, working-class neighbourhoods. Instead it has an administrative business district and a modern port that quickly makes way for a decentralised, suburban form geared around the motor car and the constant need to navigate an extreme tropical climate. Darwin’s unusual urban environment thus became a test bed for new methodologies on mapping creativity, experimenting with new forms of data capture, but also with data analysis and visualisation. The methodology built on the wider literature on critical and participatory applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). It centred on using mental maps as prompts during interviews with creative industry workers and then accumulating digital evidence from these mental maps across a large number of interviews. Deploying mental maps in this fashion allowed creative industry practitioners to indicate graphically their everyday interactions with the city, reporting on distinct locations like work and home spaces, while giving them an opportunity to indicate where they felt the most inspirational and creative places were manifest in their city. Engaging with a map during the interview had surprising flow on effects for most interviewees, triggering more spatially literate responses to other questions about their creative lives in relation to Darwin. Results from the mental mapping exercise were then combined and visualised in new ways using a GIS. Opening up this dataset to the analytical possibilities that GIS provides allowed for a number of different interpretations to be brought to bear upon the data, with each output displaying distinct geographies. These outputs, including three dimensional density plots and topological network analyses portrayed urban creativity in a new light: creativity in this city could be visualised as the product of relational networks within and beyond the city, alongside territorial constructs borne out of participants’ everyday understandings of the places that inspired them most. These alternative views of creative Darwin were starkly different to those revealed through conventional economic measures (notably spatial analysis of census data). For example, key suburban sites featured highly in residents’ perceptions of the city’s creative vitality, confounding the orthodox view that successful creative industries are predicated on dense networks and inner-city clusters. The results from this thesis and the methods detailed within have relevance for urban creative industries policies far beyond Darwin. Creativity can simultaneously appear networked and site-specific, patterned in demonstrable ways across the city, and yet contingent on the perspective of the beholder. Creativity is variegated and relationally embedded in the iconic and ordinary spaces of the city...|$|R
