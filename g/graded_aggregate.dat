50|$|Otta seal {{is formed}} by adding <b>graded</b> <b>aggregate</b> to a soft {{bituminous}} binding agent. The agent is usually emulsified asphalt. Bituminous binder application rates are between 1.9 liter/m2 (0.42 US gallon/yard2) and 2.4 liter/m2 (0.53 US gallon/yard2) - the value {{is dependent on}} aggregate gradation and type. Low quality, local aggregates are often used in Otta seal. The largest aggregate size used is between 13 and 25mm (0.5 and 1 inch). The aggregate can contain up to 10% fine gravels. Aggregate quantities are usually close to 27 kg/m2 (50 lbs/yard2). Otta seal is easily cured by blinding with sand because of its soft binders.

Part of construction which increases significantly is concrete. In concrete making, aggregate gradation affects concrete strength a lot.

The purpose {{of this research is}} to compare concrete pressure strength of gap <b>graded</b> <b>aggregate</b> and continuous <b>graded</b> <b>aggregate.</b> The research was done by making cylinder samples (d= 150 mm, t= 300 mm) with concrete pres- sure strength 17, 5 MPa, 27, 5 MPa and 37, 5 MPa.

40|$|Stabilized bases are {{normally}} {{designed for the}} heavy traffic categories or {{in the absence of}} base materials which should have the required material properties according to the specifications so that the higher strength category can be achieved. Bases can be constructed using soil or aggregates. Those are stabilized with various admixtures such as lime, sand or cement. Among them, cement stabilization is a common practice in road construction industry. The road construction industry has the experiences about the stabilization of dense <b>graded</b> <b>aggregate</b> bases with cement. Even though the content of cement has to be increased to get the higher strength capacity, shrinkage cracks may appear with the increase usage of the cement content and it has a tendency to convert the layer to a rigid pavement too. Hence, another feasible technique should be applied to achieve the required higher strength capacities concurrently to diminish shrinkage cracks and form the base withstand against higher number of heavy load repetitions as well as form the base withstand against higher number of heavy load repetitions without converting the layer into rigid. To achieve both phenomena, this research was carried out to introduce usage of a reinforcement type such as steel fibers in Dense <b>Graded</b> <b>Aggregate</b> bases. In this study, it is discussed about the high performance of Steel Fiber Reinforced Cement Stabilized bases over the conventional Cement Stabilized Bases.

30|$|Asphalt {{concrete}} pavements {{are made of}} asphalt concrete mixtures (ACMs) consisting of <b>graded</b> <b>aggregates,</b> asphalt binders, and air voids.

Time-dependent properties of ACM are not only one of the main sources of pavement rutting (e.g., permanent deformation), but also plays a critical role in fatigue and low-temperature cracking, roughness, and corrugation.|$|R

The characteristics of the sorted construction waste are significantly different from that of crushed concrete rubbles that are mostly derived from demolition waste streams. This is due to the presence of higher percentages of non-concrete components (e. g. > 10 % soil, brick, tiles etc.) in the sorted construction waste. In the study reported in this paper, three series of concrete block mixtures were prepared by using the low <b>grade</b> recycled <b>aggregates</b> to replace (i) natural coarse granite (10 mm), and (ii) 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % replacement levels of crushed stone fine (crushed natural granite < 5 mm) in the concrete blocks. Test results on properties such as density, compressive strength, transverse strength and drying shrinkage as well as strength reduction after exposure to 800 °C are presented below. The results show that the soil content in the recycled fine aggregate was an important factor in affecting the properties of the blocks produced and the mechanical strength deceased with increasing low <b>grade</b> recycled fine <b>aggregate</b> content.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Geotextiles are {{synthetic}} fabrics {{which may}} be substituted for <b>graded</b> <b>aggregate</b> to protect ocean and coastal structures from erosion and soil instability adjacent to the structure. They are commonly used as a filter and as a structural membrane between an undisturbed sediment surface below and an erosion resistant coarse aggregate above. Geotextiles provide a cost effective alternative to <b>graded</b> <b>aggregate</b> in marine foundations. The need for rational design procedures {{has led to a}} theoretical description of the combined soil-geotextile behavior which quantifies failure potential and facilitates optimum geotextile selection. A two-dimensional analytical model has been developed for a three layered system; two different soils separated by a geotextile. The soil response is modeled by Biot consolidation theory and an unsteady form of Darcy's equation in which each soil is considered homogeneous, isotropic and linearly elastic. The soil layers are coupled through the geotextile which acts as an elastic permeable membrane. Soil displacements and stresses and fluid pressures and flows are determined analytically. Potential failure conditions are identified from the cyclic shear stress ratio and from a Mohr- Coulomb stress analysis. Two series of laboratory experiments were conducted at the Oregon State University Wave Research Facility to verify the model. The large scale facility includes a wave channel which is 12 feet wide, 15 feet deep and 342 feet long. A test section 36 feet long was constructed in the wave channel and filled with approximately three feet of fine sand, a geotextile and one foot of gravel. The test section was exposed to simple harmonic and random waves with heights up to four and one-half feet and periods to eight seconds in water depths to eight feet. The pore water pressure was monitored continuously at seven to ten soil depths and three to five lateral positions and recorded on magnetic tape along with the displacement of the free surface. Four geotextile conditions were tested including woven, impermeable, semi-rigid and no geotextile. Wave-induced liquefaction was observed for a low permeability geotextile. The experimental results verify the soil-geotextile interaction model and also provide insight into the dynamic response of horizontally layered soils. Results indicate that for the permeabilities of commonly available geotextiles that the hydraulic properties of the geotextile are dominated by the adjacent soil properties. However, clogging of the geotextile increases the potential for soil failure. The pore pressure amplitude response is frequency selective, the higher frequencies being more highly damped. For a given soil condition a "worst" wave period may exist which produces maximum failure potential.
