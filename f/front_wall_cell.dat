The inner gateway entered to an entrance hall. The hall is attached with monastic cells. There were 41 cells in this monastery: 8 in the northern wing and 11 cells each in the three other wings. The cells were almost equal in size (3.66 m by 3.35 m). The thickness of the <b>front</b> <b>walls</b> of the <b>cells</b> were 1.07 m, back walls 2.59 m and partition walls 0.91-1.22 m. Each cell has a doorway in front side and niches on three side walls.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the {{coupling}} between visual information and body sway with binocular and monocular vision at two distances from the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> of a moving room. Ten participants stood as still as possible inside of a moving room facing the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> in conditions that combined room movement with monocular/binocular vision and distance from the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> (75 and 150 cm). Visual information effect on body sway decreased with monocular vision and with increased distance from the <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> In addition, the combination of monocular vision with the farther distance resulted in the smallest body sway response to the driving stimulus provided by the moving room. These results suggest that binocularvision near the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> provides visual information of a better quality than the monocular vision far from the <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> We discuss the results with respect to two modes of visual detection of body sway: ocular and extraocular.

5000|$|Following the serve, the {{receiver}} and server take alternate turns to strike the ball against the <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> The ball must be struck prior to it bouncing twice and while it may hit any combination of back and side walls {{on its way to}} the <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> it must not hit the floor or an out-of-court area.

50|$|Australian {{handball}} {{is similar}} to squash played without a racquet. The ball is served such that it makes {{direct contact with the}} <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> without having bounced on the ground. It must then be returned similarly by the opponent to the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> before the ball bounces on the ground twice. It may also contact side walls to or from the <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> but once a player has struck the ball with hand, it must make contact with the front before touching the ground.|$|R
50|$|After a {{successful}} serve, players alternate {{hitting the ball}} against the <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> The player returning the hit may allow the ball to bounce once on the floor or hit {{the ball on the}} fly. However, once the player returning the shot has hit the ball, it must strike the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> before striking the floor. Unlike during the serve, a ball in play may touch as many walls, including the ceiling, as necessary so long as it reaches the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> without striking the floor.|$|R

40|$|Wood {{consists}} essentially {{of secondary}} plant <b>cell</b> <b>walls,</b> {{composed of a}} cellulose and hemicellulose network impregnated with lignin. It is formed via the development of derivatives of {{a thin layer of}} cells (the vascular cambium) into xylem cells through cell division, expansion, secondary wall formation, lignification and, finally, programmed cell death. Throughout the formation of the resulting, complex matrix (wood) diverse proteins are involved. Hence, biosynthesis of wood is tightly regulated at the molecular level, primarily by transcriptional regulation, together with various post-transcriptional processes. In the studies this thesis is based upon, a key technique for studying proteins, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, was used to elucidate pathways of wood formation. First, proteins involved in the central transcriptional unit Mediator, regulating most essential processes in plants, were identified in arabidopsis. Mediator subunits that most likely provide secondary <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> activity are differentiated paralogous subunits located in the tail part of the complex. Point mutations in the Mediator tail subunit, Med 5 # 2 affect secondary <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> lignification. Moreover, control of xylem expansion may be indirectly regulated by Med 25. A strategy to integrate transcript-, protein- and metabolite-data was then developed, using data acquired from analyses of poplar mutants with perturbed wood development. The results showed that lignin biosynthesis is heavily affected at both transcript and protein levels in the mutant with the strongest phenotypic deviations. Interestingly, when transcript levels are decreased, the protein levels are increased. Finally, the <b>front</b> of <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> synthesis at poplar plasma membranes was dissected. A high coverage of proteins known {{to be involved in the}} <b>cell</b> <b>wall</b> synthesizing machinery and associated components was captured, as well as several potential new ones...|$|R
5000|$|Straight-in {{shots are}} usually meant {{to hit the}} <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> as low as possible. If the ball {{contacts}} the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> so low as to bounce twice before it reaches the service line it is called a [...] "kill" [...] shot. Straight-in shots are normally attempted {{with the idea of}} hitting toward the area of the court the opponent cannot cover. Straight-in shots hit where the opponent can't return them are called down-the-line and cross court passing shots. Often kill shots are returned very close to the back wall as the ball is moving towards the <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R

A 'back wall boast' has the ball struck {{against the back wall}} before reaching the <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> It is typically not recommended to beginners due to the risk of hitting spectators above and behind players on solid backed courts. A 'trickle boast' is a boast performed at a shallow angle with the <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> at a low trajectory. A 'reverse boast' is a boast played towards the sidewall furtherst from the striker.
