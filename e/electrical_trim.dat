50|$|The P.111 was {{designed}} as the smallest airframe which could couple an engine (Rolls-Royce Nene), an ejection seat (Martin-Baker), and a delta wing. The latter was aerodynamically thin and had a sweep angle of 45°. Without tip extensions the wing was strongly cropped at about 75% of the full delta. The aircraft could be flown with these wings or with one of two pairs of extensions, the larger ones making an almost perfect pointed delta shape. These extensions allowed {{an investigation of the}} aerodynamic effects of the tip shapes of delta wings. Unlike its contemporary the Avro 707, roll and attitude were both controlled by a pair of elevons. The fin had an unswept trailing edge and its tip also could be removed and altered, though it seems it always flew with a very pointed tip. The P.111 was fitted with one of the first fully powered control systems, hydraulically driven with <b>electrical</b> <b>trim</b> tabs. Because the Nene had a centrifugal compressor, the P.111 had a rather tubby fuselage, with an oval nose intake. The inward-retracting undercarriage had a noticeably wide track and a tall nosewheel leg placed it at 17° on the ground. The construction was all-metal {{with the exception of the}} wing extensions and the fin tip, which were of glass-reinforced plastic.|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>trim</b> {{techniques}} {{for reducing the}} value of a trimmable single crystal silicon resistor (trimistor) are presented. Computer-controlled current pulses are used to incrementally decrease the value of the trimistor through metal/silicon alloying. Variations of both single and multipulse current pulses are investigated. Physical mechanisms, based on electron microscopy of trimistors trimmed under various conditions, are hypothesized to explain the observed trim behavior. Threshold currents are dependent on the initial value of the resistor, the applied current density and the trim method. The <b>electrical</b> <b>trim</b> technique for a single trimmable resistor element is optimized. The final resistance values of the trimmed trimistors are shown to be stable provided that a current at or above the threshold current is not applied thereafter. The performance of both N+ and P trim resistors is evaluated over temperature and accelerated operating life...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} {{and stability of}} piezoresistive sensors based on polysilicon nanosized thin films (PNTFs), 80 nm-thick PNTFs were deposited on Si substrates by LPCVD at different temperatures and fabricated into cantilever beams. The <b>electrical</b> <b>trimming</b> characteristics and dependences of gauge factor, TCR and TCGF on resistor trim were measured. Based on interstitialvacancy model, the <b>electrical</b> <b>trimming</b> {{is due to the}} mobility increase caused by current-induced recrystallization of grain boundaries (GBs). The changes in GF, TCR and TCGF with resistor trim are due to the GB state variation (including scattering center, GB width, tunneling current, localized and extended state conductions) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a floating-gate trimmed 14 -bit 300 -MS/s current-steered digital-to-analog converter (DAC) fabricated in 0. 25 - and 0. 18 - m CMOS logic processes. We trim the static inte-gral nonlinearity to 0. 3 least significant bits using analog charge stored on floating-gate pFETs. The DAC occupies 0. 44 mm 2 of die area, consumes 53 mW at 250 MHz, allows on-chip <b>electrical</b> <b>trimming,</b> and achieves better than 72 -dB spur-free dynamic range at 250 MS/s.

40|$|Electrical {{testing of}} MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) {{can take on}} many {{different}} forms including wafer probing, <b>electrical</b> <b>trimming,</b> final test at temperatures, engineering characterization, and reliability evaluations. MEMS testing has had limited visibility in literature from companies that have successfully industrialized applications such as pressure sensors and accelerometers. This limited visibility is not {{an indication of the}} importance of this topic that represents {{a significant portion of the}} overall cost, rather it is more likely and indication custom nature of test for MEMS.

40|$|Abstract—Precision {{electrical}} trimming of stacked Si/SiGe poly-crystalline resistors {{available from}} the extrinsic base structure of a SiGe BiCMOS technology has been demonstrated for the first time. It is shown that pulse current trimming techniques {{can be used to}} trim the poly-SiGe resistors by up to 50 % from their orig-inal values with accuracy better than 0. 5 %. The temperature co-efficient of resistance (TCR) is shown to be linearly proportional to the percent change in electrically trimmed poly-SiGe resistance. Fi-nally, we demonstrate resistance cycling using an electrical trim/re-covery sequence, indicating that the technique is reversible and is governed by dopant segregation/diffusion mechanisms. The results are consistent with those obtained on conventional polysilicon re-sistors suggesting that the introduction of a strained SiGe layer does not adversely affect the <b>electrical</b> <b>trim</b> properties of these re-sistors.

50|$|From 1864 to 1869, {{the firm}} was known as Thomas C. Smith and Company, but the factory itself {{continued}} {{to be called the}} Union Porcelain Works. In its first decade, its products were limited to sturdy white china plates and dishes for the hotel trade, <b>electrical</b> insulators, hardware <b>trimming,</b> and decorated tiles. However, in 1874, in preparation for the Centennial Exposition, Smith hired sculptor Karl L. H. Müller (c. 1820-1887) as the company's chief designer. Mueller then created a wide range of designs for porcelain pieces, most notably the Century Vase which was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition. John Mackie Falconer also created designs for the company.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} beak trimming, stocking density (D) and sex (S) on live weight (LW), carcass yield and its component, and plasma glucose (PG) and triglyceride levels in Large White turkeys. To accomplish this aims, totally 288 d old large white turkey chicks (144 in each sex) were used. Beaks of 77 male and female poults were trimmed when 8 d old with an <b>electrical</b> beak <b>trimmer.</b> The birds were fed by commercial turkey rasion. Experiment was designed as 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with 3 replications in each group. Beak trimming and stocking density did not affect live weight, carcass composition and its components. The higher LW and carcass weight observed in trimmed groups. As expected, male birds are heavier than female, and carcass percentage (CP) would be adverse. However, in this study, CP of male was higher in trimmed, in 0. 25 m 2 /bird. (D) × sex (S) interaction had an effect on both CP and thigh weights (p< 0. 05). Significantly D×S was observed in LW, CP and PG. The weight of carcass and its some components were higher in male. S×D interaction had an effect on plasma glucose level (p< 0. 05). Triglyceride level was affected (p< 0. 05) by sex. Significant relationships were found between percentage of thighs (r= 0. 447, p< 0. 01) and percentage of breast (r= 0. 400, p< 0. 01). According to this study, it can be said that trimming is useful with density of 0. 25 m 2 /bird in turkey fattening...|$|R
