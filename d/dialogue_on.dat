5|$|The soundtrack {{album was}} {{released}} in 1985 by A Records; the compact disc version of this release was recalled due to a colour printing error which omitted the credits from the album cover, making it a rare collector's item. In 1997, the soundtrack was re-issued by Rykodisc, with the original soundtrack music and some film <b>dialogue,</b> <b>on</b> an Enhanced CD version. The 2003 release, by EMI, restored the original soundtrack music without dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell with questions {{about the nature of}} the altered universe, trying to determine if they were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of <b>dialogue</b> <b>on</b> set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again.|$|E

5|$|Plutarch cites Aeschines Socraticus, {{who wrote}} a <b>dialogue</b> <b>on</b> Aspasia (now lost), {{to the effect that}} after Pericles's death, Aspasia lived with Lysicles, an Athenian strategos (general) and {{democratic}} leader, with whom she had another son; and that she made him the first man at Athens. Lysicles was killed on expedition to levy subsidies from allies in action in 428 BC With Lysicles' death the contemporaneous record ends. It is unknown, if she was alive when her son, Pericles, was elected general or when he was executed after the Battle of Arginusae. The time of her death that most historians give (c. 401 BC-400 BC) is based on the assessment that Aspasia died before the execution of Socrates in 399 BC, a chronology which is implied in the structure of Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{artists in}} the later eighteenth century were {{strongly}} influenced by the Enlightenment, which stressed rationalism and human inquiry, of which Scotland was a major centre of influence. Artists like Alan Ramsey formed The Select Society, with philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith and produced his <b>Dialogue</b> <b>on</b> Taste, which made a major contribution {{to the study of}} aesthetics. Scotland also played a major part in the origins of the Romantic movement through the publication of James Macpherson's Ossian cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal, written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, influencing Herder and Goethe.|$|E

5|$|Vermigli's Eucharistic polemical {{writing was}} {{initially}} directed against Catholics, but beginning in 1557 {{he began to}} involve himself in debates with Lutherans. Many Lutherans during this time argued that Christ's body and blood were physically present in the Eucharist because they are ubiquitous, or everywhere. In 1561, Johannes Brenz published a work defending such a view, and Vermigli's friends convinced him to write a response. The result, the <b>Dialogue</b> <b>on</b> the Two Natures in Christ, {{was written in the}} form of a dialogue between Orothetes ("Boundary Setter"), a defender of the Reformed doctrine that Christ's body is physically located in Heaven, and Pantachus ("Everywhere"), whose speeches are largely taken directly from Brenz's work. Brenz published a response in 1562, to which Vermigli began to prepare a rebuttal, but he died before he was able to complete it.|$|E
