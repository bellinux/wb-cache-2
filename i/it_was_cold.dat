5|$|In 1949, the Gascoignes' third child, {{daughter}} Hester, was born. Like many Observatory personnel, the Gascoignes {{lived in}} a staff residence on Mount Stromlo, which was a long difficult trip away from Canberra. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> and lonely, particularly for Rosalie, but they enjoyed the outdoors, and the landscape inspired Rosalie's creativity and later her artistic career. In 1960 they relocated to Deakin in suburban Canberra, and in the late 1960s they moved to another suburb, Pearce.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} {{it would be}} beneficial by lending the dream-like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the voices {{that were going to}} be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for the cast and crew during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> and infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E

25|$|Operation Killer was a counter-offensive by the United Nations {{forces to}} push Communist Chinese and North Korean Armies {{back behind the}} Han River and recover the South Korean capital. The {{operation}} began on February 21, 1951. The 900 Canadians of the 2PPCLI set off to the front on 15 February, 240km away. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> and men sat in trucks for 48 hours before arriving. They suffered frostbite and numbed limbs, and the lubricants on their weapons froze during the journey.|$|E
25|$|The Ronde, in {{its first}} decades, {{followed}} the general rule that each racer was responsible for his own problems. Help from others was banned and riders carried spare tyres looped round their shoulders to cope with punctures. It could take {{two or three minutes}} to change and inflate a tyre, longer if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> or there were other problems. Tyres weighed around 500g (compared to currently around 200g). A rim or any other part of the bike that broke spelled the end of the race and still left the rider with the problem of getting to the finish.|$|E
25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a {{cushioned}} area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|E

500|$|In 1982 El Salvador took a 20-man squad (two players {{short of}} the normal 22, as a {{controversial}} cost–saving measure), coached by the aforementioned Mauricio [...] "Pipo" [...] Rodríguez, to Spain. The team's experience was an unhappy one. In their first match on June 15 in Elche, they were defeated 10–1 by Hungary, a scoreline that stands as a World Cup record to this day. A silver lining was that Luis Baltazar Ramírez Zapata scored the country's first World Cup goal during the game, albeit at a point when the Salvadorans were already down 5–0. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> comfort however. When Zapata scored against Hungary, some Salvadorans cried out to Zapata not to celebrate the goal effusively because it might make the Hungarians angry {{and encourage them to}} score more. El Salvador managed to regain some pride in their subsequent games. Displaying much-improved levels of organisation and commitment, they lost 1–0 to Belgium on June 19 in Elche and 2–0 to the then-reigning world champions, Argentina, in Alicante on June 23.|$|E
500|$|According to Kaling, {{the group}} had to pretend like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> during the outdoor scenes when it was {{actually}} warm. The snow that {{was used for the}} snowballs was artificial, and did not cooperate well. According to Kaling, the snowballs would explode' before they made contact". While Krasinski and Wilson did not hold back during the fights, neither one was injured; the blood on Jim's face and shirt was artificial. The snowmen featured {{at the end of the}} episode took a day to construct. In addition, the artificial snow had to be maintained, and footprints had to [...] "be tracked constantly" [...] to maintain continuity. The snowmen were crafted out of 100 tons of chipped ice, and the show's special effects team created molds and hand-crafted the creations. The scenes featuring the snowmen were shot on the hottest day of the episode's shoot in Los Angeles, with temperatures reaching above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The entire crew was outfitted UV-protectant glasses because [...] "snow-blindness was a real possibility." [...] To prevent heat-related injuries, an on-set medic monitored the staff and crew; anyone who was slated to appear outside was [...] "slathered in sunscreen" [...] and kept inside until [...] "moments" [...] before each shot.|$|E

500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would never know it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, you can just go home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E
500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool.

2500|$|Different {{parts from}} three 1981 DeLoreans {{were used in}} the first film.

In the off-road scenes in the third film, a modified-for-off-road VW Beetle frame was fitted to the DeLorean with the whitewall tires and baby Moon hubcaps.
