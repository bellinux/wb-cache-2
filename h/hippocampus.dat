5|$|Areas of the <b>hippocampus</b> {{are shown}} to be {{functionally}} and anatomically distinct. The dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> (DH), ventral <b>hippocampus</b> (VH) and intermediate <b>hippocampus</b> serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells. The dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermediate}} <b>hippocampus</b> has overlapping characteristics {{with both}} the ventral and dorsal <b>hippocampus.</b> Using anterograde tracing methods, Cenquizca and Swanson (2007) located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral <b>hippocampus</b> functions in fear conditioning and affective processes. Anagnostaras et al. (2002) showed that alterations to the ventral <b>hippocampus</b> reduced {{the amount of information}} sent to the amygdala by the dorsal and ventral <b>hippocampus,</b> consequently altering fear conditioning in rats.|$|E
5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the <b>hippocampus</b> in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the <b>hippocampus</b> sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.|$|E
5|$|Owing to its {{predictable}} {{organization and}} readily inducible LTP, the CA1 <b>hippocampus</b> {{has become the}} prototypical site of mammalian LTP study. In particular, NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the adult CA1 <b>hippocampus</b> is the most widely studied type of LTP, and is therefore {{the focus of this}} article.|$|E
5|$|Some studies shows {{correlation}} of reduced <b>hippocampus</b> volume and {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their <b>hippocampus</b> compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller <b>hippocampus</b> increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger <b>hippocampus</b> {{increases the likelihood of}} efficacious treatment.|$|E
5|$|The EC, {{is located}} in the parahippocampal gyrus, a {{cortical}} region adjacent to the <b>hippocampus.</b> This gyrus conceals the <b>hippocampus.</b> The parahippocampal gyrus also includes the perirhinal cortex which {{plays an important role in}} the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of the <b>hippocampus.</b> It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both the <b>hippocampus</b> and the parahippocampus are damaged.|$|E
5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their <b>hippocampus</b> and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the <b>hippocampus</b> to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the <b>hippocampus</b> is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the <b>hippocampus</b> was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the <b>hippocampus,</b> it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the <b>hippocampus</b> and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{are not well}} understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the <b>hippocampus</b> have also been described. Many reports have found reductions {{in the size of}} the <b>hippocampus</b> in schizophrenic subjects. The left <b>hippocampus</b> seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hippocampus</b> {{has been}} seen as central to the {{pathology}} of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the <b>hippocampus</b> Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the <b>hippocampus</b> and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{input to}} the <b>hippocampus</b> (from varying {{cortical}} and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the <b>hippocampus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The term hippocampal {{formation}} {{is used to}} refer to the <b>hippocampus</b> proper and its related parts. However, there is no consensus as to what parts are included. Sometimes the <b>hippocampus</b> is said to include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. Some references include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, and others also include the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.|$|E
5|$|The term {{limbic system}} was {{introduced}} in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures that line {{the edge of the}} cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include the <b>hippocampus,</b> cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala. Paul MacLean later suggested that the limbic structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. The <b>hippocampus</b> is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior—the septum, the hypothalamic mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus, and is generally accepted {{to be part of the}} limbic system.|$|E
5|$|The {{title is}} a pun {{on the common}} phrase Big Man on Campus, but with campus changed to <b>hippocampus,</b> a {{reference}} to Peter's amnesia in the episode.|$|E
5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} studies that show the involvement of the <b>hippocampus</b> in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that a challenge is to understand how conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{originally}} believed that neurons could not regenerate in the adult brain, neurogenesis {{has been shown to}} occur in mammalian brains, including those of primates. However, neurogenesis is limited to the <b>hippocampus</b> and SVZ, and the RMS is one mechanism neurons use to relocate from these areas.|$|E
5|$|Basket {{cells in}} CA3 receive {{excitatory}} {{input from the}} pyramidal cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to the pyramidal cells. This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the <b>hippocampus.</b> The pyramidal cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.|$|E
5|$|Different {{areas of}} the brain exhibit {{different}} forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is observed. For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature <b>hippocampus</b> differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult <b>hippocampus.</b> The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor, others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether. The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is observed. For example, LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the <b>hippocampus</b> is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the mossy fiber pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.|$|E
5|$|LTP {{was first}} {{observed}} by Terje Lømo in 1966 in the Oslo, Norway, laboratory of Per Andersen. There, Lømo conducted {{a series of}} neurophysiological experiments on anesthetized rabbits to explore the role of the <b>hippocampus</b> in short-term memory.|$|E
5|$|Sex-specific {{responses}} to stress {{have also been}} demonstrated in the rat, {{to have an effect}} on the <b>hippocampus.</b> Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{original}} discovery in the rabbit <b>hippocampus,</b> LTP {{has been observed}} {{in a variety of}} other neural structures, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, amygdala, and many others. Robert Malenka, a prominent LTP researcher, has suggested that LTP may even occur at all excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} age-related RMS decline in humans {{has been the}} subject of {{significant}} debate. The decline of neurogenesis in and migration from the <b>hippocampus</b> in humans has already been well documented. Furthermore, age-related declines in the activities of SVZ stem cells, which migrate to the OB via the RMS, are in place by middle age in rodents. In elderly mice, studies showed that the population of actively dividing SVZ cells and the rate of interneuron replacement in the OB are both drastically reduced, indicating an age-related decline in neuronal proliferation and migration through the RMS. This decline was shown to be due to neuronal stem cell quiescence in the SVZ even by middle age, and not destruction, much like in the <b>hippocampus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>hippocampus</b> {{contains}} {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the <b>hippocampus</b> more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hippocampus</b> {{is one of}} the few {{brain regions}} where new neurons are generated. This process of {{neurogenesis}} is confined to the dentate gyrus. The production of new neurons can be positively affected by exercise or negatively affected by epileptic seizures.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hippocampus,</b> {{strictly}} speaking, {{is found}} only in mammals. However, the area it derives from, the medial pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates. There is evidence that {{this part of the}} brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes, birds, reptiles, and mammals.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} no {{scientific}} proof of any cause. However, diffusion weighted MRI studies taken from 12–24 hours following an episode has shown there to be small dot-like lesions in the <b>hippocampus.</b> These findings have suggested a possible implication of CA1 neurons made vulnerable by metabolic stress.|$|E
5|$|Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss of {{short-term}} memory. Various causes have been hypothesized including ischemia, epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to ischemia of {{structures such as}} the <b>hippocampus</b> {{that are involved in}} memory.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the <b>hippocampus</b> feels like.|$|E
5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior <b>hippocampus</b> is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|LTP has {{received}} much attention {{among those who}} study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with degenerative changes in the <b>hippocampus</b> and other medial temporal lobe structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, {{some have suggested that}} the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.|$|E
5|$|LTP was {{discovered}} in the rabbit <b>hippocampus</b> by Terje Lømo in 1966 and has remained a popular subject of research since. Many modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of clinical research, for example, {{in the areas of}} Alzheimer's disease and addiction medicine.|$|E
5|$|Path {{integration}} in mammals {{makes use of}} the vestibular organs, which detect accelerations in the three dimensions, together with motor efference, where the motor system tells {{the rest of the}} brain which movements were commanded, and optic flow, where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes. Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The <b>hippocampus</b> is {{the part of the brain}} that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa {{demonstrated}} in 1996 that the CA1 {{area of the}} <b>hippocampus</b> {{is crucial to the}} formation of spatial memories in living mice. So-called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the <b>hippocampus.</b> The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.|$|E
5|$|Tbr1 forms {{a complex}} with CASK and regulates gene {{expression}} in cortical development. Tbr1 binds to the guanylate kinase (GK) domain of CASK. It {{was determined that}} the C-terminal domain of Tbr1 in crucial and solely capable of this process. Through luciferase reporter assays of neurons in the <b>hippocampus,</b> {{it was found that}} increased Tbr1/CASK complex expression results in enhanced promoter activity in genes downstream of TBR1 such as NMDAR subunit 2b (NMDAR2b), glycine transporter, interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and OX-2 genes. NMDAR2b experienced the greatest change in activity.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{environmental}} and economic impacts of introduced C. mutica populations remain unknown. They provide valuable food sources for larger predators, particularly fish. In New Zealand, for example, they {{have become part of}} the diet of the native big-belly seahorse (<b>Hippocampus</b> abdominalis). In Europe, wild and farmed fish like the common dab (Limanda limanda), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), and the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), consume large amounts of non-native C. mutica.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} has many {{properties}} {{that are common}} to all vertebrate brains, and shares many features common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex {{and a set of}} associated structures, including the <b>hippocampus</b> and amygdala. The cortex is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans than many other animals. Humans have more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat and the cat.|$|E
