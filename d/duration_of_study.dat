2500|$|An École préparatoire {{was created}} on 9 March 1826 {{at the site}} of collège Louis-le-Grand. This date can be taken as the {{definitive}} date of creation of the current school. After the July Revolution, the school regained its original name of École normale and in 1845 was renamed École normale supérieure. During the 1830s, under the direction of philosopher Victor Cousin, the school enhanced its status as an institution to prepare the agrégation by expanding the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> to three years, and was divided into its present-day [...] "Sciences" [...] and [...] "Letters" [...] divisions. In 1847 the school moved into its current quarters at the rue d'Ulm, next to the Panthéon in the 5th arrondissement of Paris. This helped it gain some stability, which was further established under the direction of Louis Pasteur.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{private and}} public colleges exist side by side, public {{institutions}} called general and professional education colleges (Official French only name: Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel or CÉGEP) and private independent college institutions in Quebec straddle the definitions of both secondary and post-secondary education. [...] In Quebec, these institutions are readily considered post-secondary, but Quebec is the only province that requires 11 (rather than 12) years of study {{in order to obtain}} the high school diploma. [...] While standard admission to college is based on the secondary school diploma of Quebec (representing completion of grade 11), completion of the two-year college program does not give students the equivalent of a university Diploma (university diplomas throughout Canada are awarded following completion of at least a two-year post-secondary program of study). [...] Rather, holders of the two-year college diploma still must complete a minimum of three years of university education in order to obtain a bachelor's degree. [...] Under Canadian law, Bachelor's degrees from government-accredited universities in Canada are considered equal, whether from Quebec or other provinces. [...] Those unfamiliar with Quebec may wonder if three-year university programs there are therefore equal to four-year university programs in other provinces, or in other countries where four-year first university degree programs are the norm. [...] However, given that college diploma holders are granted up to one year of advanced standing credit at any university, it is clear {{that this is not the}} case. [...] What exists in Quebec is simply a different structure of education than in other provinces, which ultimately yields exactly the same total <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>study</b> when years of secondary and post-secondary study are combined.|$|E
