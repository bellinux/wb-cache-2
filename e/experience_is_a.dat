25|$|It is {{well known}} that strict churches are strong and growing in the {{contemporary}} United States, whereas liberal ones are declining. For Iannaccone's religious <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> jointly produced collective good. Thus members of a church face a collective action problem. Strict churches, which often impose costly and esoteric requirements on their members, are able to solve this problem by weeding out potential free riders, since only the very committed would join the church {{in the face of such}} requirements. Consistent with the notion that religious <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> collective good, Iannaccone et al. show that churches that extract more resources from their members (in the form of time and money) tend to grow in membership.|$|E

500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{debate over}} whether absinthe {{produces}} effects on the human mind {{in addition to those}} of alcohol has not been conclusively resolved.

Chemist, historian and absinthe distiller Ted Breaux has claimed that the alleged secondary effects of absinthe may be caused by {{the fact that some of}} the herbal compounds in the drink act as stimulants, while others act as sedatives, creating an overall lucid effect of awakening. The long-term effects of moderate absinthe consumption in humans remain unknown, although herbs traditionally used in the production of absinthe are reported to have both painkilling and antiparasitic properties.|$|E
