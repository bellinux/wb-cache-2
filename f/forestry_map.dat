The data has been accumulated within the BIOTA East Africa subproject E 02 for research into the longer-term forest cover change for the Kakamega-Nandi forest complex in west Kenya and requires quality assessment to enable future critical use of the geodatabase. The data sources comprise satellite imagery, aerial photography, topographic <b>maps</b> and drafts, <b>forestry</b> <b>maps,</b> map sketches, thematic maps, and datasets derived from fieldwork including oral histories. The database includes image, raster and vector datasets, {{all of which are}} judged individually by one person according to the six data quality parameters of lineage, positional accuracy, attribute accuracy, logical consistency, completeness, and temporal information. Their selection is based on a literature review. Four of the judgements make use of a 1 to 5 ranking scale. For five of the six parameters additional information is given.

40|$|For {{many years}} now, {{professionals}} have experimented several approaches to extract forest characteristics with various level of automated algorithms applied to digital images. Currently, {{the main source}} of information for forest harvest planning is extracted from <b>forestry</b> <b>maps</b> and samples plots from forest inventory programs. Digital image processing can be a complement to the current operational approaches. With the wide variety of available images on the market, it is relevant to define the optimal spatial resolution for forest planning. For fine image resolutions, processing can become complex and hard to integrate in forestry practices. For coarse image resolutions, information can be lost resulting in a loss of reliability for the product. The current project is {{based on the premise that}} optimal spatial resolution is at the approximate size of typical tree crown. The objective was to identify infra-polygonal areas from satellite image (raster) processing in a forest map (vector) for sugar maple stands, clear areas and pure conifer patches. Two methods were used in this project for the image processing: pixel and object-based (segmentation) classifications. The latter uses fuzzy logic algorithms. Overall, 4 classifications were produced on images with spatial resolution ranging from 1 to 30 meters with IKONOS- 2, SPOT- 5 and LANDSAT- 7 satellite images. The best results were those from 10 meters images which is near from an individual tree crown size.

Whether because of the numerous cottage and recreational areas with abundant occurrence of fungi, these forests were subject to great anthropogenic influence since its origin. Therefore, it was created on the territory of several protected areas and nature reserves, which were designed to preserve the natural vegetation potential of local vegetation and protection of rare species of local phytomass and zoomass. The goal of this thesis is the verification of the respective forest vegetation zones of the investigated plots, which had been historically assigned in several respects. In the past, namely the allocation of forest vegetation zone was entirely an empirical matter, which scientists {{have not been able to}} verify the correctness of his judgment by means of statistical analysis, as is the case nowadays. The plots were therefore selected to characterize best the local conditions, whether in terms of species composition of vegetation or climatic conditions. On the 20 selected plots there were collected data within individual tree layers (based on Kraft-Zlatník scale), species composition and level of development of individual trees by circuits measured at breast height and height measurements according to average individuals. As additional data for the overall evaluation were used climatological maps using GIS software creating a mosaics from which it can be acknowledged how much of the forest stands is affected by abiotic factors such as the length of the snow or the average air temperature. The data assembling the complete image of the plot characteristics were subsequently analysed by regression and multivariete statistical analysis. The obtained results show the context between the actual stage of the forest stands and the used climatic parameters.

40|$|Microwave Radar is an {{attractive}} solution for forest mapping and inventories because microwave signals penetrates into the forest canopy and the backscattering signal can provide information regarding the whole forest structure. Satellite-borne and airborne imaging radars {{have been used in}} forest resources mapping for many decades. However, their accuracy with respect to the main forest inventory attributes substantially varies depending on the wavelength and techniques used in the estimation. Systems providing canopy backscatter as a function of canopy height are, practically speaking, missing. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a radar system that would enable the scientific community to better understand the radar backscatter response from the forest canopy. Consequently, we undertook a research study to develop an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) -borne profiling (i. e., waveform) radar that could be used to improve the understanding of the radar backscatter response for <b>forestry</b> <b>mapping</b> and inventories. A frequency modulation continuous waveform (FMCW) profiling radar, termed FGI-Tomoradar, was introduced, designed and tested. One goal is the total weight of the whole system is less than 7 kg, including the radar system and georeferencing system, with centimetre-level positioning accuracy. Achieving this weight goal would enable the FGI-Tomoradar system to be installed on the Mini-UAV platform. The prototype system had all four linear polarization measuring capabilities, with bistatic configuration in Ku-band. In system performance tests in this study, FGI-Tomoradar was mounted on a manned helicopter together with a Riegl VQ- 480 -U laser scanner and tested in several flight campaigns performed at the Evo site, Finland. Airborne laser scanning data was simultaneously collected to investigate the differences and similarities of the outputs for the same target area for better understanding the penetration of the microwave signal into the forest canopy. Preliminary analysis confirmed that the profiling radar measures a clear signal from the canopy structure and has substantial potential to improve our understanding of radar forest mapping using the UAV platform...|$|R

40|$|A new {{computer}} approach for mapping mixed forest features (i. e., classes, types) from computes classification maps {{is presented in}} both theory and application. This approach is particularly useful and applicable to <b>forestry</b> stand <b>mapping,</b> where small areas are required to be absorbed into the surrounding to form 2 ̆ 2 homogeneous 2 ̆ 2 stands, and where mixed stands contain mixed proportions of different species of trees. Previous studies involving LANDSAT data show that mixed pine-hardwood stands are often erroneously classified as either pine or hardwood. The present work utilizes a modification and an iterative application of a previously developed computer program called 2 ̆ 2 CLEAN 2 ̆ 2. The program CLEAN was tested on binary (2 classes, labeled 0 or 1) classification images. The modification called 2 ̆ 2 GETMIX 2 ̆ 2 operates on a multi-class image and works on one prespecified class in any one application. In any iteration, small sets of pixels with labels other than the prespecified class are eliminated, while small sets of pixels of the prespecified class are retained and have their labels temporarily changed to a new unique class. This new iterative approach was tested on LANDSAT- 1 data over Sam Houston National Forest, and proved {{to be successful in}} mapping those mixed softwood/hardwood stands which were unidentifiable previously.

The approach compares a fuzzy logic classifier and a crisp rule-based integration technique. Both methods combine spectral and textural information with ancillary data-layers and a knowledge base. For the fuzzy logic approach, the possibility of assignment for each object is combined with a fuzzy knowledge base, which consists of information about the possibility of existence of tree species and geo-factors for a GIS-database consisting of slope, aspect, and height of a medium resolution DTM, soil type, and <b>forestry</b> site <b>maps.</b> Therefore, for all woodland species of this specific region, an index of location factors was developed.
