40|$|The {{hypothesis}} is advanced that a latitudinal {{shift in the}} tropical convective heating pattern can significantly alter temperatures in the extratropics. Results of a simplified general circulation model (GCM) show that the shift of a prescribed tropical heating toward the summer pole, on time scales longer than a few weeks, leads to a more intense cross-equatorial 'winter' Hadley circulation, enhanced upper-level tropical easterlies, and a slightly stronger subtropical winter jet, accompanied by warming at the winter middle and high latitudes {{as a result of}} increased dynamical heating. The indications are that there is a robust connection between the net dynamic heating in the extratropics and the implied changes in the subtropical wind shear resulting from adjustments in the Hadley circulation associated with convective <b>heating</b> <b>displacements</b> in the tropics. The implications are that (1) the low-frequency temporal variability in the Hadley circulation may {{play an important role in}} modulating wave transport in the winter extratropics, (2) the global climate may be sensitive to those processes that control deep cumulus convection in the tropics, and (3) systematic temperature biases in GCMs may be reduced by improving the tropical rainfall simulation...|$|R

In the dielectric loss curve, it can be identified the α (f <  101  Hz) and β (f ~  104  Hz) relaxations, evidencing the displacement to high frequencies of both relaxations in the second <b>heating.</b> The <b>displacement</b> of the α-relaxation is not easily observable due to the dc conductivity increase at low frequencies (f <  10 − 1  Hz). In order to reveal the high-f displacement of α-relaxation, the dielectric loss was obtained from the Kramers–Kronig transform ε″(f) ≈ dε′/dlnf, as shown in Fig.  2 c. The Kramers–Kronig relation extracts the ε″ (f) from the ε′(f), which is free from dc conductivity contributions [18]. In Fig.  2 c, the displacement of α-relaxation to higher frequencies is confirmed. The displacement of the α and β-relaxations to higher frequencies in the second heating can be either associated with an increase of the low-f conductivity or to a reduction of the average length (α-relaxation) and the distance (β-relaxation) among Nafion polymeric aggregates. As the low-f conductivity (f <  10 − 2  Hz) in the first and second heatings is similar (Fig.  2 a), the high-f displacement of α and β-relaxations can be assigned to a reduced length and distance of the polymeric aggregates, respectively, during sample heating.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamics}} of nanoscale bridge resonators fabricated from SOI wafers. When illuminated within an interference field, resonators are seen to self-oscillate due to feedback between <b>heating</b> and <b>displacement.</b> They are driven in high vacuum and their motion transduced with laser interferometry. Analysis of Maxwell’s equations indicates that laser heating {{is not confined to}} the resonator’s top surface. A finite element model is built to study thermo-mechanical coupling. Analysis shows that feedback is strongest in barely post-buckled beams, leading to low power self-oscillation. A theoretical model is built starting with the continuum description of the temperature and displace-ment fields and a Galerkin projection is used to obtain a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. These equations are analyzed using numerical contin-uation and perturbation theory. Analysis of the model suggests that a Hopf bifurcation leads to limit cycle oscillations and that multiple stable limit cycles may be possible due to periodicity in the interference field. The threshold power for self-oscillation as well as the amplitude, frequency, and frequency noise are measured experimentally. Measured amplitude-frequency relationships verify the predicted softening/hardening nature of first and second mode vibrations in pre- and post-buckled beams. Experimental results suggest that frequency noise in self-oscillating beams is due to instability {{in the power of the}} laser drive. Fluctuations in the laser power result in fluctuations of the resonant fre-quency via the power-amplitude-frequency relationship.

When illuminated within a laser interference field, devices self-oscillate {{in their first}} bending mode due to feedback between laser <b>heating</b> and device <b>displacement.</b> Compressive prestress buckles doubly supported beams leading to a strong amplitude–frequency relationship. Significant frequency instability is seen in doubly supported devices. Self-resonant beams are also driven inertially with varying drive amplitude and frequency. Regions of primary, sub-, and superharmonic entrainment are measured. Statistics of primary entrainment are measured for low drive amplitudes, where the effects of frequency instability are measurable. Sub-and superharmonic entrainment are not seen in singly supported beams. A simple model is built to explain why high-order entrainment is seen only in doubly supported beams. Its analysis suggests that the strong amplitude–frequency relationship in doubly supported beams enables hysteresis, wide regions of primary entrainment, and high orders of sub- and superharmonic entrainment.

30|$|First, it is {{important}} to note that GHG emissions are always reduced regardless of the scenario chosen. Any heat pump with any control scheme subjected to any of the three electricity generation attribution schemes will still result in a net improvement. Second, it is somewhat interesting to note that under scenarios SS-A and VC-A, GHG abatement increases under the worst-case scenario where natural gas generators provide for all new electricity demands. This is because it is assumed that natural gas generators are also the first to cease operating when demand for electricity decreases. Because SS and VC are unable to compete economically with natural gas fired furnaces, they are not as often used under the advanced control strategy. Electric furnaces however will always be out-competed by heat pumps and will therefore always be displaced by <b>heat</b> pumps. This <b>displacement</b> results in a net decrease in electrical demand under scenarios SS-A and VC-A (see Fig.  13). The resultant reduction in GHG emissions for electricity generation is therefore attributed to the heat pumps used in those two scenarios and GHG abatement increases relative to the status quo scenario.|$|R

The effect of viscous forces in displacements in heterogeneous media is described in two separate studies, one involving an extension of percolation theory to account for viscous effects, and another discussing the effect of geometry in general displacement processes...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{efficiency}} loss in heat engines is the inability of a sinusoidally displaced piston engines to approx-imate the ideal heat volumetric cycles the engines require. While {{attempts have been made}} to address this issue in the past, re-cent developments in Stirling engine technology utilizing rolling diaphragm seals on the cylinders has offered an opportunity to greatly increase the correlation between an engines volume-time profile to the ideal profile. By changing the radius of the piston used to drive the rolling diaphragm connection over its length, the piston can effectively be used as a ”transfer function ” trans-lating the sinusoidal displacement of the crankshaft into a near ideal <b>heat</b> cycle volumetric <b>displacement.</b> This work presents a methodology for determining the ideal shape of such a piston, and a model used to most effectively match a desired input linear displacement profile with output volumetric displacement pro-file, without compromising the operating conditions required to maintain the diaphragm itself.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} project, a newly {{developed}} 3 D laser vibrometer system {{was used to}} demonstrate that heating of the defect-free bulk correlates with local stresses in the material and is caused by damping of the ultrasound. Two additional mechanisms that lead to crack heating were identi ed as friction and plastic deformation. The measured quadratic relationship between <b>heating</b> and local <b>displacements</b> in the specimen is explained by an additional modulation of the normal force pressing the crack faces together. Due to the small displacements in the parts, {{it is necessary to}} postulate a mechanism strongly dominated by static rather than dynamic friction. Plastic deformation was only observed in extreme cases. Although local stress concentration occurs at crack tips, crack tip blunting as well as crack closure ordinarily prevent plastic deformation and crack growth. For the technical implementation, commonly used systems based on ultrasonic welding equipment were investigated and their disadvantages|especially with regard to reproducibility|were demonstrated and explained. Based on these results, a new technique was developed, which uses a tunable exciter to account for the individual eigenfrequencies of the specimen and to achieve resonant excitation of the specimen and to achieve a resonant excitation of the specimen. This also enabled increased eciency as a lower-power piezoelectric exciter is sucient to achieve the same displacements of the specimen. /p> p>br /> Finally, necessary aspects for a technical implementation were investigated. Of particular interest are methods to characterize and verify the non-destructive nature of the procedure. Detection limits, post-processing methods for the infrared data, causes for false indications and a comparison with conventional NDT methods are also discussed. /p...|$|R
