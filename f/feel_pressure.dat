5|$|In mid-2014, {{having just}} {{finished}} their previous collaboration, Fatale, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project {{would be a}} noir period piece or a science fiction tale. Brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year exclusive contract with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed that the creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to the publisher first. The pair announced The Fade Out and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} sure how many issues were needed to tell the story. Since Fatale had taken twice as long as originally planned, {{they did not want to}} mislead fans or <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> to conclude before they were ready. They did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues.|$|E
5|$|When {{developing}} {{plans for}} Blood-C, {{it was decided}} to shift its setting based on positive feedback from the change of setting between Blood: The Last Vampire and the franchise's first anime series Blood+. The only elements to be retained were the first name of the main character, having a katana as her weapon, and the basic premise of her defeating monsters with that sword. The wish for the project to be distinct from earlier entries was what spurred the collaboration with CLAMP, which became {{a large part of the}} anime's marketing campaign. Fujisaku, when asked in an interview to describe his one creative ambition for the series, said that it was to fully expand and build upon the basic concept established in Blood: The Last Vampire. The choice of a school setting, the first of its kind to be featured in the Blood franchise, was chosen because Mizushima wanted to portray a school life for Saya. When asked, Mizushima did not find the change from his previous comedy anime-based turnout a barrier to his work, but did <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> when handling a project within the Blood franchise.|$|E

25|$|McDonald was {{beginning}} to <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> to end the strike from the AFL-CIO. George Meany was willing to support the strike, but not if it meant negatively impacting national security. The strike was also affecting the auto industry, which was threatening to lay off {{tens of thousands of}} Walter Reuther's members due to a steel shortage.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding, {{also known}} as nursing, is the feeding of babies and young {{children}} with milk from a woman's breast. Breastfeeding decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections and diarrhea, both in developing and developed countries. Other benefits include lower risks of asthma, food allergies, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and leukemia. Breastfeeding may also improve cognitive development and decrease the risk of obesity in adulthood. Mothers may <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> to breastfeed, but {{in the developed world}} children generally grow up normally when bottle fed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{national}} associations provide {{funding to}} some skaters if they meet certain criteria. Many skaters take part-time jobs {{and some have}} tried crowdfunding. In Germany, many elite skaters join the army to fund their skating. In Italy, some skaters join police agencies' sport groups, such as the Polizia Penitenziaria's Fiamme Azzurre (Carolina Kostner, Anna Cappellini, Luca Lanotte) or Polizia di Stato's Fiamme Oro (Federica Faiella, Paolo Bacchini). Some competitive skaters depend on income from shows. Shows must be sanctioned by their association, i.e. skaters may lose their competitive eligibility if they take part without permission. In some cases, skaters may <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> to compete through injury {{in order to be}} allowed to perform in a show.|$|E
50|$|Faced {{with that}} danger, a justice may well <b>feel</b> <b>pressured</b> into {{deciding}} {{the way that}} he testified, and rejecting attempts at persuasion. Yet that would be a violation of the judge's duty to sincerely consider the parties' arguments.|$|R

500|$|Although Sendiri Lagi did fairly well, in the {{beginning}} of the 1990s Chrisye began to <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> from the increasingly visual-oriented music industry and growing amount of young talent. He again began considering leaving the music industry, feeling as if he had already [...] "reached the finish line". Despite reassurances from Yanti that many singers continue to perform into their sixties, Chrisye observed that increasing numbers of established acts were being pushed aside by newcomers. While in this state of despair, Chrisye was approached by Jay Subyakto and Gauri Nasution, who offered him a solo concert at the Plenary Hall of the Jakarta Convention Centre, which had never before hosted a solo concert by an Indonesian artist. Unconvinced he had sufficient fans to fill the hall, Chrisye initially refused.|$|E
500|$|Hartley was reprimanded by the {{stewards}} {{because he}} was deemed responsible for causing the crash between himself and Wainwright. He said that he felt [...] "very upset for the team" [...] but praised his car and Webber for his first (and only) stint. Hartley revealed {{that he did not}} <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> because of his large advantage upfront but did not apportion blame for the accident, calling it [...] "a shocking moment and it is a true shame." [...] Wainwright apportioned blame on Hartley for causing the incident, saying he was not aware the driver was near him until the crash occurred. He felt Hartley was attempting to pass him and move across the track to rejoin onto the racing line for the next turn. His co-driver Carroll observed the incident and stated Hartley had not left enough space which had been displayed on television. He said it was [...] "a very unfortunate accident and one that definitely could have been avoided. Definitely not our fault." [...] All three of Audi's No. 8 car drivers were disappointed over their retirement from a hybrid system failure but Jarvis was optimistic for the next race.|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} feature live action footage {{in the game}} after {{becoming}} frustrated with his previous projects, particularly with the technical challenge of translating an actor's performance into a game engine. Barlow set out to work with an actor on Her Story, having enjoyed the process while working at Climax Studio, albeit with a larger budget. He contacted Viva Seifert, whom he had intermittently worked with on [...] for a year, before its cancellation. He felt that Seifert is [...] "very good at picking up a line and intuitively pulling {{a lot of the}} subtext into her performance", which led him to believe that she was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role in Her Story. When Barlow asked Seifert to audition, he sent her a 300-page script, which he managed to reduce to 80 pages, by altering font size, as well as some dialogue; she accepted the role. Seifert began to <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> midway through filming, when she realised that [...] "the whole game is hinging" [...] on her performance. She described the shoot as [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "rather exhausting", and felt as if she was [...] "subtly being scrutinised" [...] by Barlow, which helped her performance. Barlow also felt that the intensity helped Seifert's performance, taking cues from director Alfred Hitchcock, who would upset his actors in order to achieve the greatest performance. Seifert felt that there were small nuances in her performance that may have [...] "added some twists and turns" [...] for players that Barlow had not anticipated. The game's seven police interviews were filmed roughly in chronological order over five days, in a process that Barlow called [...] "natural". Barlow travelled to Seifert's home county of Cornwall to film. He felt that finding the locations for the interrogation rooms was the simplest part of production, because [...] "everywhere has crappy looking rooms", with footage being recorded in a council building in Truro. When filming was complete, Barlow wanted {{to give the impression that}} the videos had been recorded in 1994, but found digital filters were unable to capture this time frame appropriately. Instead, he recorded the footage through two VHS players to create imperfections in the video before digitising the video into the game.|$|E
50|$|Police {{lying under}} oath, {{particularly}} in drug crimes, is allegedly commonplace in certain areas; some federal grant {{programs such as}} Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program are tied to numbers, and police officers may also <b>feel</b> <b>pressured</b> to prove their productivity.|$|R

2500|$|Because the {{matching}} itself happens after the event, {{people do not}} <b>feel</b> <b>pressured</b> to select or reject each other in person. [...] On the other hand, feedback and gratification are delayed as participants must wait {{a day or two}} for their results to come in.|$|R
2500|$|Both {{boys and}} girls <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> from their friends to have sex. The {{perception}} adolescents have of their best friends' sexual behavior has a significant association with their own sex behavior. [...] Sexually active peers {{have a negative effect}} on adolescent sexual delay; however, responsive parent-adolescent sex discussions can buffer these effects.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{tend to view}} {{efforts to}} reduce medical {{services}} as [...] "healthcare rationing in the United States". Since doctors {{do not want to}} be seen as withholding care, they are hesitant to change established behavior in any way that lessens the amount of treatment they order. Doctors say that they often <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> to engage in defensive medicine by conducting extra testing to avoid lawsuits.|$|E
2500|$|High-stakes {{testing is}} not synonymous with {{high-pressure}} testing. [...] An American {{high school student}} might <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> to perform well on the SAT-I college aptitude exam. [...] However, SAT scores do not directly determine admission to any college or university, {{and there is no}} clear line drawn between those who pass and those who fail, so it is not formally considered a high-stakes test. [...] On the other hand, because the SAT-I scores are given significant weight in the admissions process at some schools, many people believe that it has consequences for doing well or poorly and is therefore a high-stakes test under the simpler, common definition.|$|E

2500|$|Burney {{was fifteen}} {{by the time}} her father {{remarried}} in 1767. Entries in her diaries suggest that {{she was beginning to}} <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> to give up her writing, as something [...] "unladylike" [...] that [...] "might vex Mrs. Allen." [...] Feeling that she had transgressed what was proper, she burnt that same year her first manuscript, The History of Caroline Evelyn, which she had written in secret. Despite this repudiation of writing, Frances kept up her diaries and in them wrote an account of the emotions that led up to that dramatic act. She eventually recouped some of the effort that went into the first manuscript by using it as a foundation for her first novel, Evelina, which follows the life of the fictional Caroline Evelyn's daughter.|$|E
2500|$|Believing {{that further}} {{landings}} would {{occur in the}} northeast, Percival did not reinforce the 22nd Brigade until the morning of 9 February; when he did, the forces dispatched consisted of two half-strength battalions from the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade. These units reached Bennett around midday, and, shortly afterwards, Percival allocated the composite 6th/15th Indian Infantry Brigade to reinforce Bennett's force on one hour's notice to move from their position around the Singapore racecourse. Throughout the day, the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade, still holding its position on the coast, began to <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> on its exposed flank, and after discussions between Percival and Bennett, {{it was decided that}} they would have to be pulled back east to maintain the southern part of the Allied line. Bennett decided to form a secondary defensive line, known as the [...] "Kranji-Jurong Switch Line", oriented to the west, and positioned between the two rivers, with its centre around Bulim, east of Tengah Airfield—which subsequently came under Japanese control—and just north of Jurong.|$|E
2500|$|Lind said of {{assuming}} the role, [...] "The audition for Bianca {{felt like an}} amusement park ride. It was such a thrill {{to go to an}} audition by plane rather than subway! I can only hope I do half of what [...] did with the part. She played it with amazing grace and dignity. Now I need to breathe my own life into it." [...] Regarding Bianca being the [...] "moral center of Pine Valley" [...] and the pressure of being a recast, Lind said she did <b>feel</b> <b>pressure</b> in the beginning. [...] "I did look at some of [...] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca." [...] Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: Part of me feels very strongly that [...] created a character that was so well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself rather than using someone else’s interpretation. I understand these emotions and all humans do, of wanting to support your family and be equal and be in love. Ultimately, I said, [...] "I can feel the pressure, but I am going to let it go." [...] The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going to throw myself into it.|$|E
5000|$|Michelle Madrigal, Sid Lucero and Paolo Contis {{were cast}} to play three equally {{important}} roles. Madrigal <b>feels</b> <b>pressured,</b> especially her character Cathy Galvez is the lynchpin of the series, said that [...] "My goal for this {{role is to}} showcase my capabilities as an actor rather than show more skin." ...|$|R
