5|$|Bhrigu– Bhrigu is {{a renowned}} sage of India, who is {{extremely}} powerful and malevolent. He {{believes that the}} Somras <b>is</b> <b>never</b> Evil, and hence mobilizes the war against Shiva.

50|$|The show is {{considered}} to be a lost television series since it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> to <b>be</b> found anywhere because it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> picked up by Boomerang and it <b>was</b> <b>never</b> released in any home media.|$|R

5|$|The current view among astronomers who model Type Ia {{supernova}} explosions, however, is {{that this}} limit <b>is</b> <b>never</b> actually attained and collapse <b>is</b> <b>never</b> initiated. Instead, the increase in pressure and density due to the increasing weight raises {{the temperature of the}} core, and as the white dwarf approaches about 99% of the limit, a period of convection ensues, lasting approximately 1,000years. At some point in this simmering phase, a deflagration flame front is born, powered by carbon fusion. The details of the ignition are still unknown, including the location and number of points where the flame begins. Oxygen fusion is initiated shortly thereafter, but this fuel is not consumed as completely as carbon.|$|E
5|$|Using similar arguments, {{this can}} be {{generalized}} to a system with an arbitrary number of particles. In general, as long as all forces are due to the interaction of objects with mass, {{it is possible to}} define a system such that net momentum <b>is</b> <b>never</b> lost nor gained.|$|E
5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the justification of Heracles's divine parentage, so she <b>is</b> <b>never</b> condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E

5|$|Acetyl-CoA, on {{the other}} hand, derived from {{pyruvate}} oxidation, or from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one molecule of acetyl-CoA is consumed for every molecule of oxaloacetate present in the mitochondrial matrix, and <b>is</b> <b>never</b> regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of acetyl-CoA that produces CO2 and water, with the energy thus released captured {{in the form of}} ATP.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which <b>is</b> <b>never</b> seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated {{as a result of}} being subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E
5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil <b>is</b> <b>never</b> perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E

5|$|At {{several points}} in the book, Bechdel {{questions}} whether her decision to come out as a lesbian {{was one of the}} triggers for her father's suicide. This question <b>is</b> <b>never</b> answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive and negative lights.|$|E
5|$|Barium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBa and atomic number56. It {{is the fifth}} element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery alkaline earth metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium <b>is</b> <b>never</b> found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{original}} working titles of the film were first The Beatles and then Beatlemania, the group's name <b>is</b> <b>never</b> spoken in the movie—it is, however, visible on Ringo's drum kit, on the stage lighting, and on the helicopter in the final scene. The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of beetles visible on the wall behind the dancers.|$|E

Dysprosium <b>is</b> <b>never</b> found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as xenotime. Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven isotopes, the most abundant of which is 164Dy.|$|E
5|$|Eurogamer {{noted the}} {{annoyance}} {{of returning to}} defend over 20 towns each with recurring zombie problems, but said that the game mechanic <b>is</b> <b>never</b> too bothersome and even appreciated its element of time management, {{similar to that of}} the Dead Rising game series. IGN thought that the lack of fast travel was an impediment. Reviewers also noted technical issues with moving Marston's character, especially when climbing ladders and outrunning zombies.|$|E

The aqueduct has some decorative architectural features, including rusticated spandrels and plain pilasters between the arches.|$|R
