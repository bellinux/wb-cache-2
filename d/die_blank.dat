This study {{applies the}} {{finite element method}} (FEM) in con-junction with an abductive network to predict springback’s angle during the U-shaped bending process with counter force. To verify the {{prediction}} of FEM simulation for springback, the experimental data are compared {{with the results of}} current simulation. Bending force, effective stress distribution and springback are investigated for different process parameters, such as profile radius of <b>die,</b> <b>blank</b> holder force and counter force of U-shaped bending process, by finite element analysis. The abductive network is then utilized to synthesize the data sets obtained from numerical simulations. Finally, prediction model is established for predicting springback’s angle under a suitable range of process parameters...|$|E
40|$|Stamping dies {{are used}} in the Sheet Metal Forming (SMF) process for {{manufacturing}} of car body parts. The lead time for design and manufacturing of a stamping die is long, and therefore costly. In the final step of the manufacturing process, manual rework is performed to reach a desired pressure distribution on the forming surfaces in order to achieve a robust process and an approved part within tolerance. The main purpose for this work is to study and further develop a Virtual Rework Method that alters the shape of the forming surfaces of a die to compensate for the displacements of a stamping press that occur during stamping. Measurements were performed to obtain the displacements that occur in the stamping press during stamping. These measurements were performed on a double action deep drawing press of the brand Danly, located at Volvo Cars Tool & Die department in Olofström, Sweden. The measurement yields information of how the stamping press is deflecting and deforming during operation. The measurements are recorded with a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system that records the displacements of the press during stamping. The displacements obtained in the measurements are then used as constraints to inverse FE- model a press table with topology optimization. This optimized press table is used in the Virtual Rework Method to be able to simulate both the deformations of the press and the internal deformations that occur in the die. Pre-simulations were performed before the measurements to ensure that the blank holder plate used in the measurements would withstand the applied blank holder force. These simulations also yield if the displacements were large enough for the ARAMIS DIC system to capture. The FE-model used in this work consisted of a <b>die,</b> <b>blank</b> holder, blank holder plate, outer ram and the optimized press table. The Virtual Rework Method was applied on the FE-model, where the result concludes that the altered shape of the deformed forming surfaces is almost identical to the shape of the nominal forming surfaces. However, an inversed modelled structure that represents the behavior of the outer ram is required to apply the Virtual Rework Method on the blank holder. This inversed modelled structure could be created from the displacements obtained in the measurements. To apply the Virtual Rework method on the punch, further measurements are required, where the position of the ARAMIS DIC system is altered, or an additional ARAMIS DIC system is used.  Pressverktyg används i plåtformningsprocessen vid tillverkning av karossdelar.

Dessa mätningar utfördes på en dubbelverkande djupdragningspress av märket Danly, som finns hos Volvo Cars Tool & Die avdelning i Olofström, Sverige. Mätningen gav information om hur pressen deformeras under stämpling.

En förstudie utfördes innan mätningarna för att säkerställa att den plåthållarplattan som användes i mätningarna skulle motstå den applicerade plåthållarkraften. Denna förstudie gjordes även för att säkerhetsställa att förskjutningarna som uppstår i plåthållarplattan var stora nog för att ARAMIS DIC systemet skulle registrera dem. FE-modellerna som användes i detta arbete bestod av en dyna, plåthållare, plåthållarplatta, yttre slid och det optimerade pressbordet. Den Virtuella fläckningsmetoden applicerades på FE- modellen, där resultatet gav slutsatsen att den korrigerade formningsytan med applicerad belastning är nästintill identisk med formen på den nominella formningsytan.

Denna inversmodellerade struktur kunde erhållas från de förskjutning som erhölls i mätningarna. För att tillämpa den Virtuella fläckningsmetoden på stansen krävs ytterligare mätningar, där ARAMIS DIC systemets position ändras eller ett ytterligare ARAMIS DIC system används.  Reduced Lead Time through Advanced Die Structure Analysis - Vinnov...|$|E
