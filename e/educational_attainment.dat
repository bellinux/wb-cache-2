Considering the fact that the average American does not have a bachelor's degree, he or she is most likely employed in the service, sales, and office support fields with many working in the professional support and business fields as well. All together the American economy and labor force have changed greatly since the middle of the 20th. century with most workers today being employed in office and service occupations.|$|E
5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low <b>educational</b> <b>attainment,</b> fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{education}} system {{played a central}} part in the country's recovery and rapid {{economic growth in the}} decades following the end of World War II. After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four years of university. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program, in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years. In Japan, having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself. Highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> make an individual more attractive in the workforce. The lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained. Furthermore, skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in Japan's highly technological economy.|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{endogenous}} growth {{model in which}} gender inequality in employment has {{an important role in}} explaining different development dimensions such as socio-political participation, <b>educational</b> <b>attainments,</b> and working hours, in developed countries. Our model’s predictions are in line with some stylized facts observed across European countries: more equal societies have higher socio-political participation, devote less time to work, and present higher <b>educational</b> <b>attainments</b> and rates of economic growth than less equal ones. Our model suggests that promoting female employment must be accompanied by pro-family policies in order to sustain economic growth and improve quality of life. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} a Swedish alcohol policy experiment {{conducted in}} the late 1960 s to identify the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on <b>educational</b> <b>attainments</b> and labor market outcomes. The experiment started in November 1967 and was prematurely discontinued in July 1968 due to {{a sharp increase in}} alcohol consumption in the experimental regions, particularly among youths. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences estimation strategy we find that around the age of 30 the cohort in utero during the experiment has substantially reduced <b>educational</b> <b>attainments,</b> lower earnings and higher welfare dependency rates compared to the surrounding cohorts. The results indicate that investments in early-life health have far-reaching effects on economic outcomes in later life. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Educational</b> <b>attainment</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} determinants of class status. As <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> represents expertise, which is a necessary component of the capitalist market system, its ownership may be seen as the ownership of one of the factors of production. In other words, those with advanced degrees already own one of the essential buttresses of the economy: expertise. Additionally <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> is basis for occupational selection. Those with higher <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> tend to be positioned in occupations with greater autonomy, influence over the organizational process, and better financial compensation.|$|E
25|$|While {{economic}} {{compensation is}} merely the result of scarcity, <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> {{may be related to}} that very economic principle as well. The attainment of a graduate degree represents the acquisition of expertise (a factor of production) that in itself may be scarce; thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner. As stated above, the upper middle class features a strong reliance on <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> (the ownership of expertise) for much of its social and economic well-being. The following chart further explains the strong correlation between <b>educational</b> <b>attainment</b> and personal as well as household income.|$|E

We find that LBW has significant long-term effects on self-reported health status, <b>educational</b> <b>attainments,</b> and labor market outcomes. However, there is little evidence of variation in the effects of LBW by SES. An important exception is that high SES women of LBW are less likely to report that they are in poor or fair health than other LBW women. ...|$|R
