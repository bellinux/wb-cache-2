This research work has been performed to investigate the way of improving the lateral load resisting capacity of buildings. The deflection of different case of structure such as a) Concrete Frame, b) Steel Frame c) Hybrid Masonry Frame system has been investigated in this research work by using civil engineering based finite element analysis software STAAD Pro. - 2006. Four (4) sides of a 15 story commercial building has been considered in this research work.

It was erected by his widower, Giorgio Ferrari for the wife whom he lived with [...] "in the most conjugal and most joyous marriage" [...] for 8 years. Olimpia died in 1582 at the age of 29. In the same year Ferrari, a publisher from Cremona, set up another funerary monument in the basilica for himself but this disappeared without trace. The monument itself is a simple Renaissance wall tomb consisting of an epitaph, the carved coat-of-arms and the painted portrait of the deceased in an oval <b>frame.</b> The <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the arched broken pediment is missing.|$|R

40|$|BELL-like {{homeobox}} genes encode plant-specific transcription factors, {{at least}} some of which are important for ovule development. Here we report MELBEL 1 -MELBEL 4, the first BELT- like genes from a non-flowering plant, the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon. Our analyses suggest that there was already at least one BELL-like gene present in the most recent common ancestor of extant seed plants about 300 million years ago. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that since this time, not only the DNA-binding homeodomain, but also a protein-protein interaction domain upstream of the homeodomain, termed the BEL domain, has been highly conserved. Sequence comparison of the BEL domain with upstream domains that have been conserved in other TALE homeodomain proteins, i. e. MEIS, KNOX, and PBC, revealed only weak sequence similarity. However, since homology has been shown for MEIS, KNOX, and PBC domains and since KNOX and BEL domains directly interact in vivo, it appears likely that the BEL domain was also derived from an ancestral upstream (MEINOX) domain.

40|$|Routine pH {{measurements}} {{are carried out}} with pH meter-glass electrode assemblies. In most cases the glass and reference electrodes are thereby fashioned into a single probe, the so- called 'combination electrode' or simply 'the pH electrode'. The use of these electrodes is subject to various effects, described below, producing uncertainties of unknown magnitude. Therefore, the measurement of pH of a sample requires a suitable calibration by certified standard buffer solutions (CRMs) traceable to primary pH standards. The procedures in use are based on calibrations at one point, at two points bracketing the sample pH and at a series of points, the so- called multi-point calibration. The multi-point calibration (MPC) is recommended if minimum uncertainty and maximum consistency are required {{over a wide range}} of unknown pH values. Details of uncertainty computations for the two-point and MPC procedure are given. Furthermore, the multi-point calibration is a useful tool to characterise the performance of pH electrodes. This is demonstrated with different commercial pH electrodes. Electronic supplementary material is available if you access this article at [URL] 002 - 1506 - 5.

40|$|Among the Middle Penninic basements of the Internal NW-Alps, the Ruitor massif {{shows the}} best {{preserved}} remnants of pre-Permian metamorphic rocks. Their Barrovian-type mineral associations are somewhat masked by the greenschist to blueschist Alpine metamorphism of Tertiary age. Four Ruitor gneisses have been analysed, showing geochemical characters of granitoids from orogenic zones. Zircon morphology also suggests magmatic protoliths and a crustal source; {{some of the}} morphological zircon types suggest anatectic granites. The first U-Pb ages on zircon for this massif have been obtained concurrently through conventional multigrain and ion microprobe dating. Two metavolcanic rocks at 471 ± 5 and 468 ± 22 Ma could be slightly older than the porphyritic augen gneisses at 465 ± 11 and 460 ± 7 Ma. Regional data from the other Internal basement massifs suggest that the Variscan event is poorly recorded, except in Ruitor-type units. Ruitor and Sapey gneisses belonged to the same unit (Nappe des Pontis), which was affected by a 480 - 450 -Ma event including volcanism and anatexis and ended with a late calc-alkaline granite emplacement at 460 - 450 Ma. The distribution of Variscan basement units roughly parallels Alpine zonation. Electronic supplementary material is available if you access this article at [URL] 002 - 0280 - 0.

This paper describes one approach to a Lunar Sample Return mission. This Lunar Sample mission consists of two spacecraft: a communications module and a landedsample return module; the modules are carried to the Moon by a bus. The desired landing site in this case is on the backside of Moon which cannot be seen from Earth; this is why a communications module is needed.
