Critics also say if a client learns of their own score, it may have an adverse effect on their morale, but even if the scores were only shown to the employers, it could affect the employers attitude towards the employee which could hurt the effectiveness of the employee.|$|E

Research has touched on how maximum performance can be predicted by these tests.

[...] Examples of such behavior can range from gossiping about a co-worker to stealing money from the organization. Researchers have linked integrity testing to maximum performance because they hypothesize that integrity levels will determine differences in how individuals perform their job, differences which can affect maximum performance in particular.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [62]- 66) This {{study is}} concerned with developing appropriate criteria of counterproductivity and assessing the discriminant and criterion-related validity of an integrity measure. In addition, the incremental validity of an <b>integrity</b> <b>test</b> over personality traits and a cognitive ability test was examined. Correlational {{analysis was used to}} show that while the <b>integrity</b> <b>test</b> was unrelated to cognitive ability, it was highly intercorrelated with personality. Specifically, the <b>integrity</b> <b>test</b> displayed corrected correlations with risk-taking as high as - 1. 00. The behavioral criteria used for this study were pilferage, fraud, communication of privileged information, and a composite of rule-breaking, time worked, and tardiness. Results of regression analyses showed that the <b>integrity</b> <b>test</b> can be used to predict pilferage and provide an improvement in prediction of pilferage once the variance accounted for by personality and cognitive ability is removed. However, these analyses also showed that personality and cognitive ability possess similar incremental validity with respect to integrity. Further regression analyses failed to find predictive ability for integrity for the composite criterion, fraud, and communication of privileged information, or incremental validity for integrity in regards to the criterion composite and communication of privileged information. Findings of incremental validity regarding the criterion of fraud are limited due to suppressor effects. Semipartial set correlation analyses confirmed the lack of incremental validity of the <b>integrity</b> <b>test</b> over personality and cognitive ability in relation to the set of criteria.
