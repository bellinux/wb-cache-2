40|$|International audienceThe HYDROGUARD {{project is}} being {{developed}} {{with a view to}} the efficient and rational management of means of preventing and combating flooding, pollution, and marine submergence. The first targeted regions are Languedoc-Roussillon and PACA. The project aims at developing autonomous technologies and equipment to be put in place across the territory (storm basins, streams, outputs from wastewater treatment plants, hydraulic structures, lagoons and shoreline [...] .) in order to contribute to the monitoring and ongoing management of coastal and surface water bodies and territories, especially during crisis situations (flooding, accidental pollution, marine submergence). Topics taken into consideration in the framework of the HYDROGUARD project keep the focus on present concerns about risk management. The overall system, consisting of especially developed buoys embedding a brand-new reliable Decision Support System and high-speed telecommunicating facilities, can be static - located in sensitive areas - or dynamic - deployed over operational areas {{in the case of an}} alert. In case of an alarm, the proposed mechanism is the optimal tool for anticipating actions, contributing to decision-making, and guiding relief measures by means of the range of information acquired through the detectors / sensors. Once the alert is over, the system returns to relaying relevant information to State services, communities, individuals, managers of industrial sites and <b>delegated</b> <b>services.</b> The originality of the system lies in its decentralization, proximity, redundancy and interoperability with other existing systems. This project is directly linked to the recommendations of the French Ministry of Environment, Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea (MEEDM), regarding knowledge, prevention, prediction and early warning; and the Water Framework Directive, for which it is necessary to develop suitable devices, in particular with regard to monitoring, improving the chemical status of water bodies, and maintaining quality resources. Finally, an evaluation of the benefits of such a system will be assessed, by means of economic Costs-Benefit Analysis (CBA). The actual project team is multi-disciplinary. The end-users targeted by the system are municipalities and local authorities, ports, firefighters and other safety personnel, as well as engineers or industrialists in the framework of their missions of prevention, protection, fighting against floods, and management of water resources...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In recent years, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} trend for multimedia applications to use <b>delegate</b> <b>service</b> providers for content distribution, archiving, search and retrieval. These <b>delegate</b> <b>services</b> have brought new challenges {{to the protection of}} multimedia content confidentiality. This paper discusses the importance and feasibility of applying a joint signal processing and cryptographic approach to multimedia encryption, in order to address the access control issues unique to multimedia applications. We propose two atomic encryption operations that can preserve standard compliance and are friendly to delegate processing. Quantitative analysis for these operations is presented to demonstrate that a good tradeoff can be made between security and bitrate overhead. In assisting the design and evaluation of media security systems, we also propose a set of multimedia-oriented security scores to quantify the security against approximation attacks and to complement the existing notion of generic data security. Using video as an example, we present a systematic study on how to strategically integrate different atomic operations to build a video encryption system. The resulting system can provide superior performance over both generic encryption and its simple adaptation to video in terms of a joint consideration of security, bitrate overhead, and friendliness to delegate processing. Index Terms — multimedia encryption, delegate processing, overhead analysis, security score. I...|$|R

The master thesis focuses in particular on the French specificities, notably the allocation of the tactical responsibilities (service design and characteristics).

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to examine whether small municipalities can reduce costs through cooperation and delegation. We first examine factors explaining the decision of municipalities to cooperate and <b>delegate</b> <b>service</b> delivery responsibility, in this case residential solid waste services, to another government. Furthermore, we estimate the impact of cooperation on the costs of providing residential solid waste services. The empirical analysis is done using a sample of small Spanish municipalities. Results of the empirical analysis suggest that cooperation is a pragmatic choice for municipalities with a sub-optimal size: municipalities that cooperate by delegating face lower costs for residential solid waste services than those that do not. Furthermore, we find that cooperation allows municipalities to save costs once we control {{for the form of}} production and other factors explaining costs...|$|R

40|$|With the {{persistent}} shift towards multi-sourcing, {{the complexity of}} service delivery is continuously increasing. This presents new challenges for clients who now have to integrate interdependent services from multiple providers. As other functions, service integration is subject to make-or-buy decisions: clients can either build the required capabilities themselves or <b>delegate</b> <b>service</b> integration to external functions. To define detailed organizational models, one requires understanding of specific tasks and how to allocate them. Based on a qualitative and quantitative expert study, we analyze generic organizational models, and identify key service integration tasks. The allocation of these tasks to clients or their providers generates a set of granular organizational structures. We analyze drivers for delegating these tasks, and develop typical allocations in practice. Our work contributes to expanding the theoretical foundations of service integration. Moreover, our findings will assist clients to design their service integration organization, and to build more effective multi-sourcing solutions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{assumption}} {{of the availability of}} port information at design time of service compositions in Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) is not valid for an increasing number of hosts on the Internet that do not have a public, static IP address. Existing workflow engines do not support services deployed on such hosts, as service invocations require the availability of port information defined either in concrete WSDL definitions or within a deployment descriptor of the BPEL workflow engine. This paper presents a workflow engine that supports runtime look-up of service endpoints based on a P 2 P middleware. Using a service identifier based on a DHT identifier, Service Proxy objects that encapsulate port information are downloaded over the structured P 2 P network from the host where the service is deployed. A <b>Service</b> Proxy <b>delegates</b> <b>service</b> invocations to an abstract protocol adaptor framework that uses dynamic invocation mechanisms to provide a protocol-independent execution of remote services, e. g., over GIOP/IIOP or SOAP. This allows us to specify binding- and port-agnostic service compositions in BPEL using abstract WSDL and our service identifiers. To validate our approach, we extended the ActiveBPEL workflow engine to support the discovery protocol adaptor. ...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Ministry of Environment, in 1992 tariffs {{by private}} {{providers}} were 22% {{higher than for}} public providers. [...] After competition in the sector has been strengthened through the Loi Sapin in 1993, the difference declined to 13% in 1998, according to the Ministry of Environment. No matter how high the difference is, these assessments do not compare apples with apples. For example, public companies {{do not have to}} pay for the acquisition of public land. Also, they are not subject to corporate income tax (taxe professionnelle) or property tax (redevance pour occupation du domaine public). Both factors reduce the costs of public companies compared to private companies without providing an economic benefit, since the higher costs of private companies are channeled back to the public treasury. In addition, a study by the research institute INRA showed that the municipalities with the most difficult conditions tend to <b>delegate</b> <b>service</b> provision to the private sector, thus biasing the comparison of tariff levels. Among the conditions driving municipalities to seek private sector participation are the classification in an ecologically sensitive zone implying stricter wastewater treatment standards and a lower population density implying a longer network per customer.|$|R
