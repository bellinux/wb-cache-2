25|$|A {{thyristor}} is a solid-state {{semiconductor device}} with four layers of alternating P and N-type materials. It acts exclusively as a bistable switch, conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, {{and continuing to}} conduct while the voltage across the device is not reversed (<b>forward-biased).</b> A three-lead thyristor is designed to control the larger current of its two leads by combining that current with the smaller current of its other lead, known as its control lead. In contrast, a two-lead thyristor is designed to switch on if the potential difference between its leads is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage).|$|E
25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become <b>forward-biased</b> (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a flyback diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|E

40|$|The <b>forward-bias</b> puzzle is {{probably}} the most important puzzle in international finance. But there is a simple solution. Covered interest parity implies that the <b>forward-bias</b> puzzle is the result of two omitted variables: (1) the future change in the forward exchange rate and (2) the future interest rate differential.

50|$|Newer CMOS {{output buffers}} using lightly doped {{silicide}} drains are more ESD sensitive; the N-channel driver usually suffers {{damage in the}} oxide layer or n+/p well junction. This is caused by current crowding during the snapback of the parasitic NPN transistor. In P/NMOS totem-pole structures, the NMOS transistor is almost always the one damaged. The structure of the junction influences its ESD sensitivity; corners and defects can lead to current crowding, reducing the damage threshold. <b>Forward-biased</b> junctions are less sensitive than reverse-biased ones because the Joule heat of <b>forward-biased</b> junctions is dissipated through a thicker layer of the material, {{as compared to the}} narrow depletion region in reverse-biased junction.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of small area (2 - mu m-diameter) Pt-GaAs Schottky barrier diodes has been made, by using a wafer chip with a matrix of these diodes lying within approximately a minority carrier diffusion length of one another. Using one diode as collector and another as emitter, transistor measurements indicated that the dominant contribution to the current is the majority-carrier thermiconic field emission current for large <b>forward-bias</b> voltage whereas the smaller <b>forward-bias</b> recombination in the space-charge region was most important. The minority carrier injection ratio is measurable only for large <b>forward-bias</b> voltages, decreasing from approximately equals 10 ** minus ** 2 to 10 ** minus ** 5 as V//E//B increases from 0. 5 to 1. 0 V.

The arms of our modulator are formed by an optimized planar photonic crystal waveguide (PPhCW) in which we have implemented at one arm a PIN diode. The choice of this configuration allows an optimal overlap between the electromagnetic field of the PPhCW guided mode and the optical index modulation induced by the free plasma dispersion effect. In addition, the use of PPhCW in the slow light regime reduces considerably the length of the Mach-Zehnder arms.
