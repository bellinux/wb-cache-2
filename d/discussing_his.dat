5|$|At {{the core}} of Confucian ethics were the {{selected}} virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, ritual, and righteousness. The amalgamation of these ideas into a theological system involving earlier cosmological theories of yin and yang {{as well as the}} five phases (i.e. natural cycles which governed Heaven, Earth, and Man) was first pioneered by the official Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE). Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals comes into question with hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang (798 BCE) or Liu Xin (d. 23 CE), three of his original memorials sent to the throne <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st-century-CE Book of Han.|$|E

5|$|David Hillis, one of DeLee's {{colleagues at}} the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, {{published}} a 1917 journal article about his invention of the fetoscope, {{also known as the}} head stethoscope. By 1922, DeLee published a report of a similar device. Though DeLee published his findings several years after Hillis, he claimed that he had been openly <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> idea for the device over many years. The device became known as the DeLee-Hillis stethoscope. DeLee was also the inventor of a catheter used to suction an infant's airway; the DeLee suction trap is still used after the delivery of a baby. He was one of the earliest physicians to advocate for the lower segment cesarean section.|$|E
5|$|Shaftesbury and {{his third}} wife had {{separated}} in April 2004 and divorce proceedings had been set in motion.

Shaftesbury wanted to end this arrangement and the marriage, so that he could marry his new girlfriend. While Shaftesbury was <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> desire with his wife, a fight broke out between him and his wife's brother, Mohammed M'Barek. Lord Shaftesbury died during the fight, when Mohammed strangled him, breaking his neck.|$|E
5|$|With Anderson serving chiefly as {{executive}} producer, {{the majority of}} the writing input for Captain Scarlet was provided by Tony Barwick, who had previously written for the short-lived second season of Thunderbirds. Originally given the role of script editor, Barwick went on to pen 18 of the 32 episodes himself, and was also often required to make substantial changes to other writers' work. While <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> approach to writing episodes in a 1986 interview, he drew parallels between the premise and characters of Captain Scarlet and those of Thunderbirds, suggesting, for example, that Spectrum was similar to International Rescue and that the character of Captain Black was like the earlier recurring villain from Thunderbirds, The Hood.|$|E

5|$|As the Second World War loomed, the British Admiralty {{commissioned}} Lethbridge {{to undertake}} a reconnaissance mission to Iceland to analyse German naval activity around the country, which he carried out in summer 1939. Lethbridge however treated the mission with contempt, spending {{much of the time}} visiting sites that interested him, such as locations mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas. Back in Britain, he self-published a short volume <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> Icelandic journey, News from Tili. As war broke out, Lethbridge organised the transfer of much of the museum's collections to Balsham Caves for safe keeping, while also becoming a warden of the Air Raid Precautions. He also led the rescue excavation of ten prehistoric tumuli that were being destroyed to enable the construction of Snailwell Airfield for the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|By 2008, Lukather was {{the only}} remaining, {{original}} Toto member still performing with the band: Bobby Kimball {{was also in the}} band at the time, but earlier had been absent from it for some time – whereas Lukather has been with Toto since its formation. However, in June of the same year, Lukather himself decided to leave Toto. This decision directly led to the official dissolution of the band. In a 2011 interview <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> career with Toto, Lukather indicated that the band had evolved too far from its original incarnation and that he was dealing with the physical and mental toll of recording and performing. In February 2010, the band announced that they would reunite to support Toto bassist Mike Porcaro, who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. They continued to tour on a limited basis in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after {{debriefing}} his team. Meanwhile, May follows Talbot, who is actually Hydra agent Sunil Bakshi using advanced technology to take on Talbot's voice and appearance. May is attacked by Agent 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and uses the same device to take on her voice and appearance. Agent 33 goes to the Bus, a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly plants a computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> contingency plan, in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that Agent 33 is not May and turns on her; this draws the attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E

5|$|In May 1948, {{while he}} was holding church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as a}} heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> wishes regarding the family's finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting on the Navajo Nation. At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of DNA sequencing {{and the use}} of genetic data in determining relationships between species of monocots confirmed what many taxonomists had long suspected: Liliaceae s.l. was highly polyphyletic. The family was demonstrated to include a significant number of unrelated groups, which belonged to quite separate families and even orders. For instance some genera such as Hyacinthus, previously placed in Liliaceae s.l., were reclassified in families within Asparagales (in this case Asparagaceae). In 1995 Chase et al. reviewed the understanding of the lilioids and equated them to Dahlgreen's Liliiflorae, which they designated as superorder Lilianae. They pointed out that the understanding of the phylogenetics of this group was critical {{for the establishment of a}} monocot classification. They also noted that while many authors treated this group as monophyletic (having a common ancestor), a closer reading of their texts revealed evidence of paraphyly (excluding some descendants of a common ancestor). For instance, Dahlgren had based monophyly on a single synapomorphy, that of a petaloid perianth, yet in <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> Lilliflorae admitted it was undoubtedly paraphyletic. Dahlgren treated the monocots as split between ten superorders and placed five orders (Dioscoreales, Asparagales, Liliales, Melanthiales, Burmanniales and Orchidales) in his Liliiflorae.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{continues}} his ascent, murdering powerful foes {{that include the}} Titan Perses and the god Helios, which causes the sun to disappear, plunging the world into eternal darkness. This leads to an encounter with Hermes, who mocks Kratos for his past sins. The Spartan chases the god, who leads him to the Chamber of the Flame. Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and {{is key to the}} success of his quest, as it was in God of War. Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After <b>discussing</b> <b>his</b> jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos and is killed. Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She then leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a teleportation device. In a suicide mission, the blacksmith sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the Omphalos Stone so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims {{that he was trying to}} protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box. Reusing the Hyperion Gate, the Spartan travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills the taunting goddess, ending all plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.|$|E
