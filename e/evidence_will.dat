25|$|Brown {{initially}} {{refused to}} provide {{testimony to the}} Commission of Inquiry under Sir Anthony Evans in October 2016. Brown's <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> be called again in November '16 to answer questions arising from the Auditor General's report of financial irregularities during Brown's term in government.|$|E
25|$|Police {{have not}} commented upon any similarities, {{but said that}} any {{surviving}} forensic <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> be rechecked. Although DNA {{had been used to}} rule out a previous suspect, detectives believe a DNA link to Tobin is unlikely due to a deterioration of the samples through poor storage.|$|E
25|$|The {{quest for}} the Dorian {{invasion}} had begun {{as an attempt to}} explain the differences between Peloponnesian society depicted by Homer and the historical Dorians of classical Greece. The first scholars to work on the problem were historians researching the only resources available to them: the Greek legends. The philologists (later linguists) subsequently took up the challenge but in the end only brought the problem into sharper definition. Finally the archaeologists have inherited the issue. Perhaps some distinctively Dorian archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> turn up or has turned up giving precise insight as to how and when Peloponnesian society changed so radically.|$|E

50|$|Next Binnie {{considered}} what prejudicial effects {{should be}} considered. He divided it into moral prejudice and reasoning prejudice. The moral prejudice includes <b>evidence</b> that <b>will</b> cause {{the jury to}} think that the accused is a bad person. This is particularly where the past events were acts that were more reprehensible than the current facts. The reasoning prejudice includes evidence that present a risk of distraction, confusion, and <b>evidence</b> that <b>will</b> consume too much time.|$|R

25|$|The {{proceeding}} in the inquisitorial {{system is}} essentially by writing. Most {{of the witnesses}} would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but {{he or she will}} be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together {{with the president of the}} trial bench, following their common deliberation.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} at the Golden Gate Mining and Town Complex {{have potential}} to answer important research {{questions about the}} community's establishment, development, interaction, trade and decline. The archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> provide information on the spatial organisation and pattern of the site, and of the interrelationships between mining, residential and commercial activities. The use of a cultural landscape approach to the archaeological investigation of Golden Gate will enable {{the examination of the}} network of satellite communities and their association with Croydon as the social and administrative centre. Physical and social connections can be investigated archaeologically through an examination of roadways, railways, domestic material culture and industrial technology. An understanding of the collective experiences of such communities may be gained through further research into the site, particularly given the level of intra-site complexity.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its opening}} {{statement}} on September 19, 2016, the prosecution {{said that at}} the World Trade Center site {{on the third day}} of the closure, [...] "the <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> show that [...] bragged [...] about {{the fact that there were}} traffic problems in Fort Lee, and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned," [...] and that Wildstein would testify and [...] "admit that he was the one who came up with that idea." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} establish {{a clear picture of}} current throughcare and aftercare (TCAC) provision across Scotland’s local authorities and to provide <b>evidence</b> that <b>will</b> inform ongoing debates about future directions and priorities for the TCAC sector. Above all, the research seeks to provide an <b>evidence</b> base which <b>will</b> help ensure that all care leavers receive the support they need to make a successful and positive transition into adult life...|$|R
2500|$|... "This was no {{accident}} that this child was killed," [...] assistant state attorney Pam Bondi told jurors. [...] "The <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> show that by what these eight defendants did and by what they failed to do, that boy lost his life." [...] Bondi said Anderson died of oxygen deprivation after guards manhandled him and used excessive amounts of ammonia capsules when he became unresponsive while the nurse stood by and watched. [...] Defense attorneys said in opening statements that they would show Anderson's death {{could not have been}} prevented and was caused solely by sickle cell trait.|$|E
2500|$|Generally police {{officers}} must have statutory {{authorisation to enter}} on to private property. Police entry on to property outside of statutory powers may be lawful and reasonable where an implied license exists. An implied license permits an officer to “go {{to the door of}} private premises in order to make inquiry of an occupier for any reasonable purpose”. This is significant as a police officer may find evidence of an offence while on the property under the implied license. Finding this <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> not be an unlawful search as a result of trespass as the officer is lawfully on the property, this was the scenario in Tararo v R (2010) ...|$|E
2500|$|Accountability is {{preserved}} {{by a number}} of procedural and substantive requirements that must be satisfied before a court may accept an assertion of the state secrets privilege. The Supreme Court in Reynolds held that such information should be protected from disclosure when there is a [...] "danger that compulsion of the <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged." [...] The Court noted that the privilege was absolute, even if the need in the plaintiff was compelling. The Fifth Circuit has noted, [...] "the greater public good - ultimately the less harsh remedy" [...] is to protect the information from disclosure, even where the result might be dismissal of the lawsuit.|$|E

2500|$|During Libby's trial, Judge Reggie Walton {{told the}} jury: [...] "No <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> be {{presented}} to you with regard to Valerie Plame Wilson's status. That is because what her actual status was, or whether any damage would result from disclosure of her status, are totally irrelevant to your decision of guilt or innocence. You must not consider these matters in your deliberations or speculate or guess about them." [...] During court proceedings, when the jury was not present, Walton told the court: [...] "I don't know, based on {{what has been presented}} to me in this case, what her status was.... It's totally irrelevant to this case.... I to this day don't know what her actual status was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In such cases, {{there are}} strong policy {{considerations}} supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair {{if a person is}} kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts {{to be sure that the}} disclosure of the <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, [...] "if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be able to see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust".|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Josef Joffe, a {{research}} fellow at the Hoover Institution, reviewed Sowell's Race and Culture: A World View for Commentary magazine, saying [...] "Thomas Sowell's work is a relentless, 331-page attack against the wisdom of the day, which comes under the frazzled labels of 'multiculturalism,' 'PC,' and 'affirmative action'; but the argument takes place on a breathtaking intellectual level that ought to command the respect even of those who violently disagree with him." [...] In reviewing the same book for the American Political Science Review, [...] political scientist Richard Coughlin was more critical, saying that [...] "In general, Sowell's attempt to build a case for the independent role played by culture works better in some areas than in others. The effort to expand the examination of race/ethnicity beyond one national setting is laudable, and the coverage of a literature drawn from several disciplines is impressive. But the absence of a coherent (much less, rigorous) comparative methodology renders the analysis less compelling than it might otherwise be. Sowell's approach is to adduce various examples drawn from one or more nations, cultures, or time periods in support of his argument. This approach is the weakest of the comparative methodologies, since it does not lend itself to negative findings. Nowhere does Sowell acknowledge the extensive comparative methods literature in [...] "so-called 'social science'," [...] nor does he provide a rationale for his selection of specific cases (i.e., a sampling design, however rudimentary). This ad hoc treatment of empirical <b>evidence</b> <b>will</b> not trouble those predisposed to agree with Sowell's blend of social conservative and laissez-faire economics ideology. But the book's lack of methodological rigor will, I suspect, make it easy for readers holding opposing viewpoints to discount Sowell's conclusions." ...|$|E

40|$|AGEing, intrabaraminic diversification, transposable elements, genome, genomic {{modularity}} The AGEing model {{proposes that}} intrabaraminic diversification occurred {{because of the}} action of transposable and repetitive elements, called Altruistic Genetic Elements (AGEs). Since the model was proposed in 1999, much new evidence has come to light, some of which supports the model and some of which calls for a significant revision of the model. Evidence of AGE/gene association, AGE horizontal transfer, and AGE-induced genetic changes all support the original AGEing model. Evidence of extensive genomic rearrangement, bacterial plasmids, and AGE transposition control requires substantial modification of the AGEing model. A new model of diversification based on these <b>evidences</b> <b>will</b> be introduced and explained...|$|R
