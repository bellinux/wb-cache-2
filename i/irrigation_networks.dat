25|$|The {{defeated}} rulers were {{obliged to}} make annual pilgrimages to Tunipalangga's court in Gowa to deliver tribute and renew the ritual demonstration of submission and loyalty, while marriage to local subjugated dynasties legitimized the authority of Gowa. By 1565 only the most powerful Bugis kingdom, Boné, remained independent of Gowa's sphere of influence in South Sulawesi. Tunipalangga not only forced the submission of most of his neighbors, but also enslaved and relocated entire populations to build <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> and fortifications.|$|E
25|$|Cotton {{requires}} particularly intense irrigation. In Tajikistan's cotton-growing regions, farms {{were established}} in large, semiarid tracts and in tracts reclaimed from the desert, but cotton's growing season is summer, when the region receives virtually no rainfall. The 50 percent increase in cotton cultivation mandated by Soviet and post-Soviet agricultural planners between 1964 and 1994 consequently overtaxed the regional water supply. Poorly designed <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> led to massive runoff, which increased soil salinity and carried toxic agricultural chemicals downstream to other fields, the Aral Sea, and populated areas of the region.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{responsibilities}} of a Mamluk provincial or district governor were repopulating depopulated areas to foster agricultural production, protecting the lands from Bedouin raids, increasing productivity in barren lands (likely through the upkeep and expansion of existing <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks),</b> and devoting {{special attention to the}} cultivation of the more arable low-lying regions. In order to ensure that rural life was undisturbed by Bedouin raiding, which could halt agricultural work or damage crops and agrarian infrastructure and thus decrease revenues, the Mamluks attempted to prevent Bedouin armament and confiscate existing weapons from them.|$|E
25|$|The Mongol {{conquest of}} Central Asia, {{which took place}} from 1219 to 1225, led to a {{wholesale}} change in the population of Mawarannahr. The conquest quickened the process of Turkification {{in some parts of}} the region because, although the armies of Genghis Khan were led by Mongols, they were made up mostly of Turkic tribes that had been incorporated into the Mongol armies as the tribes were encountered in the Mongols' southward sweep. As these armies settled in Mawarannahr, they intermixed with the local populations which did not flee. Another effect of the Mongol conquest was the large-scale damage the soldiers inflicted on cities such as Bukhoro and on regions such as Khorazm. As the leading province of a wealthy state, Khorazm was treated especially severely. The <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> in the region suffered extensive damage that was not repaired for several generations. Many Iranian-speaking populations were forced to flee southwards in order to avoid persecution.|$|E
25|$|In Egypt, Mamluk {{centralization}} over {{agricultural production}} was more thorough than in Syria and Palestine {{for a number}} of reasons. Among them was that virtually all agriculture in Egypt depended on an irrigation single source, the Nile, and the measures and rights to irrigation were determined by the river's flooding, whereas in Syria and Palestine, there were multiple sources of mostly rain-fed irrigation, and measures and rights were thus determined at the local level. Centralization over Syria and Palestine was also more complicated than in Egypt due to the diversity of those regions' geography and the frequent invasions of the Syro-Palestinian territories. The state's role in Syro-Palestinian agriculture was restricted to the fiscal administration and to the <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks</b> and other aspects of rural infrastructure. Although the level of centralization not as high as in Egypt, the Mamluks did impose enough control over the Syrian economy to derive revenues from Syria that benefited the sultanate and contributed to the defense of its realm. Furthermore, the maintenance of the Mamluk army in Syria relied on the state's control over Syrian agricultural revenues.|$|E

The construction of the Kala wewa, covering an area of [...] with an embankment [...] long and [...] high, was done during Dhatusena's reign. A [...] canal named the Jayaganga carries water from the Kala wewa to the Tissa Wewa and feeds a network of smaller canals. The construction of this network is also attributed to Dhatusena. The Jayaganga supplied water to 180 square kilometres of paddy fields. By {{the end of the}} 5th century, two major <b>irrigation</b> <b>networks,</b> one supported by the Mahaweli river and the other by Malvatu Oya and Kala Oya, were covering the Rajarata area. The Mahavamsa records that many other rulers constructed a number of irrigation tanks, some of which have not yet been identified. By the 8th century, large tanks such as Padaviya, Naccaduva, Kantale and Giritale had come into existence, further expanding the irrigation network.
