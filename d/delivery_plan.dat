500|$|Scotland {{also has}} {{significant}} quantities of fossil fuel deposits, including 62.4% of the EU's proven reserves of oil, 12.5% of the EU's proven reserves {{of gas and}} 69% of UK coal reserves. Nonetheless, the Scottish Government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy production. In 2005 the aim was for 18% of Scotland's electricity production to be generated by renewable sources by 2010, rising to 40% by 2020. In 2007 this was increased to 50 per cent of electricity from renewables by 2020, with an interim target of 31 per cent by 2011. The following year new targets to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 were announced and then confirmed in the 2009 Climate Change <b>Delivery</b> <b>Plan.</b> Maf Smith, director of the Sustainable Development Commission in Scotland said [...] "Governments across the world are shying away from taking the necessary action. The Scottish Government must be commended for its intention to lead the way".|$|E

Cluster analysis, computer simulation and metaheuristic optimisation {{are applied to}} improve planning decisions at tactical and operational levels. An integrated approach to product <b>delivery</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling built on integration of these technologies is described. A cluster analysis of product demand data of stores is used to identify typical dynamic demand patterns and associated product <b>delivery</b> tactical <b>plans.</b> Customer regional clusters are built through multi-objective optimisation. Metaheuristic optimisation techniques are applied to define optimal parameters of product transportation and delivery schedules. Here, vehicle scheduling is performed for the routed solution. Integrated solutions are illustrated and adjusted to a specific business case...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAfter {{having been}} planned, {{developed}} and implemented, Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS 2) enter the operation {{phase of the}} IPS 2 lifecycle. During the operation phase, the IPS 2 provider is facing the challenge to effectively and efficiently schedule IPS 2 delivery processes and assign available resources from the IPS 2 network. IPS 2 <b>delivery</b> <b>planning</b> is an optimization problem of great complexity which is subject to various constraints within a large solution space. Computational support is needed to systematically exploit IPS 2 -specific planning flexibility options and find close-to-optimum planning solutions. For this purpose, an IPS 2 planning method has been development and prototypically implemented in an IPS 2 Execution System. In this paper, a first evaluation of the implemented planning method in an industrial setting is presented. The {{results indicate that the}} planning method for IPS 2 <b>delivery</b> <b>planning</b> generally satisfies the requirements of the industrial evaluation partner. Possibilities for further development as well as limitations of the IPS 2 <b>delivery</b> <b>planning</b> approach are presented...|$|R

40|$|Product <b>delivery</b> <b>planning</b> and {{scheduling}} {{is a task}} of high priority in transport logistics. In distribution centres this task is related to deliveries of various types of goods in predefined time windows. In real-life applications the problem has different stochastic performance criteria and conditions. Optimisation of schedules itself is time consuming and requires an expert knowledge. In this paper an integrated approach to product <b>delivery</b> <b>planning</b> {{and scheduling}} is proposed. It {{is based on a}} cluster analysis of demand data of stores to identify typical dynamic demand patterns and product <b>delivery</b> tactical <b>plans,</b> and simulation optimisation to find optimal parameters of transportation or vehicle schedules. Here, a cluster analysis of the demand data by using the K-means clustering algorithm and silhouette plots mean values is performed, and an NBTree-based classification model is built. In order to find an optimal grouping of stores into regions based on their geographical locations and the total demand uniformly distributed over regions, a multiobjective optimisation problem is formulated and solved with the NSGA II algorithm...|$|R
