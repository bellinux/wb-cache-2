40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} {{possible}} relationship among {{the awareness of}} one' s own speech disorder and {{some aspects of the}} phonological system, as the number and the type of changed <b>distinctive</b> <b>features,</b> as well as the interaction among the severity of the disorder and the non-specification of <b>distinctive</b> <b>features.</b> METHODS: The analyzed group has 23 children with diagnosis of speech disorder, aged 5 : 0 to 7 : 7. The speech data were analyzed through the <b>Distinctive</b> <b>Features</b> Analysis and classified by the Percentage of Correct Consonants. One also applied the Awareness of one' s own speech disorder test. The children were separated in two groups: with awareness of their own speech disorder established (more than 50 % of correct identification) and without awareness of their own speech disorder established (less than 50 % of correct identification). Finally, the variables of this research were submitted to analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: The type of changed <b>distinctive</b> <b>features</b> weren' t different between the groups, as well as the total of changed features and the severity disorder. However, a correlation between the severity disorder and the non-specification of <b>distinctive</b> <b>features</b> was verified, because the more severe disorders have more changes in these linguistic variables. CONCLUSION: The awareness of one' s own speech disorder doesn' t seem to be directly influenced by the type and by the number of changed <b>distinctive</b> <b>features,</b> neither by the speech disorder severity. Moreover, one verifies that the greater phonological disorder severity, the greater the number of changed <b>distinctive</b> <b>features...</b>|$|R

5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{military}} structures that {{were built in the}} late 19th century in Šiaurės miestelis have been preserved and restored. Meanwhile, much of the construction that was not deemed to be of permanent value, erected during the Soviet times, has been demolished, leaving room for new streets and housing. The combination of military heritage sites and newer construction is a <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> of Šiaurės miestelis.|$|E

5|$|The most <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, {{which is}} present in young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and {{projects}} upward and backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest {{is often described as}} solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that may have had a respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazis came to power, {{the design}} was given priority. Despite initial {{competition}} from the Henschel Hs 123, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM, the German aviation ministry) turned to the designs of Herman Pohlmann of Junkers and co-designer of the K 47, Karl Plauth. During the trials with the K 47 in 1932, the double vertical stabilizers were introduced to give the rear gunner a better field of fire. The main, and {{what was to be}} the most <b>distinctive,</b> <b>feature</b> of the Ju 87 was its double-spar inverted gull wings.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Army {{officers}} {{indicated their}} military affiliation with different colored facing on their coats or jackets. The colors were red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, light blue for infantry, and black for medical. A very <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> of the Confederate officers uniforms was the gold braid Austrian knots on their sleeves. More elaborate braiding indicated higher rank and some knots almost reached the shoulder. However, a general order, issued in 1862, {{called for the}} Austrian knots not to be worn in the field, as this made officers conspicuous to enemy combatants.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> of Deinonychus, the shape and {{curvature}} of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E
5|$|The Tour of Oman is {{the third}} of a trio of stage races in the Middle East that come early in the road cycling season, {{following}} the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Qatar, in 2015 won by Mark Cavendish and Niki Terpstra respectively. The <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> of the Tour of Oman is the annual inclusion of the climb of Jebel Akhdar, the Green Mountain, which means the general classification is generally won by climbers. Many Grand Tour contenders start their seasons racing in Oman for this reason.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Shetland {{is complex}} with {{numerous}} faults and folds. These islands are Scotland's most northerly area of Caledonian orogenic rocks {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalradian and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. Similarly, there are also Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> is the ultrabasic ophiolite peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of Shetland's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas.|$|E

There are also small Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions.

5|$|During the Californication world tour, Frusciante {{continued}} to compose his own songs, {{many of which}} would be released in 2001 on his third solo album To Record Only Water for Ten Days. The album was stylistically unlike his previous records, less markedly stream-of-consciousness or avant-garde. However, the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down. The songwriting and production of To Record Only Water for Ten Days were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings. The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Chili Peppers on Californication, focusing more on electronic and new wave elements. In addition to his guitar work, Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers, a <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> of the record.|$|E

The cave temples are linked by a stepped path with intermediate terraces overlooking the town and lake. The cave temples are labelled 1–4 in their ascending series; this numbering does not reflect the sequence of excavation.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore {{painting}} {{style is}} {{an offshoot of}} the Vijayanagar school of painting, and King Raja Wodeyar (1578–1617 CE) is credited with having been its patron. The <b>distinctive</b> <b>feature</b> of these paintings is the gesso work, to which gold foil is applied. Mysore is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to be involved in this art in 2002. The city lends its name to the Mysore silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread). Mysore Peta, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the erstwhile rulers of Mysore, is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies. A notable local dessert that traces its history to the kitchen in the Mysore palace is Mysore pak.|$|E
