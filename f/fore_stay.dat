6000|$|His {{fleet of}} nearly two hundred fishing-smacks lay bobbing about one fine autumn evening on the North Sea. The vessels cruised round each other, out and in, hither and thither, in all positions, now on this tack, now on that, bowsprits {{pointing}} north, south, east, and west, as if without purpose, or {{engaged in a}} nautical game of [...] "touch." [...] Nevertheless all eyes were bent earnestly on the admiral's vessel, for it was literally the [...] "flagship," [...] being distinguishable only by a small flag attached to its <b>fore</b> <b>stay.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The major {{advantage}} a masthead sloop {{has over}} a fractional one, {{is that the}} jib is larger. Since the jib has no mast {{in front of it}} to cause turbulent airflow over it, it is considered much more efficient than the main, especially for sailing up wind. Also, since the <b>fore</b> <b>stay</b> is attached {{to the top of the}} mast, it pulls directly against the back stay. Tightening the back stay, then, increases the tension on the <b>fore</b> <b>stay.</b> This is useful because the jib needs considerable <b>fore</b> <b>stay</b> tension to set well. This need increases in direct proportion to the wind speed and jib size. Increasing the tension on the back stay does not tend to bend the mast, as it would on a fractional sloop. It puts the mast in compression instead. For this reason the mast on a mast head rig has a thicker section at the top to stand this load.|$|E
5000|$|But now St. Elmo's fire appeared, {{which they}} had so longed for, it settled at the bows of a <b>fore</b> <b>stay,</b> the masts and yards all being gone, and gave them hope of calmer airs. Ludovico Ariosto, 1516 ...|$|E

5000|$|Until 1926, when Fauvism, Cubism and Abstract styles {{came to the}} <b>fore,</b> Gard <b>stayed</b> {{away from}} theory and, it seems, {{followed}} Corot's lessons when he installed his easel on street corners in Morigny or Étampes and practiced with a palette of soft and refined tones.|$|R

50|$|Since jibs need {{considerable}} <b>fore</b> <b>stay</b> tension to set {{properly and}} the amount of tension needed increases with wind speed, being able to drop the jib first in windy conditions puts less strain on the rig and hull. Fractional rigs are used on lightly built multi-hulls for this reason.|$|E
50|$|A major {{advantage}} of the fractional rig, especially the '3/4' rig (where the <b>fore</b> <b>stay</b> goes 3/4 {{the way up the}} mast), is that the jib can be taken in without the boat rounding up into the wind like a weather vane. With the masthead sloop, both the main and the jib must be reefed, when shortening sail, to keep this from happening.|$|E
50|$|Coromandel {{measured}} 133 ft x 33 ft x 23 ft. She was a 3 masted square rigged {{ship with}} 13 foresails, 3 top sails, 3 <b>fore</b> topmast <b>stay</b> sails, 2 main sails, 3 main top sails and well found. She had one long boat and two quarter boats. The ship {{was made from}} oak, black birch, and red pine. She was sheathed in yellow metal.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stay</b> of the <b>fore</b> {{topgallant}} mast {{is attached to}} the jib-boom at the extremity of its point. The stay for the jib sail {{is attached to the}} shouldering at its heel. Just as the bowsprit has bobstays, in order to counteract the upward force from the jib and <b>fore</b> topgallant <b>stays</b> a martingale hangs down from the point of the jib-boom to a dolphin striker, pulling downwards on the jib-boom.|$|R
50|$|Thus we had her sparred, {{all but a}} {{bowsprit}} and jibboom; {{yet this}} we managed by making a stumpy, spike bowsprit {{from one of the}} smaller spars which they had used to shore up the superstructure, and because we feared that it lacked strength to bear the strain of our <b>fore</b> and aft <b>stays,</b> we took down two hawsers from the fore, passing them in through the hawse-holes and setting them up there.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{keep our}} eyes and ears open, and try to learn--that's the only way. I know every rope on a merchantman, kin name 'em from <b>fore</b> royal <b>stay</b> to topping lift, but that ain't the {{hundredth}} part on it. We've got to learn our vessel jest as a person has got {{to learn a new}} city and its streets, fer boats ain't built one like another, not by a jugful! And after we have learned the ship, we've got to learn the guns, and the fire-drill, and how to clear ship for action, and a lot more, not to say a word about learning how to knock out them Dons, as some calls 'em. Oh, we'll have our hands full after we get on board, don't forget it!" [...] And Si Doring shook his head vigorously.|$|R
5000|$|We pulled {{as fast as}} {{we could}} on board; and then {{despatched}} the boat for the man who was left in the water, whom we succeeded to save alive.We soon had our guns ready; but the Spanish ship had dropped so far astern of the Perseverance, that we could bring but one gun to bear on her, which was the after one. This was fired six times, without any other effect than cutting away the <b>fore</b> top-mast <b>stay,</b> and some other small ropes which were no hindrance to her going away. She was soon out of reach of our shot, steering out of the bay. We then had some other calculations to make. —Amasa Delano, A Narrative of Voyages and Travels, 1817, Chapter 18, 325. [...] The boat was immediately dispatched back to pick up the three swimming sailors. Meantime, the guns were in readiness, though, owing to the San Dominick having glided somewhat astern of the sealer, only the aftermost could be brought to bear. With this, they fired six times; thinking to cripple the fugitive ship by bringing down her spars. But only a few inconsiderable ropes were shot away. Soon the ship was beyond the gun's range, steering broad out of the bay; the blacks thickly clustering round the bowsprit, one moment with taunting cries towards the whites, the next with upthrown gestures hailing the now dusky moors of ocean--cawing crows escaped from the hand of the fowler. — Melville's [...] "Benito Cereno".|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{suggestion}} that the rig was sometimes used in a lateen style with the top cross spar dipped {{at an angle to}} aid sailing to windward i.e. the spar became the luff. There is little or no evidence to support this theory. No explanation is offered as to how this could be accomplished with a square sail as the lower reefed portion of the sail would be very bulky and would prevent even an approximation of the laminar flow necessary for windward sailing. There is no evidence of any triangular sails in use. Masts were held erect by side <b>stays</b> and possibly <b>fore</b> and aft <b>stays.</b> Each side stay was fitted at it lower end with a 150 mm toggle. There were no chain plates. The lower part of the side stay consisted of ropes looped under the end of a knee of upper futtock which had a hole underneath. The lower part of the stay was about 500 - 800 mm long and attached to a combined flat wooden turnblock and multi V jamb cleat called an angel (maiden, virgin). About 4 turns of rope went between the angel and the toggle to give the mechanical advantage to tighten the side stays. At each turn the v shape {{at the bottom of the}} angels [...] "wings" [...] jambed the stay preventing slippage and movement.|$|R
