5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E
5|$|While the 1st, 2nd and 4th Ranger Company each {{embarked}} for Korea {{shortly after}} their training was complete, the 3rd Ranger Company was retained at Fort Benning, {{to train the}} next cycle of Rangers along with the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Ranger Company. After providing fillers to 1st and 4th companies to cover their training losses, the 3rd had 40 men left. In mid-December, they took an additional 80 men from 7th Company and completed a second cycle of Ranger training. This proved beneficial to the 3rd Company, as it was given cold-weather training alongside the 5th and 8th companies at Fort Carson, Colorado. After the first training cycle was complete; the Ranger units already in Korea had not received this training and were thus unprepared for the Korean winter. The 3rd Company also received additional training which better prepared it for combat, including tactics of the People's Volunteer Army, which the other companies <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> battle and tracer designation of targets during night attacks. They also received 57mm M18 Recoilless Rifles, however, these were kept on the cargo truck due to the necessity {{to break up a}} rifle team to man a crew-served weapon, which didn't happen. The entire company was trained to be their own forward observers for artillery. In March 1951, the 3rd, 5th, and 8th Companies sailed for Korea, a trip which was fraught with frequent discipline problems as the Rangers continuously got into fights with U.S. Marines on board the troopship while en route. After spending one night in Kobe, Japan, the next morning they sailed for Pusan, South Korea.|$|E

25|$|Around 1900, {{there were}} growing demands {{to save the}} {{heathland}} and bogs of northwest Germany, which were threatened by reforestation and drainage. On Lüneburg Heath, Wilhelm Bode, then the pastor at Egestorf, was particularly active in pressing {{for the preservation of}} the endangered countryside. He <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> 1905 of plans for building weekend houses on the Totengrund. In order to prevent this, he persuaded Andreas Thomsen, a professor from Münster, to acquire the area as a nature reserve. In 1909, Pastor Bode and district administrator (Landrat) Fritz Ecker prevented the planned reforestation of the Wilseder Berg.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{education}} and training initiatives have been proposed or carried out by Vietnam Railways. Public awareness campaigns in the media {{have been carried out}} to educate the public about railway safety. The training and professional development of train operators has also been suggested as a major area of focus. One train driver interviewed in 2009 reported that he had worked as a driver for Vietnam Railways for over 10 years without receiving any training or professional development to improve his skills, which he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> Russia. Checks on drivers have also been suggested, along with random blood testing to detect whether drivers have used alcohol.|$|E
25|$|While the Social Credit {{party was}} founded {{to promote the}} social credit {{theories}} of monetary reform, these could not be implemented at the provincial level, as the Alberta Social Credit Party <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s. Bennett quickly converted the provincial party into a populist conservative party, {{and it became a}} vehicle for those who sought to keep the CCF out of power. However, as leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada's second most powerful provincial branch, he spoke for the party in federal election campaigns. During the 1957 election, he spoke for the party at a rally in Regina, Saskatchewan. In the 1965 election, Bennett and his cabinet ministers toured BC to encourage voters to elect Social Credit MPs to promote BC's interests.|$|E
25|$|Through 1960 and 1961, Reeves made {{ends meet}} working several jobs by day {{and worked as a}} singer in {{nighttime}} hours singing jazz and blues standards at some of Detroit's respected nightclubs. Singing at the 20 Grand, Reeves was spotted by Motown A director Mickey Stevenson, who recognized her talent, gave her his business card and invited her to audition. Reeves, who used the stage name Martha Lavaille showed up at Motown's Hitsville USA studios the next morning, not knowing that she was to call to schedule an audition. Stevenson asked her to answer phones while he took care of other business. Using the skills she <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> commercial courses in high school, Reeves answered phones, took notes, administrated payroll for Motown's famed Funk Brothers, and made herself invaluable.|$|E

25|$|Gray's {{defenders}} {{would later}} argue that Gray simply practiced a management style {{that was different}} from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director, and some felt Gray's visits did much to raise the morale of the agents working in those field offices. Furthermore, Gray's leadership style seemed to mirror what he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction and showed a lack of leadership. He was sure he {{was not the only one}} of the FBI leaders who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.|$|E
25|$|Sage did fewer new {{paintings}} after Tanguy died, {{partly because}} of her depression and {{partly because of}} her decreasing eyesight due to cataracts. Instead, she devoted her time to two projects: preserving Tanguy’s reputation through retrospective shows and a complete catalogue of his work, and writing poetry, mostly in the slangy French she <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> her youth and spoken with Tanguy. With the help of longtime friend Marcel Duhamel—and her own subsidies to cover most of the printing costs—Sage arranged for a book of this poetry, Demain, Monsieur Silber, to be published in France in June 1957. Around 1955 she also wrote a partial autobiography, China Eggs, which covered her life up to about the time she left San Faustino, but she never tried to publish it.|$|E
25|$|Upon one of {{his base}} wine {{acquisition}} trips to Budafok, Hungary, Törley realized that the conditions there were perfect {{for the production of}} sparkling wine. Törley determined that the soils of Budafok, more closely than anywhere else in Europe, resembled the chalky limestone soil extant in the Champagne region of France which was necessary for producing the characteristics in the base wine of champagne. In 1882, Törley moved his factory from Reims to Budafok and proceeded to replicate every aspect of the champagne production he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> France, including the methods used to grow grapes at his vineyards in Etyek, Hungary. Törley also had 45 miles worth of cellars carved out of Budafok’s limestone hills to ensure the uniform temperature required for maintaining the quality of the wine throughout production. Törley’s quarried limestone went into the construction of Hungary’s Parliament which, upon completion in 1904, was the largest building on earth.|$|E

500|$|Ultimately, of the 500 men {{attached}} to the force, only around 10 were able to speak English fluently, while 30–40 could speak it well enough, 120–150 fairly well and the rest only what they <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> grade school. [...] With only two working M4 Sherman tanks available, 13 Panther tanks were doctored to resemble American tanks and {{attached to}} the unit; Skorzeny was also given 10 Allied scout cars, with six of them breaking down during the training period. The unit was also low on American small-arms and ammunition, not to mention American uniforms; nevertheless, the unit continued training.|$|E
500|$|Both the United States and Japan {{accelerated}} {{the training of}} aircrew, but the United States had a more effective pilot rotation system, which meant that more veterans survived {{and went on to}} training or command billets, where they were able to pass on lessons they <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> training rather than in combat, where errors {{were more likely to be}} fatal. [...] By the time of the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, the Japanese had nearly rebuilt their carrier forces in terms of numbers, but their planes, many of which were obsolescent, were largely flown by inexperienced and poorly trained pilots.|$|E

Jacques Planché was a moderately prosperous watchmaker, a trade he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> Geneva, and was personally known to King George III.

500|$|Another leading countercultural figure, the beatnik poet Allen Ginsberg, was a {{supporter}} of Prabhupada. He had met the swami earlier in New York and assisted him in extending his United States visa. Despite disagreeing with many of Prabhupada's required prohibitions, especially the ones pertaining to drugs and promiscuity, Ginsberg often publicly sang the Hare Krishna mantra, which he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> India. He made the mantra part of his philosophy and declared that it [...] "brings a state of ecstasy." [...] He was glad that Prabhupada, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other countercultural ideologues like Timothy Leary, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Prabhupada and the chanting of Hare Krishna into the hippie movement.|$|E

Olds states that following the shoot down of his fourth MiG, he intentionally avoided shooting down a fifth, {{even though he had}} at least ten opportunities to do so, because he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> the middle of June that Seventh Air Force, at the direction of Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown, would immediately relieve him of command to return to the United States as a publicity asset.|$|E
