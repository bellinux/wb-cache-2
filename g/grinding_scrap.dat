40|$|About 10, 000 t of {{grinding}} scraps {{are produced}} {{in and around}} Turin each year. Grinding scraps result fromhigh speed tool cutting processes in the automobile and aerospace industries in which a fluid, called lubrorefrigerant oil, is used to cool the cutting tool. At present, grinding scraps are landfilled with an involved cost of 60 D /t, because the oil content (equal to 6. 40 % byweight, b. w.) does not permit recovery in secondary smelt furnaces. Secondary smelt foundries in fact only accept turnings, borings, scraps and oily machinery waste with an oil content no higher than 1 % b. w. The lubrorefrigerant fluid and heavy metal content of some <b>grinding</b> <b>scrap</b> samples have been determined. The characterized waste was then subjected to several laboratory tests in order to single out the most convenient operating conditions; these resulted to be: solid-liquid ratio 1 : 20 b. w., one washing phase, surfactant amount equal to 0. 15 % b. w. (of the washing water amount), solid-rinsing water ratio 1 : 20 b. w., employment of docusate sodium salt. The obtained results allowed a wet treatment to be arranged aimed at removing the cooling/cutting fluid from the waste and at a subsequent recovery or recycling the steel. The wet treatment involves a washing phase in a stirred reactor {{in the presence of}} docusate sodium salt, a filtration in a plate and frame filter for the solid separation and a final rinse in order to eliminate the residual surfactant amount. The treated material is finally pressed to minimize the residual moisture content. The oil is separated from the exhausted washing water using a cloth filter. The oily sludge is eventually landfilled. A cost analysis, carried out on the proposed reclamation plant, highlighted the economic advantage of the treatment (total annual plant operating costs are equal to about 40 D /t of treated <b>grinding</b> <b>scrap)</b> in comparison to the landfilling operation...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a hyper-viscoelastic model {{based on the}} Hencky-logarithmic strain tensor to model the response of a Tire Derived Material (TDM) undergoing moderately large deformations. TDM is a composite made by cold forging a mix of rubber fibers and grains, obtained by <b>grinding</b> <b>scrap</b> tires, and polyurethane binder. The mechanical properties are highly influenced {{by the presence of}} voids associated with the granular composition and low tensile strength due to the weak connection at the grain-matrix interface. For these reasons, TDM use is restricted to applications concerning a limited range of deformations. Experimental tests show that a central feature of the response is connected to highly nonlinear behavior of the material under volumetric deformation which conventional hyperelastic models fail in predicting. The strain energy function presented here is a variant of the exponentiated Hencky strain energy proposed by Neff et al., which for moderate strains is as good as the quadratic Hencky model and in the large strain region improves several important features from a mathematical point of view. The proposed form of the exponentiated Hencky energy possesses a set of parameters uniquely determined in the infinitesimal strain regime and an orthogonal set of parameters to determine the nonlinear response. The hyperelastic model is additionally incorporated in a finite deformation viscoelasticity framework that accounts for the two main dissipation mechanisms in TDMs, one at the microscale level and one at the macroscale level. The model is capable of predicting different deformation modes in a certain range of frequency and amplitude with a unique set of parameters with most of them having a clear physical meaning. Moreover, by comparing the predictions from the proposed constitutive model with experimental data we conclude that the new constitutive model gives accurate prediction...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{laboratory}} and field {{research has demonstrated}} that virgin synthetic and cellulose fibers provide important attributes for hot mix asphalt (HMA) : reduced asphalt (mastic) draindown during construction for certain types of mixtures, reinforcement which significantly reduces cracking; and, in some cases, reduced rutting. By-product fibers from <b>grinding</b> of <b>scrap</b> tires offer an excellent, low-cost alternative to virgin and cellulose fibers. Currently, most of these fibers are being disposed of in landfills or incinerated. Two types of recycled tire fibers were evaluated to determine whether they can be used in different types of HMA mixtures as a replacement of currently used cellulose fibers or mineral fiber. The researchers tested three different types of mixtures: stone mastic asphalt (SMA), permeable friction course (PFC), and coarse mix high binder (CMHB) mixtures with two different types of recycled tire fibers, one cellulose fiber, and no fiber. HMA specimens were prepared using all of these combinations and tested using several common laboratory test procedures. The laboratory tests used to evaluate the mixtures were: draindown test, dynamic modulus test, overlay test, indirect tensile strength test, and Hamburg wheel tracking test...|$|R
40|$|A special {{treatment}} of platinum group metals (PGMs) leaching from spent automotive catalyst {{is shown in}} this paper. Leaching of crushing and <b>grinding</b> automotive catalyst <b>scrap</b> in hydrochloric acid with defined concentration, added nitric acid as oxidant, produced chloride solution of the platinum group metals, while catalyst substrate (Al 2 O 3) remained indissoluble. Cementation of the leached platinum group metals from solution was made by powered aluminum with suitable pH values. The precipitate obtained by cementation with Al-powder is mixture of the platinum group metals and surplus aluminum. The surplus aluminum can be removed by selected resolving with hydrochloric acid. The mixture of platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, and Rh) is obtained by this treatment. Separation between platinum group metals was done by well-known chemical processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Since 1990 s, {{the major}} {{recycling}} methods for mechanical recycling of FRP(Fiber Reinforced Plastics) boats has involved shredding and <b>grinding</b> of the <b>scrap</b> FRP {{in a new}} recycled product. But still it leads to secondary problem such as air pollution, unacceptable shredding noise level and few limited appli-cations. This study is to propose a newly advanced method which is more efficient and environment friendly waste FRP regenerating system. As extracting FRP layer and making the recycled fiber for recycled-fiber reinforced concrete(RFRC) from waste FRP, the recycling process has some merits {{in a sense of}} the recycling energy and the environmental effects. In this study, for those tasks, spectro-chemical differentiation method and coloring water-soluble dye treatment makes the roving layer more distinguishable photophysically. Also that has remarkably reduced safety hazards and energy. Using the mechanical properties of polymers and composite, FRP with the orthotropic and laminated plastic structure has been easily separated in the new extracting system. Also the new method has introduced five kind of separating manuals for the some different compositions of FRP boats. The roving fiber of laminated glass-fiber layer is as good as the polyvinyl fiber which is cost-high commercial fiber to increasing strength of concrete products. The early study has shown the effectiveness of laminated glass-fiber layer which also is chemical-resistant due to the resin coating. These results imply that more efficient and environment friendly recycled glass fiber can be better applied t...|$|R
