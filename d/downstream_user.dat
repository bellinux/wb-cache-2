40|$|The European Commission had {{approved}} the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) regulations {{in the year}} 2006, and will begin to implement it form 1 June 2007. This regulation greatly increases safety of protection for the users of chemicals, but it also brought {{a problem for the}} manufactures as well as downstream users. That is they have to generate and distribute much more Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) then before. This work is difficult for most companies since this job usually was done manually. The new regulation requires a much more efficient method to generate and distribute them. This thesis project addresses the problem of automatically distributing MSDS and the corresponding metadata. It presents the underlying technology selected for this project. It gives a brief introduction of this project, the underlying technologies used, along with the methods used to deliver relevant and up to date materials safety information. At last an HTTP web application approach was selected to solve the problem, the resulting application can efficiently notify a <b>downstream</b> <b>user</b> of the newly updated MSDS and transport the corresponding file and metadata.

40|$|The new European {{chemicals}} legislation REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and {{restriction of}} Chemicals) requires {{the development of}} Exposure Scenarios describing the conditions and risk management measures needed for the safe use of chemicals. Such Exposure Scenarios should integrate considerations of both {{human health and the}} environment. Specific aspects are relevant for worker exposure. Gathering information on the uses of the chemical is an important step in developing an Exposure Scenario. In-house information at manufacturers is an important source. Downstream users can contribute information through direct contact or through their associations. Relatively simple approaches (Tier 1 tools, such as the ECETOC Targeted Risk Assessment and the model EASE) can be used to develop broad Exposure Scenarios that cover many use situations. These approaches rely on the categorisation of just a few determinants, including {{only a small number of}} risk management measures. Such approaches have a limited discriminatory power and are rather conservative. When the hazard of the substance or the complexity of the exposure situation require a more in-depth approach, further development of the Exposure Scenarios with Tier 2 approaches is needed. Measured data sets of worker exposure are very valuable in a Tier 2 approach. Some <b>downstream</b> <b>user</b> associations have attempted to build Exposure Scenarios based on measured data sets. Generic Tier 2 tools for developing Exposure Scenarios do not exist yet. To enable efficient development of the worker exposure part of Exposure Scenarios a further development of Tier 1 and Tier 2 tools is needed. Special attention should be given to user friendliness and to the validity (boundaries) of the approaches. The development of standard worker exposure descriptions or full Exposure Scenarios by <b>downstream</b> <b>user</b> branches in cooperation with manufacturers and importers is recommended.

30|$|The {{identification}} of PFOA and APFO as SVHC in the EU might indicate to states {{outside of the}} EU the need to minimize risks, and might also be {{a starting point for}} other regulatory measures on national or international level. Furthermore, this might be a strong signal to manufacturers and <b>downstream</b> <b>users</b> to replace PFOA and APFO. Authorization is the foreseen instrument in the REACH regulation to control the risks of SVHC. Once PFOA and APFO are included in the Candidate List they could be included into Annex XIV of the REACH regulation. Following inclusion into this Annex, manufacturers, importers and <b>downstream</b> <b>users</b> {{would not be allowed to}} use or to place these substances as such on the European market without an authorization of any single use. Risk control, good functioning of the internal market, and the replacement of SVHC by substitutes are aims of the authorization. Assuring the safe use of the substances, manufacturers, importers and <b>downstream</b> <b>users</b> can apply for authorization using the substances on its own, in a mixture or in an article.|$|R
30|$|The new {{requirements}} concerning {{communication in}} the supply chain and <b>downstream</b> <b>user</b> compliance are sources of non-compliance with REACH (see a non-exhaustive summary in column 3 of Additional file 4). As a rule, the attached exposure scenarios are neither available in a harmonised and structured format nor aggregated into predictive descriptions that are representative {{for the majority of}} workplaces at the moment. These problems clearly show the need to create a common format for the exposure scenarios and to clearly define and structure the relevant information that has to be transferred from the CSR to the exposure scenario annexed to the SDS. In addition, even though it is legally acceptable to attach all exposure scenarios (see column 2 of Additional file 4), recipients would benefit more if suppliers provided only those exposure scenarios relevant to the recipient.|$|E

The causes of these events are manifold and like most manifestations of scarcity, water scarcity has important demand and supply side elements. Although {{on the supply side}} drought events have contributed to water shortages in the past few years, it is the nature of water demand that presents perhaps the most important determinant of water scarcity in Beijing. On the one hand, as a <b>downstream</b> <b>user,</b> surface water supplies to Beijing have been reduced by increased demands, largely from agriculture, in upstream areas of the Chao River (Hou, 2001).

40|$|ABSTRACT. We analyze patent {{licensing}} by a patent holder to <b>downstream</b> technology <b>users.</b> We study how {{the structure and}} level of royalties depends on the patentâ€™s strength, i. e., the probability it would be upheld in court. We examine the social value of determining patent validity before licensing, in terms of deadweight loss (ex post) and innovation incentives (ex ante). When <b>downstream</b> <b>users</b> do not compete against each other or the patent holder, license fees approximate the license fee for an ironclad patent times the patent strength, and reviewing validity before licensing would be unproductive (in expected value). But when <b>downstream</b> <b>users</b> compete, two-part tariffs for weak patents have high running royalty rates, combined with a negative fixed fee, and examining patent validity generates social benefits, both ex post and ex ante. Even without negative fixed fees, rival downstream firms will accept relatively high running royalties, so determining patent validity prior to licensing is socially beneficial...|$|R

The CLP regulation provides for two approaches: on one hand, the harmonized classification which applies predominantly on effects of high concern, like carcinogenicity, germ cell mutagenicity, toxicity for reproduction {{as well as on}} substances which are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic, and which leads to partial classifications. The harmonized classifications are the minimum mandatory classifications listed in Annex VI of the CLP regulation. On the other hand, self-classification for all other hazardous properties is effectuated by the manufacturer, importer, or <b>downstream</b> <b>user.</b> Notifiers {{need to make sure that}} their self-classifications are correct: They need to consider all accessible existing information, evaluate their reliability, relevance, and adequacy in an expert judgment with a weight of evidence approach and use the evaluated data for self-classification [9 - 11].|$|E
30|$|For example, {{consider}} the electric car as a focal offer {{in the electric}} car ecosystem. The complementarities between electric cars and the charging infrastructure, {{as well as between}} batteries and electric cars, are rather obvious. However, the structure of interdependence between batteries and electric cars is distinct from the structure of interdependence between electric cars and the charging infrastructure. Batteries and electric cars are directly connected via a component-product upstream interaction whereas charging infrastructure and electric cars are indirectly connected via the <b>downstream</b> <b>user</b> interaction. Moreover, there are important interdependencies between batteries and charging infrastructure as well as between charging infrastructure and the electricity grid that are typically not revealed based on the analysis of complementarities. Improvements in batteries can enhance the contribution of the charging infrastructure towards an electric carâ€™s value creation, and improvements in the charging infrastructure could hold back the contribution if the electricity grid is not optimized for increased usage especially during peak hours.|$|E
