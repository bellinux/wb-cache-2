The press often {{referred}} to her by such names as [...] "The Mexican Spitfire", [...] "The Mexican It girl" [...] and [...] "The Mexican Kitten". Vélez consciously chose to promote her [...] "Whoopee Lupe" [...] persona but dismissed {{the idea that she}} was wild. In an interview she said: [...] "What I attribute my success?, I think, simply, because I'm different. I'm not beautiful, but I have beautiful eyes and know exactly what to do with them. Although the public thinks that I'm a very wild girl. Actually I'm not. I'm just me, Lupe Vélez, simple and natural Lupe. If I'm happy, I dance and sing and acted like a child. And if something irritates me, I cry and sob. Someone called that 'personality.' The Personality is nothing more than behave with others as you really are. If <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> and act like Norma Talmadge, the great dramatic actress, or like Corinne Griffith, the aristocrat of the movies, or like Mary Pickford, the sweet and gentle Mary, I would be nothing more than an imitation. I just want to be myself: Lupe Velez." ...|$|E

40|$|Our {{problem is}} that of {{structure}} and behavior of energy systems. I have been educated as a physicist and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at things with a physicist’s eye.

In the book, {{he argues}} that {{companies}} and individuals should study and perhaps copy Google's methods for succeeding at internet entrepreneurship. Jarvis said of the book, [...] "Just as <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> admiringly from a distance at Google, I include anecdotes and examples from Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Craig Newmark at craigslist and Jeff Bezos at Amazon." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{introduce}} {{little bit different}} perspective incorporated into Process Modeling (PM) than contemporary approaches provide. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at processes through tool used by people for centuries- rules and regulations. From this perspective I challenge contemporary technical approaches by an approach that, from my perspective, better captures the substance of a business process as relations among people and not machines.

5000|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviews. James Shotwell from Under the Gun Review said [...] "Overall, {{the record}} is not bad, and there are certainly some very notable tracks.

When looking for a new band to sink my teeth into <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for unique songs, clever lyrics and solid musicianship.

60|$|The lady {{rested her}} arms upon the table, and again her eyes disdained my words and went {{traveling}} {{by their own}} route direct to my soul.

60|$|The sudden kindness--the warm, high-minded, fearless sympathy which met me on such mercifully equal terms, which appealed {{with such}} {{delicate}} and generous abruptness straight to my heart, my honour, and my courage, overcame {{me in an}} instant. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her when she took my hand, but my eves were dim.

60|$|It takes {{but little}} {{to raise a}} laugh among a set of fox-hunters.
