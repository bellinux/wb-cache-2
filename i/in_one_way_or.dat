5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{returns to}} Scranton, after quietly quitting {{a week ago}} to work {{full-time}} at Athlead, the sports marketing company that Jim founded. When the others spot him, they are upset that he left without saying goodbye and demand {{to spend some time}} with him <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another before he leaves for good. The office ultimately decides on one final dance together.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another.|$|E
5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another.|$|E

25|$|Palahniuk's books {{prior to}} Lullaby have {{distinct}} similarities.

He labels these stories as transgressional fiction. Beginning with Lullaby, the style of his novels changed to mostly satirical horror stories.|$|E
25|$|While the Neolution {{movement}} is most notable {{represented by the}} scientists and businesspersons connected to Projects Leda and Castor, the Neolution ideas and ideals are also shared by many civilians, hoping to improve their lives <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another using its methods and technique, ranging from body modification to medical treatment.|$|E
25|$|Some anthropologists {{believe that}} the {{earliest}} intelligent modern humans practiced a form of prayer. Today, most major religions involve prayer <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practiced spontaneously by anyone at any time.|$|E

25|$|Antislavery {{movements}} in the North gained momentum in the 1830s and 1840s, a period of rapid transformation of Northern society that inspired a social and political reformism. Many of the reformers of the period, including abolitionists, attempted <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another to transform the lifestyle and work habits of labor, helping workers respond to the new demands of an industrializing, capitalistic society.|$|E
25|$|Red's dry, often sarcastic wit is {{balanced}} {{by a strong}} sense of camaraderie with his fellow lodge members, partly because he directs most of his sarcasm toward Harold.

5000|$|The {{qualitative}} {{results of}} the impact test {{can be used to}} determine the ductility of a material. [...] If the material breaks on a flat plane, the fracture was brittle, and if the material breaks with jagged edges or shear lips, then the fracture was ductile. Usually a material does not break <b>in</b> just <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>or</b> the other, and thus comparing the jagged to flat surface areas of the fracture will give an estimate of the percentage of ductile and brittle fracture.|$|R
25|$|During the 13th century, many towers {{were taken}} down or demolished, and others simply collapsed.

The last demolitions {{took place during}} the 20th century, according to an ambitious, but retrospectively unfortunate, restructuring plan for the city.

5000|$|Walworth Barbour {{served as}} Ambassador of the United States to Israel from 1961-1973, {{which is when}} the Embassy re-located to its present {{location}} of 71 Hayarkon Street.
