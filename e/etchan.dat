40|$|As {{has been}} {{described}} in the preceding chapters, the Ge(111) surface can be alkylterminated in a method {{very similar to the}} thoroughly investigated Si(111) surface. However, while the process does produce alkyl-terminated surfaces with electrical properties superior to those of the oxide, the lack of a mild, anisotropic <b>etchan...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of 29 Si-nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance experiments {{on a large}} number of KOH solutions in which silicon has been dissolved. The goal of the experiments is to clarify the chemical composition of concentrated alkaline solutions after etching of silicon. It is confirmed that the initial etching product of wet-chemical etching of silicon in KOH is a silicate monomer. Increasing the silicon content of the solution gives rise to silicate polymerization products. The often reported aging of etching solutions is due to silica in the <b>etchan...</b>|$|E
