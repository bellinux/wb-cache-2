Data for the study was collected using a cross-sectional quantitative survey. A total of 188 useable responses were collected from SMEs in Malaysia. The findings show that <b>entrepreneurial</b> orientation, <b>innovation</b> capability and knowledge creation have a positive impact on firm performance. Furthermore, the impacts of <b>entrepreneurial</b> orientation and <b>innovation</b> capability on knowledge creation are also examined in this study. The findings suggest that innovation capability is positively related to knowledge creation, but entrepreneurial orientation does not have a significant impact on knowledge creation.

It appears that unlike the creative destruction process of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>innovations,</b> in a liberalised/deregulated environment financial innovations move banks from their crucial role of financing long-term economic evolution and lead to reckless finance. Thus, financial market dynamics put economies on a destructive path.

40|$|During {{the past}} few decades, the {{configurations}} of new knowledge-intensive environments have required fertile settings for innovative and entrepreneurial activities. In these environments, Triple Helix has been operationalized in different ways, spaces, and contexts where those agents are transforming their roles {{in the development and}} strengthening of national <b>innovation</b> and <b>entrepreneurial</b> ecosystems. As a consequence, the phenomenon of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>innovations</b> emerged from enterprises with an entrepreneurial or high-growth orientation that collaborate with Triple Helix agents generating economic benefits and spillover effects. In emerging economies, the available literature about innovation and entrepreneurship is limited to explore the determinants of innovation performance as well as innovation constrains. Based on this argument and diverging from prior research, this research tries to provide a better understanding about the influence of Triple Helix agents on entrepreneurial innovations' performance of enterprises located in emerging economies. In particular, we analyze the effects produced by the links of enterprises with other enterprises, universities and government on their innovation performance (e. g., access to knowledge/technology, sources of funding, government subsidies), as well as, the moderation effects generated when those enterprises have a high-growth orientation (e. g., distinction of enterprises that develop <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>innovations</b> or traditional innovations). To achieve this aim we look inside at the case of Mexico because is an emerging economy that during the last two decades has facing a transition to a knowledge-based economy. Using a cross-section dataset of 19, 188 Mexican enterprises interviewed in the period of 2006 to 2012, we tested our proposed conceptual model with a Tobit regression. Our study provides interesting implications for the main actors involved in the Mexican Science, Technology and Innovation System, as well as, contributes about the debate of the impact of enterprises-university-government linkages on <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>innovations</b> from diverse perspectives and research fields (e. g., open innovation, knowledge transfer, high-growth entrepreneurship, academic entrepreneurship, public entrepreneurship) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} a model where <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>innovations</b> {{are sold}} into oligopolistic industries and where adverse selection problems between entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and incumbents are present. We first show that aggressive {{development of a}} basic innovation by better informed venture-backed firms {{is used as a}} signaling device to enhance the sale price of the innovation. We then show that incumbents can undertake early, preemptive, acquisitions to prevent such signaling driven overinvestment, despite the risk of buying a non-productive innovation. Therefore, to exist in equilibrium, venture capitalists must be sufficiently more efficient in selecting innovation projects, otherwise preemptive acquisitions will take place. ...|$|R

This will trigger preemptive acquisitions by incumbents, thus increasing the reward for <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>innovations.</b> We also show that venture capital can emerge in equilibrium if venture capitalists have cost advantages, or if development is associated with double moral hazard problems...|$|R

Moreover, we show that increasing the degree of industry-wide standardization furthers the goal of increasing entry by entrepreneurs. However, this may come at the cost of reducing the research intensity by reducing the bidding competition among incumbents over the innovations of entrepreneurs.

30|$|Entrepreneurs in Ghana {{have contributed}} to the {{expansion}} of SH in the last few decades due to the discovery of crude oil. The expansion is because it attempts to provide shelter for both the oil and gas drilling workers and the tourist. Ghana’s small medium enterprises (SMEs) provide about 85 % of employment, contribute about 70 % to Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (Fosu, 2015; Lee-Ross and Lashley, 2010), and consequently influence significantly the growth of the economy as well as income and employment. To this, it is deduced that SMEs play an important role to national development, be it developed or developing economy.

This paper develops a simple overlapping-generations framework with endogenous occupational choice of heterogeneous agents and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>innovations</b> in which any form of scale effect is absent. A higher population growth rate has a negligible, possibly {{negative effect on the}} long-run growth rate of per capita income.
