Both Warne and MacGill's records were etched on the home (international) team dressing room's honours board in SCG.|$|E

25|$|Mustafizur Rahman is {{probably}} the most successful bowler of the off cutter. Instead of rolling the <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> the seam of sliding it back he flicks his wrists at the very last moment with very less change to his action. Thus the 'Fizz' grips the surface and deviates the ball from its line and gets a sudden jump like bounce with slower pace. He even bowls a fast off cutter. Thus Nasser Hossain rightly described him as a 'fast off spinner'. A good example would be Andre Russels dismissal by Mustafizur in the Vivo IPL 2016.|$|E
25|$|In 1922 Wegner {{published}} Der Schrei von Ararat (The Scream from Ararat), {{an appeal}} {{for the rights}} of surviving Armenians. Toward the mid-1920s, Wegner reached the peak of his popularity as a writer and as a co-creator of German Expressionism. In 1927-8, he and his wife traveled to the Soviet Union and also visited the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia, where he met with several Armenians he had befriended in Berlin in 1918–1920. Based on his journey, Wegner authored Five <b>Fingers</b> <b>Over</b> You, the success of which made him a celebrity. The text described the underlying political violence of the Soviet Communist model, foretelling the advent of Stalinism.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it is also}} possible, {{by holding}} the seam at an angle and rolling the <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> {{the surface of the}} ball, to produce a {{deliberate}} off cutter in which the ball veers away from the off side when it bounces on the pitch, or leg cutter in which it veers away from a right-handed batsman. Former Australian bowler Dennis Lillee employed a leg cutter of this sort to considerable effect; however, deliveries of this kind will be slower than if the bowler simply bowls with the seam upright, hoping for movement one way or the other. Some bowlers deliberately use cutters more for their surprise slowness than the deviation off the pitch - a tactic very effectively used by Mustafizur Rahman.|$|E

500|$|A fast bowler who {{operated}} from a {{very short}} run-up, Mold bowled extremely quickly, releasing the ball with his arm very high in his early years, although later in his career, his arm was lower in delivery. Unusually for a bowler of his pace, he could make the ball deviate from straight, either through seam movement or cutting his <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> it before release, but most of his wickets were taken through sheer speed. His obituary in the Manchester Guardian stated that {{he was among the}} fastest bowlers of all time and his bowling action was [...] "beautiful" [...] and possessed [...] "fine grace". If the pitch was uneven or otherwise difficult for batting, he was extremely difficult to bat against: in 1892, Wisden noted: [...] "On anything like a rough or bumpy wicket [...] he is, beyond all question, the most difficult and dangerous bowler of the day, the ball getting up from the pitch so high and so fast as to intimidate all but the very pluckiest of batsmen." [...] The Times later noted that he was very successful for Lancashire and a difficult bowler to face. In combination with Briggs, he bowled a very high proportion of Lancashire's overs. At times, he struggled with a knee injury but continued to bowl with little opportunity to rest.|$|E
