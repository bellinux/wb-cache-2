50|$|Some {{applications}} allow doing {{without the}} circulation fan and air heating altogether. If the parts being processed are fairly simply geometrically, {{it may be}} feasible to use molds which are themselves <b>integrally</b> <b>heated.</b> For example, it is feasible to manufacture flat and single-curvature light aircraft landing gear springs on inexpensive aluminum molds with electric heating pads bonded directly {{to the bottom of}} the mold. This eliminates the cost of the motor and fan as well as the air heaters and uses much less electricity than a comparable electric autoclave would require. In this way, the autoclave provides consolidation pressure alone. There are limitations to this approach, such as mold complexity. Sometimes, the parts are heated from one side only; sometimes, the mold has top and bottom parts, each fitted with heaters. Although not usually feasible in a job shop, this type of autoclave can afford significant savings when only a small range of comparatively simple parts is being made.|$|E
40|$|<b>Integrally</b> <b>heated</b> {{composite}} tooling (IHCT) {{is seen as}} a {{low cost}} alternative to autoclave manufacturing of polymer matrix composites (PMCs). IHCTs consist of a composite tool heated by surface heaters; temperature distribution is ensured by a thermally conductive metallic layer. The main original contributions of this thesis was {{the development of a new}} method for applying copper coatings onto carbon fibre/epoxy PMCs using pulsed gas dynamic spraying, the production of larger size samples, and the characterisation of the performance of the coatings and laminates obtained. It was shown that this method has potential for producing the thermally conductive layer in an IHCT. Another contribution was the characterisation of parameters affecting temperature distribution across IHCTs through heat transfer simulations, leading to guidelines for IHCT design...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for polymer matrix composites (PMCs) from the airframe industry raises {{the issues of}} productivity, cost and reproducibility of manufactured PMC components. Performance reproducibility {{is closely related to}} the manufacturing technique. Resin transfer moulding (RTM) offers the advantage of flexible manufacturing of net-shape PMC components with superior repeatability starting from ready-to-impregnate dry reinforcements. An RTM apparatus was developed for manufacturing PMC plates and demonstrator components representative of actual, PMC components and PMC moulds made and used in the airframe industry. The RTM process developed in this work involved making net-shape dry carbon fibre preforms and impregnating them an epoxy resin, targeting mould applications. Thermal repeatability of different net-shape PMC components manufactured using the RTM apparatus developed in-house was investigated. Effects of bonding an outer copper plate onto the PMC material, targeting mould applications known as <b>integrally</b> <b>heated</b> copper tooling (IHCT), were explored. Heat conduction through the PMC components was studied using simulation models validated by experimental data obtained primarily by thermography. Manufactured PMC components showed good repeatability, particularly in terms of thermal behaviour. The IHCT technique was found to be well suited for mould applications. Expected advantages of thermography were materialised. Finally, the simulation models developed were in good agreement with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) {{composite}} manufacturing {{requires the}} CFRP {{part on the}} associated tool to be heated, cured, and cooled via a prescribed thermal profile. Current methods use large fixed structures such as ovens and autoclaves to perform this process step; however heating these large structures takes significant amounts of energy and time. Further, these methods cannot control for different thermal requirements across a more complex or integrated composite structure. This project focused on the below objectives and approaches: - Gather baseline energy and performance data on ovens and autoclaves to compare with estimations of new technologies; - Determine feasibility, applicability, and preliminary thermal performance of proposed heated tooling technologies on certain part families via heat transfer analyses. The project yielded the below results and conclusions: - Proved the capability of the modeling software to mimic an oven cure with less than 3 % error in maximum exothermic temperature prediction; - Provided guidelines on when to use 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D heat transfer analyses based on part thickness; - Concluded which size/shape of parts would work best for the single sided integral heating technologies; - Calculated energy intensity of incumbent technologies for comparison of future experiments on <b>integrally</b> <b>heated</b> tooling. Overall, this project helped steer the team into {{the next phase of}} their research of the technology and its applications. It provided recommendations on what type of parts the technology can be used as well as quantified the energy intensity of incumbents for comparison. by Harrison Scott Bromley. Thesis: S.

Submitted for publication on 31 -March- 2016 in journal of Composite Structures. Manuscript ID: COST-D- 16 - 00629. Tooling design is crucial {{for the production of}} cost-effective and durable composite products. As part of the current search for cost reduction (by reducing capital investment, energy use and cycle time), integrally-heated tooling is one of the technologies available for ‘out-of-autoclave’ processing of advanced thermoset polymer composites. Despite their advantages, integrally-heated tools can suffer from uneven distribution of temperature, variability in heat flow rate and inconsistency in heating/cooling time. This research, therefore, investigates a number of design variables such as shape and layout of heating channels in order to improve the heating performance of an integrally-heated tool. Design of Experiments (DoE) has been carried out using Taguchi’s Orthogonal Array (OA) method to set several combinations of design parameters. Each of these design combinations has been evaluated through numerical simulation to investigate heating time and mould surface temperature variation. The simulation results suggest that the layout of the channels and their separation {{play a vital role in}} the heating performance. Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratio and analysis of variance (ANOVA) have been applied to the results obtained to identify the optimal design combination of the integrally-heated tool. Statistical analysis reveals that the heating performance of an integrally-heated tool can be significantly improved when the channels’ layout is parallel. The shape of the channels has negligible effect and the distance between the channels should be determined based on the production requirement. According to the predicted optimal design, a developed integrally water-heated tool is manufactured. The actual thermal properties of the constituent materials of the produced tool are also measured. Then a numerical model of the experimental tool model is simulated in ANSYS software, with setting the actual material properties and boundary condition to define the temperature uniformity and heating rate of the experimental tool. Comparison of the experimental and numerical results of the experimental tool confirmed the well assigning of the boundary conditions and material properties during simulation the heated tool. The experimental results also confirmed the predicted optimal design of the <b>integrally</b> <b>heated</b> tool. Finally, in order to define its thermomechanical behaviour under the effective (in service) thermal loads, a tool model is simulated. Numerical results presented that the produced extremes of thermal deformation, elastic strain, normal and plane shear stresses, under the effective thermal loading, are within the allowable elastic limits of the participated materials.
