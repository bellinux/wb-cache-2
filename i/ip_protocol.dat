[...] Instead of using TCP/IP packets, CobraNet transfers data using {{data link layer}} packets, which travel quickly through hubs, bridges and switches, and are not as susceptible to the latency and QoS problems commonly found in streaming protocols using a higher transport layer. [...] However, since CobraNet does not use <b>IP</b> <b>protocol,</b> its packets cannot travel through routers, and therefore it is limited to use on a LAN; CobraNet cannot be used over the Internet.

The results show that the proposed mechanism improves both the throughput and the handoff delay by 50 % compared to the Cellular IP and Hawaii <b>IP</b> <b>protocols.</b> A T-test analysis shows that this improvement is significant at the 99 % confidence interval...|$|R

However, such integration is not guaranteed due to mismatches between <b>IP</b> <b>protocols.</b> Protocol conversion algorithms can generate converters that can guarantee correct system behaviour, but the implementation of converters on-chip remains an open question. IPs can be modelled at several layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Current protocol conversion algorithms either focus on a single layer or worse, blur the boundaries between these layers. We propose a formal framework that allows generating implementable converters for <b>IP</b> <b>protocols</b> modelled at different OSI layers using any existing converter generation algorithm.
