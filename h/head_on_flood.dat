40|$|AbstractThe {{overall mass}} {{transfer}} coefficient, G 20, {{for a single}} hole orifice plate was evaluated {{in a series of}} experiments as affected by four geometric variables: orifice plate hole diameter (5, 10, 14, 19, and 22 mm), hydraulic <b>head</b> <b>on</b> the <b>flooded</b> plate (2. 5, 5, and 13 cm), water fall height from the orifice to the receiving pool of water (30, 61, 91, and 122 cm), and the collection pool depth (2. 5, 8, 13, 25, and 41 cm). This is, in essence, the simplest form of a low head oxygenator (LHO). A regression equation was developed to predict G 20 as a function of these variables, their interactions, and squared terms. The hydraulic head above the flooded plate had no significant effect (P< 0. 10) on the overall mass transfer coefficient. It was determined that the contribution of the orifice hole solely to overall gas transfer was much less than previously assumed, suggesting that a much larger percentage of gas transfer is due to the splashing and subsequent entrainment as water droplets fall into the receiving pool of water. Practical implications of the results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This module focuses <b>on</b> <b>flooding</b> and {{the natural}} and {{man-made}} factors that influence floods. Students will learn the properties of soils that may influence flooding, describe factors that affect the flow of rivers, research factors that result in floods, describe the effects of land-use practices <b>on</b> <b>flood</b> control, and learn to identify their own watersheds on a map. The module consists of seven lessons in which the students will learn vocabulary, perform internet-based activities, and see a video <b>on</b> <b>flooding.</b> They will also perform historical research <b>on</b> <b>flooding,</b> use modeling software to model a flood, and perform a lab activity in which they test different types of soil for water-retaining capacity.

40|$|Urban {{pluvial flood}} {{management}} requires detailed {{spatial and temporal}} information <b>on</b> <b>flood</b> characteristics and damaging consequences. There is lack of quantitative field data <b>on</b> pluvial <b>flooding</b> resulting in large uncertainties in urban flood model calculations and ensuing decisions for investments in flood protection. In this paper four different data sources are discussed, based on literature and expert consultation, that {{are believed to be}} of value for the acquisition of quantitative data <b>on</b> pluvial <b>flooding.</b> Data assembled by insurance agencies <b>on</b> <b>flood</b> damage, call databases held by water authorities and emergency services and remote sensing images cover years of observational data that can be mined to obtain data <b>on</b> <b>flood</b> characteristics and occurrence.

40|$|Approximately 5300 fish larvae, {{representing}} 59 {{species and}} 39 families, {{were collected in}} flood and ebb tide samples taken by plankton and beach seine nets in the narrow entrance channel of a seasonally open estuary (Wilson Inlet), in the {{two to three months}} before the mouth became closed by a sand bar. All of the species were recorded <b>on</b> <b>flood</b> tides and eight of the nine that were also found in ebb tides were spawned within the estuary. The other 51 species belonged to teleosts which typically breed at sea. The most abundant species caught during this study (Favonigobius lateralis) was flushed out of the estuary as preflexion larvae on ebb tides and then re-recruited as postflexion larvae <b>on</b> <b>flood</b> tides. While other species which spawn within the estuary (e. g. Pseudogobius olorum, Engraulis australis and Urocampus carinirostris) were also flushed out on ebb tides, they rarely returned <b>on</b> <b>flood</b> tides as postflexion larvae. Of the 51 marine species, 35 were not collected as either juveniles or adults within the estuary. These species were caught only <b>on</b> <b>flood</b> tides and mainly as preflexion larvae. In contrast, the sparids Pagrus auratus and Rhabdosargus sarba, which occur as juveniles in the estuary, were found entering the entrance channel <b>on</b> <b>flood</b> tides as postflexion larvae. The fact that the last two species are amongst the few teleosts that might be recruited as larvae into {{the main body of the}} estuary, reflects the very small tidal movement in that part of the system...|$|R
