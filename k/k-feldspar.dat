40|$|A {{detailed}} mineralogical {{study was}} carried out on potassium feldspars contained in some ''paleosoil'' samples from the Alban Hills volcanic region (Latium, Italy). Chemical and structural correlation of the data allowed a comparison with data on sanidinite feldspars from the same area and with data on other nearby volcanic complexes. The chemistry (N-Or = 72. 6 divided by 88. 3 % Or) and lattice parameters [a(o) = 8. 492 divided by 8. 574 (Angstrom), b(o) = 12. 996 divided by 13. 034 (Angstrom), c(o) = 7. 163 divided by 7. 190 (Angstrom) ] indicate a prevalently more sanidinitic character for the paleosoil feldspars compared with those in Alban ''sanidinites''. The particular structural state (HT disorder) of some paleosoil <b>K-feldspars</b> would suggest different crystallization temperatures and, for some samples, also a possible pressure influence during their formation. The abundance of <b>K-feldspars</b> in the samples examined and their less orthoclasic features compared with feldspars found in sanidinitic Alban ejecta would highlight a rather different genetic process for these paleosoils {{compared with that of}} the more typical Alban volcanic products, mainly of leucititic composition.

40|$|OSL dating {{indicates}} that last-glacial (Peoria) loess deposition {{rates in the}} Great Plains of Nebraska may {{have been among the}} highest in the world, exceeding most glaciogenic loess in the Mississippi Valley (Roberts et al., 2003, QR). U-Pb ages of zircons (including a major 34 -Ma population) and highly radiogenic Pb isotopic compositions of <b>K-feldspars</b> demonstrate that the source of Great Plains loess was volcanogenic siltstone of the Tertiary White River Group. Modeling suggests that Great Plains loess deposition could have extended well east of Nebraska (Mahowald et al., 2006, JGR). To determine if Peoria Loess of the upper Mississippi River valley contains a component of Great Plains-derived sediment, we studied a thick (17 m) section of Peoria Loess near Morrison, Illinois, 18 km east of the Mississippi River. Radiocarbon ages indicate that loess deposition occurred after 32, 000 14 C yr BP (Farmdale Soil below Peoria Loess) and continued after 15, 500 14 C yr BP (snails at 3. 5 m). Zircons from the loess have major age populations of about 2. 70, 1. 88, and 1. 07 Ga, indicating derivation from the Superior, Penokean, and Grenville provinces over which the Laurentide ice sheet traversed. <b>K-feldspars</b> in Peoria Loess from Morrison have Pb-isotopic compositions indicative of mixing between Superior and Grenville province sources, in agreement with the zircon U-Pb data. We conclude that Peoria Loess at Morrison is dominantly glaciogenic, although a very radiogenic Pb-isotopic composition of <b>K-feldspars</b> in the section 2 ̆ 7 s uppermost part permits a Great Plains input to the modern soil. Loess at Morrison also shows three distinct clay mineral and carbonate zones, similar to loess elsewhere in Illinois. Pb-isotopic variations of <b>K-feldspars</b> track the clay mineral and carbonate trends. Thus, although the loess at Morrison was dominantly Laurentide-derived, the relative importance of different glacial lobes as loess sources varied over the period of deposition...|$|R

Our new data indicate that only loess adjacent to the Platte River has Pb isotopic characteristics suggesting derivation from this river. Most Peoria Loess in central Nebraska (up to 20 m thick) is non-glaciogenic, {{on the basis of}} Pb isotope ratios in <b>K-feldspars</b> and the presence of 34 -Ma detrital zircons. These isotopic characteristics suggest derivation primarily from the Oligocene White River Group in southern South Dakota, western Nebraska, southeastern Wyoming, and northeastern Colorado.

40|$|Wadi Zarieb area lies 10 km to the south, midway on the Qena-Safaga paved road. Pegmatites are {{the most}} {{important}} rock type in the area that are the source of feldspars in the ceramic industries. Most of the pegmatite bodies that are invading granitoid rocks at Wadi Zarieb, central Eastern Desert, are classified as zoned pegmatites. They mainly consist of coarse-grained milky quartz core, intermediate Li-mica zone and wall zone of feldspars. Feldspars represent 45 % of ceramic constituents that are the main fluxing components used in ceramic industries. The Wadi Zarieb feldspars were found to have good grinding ability only requiring 120 - 150 min to obtain the needed grain size with a release of both Na + and K + in the solution which, in turn, enhance the rheological properties of the ceramic slip. The total alkalis content (sum of Na 2 O + K 2 O) in Zarieb <b>K-feldspars</b> is more than 13 %, whereas the uranium content is ranging between 1 and 2 ppm. The thorium content is not exceed 7. Then, the geochemical data reveals that Zarieb <b>K-feldspars</b> are good flux in ceramic industries. The results of the physical tests illustrated by water absorption %, shrinkage and bending strength beside their good resist for thermal shock suggest that the feldspars of the studied area can be used for wall and floor ceramic industry. Finally, the economical aspects of the Wadi Zarieb <b>K-feldspars</b> were compiled to give an idea of to what extent costs can be saved in ceramics production by using this feldspar source. This assumption is supported by the self-separation of feldspars in zoned pegmatites that are delivered as rock raw materials which are used as they are without any upgrading or treatments...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for dating well-bleached sediments is presented, with results for {{thirteen}} samples from China. The method uses an isochron constructed from {{the measurement of}} natural radiation doses received by potassium-feldspar grains {{in a range of}} grain sizes using the infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signal. The age of deposition of the sediment is calculated from this isochron and from the internal dose rate to the grains from 40 K and 87 Rb in the crystal lattice. This procedure appears to overcome age underestimation due to anomalous fading, a phenomenon that has precluded conventional luminescence dating of <b>K-feldspars</b> and would be applicable to <b>K-feldspars</b> for which the natural dose is beyond the linear dose response region. Also, since the isochron IRSL method is reliant on only the internal dose rate, it overcomes problems related to (1) changes in past dose rate due to postdepositional migration of radionuclides, (2) changes in water content as water-lain sediments dry out, (3) spatial heterogeneity in the gamma dose rate, and (4) uncertainties in the cosmic ray dose rate during the period of sample burial.

This work focuses on the natural weathering characteristics of soils, particularly the clay material, through the study of samples collected near the River Cavado. Samples taken from various sites, after physico-chemical characterisation, were subjected to clay dissolution tests, using sodium salts of different ionic forces, to detect the relationship between certain physico-chemical parameters of water, such as pH, nitrate, chloride and sulphate content, in the dissolution of clay and the subsequent extraction of such cations as Al, Fe and K. In acidic sandy clay soils, the mineralogical composition of which was characterised by a predominance of quartz, micas, kaolinite and <b>K-feldspars,</b> decreases of the clay material/water pH ratio increases dissolution of the micaceous and <b>K-feldspars</b> phases.

For triclinic samples, measures of the state of A 1,Si order (M 1 and M 2 of 27 A 1 spectra and M 2 of 29 Si spectra) correlate well with site occupancies determined by powder XRD, but for the monoclinic samples the NMR parameters continue to change whereas the XRD parameters do not.
