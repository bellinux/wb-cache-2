25|$|In Europe, woodcut is {{the oldest}} {{technique}} used for old master prints, developing about 1400, by using on paper existing techniques for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts {{in the middle of}} the century led to a fall in standards, and many popular prints were very crude. The development of hatching followed on rather later than in engraving. Michael Wolgemut was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and Erhard Reuwich was the first to use cross-hatching (far <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than in engraving or etching). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century Albrecht Dürer brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the single-leaf (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.|$|E
25|$|Space {{neuroscience}} is {{the scientific}} study of the central nervous system (CNS) functions during spaceflight. Living systems can integrate the inputs from the senses to navigate in their environment and to coordinate posture, locomotion, and eye movements. Gravity has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In weightlessness during spaceflight, integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> because gravity is no longer sensed during free-fall. For example, the otolith organs of the vestibular system no longer signal head tilt relative to gravity when standing. However, they can still sense head translation during body motion. Ambiguities and changes in how the gravitational input is processed can lead to potential errors in perception, which affects spatial orientation and mental representation. Dysfunctions of the vestibular system are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as space motion sickness in orbit and balance disorders after return to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Bartolo, his wife Josefa {{encouraged}} their son Federico {{to take over the}} business at the young age of 17. Shortly after Federico took the helm, Spanish dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, closed the frontier with Gibraltar in the 1920s making it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business and maintain his widowed mother, brother and two sisters. This was the first of a repeating pattern of political obstacles which the family business would have to face from governments in Madrid. The next decade continued to be troublesome times for Gibraltar with the Spanish Civil War at its doorstep. The end of the war in 1939 reopened access to the Spanish market for Gibraltarian merchants. Commodities such as tobacco and coffee were scarce in the post civil war Spain and Federico, together with his younger brother Bartolo were able to sell vast quantities of coffee there. Their renown La Negrita brand became so popular in southern Spain that it was even mentioned in a famous chirigota, a satirical folksong so typical of the Cádiz Carnival.|$|E

500|$|In March 2016, Alisha Grauso of Forbes {{discussed}} the series and its ratings, describing {{the show as}} having [...] "never quite been the ratings hit for ABC that the network had hoped it would be...It's hard enough to write a film script that fits within {{the continuity of the}} larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, even <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with a full-length TV season that must act as connective tissue to the larger world while still being its own thing." [...] Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it could be (with fewer connections to the films, like the Marvel-Netflix shows) or on just being [...] "support and tie-in {{to the world of the}} Avengers". Grauso concluded, [...] "The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world." ...|$|E
500|$|Following a {{long time}} of hiatus in her acting career, Cher was {{announced}} to be returned on the musical film Burlesque (2010) co-starring Christina Aguilera. This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things. I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still talking to me and listening to what I say. But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for me, had a lot of meaning. It reminded me that I have to kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have to pull me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack. In order to promote the song, several promotional remixes were made by Almighty, Dave Aude and StoneBridge. The remix EP, which contains uptempo dance versions of the track, was released onto iTunes Stores on November 24, 2010. The remix done by StoneBridge was released as a single on December 7, 2010. The song is also included in Cher's 25th studio album, Closer to the Truth (deluxe edition).|$|E

2500|$|On October 31 Nkunda {{declared}} that he would create a [...] "humanitarian aid corridor", a no-fire zone where displaced persons would be allowed back to their homes, given {{the consent of the}} United Nations task force in the Congo. Working with the UN forces around Goma, Nkunda hoped to relocate victims of the recent fighting between his CNDP forces and UN peacekeepers (MONUC). MONUC spokesman Kevin Kennedy stated that MONUC's forces were stretched thin trying to keep peace within and around the city; recent looting by Congolese soldiers had made it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so as incidents arose both within city limits and outside. According to Anneke Van Woudenberg, a Human Rights Watch researcher, more than 20 people were killed overnight in Goma alone. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice contacted Rwandan President Paul Kagame to discuss a long-term solution.|$|E

Along with the band's tour manager and a friend, Pierre made appearances and played acoustic shows throughout the US Midwest and East Coast. The tour's itinerary was planned with fans' help through Twitter, {{with it all}} being chronicled online at MyDinosaurLife.com. The guitarist Joshua Cain commented that he felt their use of Twitter had helped to reconnect the band with fans. [...] "I feel like {{in the last few}} years, that stuff's gotten <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do...</b> really re-engaged us as a band to be able to communicate with everybody." [...] The band played three sold-out Chicago shows in mid-December, each of which featured one of the band's previous records in full. They then arranged a touring schedule which would include supporting Weezer on several dates in December and January, as well as beginning a headlining tour in late January covering the United States. Following the album's release, they recommenced touring; {{in the first three months}} the band travelled to Australia for the national Soundwave festival, as well as to Japan and the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|The {{algorithm}} finds a maximal set of vertex disjoint augmenting {{paths of}} length [...] (Maximal means {{that no more}} such paths can be added. This is different from finding {{the maximum number of}} such paths, which would be <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Fortunately, it is sufficient here to find a maximal set of paths.) This set may be computed by depth first search (DFS) from [...] to the free vertices in , using the breadth first layering to guide the search: the DFS is only allowed to follow edges that lead to an unused vertex in the previous layer, and paths in the DFS tree must alternate between matched and unmatched edges. Once an augmenting path is found that involves one of the vertices in , the DFS is continued from the next starting vertex. Any vertex encountered during the DFS can immediately be marked as used, since if there is no path from it to [...] at the current point in the DFS, then that vertex can't be used to reach [...] at any other point in the DFS. This ensures [...] running time for the DFS. It is also possible to work in the other direction, from free vertices in [...] to those in , which is the variant used in the pseudocode.|$|E
2500|$|According to Yorke, {{many of his}} {{lyrics are}} {{motivated}} by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns, and written as [...] "a constant response to doublethink". The lyrics of the 2003 Radiohead album Hail to the Thief dealt with what he called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush and the unfolding War on Terror. Yorke wrote his 2006 solo single [...] "Harrowdown Hill" [...] about David Kelly, a whistleblower who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified weapons of mass destructions in Iraq. In a 2008 television performance of [...] "House of Cards", Yorke dedicated the chorus lyric, [...] "denial, denial", to Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases. Despite his political concerns, in a November 2015 interview with the activist and writer George Monbiot, he said: [...] "In the 60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. It’s much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that now ... If I was {{going to write a}} protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit.
