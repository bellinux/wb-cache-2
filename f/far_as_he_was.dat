5|$|The final witness {{called for}} the defence was Coventry. He {{was one of the}} non-playing members of the party who had {{witnessed}} no cheating, understood little about gambling and, as a non-soldier, knew nothing of Article 41 of the Queen's Regulations. When cross-examined by Clarke, Coventry confirmed that as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> aware, the witnesses had all decided to watch Gordon-Cumming's play on the second night, despite their claims to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of the telegraph {{and the development of}} the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day-to-day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed, and he used the new technologies to direct the army's and navy's movements as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able. McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War, and did not get along with the Army's commanding general, Nelson A. Miles. Bypassing them, he looked for strategic advice first from Miles's predecessor, General John Schofield, and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin. The war led to a change in McKinley's cabinet, as the President accepted Sherman's resignation as Secretary of State; Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war's end.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{position}} on any offensive move {{was made clear}} by Leopold III. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned, the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also made clear that in the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position {{in order to keep}} contact with the Belgian Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports. The will of the CIGS won out. Gort committed just two infantry battalions and the only armoured battalion in the BEF to the attack, which despite some initial tactical success, failed to break the German defensive line at the Battle of Arras on 21 May.|$|E

25|$|In reality, the Committee {{seems to}} have been misled by false {{information}} to the effect that Goring and the governor of Oxford were about to declare for Parliament. Had they not dispatched Fairfax to the relief of Taunton in the first instance, the necessity for such intrigues would not have arisen. However, Fairfax obeyed orders, invested Oxford, and so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able, without a proper siege train, besieged it for two weeks, while Charles and Rupert ranged the Midlands unopposed.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was furious}} over the {{official}} decision and argued with the officials {{claiming that he}} should be declared the winner and not Austin. On the following night's Raw, Hart came to the ring unannounced {{at the beginning of the}} show and began venting his frustrations toward Vince McMahon over how he believed that the finish to the Royal Rumble was just another in a long string of screwings and broken promises that had been dogging Hart since he returned to the company. He demanded that he receive the title shot that the winner of the Royal Rumble is entitled to, saying that as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned he won the match. McMahon simply ignored him and walked to his broadcast position, and an incensed Hart finally decided he had had enough and declared he was quitting the WWF.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Bourguiba and {{his friends}} of L'Action Tunisienne saw the Destour as lacking firmness. Nevertheless, it {{developed}} an organization with 90 local representatives from throughout the country. It had not grown since the arrival of Manceron {{at the head of}} the Residence. Recruiting among lower classes as well as the bourgeois classes, the new distinction among the Destour permitted them to have a strong position and influence the party in order to unify all factions of the nationalist front. Responding to the wishes of Bourguiba, many delegates supported this union. However, in 1933, it was not yet Bourguiba but Mahmoud El Materi who appeared to be the leader of L'Action group. This man who proved himself to be an active man of science in the French communist party and ended up as a delegate during the Tours Congress. He expressed his will not to become a politician. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned, tolerance, the sense of honour, solidarity, spirit, and justice overrode tactics, cynicism, provocation, and low blows. His qualities and charisma allowed him to forge a strong position within the Destour in which he was unanimous.|$|E

The New York Post reported that according to sources the split was not about [...] "irresolvable personality conflicts" [...] but about the money; a friend of Cornell said, [...] "Chris was unhappy with the financial arrangement within the group—he wrote all the music, yet the other three bandmates took an equal share in the multimillion-dollar publishing rights." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} rumored to be about Jackson's {{relationship}} with Debbie Rowe in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Co-writer Teddy Riley, who was quoted to have said so {{in an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times in 1996, denied in a 2011 reply to a fan on Twitter that the song was about Rowe. Others have noted that when the single was originally released in 1992, Jackson dedicated the song to Diana Ross, including Jermaine Jackson, who in his book You Are Not Alone: [...] Michael: [...] Through a Brother's Eyes wrote, [...] "...that song was, as Michael told me, written with Diana Ross in mind; the one great love that, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned, escaped him." ...|$|E
500|$|AOC 11 Group Keith Park was livid {{with the}} claim returns. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned, {{claiming}} 200 {{on one day}} was nonsense. He placed particular blame on Leigh-Mallory's Big Wing which had claimed one third, around 60, of the 185 'victories' (total claims were 81 {{in the morning and}} 104 in the afternoon). More damage should have been done to German bombers inbound to the target rather than destroying stragglers that were no military threat {{as they made their way}} to the coast. He complained that there were too many inexperienced leaders and interceptions were being missed. Things needed [...] "tightening up", that was Park's lesson for 15 September. Park was aware the ratio of losses was 2:1 in the British favour. It had been a decent performance, but not Fighter Command's best.|$|E

500|$|The issue {{concerned}} Hand {{again during}} the New Deal period, when the Supreme Court repeatedly overturned or blocked Franklin D. Roosevelt's legislation. As an instinctive democrat, Hand was appalled that an elected government should have its laws struck down in this way. He viewed it as a judicial [...] "usurpation" [...] for the Supreme Court to {{assume the role of}} a third chamber in these cases. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned, the Constitution already provided a full set of checks and balances on legislation. Nevertheless, Hand did not hesitate to condemn Roosevelt's frustrated attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, which led commentators to warn of totalitarianism. The answer, for Hand, lay in the separation of powers: courts should be independent and act on the legislation of elected governments.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{returned}} to Australia in 1980 {{to compete at}} the Australian Championships, which doubled as the Olympic trials. His sojourn in the United Kingdom meant {{that he was a}} virtual unknown in his home country. He set a national record in winning the 100m breaststroke in a time of 1m 4.80s and also qualified for his less preferred 200m event. During the Olympic training camp in Brisbane, the Australian coaches tried to get Evans to cover more mileage at training. Evans' teammates recalled him stopping during a pool session and emphatically proclaiming that [...] "Work is a poor substitute for talent". In 2000, more than a decade after his retirement, he was still using this slogan. Evans was confident in his own training methods and refused to bend to the coaches. His teammate Mark Tonelli said that Evans [...] "knew what he was capable of and as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned, he was capable of anything".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in the US {{towards the end of}} 1896 Churchill explained that for the financial year ending 1 September 1896 sales were £110,000, and the order book value was £30,000. He attributed much of the exceptional growth of that year to the boom in bicycling and the consequent demand for automatic screw machines and similar machinery, and commented that he had placed orders for between 15million and 18million steel balls and that gas furnaces were selling well. He explained that there was little competition for the imported machinery – not even a manufacturer of chucks, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> aware – because [...] "English" [...] firms seemed reluctant to even copy US designs, partly because of [...] "the Englishman's desire to have and to embody his own ideas" [...] and to what they perceived to be the high capital costs of setting up production given the price at which US machinery was sold there. A few years later he did just that.|$|E

500|$|To Britain's {{alarm and}} indignation, the Portuguese {{government}} announced on 21 September that Nogueira had accepted [...] "a letter of introduction" [...] from Reedman, conferring upon him the title [...] "Chief of the Rhodesian Mission", with powers {{to deal with}} the Portuguese Foreign Ministry in Luso-Rhodesian matters without British interference. This followed the precedent set by Reedman's counterpart in South Africa, the statement said. Speaking publicly in Salisbury the same evening, Dupont told reporters that there had never been any intention to claim ambassadorial status for Reedman, and that Rhodesia had constantly kept Britain informed of what was happening regarding the appointment. So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> concerned, he said, the Rhodesian government had achieved its objective of attaining an independent diplomatic representative in Portugal, and had not exceeded its mandate in any way while doing so. Britain protested strenuously, saying Portugal was going back on its word. Portugal insisted that its reception of Reedman and his Lisbon mission did not prejudice Britain's responsibility over Rhodesia, and was justified because of the long-standing ties between Portugal and Rhodesia, as well as their common involvement in many southern African issues.|$|E
