3000|$|Composite slab {{reinforced}} with profiled steel <b>decking</b> <b>sheet</b> {{means there is}} {{a provision in the}} system for positive mechanical interlock between the interface of the concrete and the steel deck by means of embossments. The profiled <b>decking</b> <b>sheet</b> must provide the resistance to vertical separation and horizontal slippage between the contact surface of the concrete and the <b>decking</b> <b>sheet</b> (Poh and Attard [1993]). It also permits transfer of shear stresses from the concrete slab to the steel deck. The horizontal slippage between the concrete and the steel deck will exist due to the longitudinal shear stress when the shear force of the shear connectors reaches its ultimate strength. However, it is complicated to predict exactly the longitudinal shear stress (τ u,Rd [...]) under flexural loading; therefore, the longitudinal shear resistance of composite slabs under flexural loading is indirectly evaluated from the empirical method (Vainiunas and Valivonis [2006]). Eurocode 4 - Part 1.1 offers two approaches that both necessitate serious full-size laboratory work. One is called m-k method (shear bond method) where m represents the mechanical interlocking and k represents the friction between concrete and steel deck (BS 5950 : Part 4 [1994]; EN 1994 - 1 - 1 [2004]) and the other is partial shear connection (PSC) method (EN 1994 - 1 - 1 [2004]) as an alternative to m-k method.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} this time that the L'Orient caught fire, and when Bill and his friend reached the <b>deck,</b> <b>sheets</b> of flame were already leaping out at the port-holes of the {{gigantic}} ship. The sides of the L'Orient had been recently painted, and the paint-buckets and oil-jars which stood on the poop soon caught, and added brilliancy to the great conflagration which speedily followed the first outbreak of fire. It was about nine o'clock when the fire was first observed. Before this the gallant French Admiral had perished. Although three times wounded, Brueys refused to quit his post. At length a shot almost cut him in two, but still he refused to go below, and desired {{to be left to}} die on his quarter-deck. He was spared the pain of witnessing the destruction of his vessel.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of longitudinal shear stress using the experimental evaluation of m-k values for ultimate strength design of composite slabs reinforced with new trapezoidal profiled steel <b>decking</b> <b>sheet</b> with rectangular dishing type embossments. The longitudinal shear stress resulting from m-k method is compared with PSC method, and the comments to evaluate the longitudinal shear stress of composite slabs are discussed. Also, to study the load-deflection curves, load-end slip curves and failure modes subject to imposed loads. The steel decks (CRIL DECKSPANTM) are manufactured and supplied by Colour Roof India Limited (CRIL), Mumbai, INDIA. A total of 18 full-scale, one-way, single-span, simply supported composite slab specimens are tested using M 20 grade concrete subjected to two equal line loads placed symmetrically at six different shear span lengths. The ultimate load-carrying capacity of the composite slabs is calculated using m-k method and is verified with the results obtained by the PSC method as per Eurocode 4 - Part 1.1.|$|R

60|$|With her stern {{low in the}} water, the lugger was now tearing {{along at}} a {{tremendous}} pace. Stout as were her masts, and strong the stays, James Walsham wondered at their standing the strain of the great brown sails, as they seemed, at times, almost to lift her bodily out of the water. Buoyant as the craft was, the waves broke over her bows and flooded her <b>decks,</b> and <b>sheets</b> of spray flew over her.|$|R
60|$|Again the Rathmines {{rolled in}} the wash of some unseen ship, and a silver-gray wave broke over the bow, leaving on the <b>deck</b> a <b>sheet</b> of sediment--the gray broth that has {{its place in the}} fathomless deeps of the sea. A {{sprinkling}} of the wave fell on my face, and it was so cold that it stung as boiling water stings. The dead and most untouched deep water of the sea had been heaved to the top by the submarine volcano--the chill still water that kills all life and smells of desolation and emptiness. We did not need either the blinding fog or that indescribable smell of musk to make us unhappy--we were shivering with cold and wretchedness where we stood.|$|R

Ninenteen of them were bottom trawls (using two {{commercial}} standard nets, with 40 and 48 mm size at code-end, mesured by ICNAF method, added with a cover of 10 mm mesh size), and two were IKMT sets. In the present report the methodology employed is described. Catches were subsampled under prestabilished conditions: a) species composition (number, weigts and relatives abundances for all species); b) length frecuencies distribution; and c) biological data from selected species (length, weight, sex maturity, age, stomachal contents, etc). Data from c) is not reported by the moment. Special <b>deck</b> annotaton <b>sheets</b> were used when picking up data. These sheets-at {{the end of the study}} of each haul-were directly punched in cards and entered to the DBP system.

50|$|Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Rufus Herrings {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as Commanding Officer of LCI (G) 449 operating as a unit of LCI (G) Group EIGHT, during the preinvasion attack on Iwo Jima on 17 February 1945. Boldly closing the strongly fortified shores under the devastating fire of Japanese coastal defense guns, Lieutenant (then Lieutenant, Junior Grade,) Herring directed shattering barrages of 40-mm. and 20-mm. gunfire against hostile beaches until struck down by the enemys savage counterfire which blasted the 449s heavy guns and whipped her <b>decks</b> into <b>sheets</b> of flame. Regaining consciousness despite profuse bleeding he was again critically wounded when a Japanese mortar crashed the conning station, instantly killing or fatally wounding most of the officers and leaving the ship wallowing without navigational control. Upon recovering the second time, Lieutenant Herring resolutely climbed down to the pilot house and, fighting against his rapidly waning strength, took over the helm, established communication with the engine room and carried on valiantly until relief could be obtained. When no longer able to stand, he propped himself against empty shell cases and rallied his men to the aid of the wounded; he maintained position in the firing line with his 20-mm guns in action in the face of sustained enemy fire and conned his crippled ship to safety. His unwavering fortitude, aggressive perseverance and indomitable spirit against terrific odds reflect the highest credit upon Lieutenant Herring and uphold the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|R
40|$|The article {{explains}} {{the design and}} project of a steel footbridge, suspended and supported by an eccentric arc, situated in Orense. The footbridge, known as &# 226;&# 128;&# 156;Bellour&# 226;&# 128;&# 157;, has a main span of 20 meters, with a leaned steel eccentric arc that supports the deck. The deck was designed with a uniform slope of 8 %, due the difference of level between each end. It is suspended from the arc in the Orense side and supported in the other boarder, because of the headway limitations. The deck is 2, 80 meters wide. The cross section is composed of a steel eccentric tube with steel cantilever beams, of variable depth, and is joined at the other edge to a small steel tube. The pedestrian zone is narrower than the board, leaving individual empty spaces at both sides, and is constituted by a structural concrete slab of 7 centimeters thick and 2 meters wide, linked to the <b>deck</b> top <b>sheet,</b> with a steel profiles. The board was designed with a structural skeleton, spine shaped, suspended or supported from the arc, and it&# 194;&# 180;s joined to the skin, a rough concrete surface that avoids frost and slides due to the rain. En este art&# 237;culo se expone el dise&# 241;o de una pasarela met&# 225;lica exc&# 233;ntrica suspendida y apoyada en un arco met&# 225;lico situada en la ciudad de Orense. La pasarela, conocida por &# 194;&# 171;Bellour&# 194;&# 187;, tiene un &# 250;nico vano de 20 metros de luz, soportado exc&# 233;ntricamente por un arco met&# 225;lico inclinado. Las cotas de inicio y fin de la pasarela obligaron a dise&# 241;ar un tablero inclinado que est&# 225; suspendido del arco en el lado Orense y apoyado en el otro extremo al permitirlo el g&# 225;libo de la carretera. La secci&# 243;n transversal del tablero est&# 225; formada por un tubo exc&# 233;ntrico del que parten unas m&# 233;nsulas met&# 225;licas de canto variable, unidas en su otro extremo por otro tubo m&# 225;s peque&# 241;o. El pavimento de la pasarela, que es m&# 225;s estrecho que el propio tablero, dejando sendos espacios vac&# 237;os a ambos lados, est&# 225; formado por una losa de hormig&# 243;n armado conectada a una chapa met&# 225;lica que est&# 225; soldada a la parte superior de las m&# 233;nsulas. La geometr&# 237;a del tablero responde al concepto de dise&# 241;ar una espina resistente, con una plataforma que se puede pisar de hormig&# 243;n rugoso, de gran adherencia y resistente a las heladas...|$|R
