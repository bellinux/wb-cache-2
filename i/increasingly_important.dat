5|$|In {{the early}} years of the FN, the party already called for {{immigration}} to be reduced. The theme of exclusion of non-European immigrants was brought into the party in 1978 and became <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Youth {{travel is}} {{becoming}} <b>increasingly</b> more <b>important</b> within global tourism. In the 1990’s, it represented 15% of the tourism market, with it increasing to 20% {{in the last}} decade, and expected to reach 25% in the near future.|$|R
25|$|Money {{market funds}} <b>increasingly</b> became <b>important</b> to the {{wholesale}} money market {{leading up to}} the crisis. Their purchases of asset-backed securities and large-scale funding of foreign banks' short-term U.S.-denominated debt put the funds in a pivotal position in the marketplace.|$|R
50|$|Again, quality always {{supersedes}} quantity. The {{genesis of}} a product is becoming more of concern for consumers.

5|$|The West also {{suffered}} more heavily from {{the instability of}} the 3rd century AD. This distinction between the established Hellenised East and the younger Latinised West persisted and became <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> in later centuries, leading to a gradual estrangement of the two worlds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, Magna Carta became <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> as a {{political}} document in arguments over {{the authority of the}} English monarchy. James I and Charles I both propounded greater authority for the Crown, justified by the doctrine of the divine right of kings, and Magna Carta was cited extensively by their opponents to challenge the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Somerset has few {{industrial}} centres, but it {{does have}} a variety of light industry and high technology businesses, along with traditional agriculture and an <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> tourism sector, resulting in an unemployment rate of 2.5%. Unemployment is lower than the national average; the largest employment sectors are retail, manufacturing, tourism, and health and social care. Population growth in the county is higher than the national average.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important to}} humans, as {{is shown by}} their depiction in art over the centuries. The fishing industry harvests them for food, and anglers attempt to capture them for sport. Some species are farmed commercially, and this method of production {{is likely to be}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> in the future. Others are kept in aquariums or used in research, especially in the fields of genetics and developmental biology.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{incendiary}} devices had {{decreased by}} the 14th century, {{perhaps due to}} the economic realities of war where it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> that captured castles and towns were undamaged. Moreover, fewer wooden engines and structures were employed in the battlefield after the late 13th century, {{perhaps because of the}} prior success of the incendiary weapons at destroying them.|$|E
5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century. However, {{with the emergence of}} the feminist movement {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became <b>increasingly</b> <b>important.</b> Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} area {{of intelligent}} {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) research has shown rapid development {{in recent years and}} offers a great number of research challenges for artificial intelligence and knowledge representation. Much previous research has focused on low-level control capability with the goal of developing controllers which support the autonomous flight of a UAV from one way-point to another. The most common type of mission scenario involves placing sensor payloads in position for data collection tasks where the data is eventually processed off-line or in real-time by ground personnel. Use of UAVs and mission tasks such as these have become <b>increasingly</b> more <b>important</b> in recent conflict situations and are predicted to play <b>increasingly</b> more <b>important</b> roles in any future conflicts...|$|R

5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes <b>increasingly</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
5|$|Del Piero's first {{appearance}} after the 2006 FIFA World Cup triumph {{was in a}} Coppa Italia match against Cesena on 23 August 2006. As Juventus played in the Serie B for the 2006–07 season, the Coppa Italia campaign became <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> for the club {{in order to achieve}} a UEFA Cup spot. Having been on vacation beforehand, Del Piero started on the bench. Juventus and Cesena were locked on 1–1 when Del Piero entered in the 74th minute and after nine seconds, he scored the winning goal for Juventus.|$|E
5|$|Early {{improvement}} {{was carried out}} with the traditional tools, but new technology was <b>increasingly</b> <b>important.</b> Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first adopted in the south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} the game that changed was the {{lowering}} of {{the height of the}} net to 6'8" [...] and size of the court to 29'.5" [...] x 58'. The rallies shorted a bit; but the action became faster with power becoming <b>increasingly</b> more <b>important</b> on offensive.|$|R

5|$|Egypt {{became a}} {{province}} of the Roman Empire in 30BC, following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the Roman army, {{under the control of}} a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period. Alexandria became an <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{and tourism}} {{now account for}} much of the area's economy. The rugged natural scenery, sense of isolation, and natural attractions such as Cathedral Caves makes the Catlins a popular {{destination}} for weekend trips by people from Dunedin and Invercargill, the two nearest cities. A large number of cribs (holiday cottages) occur at places such as Jack's Bay and Pounawea. Ecotourism is becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> to the area's economy, with many of the visitors coming from overseas. Tourism added an estimated $2.4 million to the region's economy in 2003.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th century on, the {{crossbow}} (called , tzangra in Greek) became <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> in Mediterranean warfare, remaining {{the most}} deadly weapon available until {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made infrequent use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the land walls of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no indication that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.|$|E

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of broad-coverage parsers, quantitative evaluation of parsers becomes <b>increasingly</b> more <b>important.</b> We propose a dependency-based method for evaluating broad-coverage parsers. The method offers several advantages over previous methods {{that are based on}} phrase boundaries. The error count score we propose here is not only more intuitively meaningful than other scores, but also more relevant to semantic interpretation. We will also present an algorithm for transforming constituency trees into dependency trees so that the evaluation method is applicable to both dependency and constituency grammars. Finally, we discuss a set of operations for modifying dependency trees {{that can be used to}} eliminate inconsequential differences among different parse trees and allow us to selectively evaluate different aspects of a parser. 1. Introduction With {{the emergence}} of broad-coverage parsers, quantitative evaluation of parsers becomes <b>increasingly</b> more <b>important.</b> It is generally acc [...] ...|$|R
