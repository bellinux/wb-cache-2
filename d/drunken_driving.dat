40|$|The Great Gatsby {{is filled}} with {{potential}} tort claims, from <b>drunken</b> or reckless <b>driving</b> to assault and battery. In a pivotal passage Nick Carraway, the narrator of The Great Gatsby, judges Daisy and Tom as “careless people,” who “destroy creatures and leave others {{to clean up the}} mess. ” The carelessness, negligence, and recklessness portrayed by Fitzgerald’s characters shows an absence of due care, long regarded as the foundation for tort law. Although there are torts, tortfeasors, and tortious behavior aplenty in The Great Gatsby, the novel is void of even a mention of tort law. Why? The first part of this piece discusses tort law during Gatsby’s decade – the beginning of the “era of automobility” [...] and explains tort law’s absence from the novel: Tort law is absent from The Great Gatsby, in part, because tort law itself was dysfunctional and could not provide meaningful access to the legal system. Tort victims of automobile accidents were largely unable to access legal avenues, and recovery was hindered by a host of rules, prominently the contributory negligence system. The piece then briefly describes a reform movement, led by progressive legal realists, to replace tort recovery for automobile accidents with a no-fault compensation scheme. One consequence of that movement, I suggest, was the loss of tort law’s traditional “moral center,” the idea of the law of torts as a “law of wrongs. ” The second part of the piece then discusses the costs of this change, politically and conceptually, and briefly defends traditional “wrongs” and “justice-based” tort law against compensation-minded reforms. I conclude that while the moralistic tort law of Gatsby’s era expressed plenty of blame for tortfeasors, it failed to hold them accountable, thus contributing to the death of our understanding of the law of tort as a law of wrongs – and only partly and fitfully replaced by compensation schemes...|$|R

40|$|SAMMENDRAG Sjåfører som mistenkes for påvirket kjøring blir i første omgang vurdert av politiet med henblikk på om det kun skal rekvireres alkoholanalyse eller om det også skal tas prøve med hensyn på andre rusmidler (narkotika, medikamenter med ruspotensial) ved Statens rettstoksikologiske institutt (SRI). Rutinemessig vil SRI undersøke det politiet rekvirerer, men prøvene lagres inntil to år etter at de er analysert. Ved supplerende analyse i ettertid kan man således få et mer fullstendig bilde av hva mistenkte, påvirkede bilførere hadde i kroppen da de avga prøve. I den foreliggende undersøkelsen ble 1197 prøver fra februar og {{september}} 1993 analysert på et bredt spekter av andre rusmidler foruten alkohol, uavhengig av hva politiets mistanke hadde vært. Vi fant da at alkohol alene var til stede i 55 % av prøvene, andre rusmidler alene i 16 %, både alkohol og andre rusmidler i 14 %, mens verken alkohol eller andre rusmidler ble påvist i 15 % av prøvene. Politiets mistanke med hensyn til alkoholpåvirkning ble bekreftet av analyseresultatene i 71 % av tilfellene, og mistanke om forekomst av andre rusmidler i 58 % av tilfellene. Tidligere studier og denne undersøkelsen viste at bilførere som mistenkes for påvirket kjøring synes å representere en gruppe med storbruk av alkohol og misbruk av andre stoff. Beylich K-M, Christophersen AS, Skurtveit S, Bjørneboe A, Mørland J.   Frequency {{of different}} drugs in     ENGLISH SUMMARY Drivers apprehended under the suspicion of <b>drunken</b> or drugged <b>driving</b> are primarily {{evaluated by the}} police with regard to whether alcohol or drugs should be looked for in the blood samples taken shortly after apprehension. Until March 1996 all blood samples {{were sent to the}} National Institute of Forensic Toxicology (NIFT), for analysis. NIFT routinely perform only those analyses requested, but the samples are stored for up to two years after analysis. By later additional analyses of this material one could obtain a more complete picture of which drugs were present in the drivers at the time of blood sampling. In the present study, 1197 samples collected during February and September 1993, were analyzed for a broad spectrum of drugs in addition to alcohol, regardless of what the suspicion by the police had been. We found that alcohol only was present in 55 per cent of the samples, drugs only in 16 per cent, both alcohol and drugs in 14 per cent, while neither alcohol nor drugs were present in 15 per cent of the samples. Drugs were detected more frequently in samples which did not contain alcohol (in 64 per cent of the samples), while the frequency of detection was from 18 to 25 per cent in samples where alcohol was present. In the majority of the samples with drugs present, alcohol and/or another drug was present too. The suspicion by the police with respect to alcohol influence was confirmed in 71 per cent of cases, and the suspicion of the presence of other drugs was verified in 58 per cent of cases. Earlier studies and the present demonstrated that drivers suspected for drunken/ drugged driving represent a group with heavy drinking and drug abuse.

25|$|In 2010, an ex-foster {{child was}} awarded $30 million by jury trial in California (Santa Clara County) for sexual abuse damages that {{happened}} to him in his foster home from 1995 to 1999. The foster parent, John Jackson, was licensed by the state, {{despite the fact that}} he abused his own wife and son, overdosed on drugs and was arrested for <b>drunken</b> <b>driving.</b> In 2006, Jackson was convicted in Santa Clara County of nine counts of lewd or lascivious acts on a child by force, violence, duress, menace and fear, and seven counts of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14, according to the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office. The sex acts that he forced the children in his foster care to perform sent him to prison for 220 years. Later in 2010, Giarretto Institute, the private foster family agency responsible for licensing and monitoring Jackson's foster home and others, was also found to be negligent and liable for 75 percent of the abuse that was inflicted on the victim, and Jackson himself was liable for the rest.|$|E
25|$|On August 27, 2009, Gillispie {{was arrested}} at 2:45am in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky for driving under the influence. A {{passenger}} in the 2009 Mercedes Benz C300, Charles O'Connor, {{was arrested and charged}} with alcohol intoxication. According to the police report, an officer saw the vehicle swerving and stopped the driver. The officers who were at the scene smelled a strong odor of alcohol, describing Gillispie's eyes as being red and glassy, with his speech slurred. When asked about his proof of insurance, Gillispie stated that it was in a golf bag in his trunk. He then refused a blood test and a breathalyzer on the scene and was subsequently arrested and taken to the Franklin County jail. Gillispie pleaded not guilty. A judge had scheduled a trial for February 10, 2010 in the case. However, on November 2, 2009, Gillispie changed his plea to guilty under a plea agreement. He was fined $1,028 and must complete an alcohol and drug education course before his Kentucky driver's license can be renewed. He has had two prior DUI arrests, the first in 1999 when he was arrested for driving while intoxicated and improper use of a lane in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. He was arrested again in 2003 in his first year at the University of Texas at El Paso on suspicion of <b>drunken</b> <b>driving,</b> although it was later dismissed based on a lack of evidence.|$|E
