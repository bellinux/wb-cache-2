5|$|Directly {{across the}} {{courtyard}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> from the Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay). Built in 1495, this gate leads {{to the court of}} the prayer hall.|$|E
5|$|On August 19, 2017, {{following}} the violent clashes at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, VA, {{the statue of}} Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> to the Duke University Chapel, after having been vandalized by civil rights protesters.|$|E
5|$|Hyde Park is a Grade I-registered major park in Central London. It is {{the largest}} of four Royal Parks that form a chain <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{entrance}}</b> of Kensington Palace through Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, via Hyde Park Corner and Green Park past the main entrance to Buckingham Palace. The park is divided by the Serpentine and the Long Water.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> main <b>entrance</b> at Earlham Road and <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> at Dereham Road and Bowthorpe Road are all {{served by}} bus {{services}} provided by First Norfolk & Suffolk and Konnectbus. They also stop a short distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> at Farrow Road.|$|R
50|$|The West Kennet Avenue, {{an avenue}} of paired stones, leads <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southeastern <b>entrance</b> of <b>the</b> henge; and traces of a second, the Beckhampton Avenue, lead out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> western <b>entrance.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like other Mills Centers, Arizona Mills has {{abstract}} graphics <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrances</b> {{and inside}} <b>the</b> whole mall. Likewise for this mall, numerous artworks are displayed throughout Arizona Mills <b>from</b> <b>the</b> people of Arizona.|$|R
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat roosts {{in caves}} in {{limestone}} hills, far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance.</b> While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, {{with a maximum}} of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.|$|E
5|$|Large {{pieces of}} glass screens and metal {{shoulder}} eaves extend horizontally; {{the station is}} lit and transparent. The specially designed lighting, the clear tempered glass, the insulating glass, and the truss system emphasize {{the functions of the}} space and bring a bright look to the building. The 6-meter tall lobby on the ground floor is connected by the escalators coming up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> hall and the platforms built underground.|$|E
5|$|Large scale protests, demonstrations, {{and other}} gatherings {{directly}} on First Avenue are rare. Some gatherings {{have taken place}} in Ralph Bunche Park, but it is too small to accommodate large demonstrations. The closest location where the New York City Police Department usually allows demonstrators is Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza at 47th Street and First Avenue, one block away from the visitors' entrance, four blocks away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> used by top-level diplomats, and five blocks away from the general staff entrance.|$|E

5|$|On November 16, 2011, the {{production}} received a fine (between $343–$3,440) from the Bulgarian {{environmental protection agency}} for unlawfully removing shrubs and small trees <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of Devetashka Cave. Although permits had been obtained allowing sets {{to be built in}} the area (including a bridge to the cave), environmentalists complained that filming could damage the cave (home to about 40 endangered species). To avoid further problems, the producers agreed not to film explosions, car chases and fires near the cave.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{released}} a DVD counting down the top 50 moments {{in their history}} in 2007, with several moments from Bound for Glory making it on the list. Liger's debut was ranked at number 42, Jeff Hardy's jump <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> stage marked in at number 27, and Rhino winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was ranked at number 21 on the compilation.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match for}} the event {{featured}} Chavo Guerrero defending his ECW Championship against Kane. Kane surprised Chavo by emerging from underneath the ring instead of <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> stage during his ring entrance. Kane instantly pinned Chavo after a chokeslam and won the ECW Championship in eleven seconds. This was the only ECW match on the show.|$|E

5|$|Males sing {{constantly}} as {{the breeding}} period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In {{the presence of}} a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.|$|E
5|$|Originally various {{buildings}} were {{built around the}} curtain wall. Moving clockwise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> to the Inner Court, {{the shape of the}} 12th-century castle chapel can still be made out on the curtain wall. Convention at the time required a chapel to point along a north-east/south-east axis; in order to achieve this, the chapel had to extend out considerably into the bailey, similar to the design at White Castle. The chapel is adjacent {{to the site of the}} first stone hall in the castle, built around 1160; in the 16th and 17th centuries the chapel tower was probably also used as a cannon emplacement.|$|E
5|$|The Eighteenth Dynasty tombs {{within the}} valley vary {{quite a bit}} in decoration, style, and location. It seems that at first there was no fixed plan. The tomb of Hatshepsut has a unique shape, {{twisting}} and turning down over 200metres <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> so that the burial chamber is 97metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and those of Thutmose III and Thutmose IV, KV34 and KV43, are good examples of Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.|$|E

5|$|The Walronds was {{probably}} built in 1605 {{which is the}} date over the hall fireplace. John Peter, a lawyer, acquired the property by marriage into the Paris family and his initials are over the fireplace. The plan is a traditional one with the ground floor hall divided <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> passage by a screen. The main range has three storeys {{and there are two}} wings which are both two storeys high. In the upper south-east room is a barrel shaped ceiling and a second fireplace with the date 1605. The association with the prominent local gentry family of Walrond of Bradfield House only dates from the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they are perceived as three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The three sections of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the three sections are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E
5|$|The present main {{entrance}} to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved courtyard {{at the opposite end}} of the main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, the courtyard is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya; the southwestern end of the courtyard leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly across the courtyard <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> to the Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies the courtyard of the prayer hall.|$|E

5|$|The {{terminal}} {{consists of}} a single building, with an integrated control tower, capable of handling 120passengers per hour. The facade is covered in Russian larch; the focus on wood as a dominant material was common for Norwegian architecture the 1990s, and is also seen at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (opened in 1998) and for the venues of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The terminal was designed by Alta-based architect Solveig Thorsen and is shaped like an aircraft wing, similar to the terminal building at Gardermoen. There is a single gate at the airport, which prior to the installation of security control was 17steps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{had been}} {{extensively}} plundered by tomb robbers during antiquity, yet numerous stone vessels and earthen jars remained. Some {{of the stone}} vessels had copper-coated rims and {{are similar to the}} better known finds from tomb of Khasekhemwy. Vessels from preceding rulers such as Nynetjer and Raneb were also found. Beads and bracelets made of fayence and carnelian and tools made of copper were excavated. Special findings include a silver needle engraved with the name of king Hor Aha and clay seal fragments with the name of king Sekhemib. The two stone stelae <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> common to burial chambers of the First and Second dynasties, are now on display in two different museums.|$|E
5|$|Pellew's {{departure}} for the East Indies was delayed by the Vellore Mutiny in the spring, and instead he sent frigates to reconnoitre {{the situation of}} the Dutch forces in the region. In July, HMS Greyhound under Captain Edward Elphinstone cruised in the Molucca Islands and captured a Dutch convoy at the Action of 26 July 1806 off Celebes. Three months later another frigate, HMS Caroline under Captain Peter Rainier, cruised successfully in the Java Sea and managed to capture a Dutch frigate at the Action of 18 October 1806 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> to Batavia harbour. Shortly before Rainier's engagement, the principal ships of the Dutch squadron, the two ships of the line Pluto and Revolutie, had sailed westwards towards the port of Griessie, Rear-Admiral Hartsinck seeking to divide his forces in preparation for the coming British attack to prevent their complete destruction.|$|E
