40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has been marked}} by cycles of {{excessive}} boom and bust in the housing market. However, not all countries have experienced high volatility in their house prices. Indeed, Germany has been unique in retaining flat price levels over the whole period and failing to respond to any of the macroeconomic shocks. The main reason for this stability can be found in real estate finance and in the existence of a sophisticated rental market. While in other countries monetary stimuli are effectively transmitted to the real economy via the housing market, the German insistence on prudential lending isolates the housing market from financial market distortions. By demanding high deposits, aligning lending to the mortgage lending value instead of the market value and by offering predominantly fixed-rate mortgages, banks reduce the risk of defaults and thus contribute to stability in the market. This system has evolved as a result not of regulations but of a sophisticated rental market which enables households to save their own funds <b>for</b> <b>house</b> <b>purchases.</b> This, in turn, explains the preference for fixed-rate mortgages. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of recent asset price developments in France in the light of analytical research carried out at the Banque de France. Like in many other countries, historically low interest rates have boosted asset price dynamics in France over recent years. The paper attempts to shed light on the main driving factors and assesses, in particular, the role played by "excess liquidity" in shaping current developments. Additional factors related to fierce competition in the French banking sector have also contributed to the upswing in residential property prices, exacerbating households' demand through credit expansion and leading to a sharp and unprecedented increase in household debt, consistent with a financial-accelerator-like mechanism. On several occasions over the past two years, the Banque de France has expressed its concerns about lending <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> <b>purchase</b> and <b>housing</b> price developments, both from a monetary and a financial stability perspective.

40|$|Housing {{loans are}} by far the largest {{liability}} of households, and they make up a large part of bank lending. Housing-related borrowing has implications for the transmission channels through which monetary policy affects financing conditions and, ultimately, real activity and price developments. The article presents the main results of the latest Structural Issue Report compiled at European level, entitled “Housing finance in the euro area”. It analyses the main developments in housing finance in Belgium, compared with those elsewhere in the euro area, over the period from 1999 to 2007, looking at mortgage indebtedness, features of housing loans (including fixed versus variable rate loans, maturity, loan-to-value ratios, redemption schemes, spreads on housing loans) and also at the way in which banks have financed these loans. Households’ debt <b>for</b> <b>house</b> <b>purchase</b> has increased in most euro area countries over recent years. Various factors account for this strong growth, such as lower interest rates, income and population growth and the effects of past deregulation and liberalisation that broadened the scope of both suppliers of mortgage loans and loan products. Moreover, some common trends in the characteristics of housing loans can be observed in the 15 euro area countries, namely a lengthening of maturities, an increase in the loan-to-value ratios and greater flexibility in repayment schedules. However, there are still substantial differences across countries, for instance, as regards the share of variable rate contracts. On the other hand, the funding of housing loans has changed markedly in the euro area over the last decade, with a rapid increase in the issuance of mortgage-covered bonds and securitisation of loans <b>for</b> <b>house</b> <b>purchase.</b> Nevertheless, retail deposits are still the main source of financing for loans. Considerable cross-country diversity in funding sources can still be observed, partly reflecting differences in legislation on new sources of funding, but also differences in consumers’ preferences for safe deposit investment, differences in mortgage demand dynamics and, to some extent, differences in borrowers’ preferences for fixed or variable interest rate loans. The data mostly refer to the situation prevailing {{before the start of the}} turmoil in the summer of 2007. The financial market crisis has had a deep impact on the afore-mentioned developments in the mortgage finance market. Some considerations about the way in which the financial crisis is affecting mortgage markets are given at the end of the paper. For instance, it may actually contribute to reversing the changes in the funding structure of euro area banks, and shifting this structure towards more traditional and less volatile sources of finance. bank lending, mortgage, mortgage markets...|$|E
40|$|Aggregate loan {{development}} typically {{hinges on}} a combination of factors that impact simultaneously on the demand and the supply side of bank lending. The financial turmoil starting in mid- 2007 had detrimental consequences for banks ’ balance-sheets, cost of funds and profitability, thus weighing negatively on their ability to supply new loans. This paper examines the impact of supply constraints on bank lending in the euro area with a special focus on this turmoil period. The empirical evidence presented suggests that banks ’ ability and willingness to supply loans affects overall bank lending activity in general and has done so particularly during the financial crisis. Applying a cross-country panel-econometric approach using a unique confidential data set on results from the Eurosystem’s bank lending survey allows us to disentangle loan supply and demand effects. We find that even when controlling for the effects coming from the demand side loan growth is negatively affected by supply-side constraints. This applies both for loans to households <b>for</b> <b>house</b> <b>purchase</b> and, in particular, for loans to non-financial corporations. We furthermore provide evidence that the impact of supply-side constraints, especially related to disruptions to banks ’ access to wholesale funding and their liquidity positions, was reinforced since the eruption of the financial crisis. 1 Suggestions by Jörg Breitung are gratefully acknowledged.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{consider}} {{a broad range of}} factors, both market based and policy based, which have contributed to the dramatic rise and fall in house prices in Spain between 1997 and the second quarter of 2012. We combine existing theories on drivers of house prices and available data on these drivers in a qualitative analysis. Our findings are then related to several empirical studies conducted by others. Finally, by considering the drivers that are related to government policy, we analyze the influence of the government on the house price development. Our findings suggest that the land on which the Spanish houses were built is the component that increased the most in value between 1997 and 2007. We also suggest that the low rental share in Spain might have contributed to the increase in house prices towards 2008. Important drivers of demand are income, unemployment rates, tax deductions <b>for</b> <b>house</b> <b>purchase</b> and credit growth. However, the most important driver, which explains both the surge in house prices as well as the decline after 2008, is the presence of irrational expectations. Our findings suggest that inconsistent housing policies and a lack of supervision of credit institutions after the entry to the EMU have had a significant effect {{in the creation of the}} Spanish housing bubble. We therefore suggest that the government influence on the house price development between 1997 and 2012 has been substantial...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{estimates}} the saving profiles of Chinese households in 1995 and 2002 and discusses {{possible explanations for}} the high and increasing saving rates among the young and old generation in China. The high saving rate among young and old households relative to mid-aged households has created a u-shaped saving profile. The Chinese saving pattern {{is quite different from}} the pattern observed in most OECD countries where savings tend to increase up to a mid-life age and then decrease. After controlling for employment, education and income, we find that the increase in savings has been especially large among young households. We suggest two potential reasons for the increase: precautionary savings and saving <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> <b>purchases</b> in the presence of credit constraints. First, the period from 1995 to 2002 was related to more income uncertainty and a larger private burden of health expenditures. Second, housing was privatized, which combined with a strong value appreciation on urban real estate, makes it necessary for young households to save more in order to enter the property market. We use the Life Cycle Hypothesis (LCH) to discuss the present features of the Chinese saving profiles. We show that a LCH-model with income uncertainty can explain high saving rates among young households in China. We also introduce a <b>housing</b> <b>purchase</b> to the LCH-model and show that in the presence of credit constraints this can also contribute to high saving rates among young households...|$|R
50|$|Until {{the mid-1970s}} {{mortgages}} were largely unavailable {{for the purchase}} of flats (or large deposits were required with repayments at a high rate of interest). Large numbers of blocks of flats had been built in the 1930s usually on a leasehold basis for 99 years. Individual flats could only be sold on long leases for the remaining sixty or so years. Building societies did not consider this to be sufficient security for a mortgage. Once building societies changed their policies to offer 75% or sometimes larger mortgages at the same rates as paid <b>for</b> those <b>for</b> <b>house</b> <b>purchases,</b> landlords were able to sell flats as they became vacant on long leaseholds. Leases in older blocks with less than twenty years to run were almost impossible to sell.

The CPF investment scheme was introduced in 1986 by the Singapore government in order to enhance CPF members’ funds for retirement. CPF members usually withdraw money <b>for</b> <b>house</b> <b>purchase,</b> while male and high income earners involve in more risky investment with their CPF saving.

Fund management companies with intention to enter the CPF Investment must have at least S 500 million fund managed in Singapore with minimum three fund managers. One of fund managers must have at least 5 year experience in fund management. Moreover, foreign funds recognized by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are allowed to apply for the inclusion of CPF investment scheme, provided that they are a member of the Investment Management Association of Singapore and also have to submit a representative agreement of foreign funds or their mangers.

The surveys are, therefore, very specific in nature and the subjects covered diverse. The Data Archive holds 19 such surveys. Readers are asked to note that, {{with the exception of the}} surveys on the Telephone Service - 69004, 69016, respondents surveyed are self selected from subscribers to the Association's magazine Which? and so the surveys cannot singly be used in descriptive accounts of the British public. Surveys 69005 - 69012 cover various aspects of the housing experiences of Which? readers who moved house in 1967 and 1968. It is here particularly important to remember that the choice strategies and the resources of Which? readers are unlikely to be typical. Main Topics : The loan: date of application; source of loan (including number of lenders approached); type of loan obtained (9 categories); amount borrowed (also represented as a percentage of purchase price); length of loan repayment and interest rate at start of repayment (also whether repayment was fixed or variable). Data include: whether spouse's income was taken into account and whether there were any problems likely to affect application. Subsequent changes affecting repayment of loan are considered in detail (e. g. where interest rate has been increased, where loan has been added to, where there has been a change in personal circumstances etc.). Respondent is asked to assess service received (e. g. easiness of obtaining loan, time that loan took to arrange and whether this delayed property purchase negotiations, satisfaction with service received from staff of lending institution, assessment of overall treatment received etc.).

The basic typology involves the familiar distinction between (i) separation benefit type 2 ̆ 013 fixed sum severance or unemployment-linked 2 ̆ 013 and (ii) financing type 2 ̆ 013 insurance or savings.

Indeed insurance plan performance converges on that of savings plans as the range of insured events and their likelihoods expand.

Conversely the severance properties of pension plans vary with ownership rights (vesting) and "rollover" rules.

40|$|Rising elderly life expectancies {{imply the}} need to {{accumulate}} sufficient savings for retirement. This paper investigates the role of recent changes in the investment menu of the Singaporean Central Provident Fund (CPF) system. Our research explores the investment patterns of CPF participants and articulates their implications for policymakers. We find that most investors use their money <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> <b>purchase</b> and default the remainder to the CPF investment pool. The bulk of non-housing saving sits in bank accounts paying a low return. A fraction of workers does elect outside investment products, with high-income earners and males taking more risk than low-income earners and females. Since workers who default their money to the CPF fund receive a guaranteed 2. 5 % return on the Ordinary Account and 4 % on the Special Account, hurdle rates for money market and equity funds are substantial. These high hurdle rates help explain why few CPF account holders invest outside the default government in-vestment pool, though inertia probably explains why many employees let their funds sit in bank accounts earning low interest rates. More attention could be devoted to lowering fund expenses and commissions, including the myriad of fees, expenses, loads, and wrap charges; it might als...|$|R
