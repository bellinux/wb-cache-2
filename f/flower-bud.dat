There is something hideously wicked and cruel in this lowest depth of imitative infamy. A <b>flower-bud</b> is something so innocent and childlike; and to disguise oneself as such for purposes of murder and rapine argues the final abyss of arachnoid perfidy.

An Indian mantis or praying insect, a little less wicked, though no less cruel than the spiders, deceives the flies who come to his arms under the false pretence of being a quiet leaf, upon which they may light in safety for rest and refreshment. Yet another abandoned member of the same family, relying boldly upon the resources of tropical nature, gets itself up as a complete orchid, the head and fangs being moulded in the exact image of the beautiful blossom, and the arms folding treacherously around the unhappy insect which ventures to seek for honey in its deceptive jaws.|$|E
60|$|Gartner has {{designated}} by this term a peculiar {{condition of the}} anthers in certain plants, {{in which they are}} shrivelled, or become brown and tough, and contain no good pollen. When in this state they exactly resemble the anthers of the most sterile hybrids. Gartner (18/88. 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss' etc. s. 117 et seq.; Kolreuter 'Zweite Fortsetzung' s. 10, 121; 'Dritte Fortsetzung' s. 57. Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' page 355. Wiegmann 'Ueber die Bastarderzeugung' s. 27.), in his discussion on this subject, has shown that plants of many orders are occasionally thus affected; but the Caryophyllaceae and Liliaceae suffer most, and to these orders, I think, the Ericaceae may be added. Contabescence varies in degree, but on the same plant all the flowers are generally affected to nearly the same extent. The anthers are affected at a very early period in the <b>flower-bud,</b> and remain in the same state (with one recorded exception) during the life of the plant. The affection cannot be cured by any change of treatment, and is propagated by layers, cuttings, etc., and perhaps even by seed. In contabescent plants the female organs are seldom affected, or merely become precocious in their development. The cause of this affection is doubtful, and is different in different cases. Until I read Gartner's discussion I attributed it, as apparently did Herbert, to the unnatural treatment of the plants; but its permanence under changed conditions, and the female organs not being affected, seem incompatible with this view. The fact of several endemic plants becoming contabescent in our gardens seems, at first sight, equally incompatible with this view; but Kolreuter believes that this is the result of their transplantation. The contabescent plants of Dianthus and Verbascum, found wild by Wiegmann, grew on a dry and sterile bank. The fact that exotic plants are eminently liable to this affection also seems to show that it is in some manner caused by their unnatural treatment. In some instances, as with Silene, Gartner's view seems the most probable, namely, that it is caused by an inherent tendency in the species to become dioecious. I can add another cause, namely, the illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants, for I have observed seedlings of three species of Primula and of Lythrum salicaria, which had been raised from plants illegitimately fertilised by their own-form pollen, with some or all their anthers in a contabescent state. There is perhaps an additional cause, namely, self-fertilisation; for many plants of Dianthus and Lobelia, which had been raised from self-fertilised seeds, had their anthers in this state; but these instances are not conclusive, as both genera are liable from other causes to this affection.|$|E

60|$|Bud-variation is, also, {{important}} {{under our}} present point of view, in some few cases, as {{when all the}} eyes on the same tuber of the potato, or all the fruit on the same plum-tree, or all the flowers on the same plant, have suddenly varied in the same manner, {{it might be argued}} that the variation had been definitely caused by some change in the conditions to which the plants had been exposed; yet, in other cases, such an admission is extremely difficult. As new characters sometimes appear by bud-variation, which do not occur in the parent-species or in any allied species, we may reject, at least in these cases, the idea that they are due to reversion. Now it is well worth while to reflect maturely on some striking case of bud-variation, for instance that of the peach. This tree has been cultivated by the million {{in various parts of the}} world, has been treated differently, grown on its own roots and grafted on various stocks, planted as a standard, trained against a wall, or under glass; yet each bud of each sub-variety keeps true to its kind. But occasionally, at long intervals of time, a tree in England, or under the widely different climate of Virginia, produces a single bud, and this yields a branch which ever afterwards bears nectarines. Nectarines differ, as every one knows, from peaches in their smoothness, size, and flavour; and the difference is so great that some botanists have maintained that they are specifically distinct. So permanent are the characters thus suddenly acquired, that a nectarine produced by bud-variation has propagated itself by seed. To guard against the supposition that there is some fundamental distinction between bud and seminal variation, it is well to bear in mind that nectarines have likewise been produced from the stone of the peach; and, reversely, peaches from the stone of the nectarine. Now is it possible to conceive external conditions more closely alike than those to which the buds on the same tree are exposed? Yet one bud alone, out of the many thousands borne by the same tree, has suddenly, without any apparent cause, produced a nectarine. But the case is even stronger than this, for the same <b>flower-bud</b> has yielded a fruit, one-half or one-quarter a nectarine, and the other half or three-quarters a peach. Again, seven or eight varieties of the peach have yielded by bud-variation nectarines: the nectarines thus produced, no doubt, differ a little from one another; but still they are nectarines. Of course there must be some cause, internal or external, to excite the peach-bud to change its nature; but I cannot imagine a class of facts better adapted to force on our minds the conviction that what we call the external conditions of life are in many cases quite insignificant in relation to any particular variation, in comparison with the organisation or constitution of the being which varies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The outer {{cell wall}} of the pollen grain (exine) is an {{extremely}} resistant structure containing sporopollenin, a mixed polymer made up of fatty acids and phenolic compounds. The synthesis of sporopollenin in the tapetal cells and its proper deposition on the pollen surface are essential {{for the development of}} viable pollen. The beginning of microsporogenesis and pollen maturation in perennial plants from temperate climates, such as peach, is conditioned by the duration of flower bud dormancy. In order to identify putative genes involved in these processes, we analyzed the results of previous genomic experiments studying the dormancy-dependent gene expression in different peach cultivars. Results The expression of 50 genes induced in flower buds after the endodormancy period (<b>flower-bud</b> late genes) was compared in ten cultivars of peach with different dormancy behaviour. We found two co-expression clusters enriched in putative orthologs of sporopollenin synthesis and deposition factors in Arabidopsis. <b>Flower-bud</b> late genes were transiently expressed in anthers coincidently with microsporogenesis and pollen maturation processes. We postulated the participation of some <b>flower-bud</b> late genes in the sporopollenin synthesis pathway and the transcriptional regulation of late anther development in peach. Conclusions Peach and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana show multiple elements in common within the essential sporopollenin synthesis pathway and gene expression regulatory mechanisms affecting anther development. The transcriptomic analysis of dormancy-released flower buds proved to be an efficient procedure for the identification of anther and pollen development genes in perennial plants showing seasonal dormancy. </p...|$|E

40|$|Summary In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the correlation of}} temperature {{and the effect of}} gibberellin spray on the development of flower-buds in Cryptomeria japonica cultivar Kumotooshi, experiments were done in controlled environmental condition during 1970 - 1971. The following points were observed: 1. The male flower-buds were formed maximum in the temperature range of 25 °C- 30 °C and their formation decreased with the decrease in temperature. On the other hand, the female flower-buds were formed maximum in the temperature range of 20 °C- 25 °C. At 15 °C the both flower-buds were hardly differentiable. At 33 °C, they were differentiated, but soon they changed into leaf buds and chlorosis was observed. 2. Male and female flower-buds were formed even at temperatures lower than the optimum ones when sprayed with gibberellin. 3. The effects of the temperature treatment was most predominant at the early term (May 10 -Jun. 24) of differentiation in both male and female flower-buds. 4. Under alternating temperature condition the male flower-buds were formed maximum when the mean temperature was around 30 °C, and around 20 °C, the female flower-buds were formed maximum. 5. Neither male nor female flower-buds were formed at constant temperature treatment (33 °C) in the whole period (MaySeptember). However, with a short time treatment at 33 °C, the flower-buds were formed in both cases of constant and alternating temperatures. 6. Even at 30 °C, the male flower-buds were formed after the samples were treated at the low temperature (chilling) in winter. This result suggests that chilling as a pretreatment is essential for the <b>flower-bud</b> formation and both adequate temperature and day length conditions can control the <b>flower-bud</b> differe ntiation period...|$|E

The experiment was conducted at the Department of Plant Science, Faculty of Natural Resources, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla Province, from December, 2001 to November, 2002. In the root-pruning trial, twelve 6 -year-old longkong trees were used. Each tree was grown in 1 m 3 soil volume. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design having 4 treatments in 3 replications. The treatments were: (1) control, (2) cutting 1 side 30 cm from the stem at 30 cm depth, (3) cutting 1 side 20 cm from the stem at 30 cm depth, and (4) cutting 2 sides 30 cm from the stem at 30 cm depth. In the limb strangulation experiment, six 6 -year-old longkong trees were used. Again, each tree was grown in 1 m 3 soil volume and the experiment was arranged in a com- pletely randomized design. The treatments were: (1) control, (2) limb strangulation 2 months before bloom, and (3) limb strangulation 1 month before bloom.

60|$|The {{lower and}} naked {{part of the}} sub-peduncle (C) is {{likewise}} slightly sensitive to a rub, and I have seen it bent round a stick and even partly round a leaf with which it had come into contact. That the sub-peduncle has the same nature as the corresponding branch of an ordinary tendril, is well shown when it bears only a few flowers; for {{in this case it}} becomes less branched, increases in length, and gains both in sensitiveness and in the power of spontaneous movement. I have twice seen sub-peduncles which bore from thirty to forty flower- buds, and which had become considerably elongated and were completely wound round sticks, exactly like true tendrils. The whole length of another sub-peduncle, bearing only eleven <b>flower-buds,</b> quickly became curved when slightly rubbed; but even this scanty number of flowers rendered the stalk less sensitive than the other branch, that is, the flower-tendril; for the latter after a lighter rub became curved more quickly and in a greater degree. I have seen a sub-peduncle thickly covered with <b>flower-buds,</b> with one of its higher lateral branchlets bearing from some cause only two buds; and this one branchlet had become much elongated and had spontaneously caught hold of an adjoining twig; in fact, it formed a little sub-tendril. The increasing length of the sub-peduncle (C) with the decreasing number of the <b>flower-buds</b> is a good instance of the law of compensation. In accordance with this same principle, the true tendril as a whole is always longer than the flower-stalk; for instance, on the same plant, the longest flower-stalk (measured {{from the base of the}} common peduncle to the tip of the flower-tendril) was 8.5 inches in length, whilst the longest tendril was nearly double this length, namely 16 inches.|$|R

Most of the studies have focused their attention on fruit growth, whereas no information is available {{about the effect of}} branch autonomy on fruit composition. The aim of this experiment was to study how branch autonomy affects fruit size and quality in nectarine trees. The trial was conducted in 2008, in Eboli (Italy), on ‘Rose Diamond’ nectarine trees grafted on GF 677. The experiment compared four thinning treatments: a control treatment (C) including trees that were commercially fruit-thinned; a <b>flower-bud</b> thinning treatment (BT) applied homogeneously in all the canopy; a bud-thinning treatment where all the flower-buds of {{the top half of the}} canopy were removed, whereas in the bottom canopy layer thinning was applied at fruit stage as in the C treatment (Top-BT); the fourth treatment was similar to Top-BT, with the differences that the bottom layer was completely <b>flower-bud</b> thinned and the top commercially fruit thinned (Bottom-BT). Crop load in each canopy layer was very similar between treatments. BT treatment induced significant increments in fruit fresh weight at harvest in both canopy layers and in soluble solids content (SSC) only in the bottom layer compared to the C. Interestingly, fruit size (in both canopy layers) and SSC (only in the bottom canopy layer) was higher in Bottom-BT and Top-BT trees compared to BT trees. The a* coordinate of the fruit skin cover color decreased slightly in thinned trees compared to control. Skin ground color and flesh firmness were very similar in Bottom-BT, Top-BT, and C trees. These results suggest that branch autonomy is only partial and carbon can move along relatively short pathways from canopy layers where demand for carbon is lower to layers where the demand is higher. These effects depended on the measured parameters and the canopy layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} to form flower buds in thin-layer explants was studied in flowering plants of several species, cultivars, and lines of Nicotiana differing in {{their response to}} photoperiod. This capacity was found in all biotypes examined and could extend into sepals and corolla. It varied greatly, depending on genotype, source tissue and its developmental stage, and composition of the culture medium, particularly the levels of glucose, auxin, and cytokinin. It was greatest in the two day-neutral plants examined, Samsun tobacco and Nicotiana rustica, where it extended from the inflorescence region down the vegetative stem, in a basipetally decreasing gradient; it was least in the two qualitative photoperiodic plants studied, the long-day plant Nicotiana silvestris and the short-day plant Maryland Mammoth tobacco, the quantitative long-day plant Nicotiana alata and the quantitative short-day plant Nicotiana otophora line 38 -G- 81, where it {{was limited to the}} pedicels (and, in some cases, the sepals). Regardless of the photoperiodic response of the source plants, the response was the same in explants cultured under long and short days.

However, the source plants were all in the flowering stage, and no <b>flower-bud</b> formation can be obtained in explants from strictly vegetative Nicotiana plants.

60|$|It will {{be shown}} in a future chapter that the {{position}} of flowers on {{the summit of the}} axis, and the position of seeds within the capsule, sometimes determine a tendency towards reversion; and this apparently depends on the amount of sap or nutriment which the <b>flower-buds</b> and seeds receive. The position, also, of buds, either on branches or on roots, sometimes determines, as was formerly shown, the transmission of the character proper to the variety, or its reversion to a former state.|$|R

The first one was built in 1576 by the architect John Holl (1512-1594) on the church of the Convent of the Franciscan Sisters of Maria Stern in Augsburg. Usually made of copper sheet, onion domes appear on Catholic churches all over southern Germany, Czech lands, Austria and Sardinia and Northeast Italy. Onion domes were also a favourite of 20th-century Austrian architectural designer Friedensreich Hundertwasser.|$|R
