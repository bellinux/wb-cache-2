In addition, the retardation factor, R{sub f}, in Yucca Mountain tuff with respect to selenium, as the selenite species, was measured under unsaturated conditions. These data were used to determine the feasibility of applying a new unsaturated flow technology (UFA) to further hydrologic studies at Yucca Mountain. The UFA directly measures K({theta}) rapidly in Yucca Mountain tuff and is shown to agree well with traditional methods. Hysteresis does not appear important during this testing. Hydraulic steady-state is achieved fastest during desaturation from a saturated state. Imbibition into dry tuff requires a long time for steady-state to occur because of slow filling of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>porosity</b> which can take a few weeks. The existing UFA is a prototype, and a new design of the next generation UFA is completed that eliminates some of the earlier problems.

40|$|The {{probabilistic}} {{analysis by}} Monte Carlo simulation method (MCSM) for {{the transport of}} nonlinear reactive solutes in a three-dimensional heterogeneous porous medium is a computationally prohibitive task. For linear transport problems, the perturbation-based stochastic finite element method (SFEM) {{has been found to}} be computationally efficient with acceptable accuracy. This provides a motivation to develop the SFEM for the nonlinear reactive solute transport. In the present study, SFEM is developed for the transport of equilibrium nonlinear sorbing solutes, which follow the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm. This method produces a second-order accurate mean and a first-order accurate standard deviation of concentration. In this study, the governing medium propertis viz. hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity, molecular <b>diffusion,</b> <b>porosity,</b> sorption, and decay coefficients are considered to vary randomly in space. The performance of SFEM is compared to MCSM for both one- and three-dimensional transport problems. The mean and the standard deviation of concentration for various test cases obtained with the SFEM compares well for the mild heterogeneity cases (standard deviation of log hydraulic conductivity less than 0. 85) tested. SFEM produces a sharp front for the mean and the standard deviation of concentration while fronts obtained by MCSM are found to be dispersive. The error associated with the results obtained by SFEM is sensitive to the boundary conditions, the size of the domain, and the plume size. For a higher nonlinearity of sorption isotherm, the prediction uncertainty is higher. The pattern of the statistical moments of concentration is similar for cases with different correlation lengths of the parameters...|$|E

40|$|Sorption {{processes}} {{can be used}} {{to study}} different characteristics of coal properties, such as gas content (coalbed methane potential of a deposit), gas <b>diffusion,</b> <b>porosity,</b> internal surface area, etc. Coal microstructure (porosity system) is relevant for gas flow behaviour in coal and, consequently, directly influences gas recovery from the coalbed. This paper addresses the determination of coal porosity (namely micro- and macroporosity) in relation to the molecular size of different gases. Experiments entailed a sorption process, which includes the direct method of determining the ‘‘void volume’’ of samples using different gases (helium, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane). Because gas behaviour depends on pressure and temperature conditions, it is critical, in each case, to know the gas characteristics, especially the compressibility factor. The experimental conditions of the sorption process were as follows: temperature in the bath 35 ºC; sample with moisture equal to or greater than the moisture-holding capacity (MHC), particle size of sample less than 212 mm, and mass ca. 100 g. The present investigation was designed to confirm that when performing measurements of the coal void volume with helium and nitrogen, there are only small and insignificant changes in the volume determinations. Inducing great shrinkage and swelling effects in the coal molecular structure, carbon dioxide leads to ‘‘abnormal’’ negative values in coal void volume calculations, since the rate of sorbed and free gas is very high. In fact, when in contact with the coal structure, carbon dioxide is so strongly retained that the sorbed gas volume is much higher than the free gas volume. However, shrinkage and swelling effects in coal structure induced by carbon dioxide are fully reversible. Methane also induces shrinkage and swelling when in contact with coal molecular structure, but these effects, although smaller than those induced by carbon dioxide, are irreversible and increase the coal volume...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the realm of}} computational modeling of complex multiphysics phenomena in articular cartilage enabled efficient and precise determination of articular cartilage properties. However, still accurate quantification of complicated indentation and diffusion processes tying closely with the inhomogeneity of articular cartilage remains challenging. In the present thesis accurate approaches are proposed to capture the mechanical and physical behavior of articular cartilage as faithfully as possible. Finite element models (FE-models) capable of detecting contact between indenter and cartilage surface are developed and applied to spherical indentation process. To predict mechanical and physical properties of cartilage artificial neural networks (ANN) were used and to guarantee the efficacy of the generated ANN they were trained using simulated noisy force-time data. The combination of FE-model and ANN trained with noisy data allowed obtaining cartilage properties robustly. FE-models taking the inhomogeneity of articular cartilage into account were developed and validated and applied to capture neutral (biphasicsolute model) and charged (multiphasic model) solute transfer across articular cartilage in a finite bath experimental setup. Those models could capture the behavior of solute diffusion across cartilage and provide diffusivities and fixed charge densities (FCD) of different cartilage zones. An algorithm consisting of inverse and forward ANNs was developed to obtain the diffusivities of cartilage layers which eliminates the need for computational expertise. The final goal of this algorithm is to introduce a methodology by which properties of cartilage can be determined without any need for computational expertise, which provides a promising opportunity to meet the needs for clinics when it comes to assess the healthiness of articular cartilage during osteoarthritis progression. Effects of bath osmolarity, concentration and charge of solute were investigated using a combination of micro-CT experiments and FE-models. The results suggested that solute charge unlike the osmoalrity and solute concentration {{had a profound effect on}} solute <b>diffusion.</b> <b>Porosity</b> and thickness of subchondral plate were identified as two primary factors affecting the diffusion of neutral solutes across subchondral plate. Using a developed multi-zone biphasic-solute model allowed obtaining the diffusivities of cartilage layers as well as subchondral plate. Using a multi-zone biphasic-solute model, we found that overlying bath size, bath stirring and thickness of the formed stagnant layer can substantially influence the diffusion across cartilage. This provides an opportunity to optimally design diffusion experiments. Biomaterials & Tissue Biomechanic...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStabilization and {{solidification}} {{of hazardous}} waste before storage in an engineered landfill has been used at an industrial scale for more than 10 years in several European countries. The European decision 2003 / 33 specifies a waste acceptance criteria (WAC) for granular waste {{but there is still}} no common rules for monolithic waste. One alternative is to define WAC from reverse environmental impact calculations based on compliance of the storage site release with drinkable water criteria at the local water table. However - and contrarily to reactive transport modeling - most published studies do {{not take into account the}} physical-chemical processes taking place in the waste and the liners, as well as their long-term evolution with time. Such a simplification can lead to very low acceptance criteria, especially for salts. Chloride and sulfates salts are the major species in air pollution control (APC) residues, which represent the majority of treated waste in France and the Netherlands. A model of the stabilized waste material was set on total element content, mineralogy and physical parameters (<b>diffusion,</b> <b>porosity,</b> density). In a first stage, the model was validated on dynamic leaching tests by modeling element release and mineralogical evolution of leached monoliths. The model was also used to simulate a French compliance leaching test. Modeling is in good agreement with experiment in both cases. These results show that limit values defined by European decision on chloride and total dissolved solid (TDS) are not equivalent. For the studied sample, chloride release is very close to the European limit (25 000 mg/kg) while TDS release is well below the European limit (10 %). In a second stage, the model was extended to assess the impact of landfilling stabilized waste on groundwater resources. Modeling hypotheses were similar to the scenario of the European Technical Application Committee (TAC) prescribed for defining acceptance criteria on granular waste, i. e. assuming a complete failure of the geomembranes, a defective drainage system and no effect of the cover slope. The evolution of the waste chemistry and the migration of the pollutant plume were modeled for undamaged monoliths in agreement with recent studies based on the examination of aged site samples. Chloride content in the water table at the point of compliance infinite source term, which is physically impossible as the waste cannot release more chloride than it contains. Chlorides were then assumed to be present in very mobile phases or partly trapped as less soluble Friedel's salts (a chloroaluminate cement phase). Chloride concentrations at POC are below the drinkable water thresholds in both cases, and systematically lower when chlorides are trapped as Friedel's salts. This reactive transport modeling study shows that landfill of monoliths as presently managed should have a negligible impact on the water table. This coupled model is also important for bridging the gap between compliance tests and field conditions. Field modeling is consistent with WAC based on a short monolithic leaching test and the existing TDS limit. Therefore, it is likely that no stricter WAC will need to be defined on salt release for monolithic waste...|$|E

40|$|Why NMR? Because {{it is so}} {{informative}} for so {{many different}} types of applications. Since the discovery of the basic phenomenon in 1945, the field of NMR was continuously growing. NMR spectroscopy and relaxometry are powerful analytical techniques in material science and biochemistry. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a huge impact on the medical field, mentioning the non-invasive behaviour and the achievement of high spatial resolution. This work tries to emphasise three aspects for which NMR is nowadays considered unique: molecular transport, molecular dynamics, and molecular order. There is no other technique that can provide information about the translational diffusion in liquids, the type and timescale of slow molecular motion in solids as well as about the molecular order, at the same time. In this thesis, molecular transport in liquid samples is studied in terms of susceptibility induced magnetic field inhomogeneities and spectral distortions for interdiffusion in binary mixtures. Molecular order and dynamics are topics for two different soft solids, natural rubber and polyurethane. Going from extremely high homogeneity of the field required in liquid state NMR, through the microscopic world of solid state NMR, this work comes to the end with some recent ideas of more homogeneous low field devices and new magnet designs. Diffusion of liquids is an intense field of research, due to the necessity to understand the separation processes and molecular interactions. While the self-diffusion coefficients can be measured with high precision, the concentration profiles and the interdiffusion coefficients in mixtures encounter some difficulties. Therefore, the influence of the mixture heterogeneity on the magnetic field homogeneity was investigated in terms of a spatial and time-dependent magnetic susceptibility. The effect of the heterogeneous distribution of magnetic susceptibility in liquid mixtures on the static and rf field homogeneity was simulated together with the corresponding spectral distortions. The results are promising and open the way to an elaborated method to correct the apparent concentration profile in multi-component mixtures. From another point of view, the problem of low magnetic field homogeneity provided by the Halbach type of magnets is discussed. The design of modified Halbach magnets is studied in order to increase the field homogeneity. The work was focused on two types of Halbach magnets, consisting of 16 and 24 magnet blocks, respectively. Different modifications were applied to these magnet designs, and the field homogeneity was significantly improved. The new magnets were built and are in use for different purposes such as <b>diffusion,</b> <b>porosity</b> determination, imaging, and measurements of relaxation dispersion. This relatively new generation of low field NMR magnets opens new perspectives for portable NMR. The changes induced in molecular dynamics and order in stretched elastomers was investigated using multispin moments edited by multiple-quantum NMR. The main purpose of this part is to investigate the changes in proton residual dipolar coupling and the sensitivity of multiple quantum coherences of higher order for cross-linked natural rubber under uniaxial deformation. The effect of uniaxial deformation of a natural rubber band was investigated by measurements of second van Vleck moments and fourth moments edited by double-quantum and triple-quantum coherences, respectively. These results can be applied to compare 1 H residual moments edited by double-quantum and triple-quantum experiments with those measured by other NMR methods. A spin diffusion experiment was employed for the elucidation of the morphology and domain sizes of a series of polyurethane samples. A proton DQ dipolar filer was used to select the magnetization of the rigid phase. The most probable morphology is three-dimensional for the TPU samples with a high content in HS as was established by a combination between the equilibrium magnetizations and the domain size ratios obtained from simulations of the spin-diffusion process using 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D solutions of the spin-diffusion equations. The correlation between macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic properties of the TPU samples was also discussed. A semi-quantitative model was developed to explain the functional dependence of the residual second van Vleck moment on the effective volume of the hard segments...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{flow and}} solute {{transport}} problem in porous media {{are affected by}} uncertainty inbuilt both in boundary conditions and spatial variability in system parameters. The experimental investigation reveals that the parameters may vary in various scales by several orders. These affect the solute plume characteristics in field-scale problem and cause uncertainty in the prediction of concentration. The main focus of the present thesis is to analyze the probabilistic behavior of solute concentration in three dimensional(3 -D) heterogeneous porous media. The framework for the probabilistic analysis has been developed using perturbation approach for both spectral based analytical and finite element based numerical method. The results of the probabilistic analysis are presented either in terms of solute plume characteristics or prediction uncertainty of the concentration. After providing a brief introduction {{on the role of}} stochastic analysis in subsurface hydrology in chapter 1, a detailed review of the literature is presented to establish the existing state-of-art in the research on the probabilistic analysis of flow and transport in simple and complex heterogeneous porous media in chapter 2. The literature review is mainly focused on the methods of solution of the stochastic differential equation. Perturbation based spectral method is often used for probabilistic analysis of flow and solute transport problem. Using this analytical method a nonlocal equation is solved to derive the expression of the spatial plume moments. The spatial plume moments represent the solute movement, spreading in an average sense. In chapter 3 of the present thesis, local dispersivity if also assumed to be random space function along with hydraulic conductivity. For various correlation coefficients of the random parameters, the results in terms of the field scale effective dispersivity are presented to demonstrate the effect of local dispersivity variation in space. The randomness of local dispersivity is found to reduce the effective fields scale dispersivity. The transverse effective macrodispersivity is affected more than the longitudinal effective macrodispersivity due to random spatial variation of local dispersivity. The reduction in effective field scale longitudinal dispersivity is more for positive correlation coefficient. The applicability of the analytical method, which is discussed in earlier chapter, is limited to the simple boundary conditions. The solution by spectral method in terms of statistical moments of concentration as a function of space and time, require higher dimensional integration. Perturbation based stochastic finite element method(SFEM) is an alternative method for performing probabilistic analysis of concentration. The use of this numerical method for performing probabilistic analysis of concentration. The use of this numerical method is non common in the literature of stochastic subsurface hydrology. The perturbation based SFEM which uses FEM for spatial discretization of the steady state flow and Laplace transform for the solute transport equation, is developed in chapter 4. The SFEM is formulated using Taylor series of the dependent variable upto second-order term. This results in second-order accurate mean and first-order accurate standard deviation of concentration. In this study the governing medium properties viz. hydraulic Conductivity, dispersivity, molecular <b>diffusion,</b> <b>porosity,</b> sorption coefficient and decay coefficient are considered to vary randomly in space. The accuracy of results and computational efficiency of the SFEM are compared with Monte Carle Simulation method(MCSM) for both I-D and 3 -D problems. The comparison of results obtained hby SFEM and MCSM indicates that SFEM is capable in providing reasonably accurate mean and standard deviation of concentration. The Laplace transform based SFEM is simpler and advantageous since it does not require any stability criteria for choosing the time step. However it is not applicable for nonlinear transport problems as well as unsteady flow conditions. In this situation, finite difference method is adopted for the time discretization. The first part of the Chapter 5, deals with the formulation of time domain SFEM for the linear solute transport problem. Later the SFEM is extended for a problem which involve uncertainty of both system parameters and boundary/source conditions. For the flow problem, the randomness in the boundary condition is attributed by the random spatial variation of recharge {{at the top of the}} domain. The random recharge is modeled using mean, standard deviation and 2 -D spatial correlation function. It is observed that even for the deterministic recharge case, the behavior of prediction uncertainty of concentration in the space is affected significantly due to the variation of flow field. When the effect of randomness of recharge condition is included, the standard deviation of concentration increases further. For solute transport, the concentration input at the source is modeled as a time varying random process. Two types of random source at the source is modeled as a time varying random process. Two types of random source condition are considered, firstly the amount of solute mass released at uniform time interval is random and secondly the source is treated as a Poission process. For the case of multiple random mass releases, the stochastic response function due to stochastic system is obtained by using SFEM. Comparing the results for the two type of random sources, it sis found that the prediction uncertainty is more when it is modeled as a Poisson process. The probabilistic analysis of nonlinear solute transport problem using MCSM is often requires large computational cost. The formulation of the alternative efficient method, SFEM, for nonlinear solute transport problem is presented in chapter 6. A general Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm is considered to model the equilibrium mass transfer between aqueous and sorbed phase. In the SFEM formulation, which uses the Taylor Series expansion, the zeroth-order derivatives of concentration are obtained by solving nonlinear algebraic equation. The higher order derivatives are obtained by solving linear equation. During transport, the nonlinear sorbing solutes is characterized by sharp solute fronts with a traveling wave behavior. Due to this the prediction uncertainty is significantly higher. The comparison of accuracy and computational efficiency of SFEM with MCSM for I-D and 3 -D problems, reveals that the performance of SFEM for nonlinear problem is good and similar to the linear problem. In Chapter 7, the nonlinear SFEM is extended for probabilistic analysis of biodegrading solute, which is modeled by a set of PDEs coupled with nonlinear Monod type source/sink terms. In this study the biodegradation problem involves a single solute by a single class of microorganisms coupled with dynamic microbial growth is attempted using this methods. The temporal behavior of mean and standard deviation of substrate concentration are not monotonic, they show peaks before reaching lower steady state value. A comparison between the SFEM and MCSM for the mean and standard deviation of concentration is made for various stochastic cases of the I-D problem. In most of the cases the results compare reasonably well. The analysis of probabilistic behavior of substrate concentration for different correlation coefficient between the physical parameters(hydraulic conductivity, porosity, dispersivity and diffusion coefficient) and the biological parameters(maximum substrate utilization rate and the coefficient of cell decay) is performed. It is observed that the positive correlation between the two sets of parameters results in a lower mean and significantly higher standard deviation of substrate concentration. In the previous chapters, the stochastic analysis pertaining to the prediction uncertainty of concentration has been presented for simple problem where the system parameters are modeled as statistically homogeneous random. The experimental investigations in a small watershed, point towards a complex in geological substratum. It has been observed through the 2 -D electrical resistivity imaging that the interface between the layers of high conductive weathered zone and low conductive clay is very irregular and complex in nature. In chapter 8 a theoretical model based on stochastic approach is developed to stimulate the complex geological structure of the weathered zone, using the 2 -D electrical image. The statistical parameters of hydraulic conductivity field are estimated using the data obtained from the Magnetic Resonance Sounding(MRS) method. Due to the large complexity in the distribution of weathered zone, the stochastic analysis of seepage flux has been carried out by using MCSM. A batter characterization of the domain based on sufficient experimental data and suitable model of the random conductivity field may help to use the efficient SFEM. The flow domain is modeled as (i) an unstructured random field consisting of a single material with spatial heterogeneity, and (ii) a structured random field using 2 -D electrical imaging which is composed of two layers of different heterogeneous random hydraulic properties. The simulations show that the prediction uncertainty of seepage flux is comparatively less when structured modeling framework is used rather than the unstructured modeling. At the end, in chapter 9 the important conclusions drawn from various chapters are summarized...|$|E

Data from four boreholes in two different clay formations are analyzed. Cross-validation is used to estimate the relevance of the different types of secondary data. The flow and transport parameters (hydraulic conductivity, diffusion coefficient and <b>diffusion</b> accessible <b>porosity)</b> are first estimated by kriging using primary information only and then estimated by co-kriging using primary information and one type of secondary information (grain size, gamma ray and resistivity). The kriging residuals, i. e. the difference between the estimated and the measuredvalues, of the different kriging and co-kriging variants are compared to evaluate the relevance of each type of secondary information. This analysis shows that in the different clays and the different boreholes, different types of secondary information result in the largest improvement of the estimates of the flow and transport parameters. It is not possible to determine the "best" type of secondary information for improving the estimation of the flow and transport parameters of low-permeability media. This probably depends on local factors such as the quality of the loggings and the amount of nearby primary and secondary data...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of concrete durability increases since RC (Reinforced Concrete) structures undergo degradation due to aggressive environmental conditions, which affects structural safety and serviceability. Steel corrosion {{is the major}} cause for the unexpected failure of RC structures. The main cause for the corrosion initiation is the ingress of chloride ions prevailing in the environment. Hence quantitative evaluation of chloride diffusion becomes very important to obtain a chloride diffusion coefficient and resistance to chloride ion intrusion. In the present investigation, 15 mix proportions with 3 water-to-binder ratios (0. 37, 0. 42, and 0. 47) and 3 replacement ratios (0, 30, and 50 %) were prepared for HPC (high-performance concrete) with fly-ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag. Chloride diffusion coefficient was measured under nonstationary condition. In order to evaluate the microstructure characteristics, porosity through MIP was also measured. The results of compressive strength, chloride <b>diffusion,</b> and <b>porosity</b> are compared with electrical charges.

40|$|Most {{studies that}} {{incorporate}} subsurface heterogeneity in groundwater flow and transport models only analyze and simulate the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity. Heterogeneity {{of the other}} flow and transport parameters are usually neglected. This approach is often justified, but there are, however, cases in which disregarding the heterogeneity of the other flow and transport parameters can be questionable. In low permeability media, for instance, diffusion is often the dominant transport mechanism. It therefore seems logical to incorporate the spatial variability of the diffusion parameters in the transport model. This study therefore analyses and simulates the spatial variability of the effective diffusion coefficient and the <b>diffusion</b> accessible <b>porosity</b> with geostatistical techniques and incorporates their heterogeneity in the transport model of a low permeability formation. The formation studied was Boom clay (Belgium), a candidate host rock for the deep geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The calculated output radionuclide fluxes of this model are compared with the fluxes calculated with a homogeneous model and a model with a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distribution. This analysis shows that the heterogeneity of the diffusion parameters has a much larger effect on the calculated output radionuclide fluxes than the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity in the low permeability medium under study.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for numerically calculating the concentration profiles of both solid calcium and total chloride ions (Cl−) in concrete {{in contact with}} 3 % (0. 5 mol/l) sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. Since the diffusion of ions present in the pore solution is a primary controlling factor, the application of mutual diffusion coefficients of corresponding ions that {{are influenced by the}} concentration of other coexisting ions is proposed. The method of calculation is based on the generalized form of Fick's First Law suggested by Onsager, which is composed of the Onsager phenomenological coefficient and the thermodynamic force between ions, which occurs according to the gradient of electrochemical potential in a multicomponent concentrated solution for the pore solution. In addition, the chemical equilibrium for Ca(OH) 2 dissolution and C-S-H decalcification are also modeled and coupled with <b>diffusion.</b> Increased <b>porosity</b> due to dissolved Ca 2 + and a chloride binding isotherm are taken into consideration. The concentration profiles of solid calcium and the presence of Friedel's salt in mortar specimens are experimentally identified by the X-ray diffraction method (XRD) and the thermal analysis (TG/DTA) as well as the total chloride profile using an acid extraction method after three years of exposure to 0. 5 mol/l NaCl solution.

Salts of zinc and other divalent cations are sometimes co-encapsulated in PLG particles to control the pH or to stabilize encapsulated proteins or peptides. Zinc salts are known to affect pore formation and other processes that may lead to the release of an encapsulated drug. In this study the effect of encapsulated zinc acetate on protein diffusion through PLG films was investigated. PLG films, with and without encapsulated zinc acetate, were degraded in Hepes buffer for different periods of time. The films were subsequently subjected to various kinds of analyses: diffusion properties (using a <b>diffusion</b> cell), <b>porosity</b> (using scanning electron microscopy) and thickness (using light microscopy and an image-analysis program). Encapsulated zinc acetate had a considerable effect and increased the diffusion coefficient of lysozyme through PLG films degraded for 18 days or longer. Films containing zinc acetate became porous, while those without zinc acetate only developed cavities on the surface. Zinc salts may thus be used as release-modifying agents. This effect should be considered when using zinc salts as protein stabilizers or pH neutralizers...|$|R

The values of parameters obtained in this work indicate that ionic conduction and gas-phase transport are two processes significantly influencing the performance of PEMFC air cathodes.

This paper presents development of a 1 D electrochemical model which can be used to predict 18650 lithium-ion cell performance under different operating conditions.

40|$|International audienceDiffusion {{parameters}} for HTO, 36 Cl−, and 125 I− were determined on Upper Toarcian argillite {{samples from the}} Tournemire Underground Research Laboratory (Aveyron, France) using the through diffusion technique. The direction of diffusion was parallel to the bedding plane. The {{purpose of the present}} study was 3 -fold; it was intended (i) to confirm the I− interaction with Upper Toarcian argillite and to verify the effects of initial I− concentration on this affinity, as previously observed by means of radial diffusion experiments, (ii) to highlight any discrepancy between Cl− and I− diffusivity, and (iii) to investigate the effect of an increase of the ionic strength of the solution on the anionic tracers' diffusive behaviour. The results show that the effective diffusion coefficient (De) and <b>diffusion</b> accessible <b>porosity</b> (εa) values obtained with an ionic strength (I. S.) synthetic pore water of 0. 01 eq L− 1 are: De = 2. 35 - 2. 50 × 10 − 11 m 2 s− 1 and εa = 12. 0 - 15. 0 % for HTO, and De = 14. 5 - 15. 5 × 10 − 13 m 2 s− 1 and εa = 2. 5 - 2. 9 % for 36 Cl−. Because of anionic exclusion effects, anions diffuse slower and exhibit smaller <b>diffusion</b> accessible <b>porosities</b> than HTO, taken as a water tracer. The associated effective diffusion coefficient (De) and rock capacity factor (α) obtained for 125 I are: De = 7. 00 - 8. 60 × 10 − 13 m 2 s− 1 and α = 4. 3 - 7. 2 %. Such values make it possible to calculate low 125 I distribution ratios (0. 0057 < RD < 0. 0192 mL g− 1) which confirm the trend indicating that the 125 I rock capacity factor increases with the decrease of the initial I− concentration. Additional through-diffusion experiments were carried out with a higher ionic strength synthetic pore water (I. S. = 0. 11 eq L− 1). No evolution of HTO diffusion parameters was observed. The anionic tracers' effective diffusion coefficient increased by a factor of two but no clear evolution of their accessible porosity was observed. Such a paradox could be related to the particularly small mean pore size of the Upper Toarcian argillite of Tournemire. The most significant finding of this study is the large discrepancy (factor of two) between the values of the effective diffusion coefficient for 125 I and 36 Cl. Whatever the ionic strength of the synthetic solution used, 125 I exhibited De values two times lower than those of 36 Cl. A detailed explanation for this difference cannot be given at present even if a hypothesis based on ion-pairing or on steric-exclusion cannot be excluded. This makes questionable the assumption usually made for quantifying 125 I sorption and postulating that 36 Cl and 125 I would diffuse in the same porosity. In other terms, at Tournemire, 125 I sorption could be more pronounced than previously indicated...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of mass transport parameters {{is necessary for}} overall design and evaluation processes of the waste disposal facilities. The mass transport parameters, such as effective diffusion coefficient, retardation factor and <b>diffusion</b> accessible <b>porosity,</b> are estimated from observed diffusion data by inverse analysis. Recently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm {{has been used to}} develop inverse model for estimating these parameters that alleviated existing limitations in the inverse analysis. However, PSO solver yields different solutions in successive runs because of the stochastic nature of the algorithm and also {{because of the presence of}} multiple optimum solutions. Thus the estimated mean solution from independent runs is significantly different from the best solution. In this paper, two variants of the PSO algorithms are proposed to improve the performance of the inverse analysis. The proposed algorithms use perturbation equation for the gbest particle to gain information around gbest region on the search space and catfish particles in alternative iterations to improve exploration capabilities. Performance comparison of developed solvers on synthetic test data for two different diffusion problems reveals that one of the proposed solvers, CPPSO, significantly improves overall performance with improved best, worst and mean fitness values. The developed solver is further used to estimate transport parameters from 12 sets of experimentally observed diffusion data obtained from three diffusion problems and compared with published values from the literature. The proposed solver is quick, simple and robust on different diffusion problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{overwhelming}} {{body of evidence}} that certain Staphylococcus aureus strains become more sensitive to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes after their growth in media containing subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin. However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent this phenomenon contributes to the curative effect of penicillin in vivo. To explore its therapeutic relevance, we evaluated the interaction of staphylococci pretreated with penicillin in vitro with leukocytes in cell-proof <b>diffusion</b> chambers (<b>porosity,</b> 0. 22 micron) implanted subcutaneously in rabbits. Under this in vivo environment, staphylococci pretreated with penicillin remained hypersensitive to leukocyte killing as under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, when the staphylococci were mixed with the leukocytes in chambers implanted intraperitoneally in mice which subsequently received intravenously a suboptimal dose of penicillin, they also became hypersensitive to leukocytic killing. However, because the staphylococcal growth rate was considerably reduced in vivo, the degree of penicillin-induced sensitivity to leukocytic killing was smaller than that obtained in test tube cultures; nevertheless, the enhanced killing was significant. Additional support that the curative effect of penicillin partly depends on its synergistic action with the leukocytes was provided by the relative decrease in virulence of staphylococci pretreated with penicillin in mice in which the cellular host defenses were already recruited at the focus of inoculation. These observations indicate that penicillin-induced hypersensitivity of staphylococci to leukocytic killing is not only an in vitro phenomenon, but an effect which has therapeutic relevance...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{flow and}} {{transport}} in low-permeability media {{is very important}} in the context of nuclear waste disposal, oil and gas reservoirs and long term evolution of groundwater systems. In low-permeability media, transport by diffusion is often the most important mass transport process. This study investigates the effect of the heterogeneity of diffusion parameters on mass transport in low-permeability media. A geostatistical approach for integrating heterogeneity of diffusion parameters in groundwater flow and transport models is proposed and applied to the Toarcian argillites in France which are studied in the framework of feasibility of storing radioactive waste in deep clayey massifs. Stochastic fields of the diffusion parameters of the Toarcian argillites (France) are generated based on 64 measured values of diffusion coefficient and <b>diffusion</b> accessible <b>porosity</b> and used as input for a 3 D local-scale groundwater flow and transport model. The chloride concentrations computed by these heterogeneous models are compared to the measured chloride concentrations and to concentrations calculated with a model in which the Toarcian argillites are subdivided into several homogeneous zones. The heterogeneous simulations result in a slightly better correspondence between measured and calculated values and have the additional advantage that the measured diffusion coefficient values in the Toarcian are perfectly honored in the model. This study shows that small-scale variability of diffusion parameters has a significant effect on solute concentrations and omitting this heterogeneity may be a problem in transport calculations in low-permeability media, depending on the specific setting and objectives of the study.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{reliably}} predict flow and transport in fractured porous rock {{is an essential}} condition for performance evaluation of geologic (underground) nuclear waste repositories. In this report, a suite of programs (TRIPOLY code) for calculating and analyzing flow and transport in two-dimensional fracture-matrix systems is used to model single-well injection-withdrawal (SWIW) tracer tests. The SWIW test, a tracer test using one well, is proposed as a useful means of collecting data for site characterization, as well as estimating parameters relevant to tracer diffusion and sorption. After some specific code adaptations, we numerically generated a complex fracture-matrix system for computation of steady-state flow and tracer advection and dispersion in the fracture network, along with solute exchange processes between the fractures and the porous matrix. We then conducted simulations for a hypothetical but workable SWIW test design and completed parameter sensitivity studies on three physical parameters of the rock matrix - namely <b>porosity,</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient, and retardation coefficient - in order to investigate {{their impact on the}} fracture-matrix solute exchange process. Hydraulic fracturing, or hydrofracking, is also modeled in this study, in two different ways: (1) by increasing the hydraulic aperture for flow in existing fractures and (2) by adding a new set of fractures to the field. The results of all these different tests are analyzed by studying the population of matrix blocks, the tracer spatial distribution, and the breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained, while performing mass-balance checks and being careful to avoid some numerical mistakes that could occur. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of matrix effects in the solute transport process, with the sensitivity studies illustrating the increased importance of the matrix in providing a retardation mechanism for radionuclides as matrix <b>porosity,</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient, or retardation coefficient increase. Interestingly, model results before and after hydrofracking are insensitive to adding more fractures, while slightly more sensitive to aperture increase, making SWIW tests a possible means of discriminating between these two potential hydrofracking effects. Finally, we investigate the possibility of inferring relevant information regarding the fracture-matrix system physical parameters from the BTCs obtained during SWIW testing...|$|R
40|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of a CO 2 storage site and {{containment}} of CO 2 in the subsurface, the integrity of wellbore materials must be maintained. Field and laboratory studies have shown CO 2 -induced reactivity of wellbore cement, but these results have to be extrapolated to the extended time span of CO 2 storage. Geochemical modeling provides a tool for the prediction of cement alteration; however, large uncertainties in input parameters exist and signifi cant variation in subsurface conditionsis expected. This asks for a systematic investigation of the sensitivity of modeled cement alteration towards these factors. In this paper we report PHREEQC simulations of CO 2 diffusion into cement and subsequent chemical reactions. The sensitivity of cement alteration toward reaction rates, initial porosity, temperature/mineralogy and fl ow/no fl ow conditions were investigated. The base case model indicated that intact cement and tight interfaces between the reservoir and the cement would yield less than 1 % porosity change after 300 days of <b>diffusion.</b> For <b>porosity</b> increase or degradation to occur at the cement interface, leaching/fl ow along the wellbore was required. The sensitivity scenarios yield CO 2 penetration depths between 0. 3 cm and 1. 4 cm after 300 days of diffusion. The maximum was reached for the high <b>porosity</b> (fast <b>diffusion)</b> scenario that facilitates CO 2 transport through the cement matrix. The minimum CO 2 penetration was for enhanced calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) decalcifi cation, which increases calcite precipitation, CO 2 consumption, and hence decelerates CO 2 penetration.
