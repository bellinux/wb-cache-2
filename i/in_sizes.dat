5|$|Older Macintoshes {{dating from}} 1983 until 1998 {{utilized}} a basic bootloader; the bootloader was solely a ROM chip varying <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> up to 4megabytes (MB), which contained both the computer code to boot {{the computer and}} to run the Mac OS operating system. This {{was known as the}} Macintosh Toolbox, or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from design the modern Macintosh which generally use a hard drive of large capacity to store the operating system. This bootloader was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998.|$|E
5|$|Rocks sampled in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the Lunar Module are mostly vesicular coarse-grained subfloor basalt, with some appearance of fine-grained basalt as well. Much of the valley floor, as displayed in observations of {{the immediate}} landing area, is predominately regolith and fragments varying <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> excavated by several impacts in the Moon's history.|$|E
5|$|Fu: Fu were Chinese tally sticks made of bamboo, wood, metal (gold, silver, bronze) or jade {{and used}} as a proof of authorization. Most commonly, fu were made of wood or bamboo <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> of wooden slips or bamboo chopsticks. Although fu {{have been made in}} various shapes (such as tiger, dragon, turtle, snake, fish or human), most of them come {{in the shape of a}} tiger. Classical {{description}} of tallies is found in the Zhou li, which refers to the tallies of jade and horn, and mentions the shapes of tiger, human, dragon, seal, and banner.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
5|$|For the game's characters, the {{developers}} {{intended to keep}} the comical looks from the previous games, but they decided to update their appearances with realistic materials and textures {{to take advantage of}} the more powerful level of graphics capabilities of seventh-generation consoles. The designers first drew character sketches to determine the characters' looks and clothing, creating a main and an alternate outfit for each character, which were then made into reference artwork. Afterward, low-level meshes for each character were created, with details added with Zbrush, resulting in characters that, before being scaled down for the game environment, had more than six million polygons. Textures and pixel shaders were added using the team's previous work on Tony Hawk's Project 8 to match the style of earlier Guitar Hero games. Unlike the Tony Hawk games, each character in the game was given a unique skeleton to match their variations <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> and shapes, allowing the animators to create unique moves for individual characters. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock introduces three new characters modeled after real-life musicians. Slash, Tom Morello, and Bret Michaels, each performing one or more songs from their past recordings. All three were brought into the game using motion capture from the Motion Analysis Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E

5|$|This {{treatise}} documented a {{wide range}} of pharmaceutical practices, including the use of ephedrine as a drug. It includes valuable information on metallurgy and the steel and iron industries during 11th century China. He created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of mica {{that could be used to}} cure ills through digestion. He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form. Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with copper sulphate. Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants. According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine realgar, its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> ranging from the size of a pea to a walnut.|$|E

25|$|One {{issue that}} complicates finding a {{correctly}} fitting bra is that band and cup sizes are not standardized, but vary considerably from one manufacturer to another, resulting <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> that only provide an approximate fit.

25|$|Goldman Sachs {{is one of}} {{the leading}} M {{advisory}} firms, often topping the Thomson Financial league tables <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> of transactions. The firm gained a reputation as a white knight in the mergers and acquisitions sector by advising clients on how to avoid unfriendly hostile takeovers. During the 1980s, Goldman Sachs was the only major investment bank with a strict policy against helping to initiate a hostile takeover, which increased the firm's reputation immensely among sitting management teams at the time.|$|E
25|$|The size {{distribution}} of the aggregate determines how much binder is required. Aggregate with a very even {{size distribution}} has the biggest gaps whereas adding aggregate with smaller particles tends to fill these gaps. The binder must fill the gaps between the aggregate as well as pasting the surfaces of the aggregate together, and is typically the most expensive component. Thus variation <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> of the aggregate reduces the cost of concrete. The aggregate is nearly always stronger than the binder, so its use does not negatively affect {{the strength of the}} concrete.|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to find conspicuous variations amongst individuals with bare eyes, definite features are unique to each individual. For example, the abdominal spots on males of P. dominula vary <b>in</b> <b>sizes,</b> locations, and patterns. They act as sexually selective signals and also are used to determine social hierarchy within the colonies. Males with smaller, regular patterns of spots were more aggressive and dominant over those that had larger, irregular patterns. Similarly, morphology of females also varies between individuals. The larger and the more scattered the clypeus marks on the foundress are, the higher the chance for her to be dominant over other females.|$|E
