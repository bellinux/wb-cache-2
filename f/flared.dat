40|$|A solar <b>flare</b> {{evolution}} {{prediction model}} has been developed and placed into operations to mitigate flare-related risks to operational systems. The GOES 0. 1 - 0. 8 nm X-ray background flux is first determined and the residual flux is {{used to create a}} <b>flare</b> index value. The <b>flare</b> index is useful for determining the relative characteristics of a <b>flare</b> separate from its back-ground, for comparison with other <b>flares,</b> and for determining <b>flare</b> initiation. Within the first five minutes of <b>flare</b> initiation, the <b>flare</b> evolution model predicts the <b>flare</b> rise, timing and magnitude of the peak fluxes, decay to half maximum, and termination at background levels. Based on the rise time, a <b>flare</b> is quantitatively categorized as small, medium, or large based on the absolute value of the <b>flare</b> index value and this enables the selection of a <b>flare</b> model shape. Using the convolution of Gaussian and quadratic functions for the modeled <b>flare,</b> the integral of the <b>flare</b> area (magnitude and duration) quantifies its integrated energy content which can be related to the <b>flare’s</b> geoeffectiveness.

40|$|It {{is found}} that 22 {{percent of a}} sample of M 1 or greater {{impulsive}} soft X-ray <b>flares</b> were associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed in the Solwind coronagraph.

40|$|When <b>flares</b> {{occur in}} the Sun’s atmosphere, {{electromagnetic}} radiation in all wavelengths is emitted. <b>Flares</b> observed at visible wavelengths are called 2 ̆ 2 white light 2 ̆ 2 <b>flares.</b> Little is known about white light <b>flares</b> since the radiation from the Sun in the visible range greatly outshines what is produced during solar <b>flares.</b> Since white light <b>flares</b> are hard to see, {{it is not clear}} in what part of the solar atmosphere they occur.

5|$|After {{the decline}} of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, {{territorial}} disputes <b>flared</b> up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by VijayadityaII(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of BhimaI (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of BhimaI, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.|$|E

40|$|Chromospheric <b>flares</b> are the footpoints {{of closed}} coronal field lines. In this paper {{different}} <b>flare</b> morphologies from observations are presented, and the implied coronal field configurations above the <b>flaring</b> region are examined. <b>Flares</b> are grouped {{according to the}} number of ribbons, from an unresolved compact point-like <b>flare</b> to four-ribbon <b>flares.</b> Quiet region <b>flares</b> having characteristics of their own are also presented here. It is found that compact, unresolved point-like <b>flares</b> have two distinct footpoints when viewed in offband H-alpha. The footpoints of some of the compact <b>flares</b> also show increased separation as a function of time. Unlike large two-ribbon <b>flares,</b> the ribbons of many small and/or short-lived two-ribbon <b>flares</b> usually have no measurable separation of ribbons. Multiple-ribbon (three or more ribbon) <b>flares</b> consists of two or more pairs of two-ribbons, or two or more sets of field lines. Parity of the ribbons in multiple-ribbon <b>flares,</b> or the lack of it, depends on the magnetic makeup of the locale of the ribbons. <b>Flares</b> in old quiet regions resulting from sudden filament eruptions show discrete small patches of emissions reflecting the 'spottiness' of the decayed and dispersed field of the quiet region...|$|R
5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension <b>flared</b> {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not.

On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E

40|$|We aim {{to perform}} a {{statistical}} study of stellar <b>flares</b> observed by Kepler. We want to study the <b>flare</b> amplitude, duration, energy and occurrence rates, {{and how they are}} related to the spectral type and rotation period. To that end, we have developed an automated <b>flare</b> detection and characterisation algorithm. We have harvested the stellar parameters from the Kepler input catalogue and the rotation periods from McQuillan et al. (2014). We find several new candidate A stars showing <b>flaring</b> activity. Moreover, we find 653 giants with <b>flares.</b> From the statistical distribution of <b>flare</b> properties, we find that the <b>flare</b> amplitude distribution has a similar behaviour between F+G-types and K+M-types. The <b>flare</b> duration and <b>flare</b> energy seem to be grouped between G+K+M-types vs. F-types and giants. We also detect a tail of stars with high <b>flare</b> occurrence rates across all spectral types (but most prominent in the late spectral types), and this is compatible with the existence of "flare stars". Finally, we have found a strong correlation of the <b>flare</b> occurrence rate and the <b>flare</b> amplitude with the stellar rotation period: a quickly rotating star is more likely to <b>flare</b> often, and has a higher chance to generate large <b>flares...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{campaign}} to observe <b>flares</b> on the M dwarf <b>flare</b> star EV Lacertae over the course of two days in 2001 September, utilizing a combination of radio continuum, optical photometric and spectroscopic, ultraviolet spectroscopic, and X-ray spectroscopic observations, to characterize the multi-wavelength nature of <b>flares</b> from this active, single late-type star. We find <b>flares</b> in every wavelength region in which we observed. In the multi-wavelength context, the start of the intense radio <b>flare</b> is coincident with an impulsive optical U-band <b>flare,</b> to within one minute, and yet there is no signature of an X-ray response. There are other intervals of time where optical <b>flaring</b> and UV <b>flaring</b> is occurring, but these cannot be related to the contemporaneous X-ray flaring: the time-integrated luminosities do not match the instantaneous X-ray <b>flare</b> luminosity, as one would expect for the Neupert effect. We investigate the probability of chance occurrences of <b>flares</b> from disparate wavelength regions producing temporal coincidences, but find that not all the <b>flare</b> associations can be explained by a superposition of <b>flares</b> due to a high <b>flaring</b> rate.

40|$|Equipment Description <b>Flares</b> {{are used}} to ignite areas {{remotely}} that are not easily accessible on foot. When used with a <b>flare</b> launcher in a <b>flare</b> system, the point of ignition can be 300 feet away. One of the two basic types of <b>flare</b> systems uses a <b>flare</b> launcher that breaks open so a self-contained cartridge similar to a shotgun shell can be loaded (figure 4 – 1). The cartridge contains the <b>flare</b> and the powder to propel it. The <b>flare</b> launcher is typically cast aluminum or plastic. The <b>flare</b> launcher is opened and a cartridge is inserted into the launcher. The launcher is pointed toward the area to be burned and the operator pulls the trigger, igniting the powder Interagency Ground Ignition Guide and launching the <b>flare.</b> These <b>flare</b> launchers typically {{range in size from}} 12 gauge to 25 millimeters. A second type of <b>flare</b> system (figure 4 – 2) has a launcher with separate cartridges (also known as blanks or power loads) to propel the <b>flare.</b> The cartridges are loaded into a cylinder that is installed in the launcher. Each cylinder holds nine cartridges. A <b>flare</b> is loaded into the barrel, the launcher is pointed in the desired direction, and the trigger is pulled. The cartridge fires, ignites the <b>flare,</b> and propels it to the area to be burned. Up to nine <b>flares</b> may be fired before the cylinder must be removed and reloaded with new cartridges.
