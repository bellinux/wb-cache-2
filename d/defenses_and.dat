5|$|Plant {{defenses}} can {{be classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive defenses are always present in the plant, while induced defenses are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive <b>defenses</b> <b>and</b> these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical <b>defenses</b> <b>and</b> large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize.

5|$|As the German Sixth Army was encircled in Stalingrad, the Red Army {{undertook}} {{a series of}} wider attacks against the rest of Army Group South.

The Soviet victories caused participating Soviet units to over-extend themselves. Freed on 2 February by the surrender of the German Sixth Army the Red Army's Central Front turned its attention west and on 25 February expanded its offensive against both Army Group South and Army Group Center. Months of continuous operations, however, had taken a heavy toll on the Soviet forces and some divisions were reduced to 1,000–2,000 combat effective soldiers.

5|$|Constantinople {{began to}} decline {{continuously}} {{after the end of}} the reign of Basil II in 1025.

The city subsequently became the center of the Latin Empire, created by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. Hagia Sophia was converted to a Catholic church in 1204. The Byzantine Empire was restored, albeit weakened, in 1261. Constantinople's churches, <b>defenses,</b> <b>and</b> basic services were in disrepair, and its population had dwindled to a hundred thousand from half a million during the 8th century.
