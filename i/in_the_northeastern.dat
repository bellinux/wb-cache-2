5|$|Hurricane Sandra was the latest-forming major {{hurricane}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>northeastern</b> Pacific basin, {{the strongest}} November Pacific hurricane on record, {{and the record}} eleventh major hurricane of the 2015 season. Originating from a tropical wave, Sandra was first classified as a tropical depression on November23 well south of Mexico. Environmental conditions, including high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, were highly conducive to intensification and the storm quickly organized. A small central dense overcast developed atop the storm and Sandra reached hurricane status early on November25 after the consolidation of an eye. Sandra reached its peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 150mph (240km/h) and a pressure of 934mbar (hPa; 27.58inHg) early on November26. This made Sandra the strongest November hurricane on record <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeastern</b> Pacific. Thereafter, increasing shear degraded the hurricane's structure and weakening ensued. Rapid weakening took place on November27 and Sandra's circulation became devoid of convection as it diminished to a tropical storm that evening. The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low soon thereafter and ultimately dissipated just {{off the coast of}} Sinaloa, Mexico, on November29.|$|E
