500|$|... "We Remain" [...] {{was written}} by Ryan Tedder and Brent Kutzle of OneRepublic, and Mikky Ekko. The song is a midtempo arena pop power ballad. It lasts for a {{duration}} of [...] (four minutes). Aguilera sings with [...] "enormous" [...] and [...] "soaring" [...] vocals on a [...] "propulsive Ryan Tedder-ish beat" [...] background. [...] "We Remain" [...] incorporates a smooth piano and drum machine in its instrumentation. According to Billboard magazine, the ballad [...] "finds [...] tamping down [...] for a natural and forceful message of perseverance". At the chorus, Aguilera sings [...] "So burn me with fire/ Drown me with rain/ I'm gonna wake up screaming your name/ Yes I'm a sinner, yes I'm a saint/ whatever <b>happens</b> <b>here,</b> whatever <b>happens</b> <b>here,</b> we remain". Several critics compared [...] "We Remain" [...] to Aguilera's previous hit [...] "Beautiful" [...] (2002) and Alicia Keys' [...] "Girl on Fire" [...] (2012) for musical similarities.|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics. Robbie Daw of Idolator complemented the video {{by saying that}} the [...] "standout track from Doo-Wops & Hooligans, and it’s given an extra sheen thanks to a quirky, unconventional video that doesn’t shy away from the dark tone of the song’s lyrics". Brian Zacher from AXS.com said that the video shares the [...] "greatness" [...] with the previous one, [...] "Just the Way You Are". James Montgomery of MTV News gave a mixed review on the video, in which he said [...] "after all, it would’ve been easy — and expected — to make something slick, sexy and/or saccharine, a glossy thing where he croons from a rooftop somewhere, removes his shirt, and somehow ends up with the girl. None of that <b>happens</b> <b>here.</b> Rather, we see Mars struggling and sweating, being taunted and tempted, falling and rising again... He ends up alone, unloved. He probably gets flattened by a train". On another review by Montgomery, the singer redemption is refereed because Mars [...] "distances himself from his smoove-crooning contemporaries, and he does it simply by being real. Really dramatic, really emotional, really clever. This one’s a winner, even if, at the end of it, Mars has lost everything." ...|$|E

6000|$|We {{were talking}} of this {{the other night}} {{at the house of}} that lady whom Mrs. Makely invited me {{specially}} to meet on Thanksgiving-day. It happened then, as it often <b>happens</b> <b>here,</b> that although I was asked to meet her, I saw very little of her. It was not so bad as it sometimes is, for I have been asked to meet people, very informally, and passed the whole evening with them, and yet not exchanged a word with them. Mrs. Makely really gave me a seat next Mrs. Strange at table, and we had some unimportant conversation; but there was a lively little creature vis-à-vis of me, who had a fancy of addressing me so much of her talk that my acquaintance with. Mrs. Strange rather languished through the dinner, and she went away so soon after the men rejoined the ladies in the drawing-room that I did not speak to her there. I was rather surprised, then, to receive a note from her a few days later, asking me to dinner; and I finally went, I am ashamed to own, more from curiosity than from any other motive. I had been, in the mean time, thoroughly coached concerning her by Mrs. Makely, whom I told of my invitation, and who said, quite frankly, that she wished Mrs. Strange had asked her, too. [...] "But Eveleth Strange wouldn't do that," [...] she explained, [...] "because it would have the effect of paying me back. I'm so glad, on your account, that you're going, for I do want you to know at least one American woman that you can unreservedly approve of; I know you don't begin to approve of me; and I was so vexed that you really had no chance to talk with her that night you met her here; it seemed to me as if she ran away early just to provoke me; and, to tell you the truth, I thought she had taken a dislike to you. I wish I could tell you just what sort of a person she is, but it would be perfectly hopeless, for you haven't got the documents, and you never could get them. I used to be at school with her, and even then she wasn't like any of the other girls. She was always so original, and did things from such a high motive, that afterwards, when we were all settled, I was perfectly thunderstruck at her marrying old Bellington Strange, who was twice her age and had nothing but his money; he was not related to the New York Bellingtons at all, and nobody knows how he got the name; nobody ever heard of the Stranges. In fact, people say that he used to be plain Peter B. Strange till he married Eveleth, and she made him drop the Peter and blossom out in the Bellington, so that he could seem to have a social as well as a financial history. People who dislike her insisted that they were not in the least surprised at her marrying him; that the high-motive business was just her pose; and that she had jumped at the chance of getting him. But I always stuck up for her--and I know that she did it for the sake of her family, who were all as poor as poor, and were dependent on her after her father went to smash in his business. She was always as high-strung and romantic as she could be, but I don't believe that even then she would have taken Mr. Strange if there had been anybody else. I don't suppose any one else ever looked at her, for the young men are pretty sharp nowadays, and are not going to marry girls without a cent, when there are so many rich girls, just as charming every way; you can't expect them to. At any rate, whatever her motive was, she had her reward, for Mr. Strange died within a year of their marriage, and she got all his money. There was no attempt to break the will, for Mr. Strange seemed to be literally of no family; and she's lived quietly on in the house he bought her ever since, except when she's in Europe, and that's about two-thirds of the time. She has her mother with her, and I suppose that her sisters and her cousins and her aunts come in for outdoor aid. She's always helping somebody. They say that's her pose, now; but, if it is, I don't think it's a bad one; and certainly, if she wanted to get married again, there would be no trouble, with her three millions. I advise you to go to her dinner, by all means, Mr. Homos. It will be something worth while, in every way, and perhaps you'll convert her to Altrurianism; she's as hopeful a subject as I know." ...|$|E
