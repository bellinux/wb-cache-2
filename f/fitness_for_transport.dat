40|$|There are {{a number}} of factors {{involved}} in the transport of animals for slaughter in Canada that can potentially affect the welfare implications of transportation. These include <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>transport,</b> animal handling, climatic conditions (including vehicle ventilation) and journey duration. Legislation has been put in place as a means of control of industry practices to protect animal welfare during transport. This thesis examines the law relating to the protection of animal welfare during transport in Canada and assesses the impact of legislation in relation to animal welfare. The deliberations of the Canada Agricultural Review Tribunal in terms of its decisions in cases where they heard an appeal against a Notice Of Violation issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for an infringement of Part XII of the Health of Animals Regulations provided one useful source of data with which to assess the effectiveness of the enforcement of the regulations for the protection of animal welfare during transport in Canada. Welfare issues when transporting poultry for slaughter are prominent. This led to a retrospective observational study of the risk factors when transporting broiler chickens for slaughter in Atlantic Canada. Results indicated that there are numerous interrelated risk factors inherent in the transport process affecting mortality during transit in Canada, with the most prominent being the weather conditions in which animals are transported. A significant interaction between the stocking density and the external temperature during transit was identified in the analysis. The mortality risk was higher in cold weather conditions compared with hot weather conditions. At very cold external temperatures, the mortality risk was reduced at high compared with low crate stocking densities, but it still remained higher than that at warmer temperatures. The stocking densities used by the slaughter plant were within the maximum recommended in the Canadian codes of practice for transport of poultry. Environmental conditions of high temperature and high humidity while at the holding barn, as indicated by an apparent equivalent temperature in the ‘high risk’ zone, resulted in a higher mortality risk than when the AET was in the medium or low risk zones. Keeping birds dry during transport results in lower mortality risk than when birds become wet. Large temperature gradients were recorded between the external temperature and that recorded within the trailer during transit and during the holding barn period, particularly in winter conditions when vehicle ventilation openings were most likely to be closed. This indicates a potential for heat stress to occur, even in winter conditions. Improvements in the monitoring and control of the thermal conditions (hot and cold) within trailers and the holding barn would be beneficial in reducing the mortality risk. During extreme weather conditions, consideration should be given to the ability of the equipment and facilities to provide appropriate conditions for the broilers when making decisions as to whether loading and transportation should be undertaken...|$|E

When borrowed artworks are transported from one museum to another, there are many variables that come into play and careful planning is necessary {{for the safety of the}} object. Specific case studies of several well-known and respected museums that engage in and encourage loans will explore the complex nature of lending policies, their effect on the condition of artworks and their significance and impact on the museum world. This thesis culminates in an analysis of the loan <b>fitness</b> and possibility <b>for</b> <b>transport</b> of Joachim Beich’s Untitled, a painting in the Scripps College collection...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{networks}} serve critical {{functions in}} biological and engineered systems, and yet their design requires trade-offs between competing objectives. Due to their sessile lifestyle, plants need to optimize their architecture to efficiently acquire and distribute resources while also minimizing costs in building infrastructure. To understand how plants resolve this design trade-off, we used high-precision three-dimensional laser scanning {{to map the}} architectures of tomato, tobacco, or sorghum plants grown in several environmental conditions and through multiple developmental time points, scanning in total 505 architectures from 37 plants. Using a graph-theoretic algorithm that we developed to evaluate design strategies, we find that plant architectures lie along the Pareto front between two simple length-based objectives-minimizing total branch length and minimizing nutrient transport distance-thereby conferring a selective <b>fitness</b> advantage <b>for</b> plant <b>transport</b> processes. The location along the Pareto front can distinguish among species and conditions, suggesting that during evolution, natural selection may employ common network design principles despite different optimization trade-offs...|$|R

40|$|Background. Evidence now {{suggests}} {{that work is}} generally good for {{physical and mental health}} and well-being. Worklessness for whatever reason can lead to poorer physical and mental health. The role of the general practitioner (GP) in the management of <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> work is pivotal. Aims. To understand the interaction between GP and patient in the <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> work consultation. This study forms part of a larger research project to develop a learning programme for GPs around the <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> work consultation based on behaviour change methodology. Methods. A qualitative study set in South Wales. Structured discussion groups with seven GPs. Two sessions each lasting 3 h were conducted to explore the GP and patient interaction around the <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> work consultation. Multiple methods were used to enhance engagement. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Results. Four major themes emerged from the meetings: role legitimacy, negotiation, managing the patient and managing the systems. Within these, subthemes emerged around role legitimacy. ‘It's not my job’, ‘It's not what I trained for’ and the ‘shifting agenda’ Negotiation was likened to ‘A polite tug of war’ and subthemes around decision making, managing the agenda and dealing with uncertainty emerged. Conclusions. This study starts to unravel the complexity of the <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> work consultation. It illustrates how GPs struggle with the ‘importance’ of their role and ‘confidence’ in managing the <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> work consultation. It addresses the skilful negotiation that is required to manage the consultation effectively...|$|R

Australia's overall transport sector efficiency and project delivery performance is compared to other OECD nations.

A sample of the largest delivered projects in Australia in that time is examined and compared for their cost, delivery performance, <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> purpose, and benefits. We note trends towards a smaller number of larger projects, less stability in government funding, greater reliance on Commonwealth funds, selection of transport modes on ideological grounds, and projects evidently being planned to satisfy economic or political objectives rather than meet transport objectives. In conclusion we discuss where reforms are needed for transparency and community involvement, as well as governance. 1...|$|R
