50|$|Normalizing is a {{technique}} used to provide uniformity in grain size and composition (equiaxing) throughout an alloy. The term is often used for ferrous alloys that have been austenitized and then cooled in open air. Normalizing not only produces pearlite, but also martensite and sometimes bainite, which gives harder and stronger steel, but with less ductility for the same composition than <b>full</b> <b>annealing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ferrous alloys {{are usually}} either [...] "full annealed" [...] or [...] "process annealed." [...] <b>Full</b> <b>annealing</b> {{requires}} very slow cooling rates, {{in order to}} form coarse pearlite. In process annealing, the cooling rate may be faster; up to, and including normalizing. The main goal of process annealing is to produce a uniform microstructure.

50|$|As {{copper and}} nickel alloy {{with each other}} easily and have simple structures, the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated. Strength and {{hardness}} for each individual alloy is increased by cold working; they are not hardened by heat treatment. Joining of 90-10 (C70600) and 70-30 (C71500) is possible by both welding or brazing. They are both weldable {{by the majority of}} techniques, although autogenous (welding without weld consumables) or oxyacetylene methods are not recommended. The 70-30 rather than 90-10 weld consumables are normally preferred for both alloys and no after-welding heat treatment is required. They can also be welded directly to steel, providing a 65% nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects. The C71640 alloy tends to be used as seamless tubing and expanded rather than welded into the tube plate. Brazing requires appropriate silver-base brazing alloys. However, great care must be taken to ensure that there are no stresses in the Cu-Ni being silver brazed, since any stress can cause intergranulary penetration of the brazing material, and severe stress cracking (see image). Thus, <b>full</b> <b>annealing</b> of any potential mechanical stress is necessary.|$|E

50|$|A <b>full</b> <b>anneal</b> {{typically}} {{results in}} the second most ductile state a metal can assume for metal alloy. Its purpose is to originate a uniform and stable microstructure that most closely resembles the metal's phase diagram equilibrium microstructure, thus letting the metal attain relatively low levels of hardness, yield strength and ultimate strength with high plasticity and toughness. To perform a <b>full</b> <b>anneal</b> on a steel for example, steel is heated to slightly above the austenitic temperature and held for sufficient time to allow the material to fully form austenite or austenite-cementite grain structure. The material is then allowed to cool very slowly so that the equilibrium microstructure is obtained. In most cases this means the material is allowed to furnace cool (the furnace is turned off and the steel is let cool down inside) {{but in some cases}} it's air cooled. The cooling rate of the steel has to be sufficiently slow so as to not let the austenite transform into bainite or martensite, but rather have it completely transform to pearlite and ferrite or cementite. This means that steels that are very hardenable (i.e. tend to form martensite under moderately low cooling rates) have to be furnace cooled. The details of the process depend on the type of metal and the precise alloy involved. In any case the result is a more ductile material but a lower yield strength and a lower tensile strength. This process is also called LP annealing for lamellar pearlite in the steel industry as opposed to a process anneal, which does not specify a microstructure and only has the goal of softening the material. Often the material to be machined is annealed, and then subject to further heat treatment to achieve the final desired properties.|$|R

40|$|Our work {{focuses on}} an {{analysis}} of the processes for <b>full</b> and partial <b>annealing</b> of aluminium coils. Due to inefficient production management these processes show high inventory levels, long lead times and decreased delivery performance. We have also found inadequacies in the ways costs for these processes are distributed. We have established a new process mapping by initially investigating the strategic dimensions of the company and the processes for annealing, in order to later on establish performance measures congruent with the business objectives. Furthermore we have conducted extensive calculations and analyses to facilitate the successful implementation of a Just-in-time production philosophy, including necessary process improvements and redesigns to be made. Our proposed changes will lead to shorter lead times and low levels of WIP, which are important success factors of a JIT-based production philosophy. To do this we have developed a capacity analysis tool with which it is also possible to analyse other processing scenarios or the effect of load changes and/or product mix variations. This tool can also serve as a benchmark for capacity analysis of other processes. Finally, {{we have been able to}} establish more accurate costs per machine hour for <b>full</b> and partial <b>annealing</b> to be implemented in the managerial system.

5000|$|As {{one of the}} {{requirements}} for stress corrosion cracking {{is the presence of}} stress in the components, one method of control is to eliminate that stress, or at least reduce it below the threshold stress for SCC. This is not usually feasible for working stresses (the stress that the component is intended to support), but it may be possible where the stress causing cracking is a residual stress introduced during welding or forming.Residual stresses can be relieved by stress-relief annealing, and this is widely used for carbon steels. These have the advantage of a relatively high threshold stress for most environments, consequently it is relatively easy to reduce the residual stresses to a low enough level. In contrast austenitic stainless steels have a very low threshold stress for chloride SCC. This, combined with the high annealing temperatures that are necessary to avoid other problems, such as sensitization and sigma phase embrittlement, means that stress relief is rarely successful as a method of controlling SCC for this system.For large structures, for which <b>full</b> stress-relief <b>annealing</b> is difficult or impossible, partial stress relief around welds and other critical areas may be of value. However, this must be done in a controlled way to avoid creating new regions of high residual stress, and expert advice is advisable if this approach is adopted.Stresses can also be relieved mechanically. For example, hydrostatic testing beyond yield will tend to ‘even-out’ the stresses and thereby reduce the peak residual stress. Similarly laser peening, shot-peening, or grit-blasting tend to introduce a surface compressive stress, and are beneficial for the control of SCC. The uniformity with which these processes are applied is important. If, for example, only the weld region is shot-peened, damaging tensile stresses may be created at the border of the peened area. The compressive residual stresses imparted by laser peening are precisely controlled both in location and intensity, and can be applied to mitigate sharp transitions into tensile regions. Laser peening imparts deep compressive residual stresses on the order of 10 to 20 times deeper than conventional shot peening making it significantly more beneficial at preventing SCC. [...] Laser peening is widely used in the aerospace and power generation industries in gas fired turbine engines.|$|R

Strength properties depend in certain extent on method of production of the given forging. On the basis of used production technology it is possible to classify the forgings to forged pieces supplied in these conditions: as is after forging, after <b>full</b> <b>annealing,</b> after heat treatment, after controlled forging, and after controlled forging with controlled cooling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{addresses}} {{the influence of}} distinct microstructures and deep rolling parameters on the behaviour of AISI 1060 steel. For this purpose, the work material was initially subjected to subcritical and <b>full</b> <b>annealing</b> {{as well as to}} hardening through quenching and tempering. The specimens were subsequently deep rolled under different rolling pressures and numbers of passes. The findings indicate that plastic deformation increases with rolling pressure and number of passes due to more intense cold working and that under identical deep rolling conditions the fully annealed material presents more severe deformation than the subcritically annealed samples. Moreover, the ability of deep rolling to increase surface hardness decreases with the elevation of the hardness of the original material. The values of the yield and ultimate tensile strength were affected in different manners by deep rolling depending on work material condition and the tensile residual stresses observed after turning were converted into compressive values by deep rolling. Finally, the elevation of rolling pressure and number of passes presented distinct effects on the microhardness distribution beneath the surface depending on the work material condition...|$|E
40|$|A {{subsequent}} {{yield function}} of the sixth degree has been proposed by the author. It is able to include three effects, namely the third deviatoric stress invariant, anisotropy and the Bauschinger effect. Experimental evaluation is made on A 1050 aluminum tubes under multiaxial stress states. The tubing used has undergone progressive deformation such as extruding, plug drawing and stretching in the industrial forming process. For this reason, it has orthotropic anisotropy even after <b>full</b> <b>annealing,</b> and the initial yield locus in the tension-torsion stress field lies outside von Mises’ yield locus. Reloading tests by means of both combined axial load (tension and compression) -torsion and combined axial load-internal pressure-torsion are carried out on the fully annealed tubes subjected to prestrains in tension, torsion and combined tension-torsion. By determining the subsequent yield loci in various principal stress planes, the change in yield stress with a rotation of the principal stress axes is examined. Consequently, it is shown that anisotropic hardening (expansion, distortion and rotation of the locus) superposed kinematic hardening (translation) can be expressed precisely by the proposed yield function. words: A 1050 aluminum, Tensile prestrain, Torsional prestrain, Combined prestrain, Yield locus, Subsequent yield function...|$|E
40|$|Since {{it is well}} {{accepted}} that the { 111 } recrystallization texture component originates in the ? fibre, a series of experiments to maximize this component have been undertaken. The total cold rolling was fixed at 80 % and was done in two parts interrupted by an intermediate anneal. This intermediate anneal was designed to give 100 % recrystallization, followed by the remaining cold rolling {{to a total of}} 80 % reduction. Clearly given the procedure, low initial reductions gave very large grain sizes at <b>full</b> <b>annealing,</b> whether this rolling occurred first or second. However significant improvement was obtained for a certain combination of this double rolling procedure. A second experiment was performed in which IF steel was warm rolled at 700 ° C in a single pass to 75 % reduction. This was then cold rolled 80 % and given a final recrystallization treatment. The resulting texture was an extremely intense { 111 } fibre of 30 - 40 x Random. OIM revealed that deformation banding in ? deformed material provided the lattice curvature for successful nucleation of { 111 } in the deformed ? fibre material. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} is {{an advanced method}} for obtaining sophisticated products and assembly permanent joints. This is particularly relevant for heat resistant alloys employed in aviation equipment. Heat treatment modes traditionally applied to the products are chosen in accordance with conditions of further product operation. In this paper there are given the results of experimental study of hardness, deformability and microstructure of samples after selective {{laser sintering}} of Ni- 15 Co- 10 Cr and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy powders. It has been determined that Ni- 15 Co- 10 Cr alloy ageing increases the hardness and deformability of samples; these characteristics decrease if the ageing lasts for 9 - 19 hours. Annealing of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy samples results in preserving original hardness. After complete annealing, the hardness of samples decreases from 32 … 33 HRC to 24 … 26 HRC. Microstructural studies showed that there are cracks between layers in the surface of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy samples after sintering and not complete annealing. After <b>full</b> <b>annealing,</b> cracks' width and length decreased. Cracks in Ni- 15 Co- 10 Cr alloy samples' microstructure were not detected...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we present and {{interpret}} a new experimental data set documenting thermal annealing of alpha recoil tracks (ARTs) in phlogopite. Through improvements in experimental technique, difficulties in obtaining useable data from material with an uneven distribution of U and Th were overcome. The resulting annealing pattern was well organized on an Arrhenius plot, allowing construction of a simple, 3 -parameter annealing model of parallel contours of constant annealing with a linear progression. Our data and model indicate that phlogopite ARTs anneal at very low temperatures on geological time scales. At the million-year time scale, <b>full</b> <b>annealing</b> requires a temperature of only 33 degrees C, and we infer closure temperatures from 26 - 37 degrees C for cooling rates of 10 - 100 degrees C/m. y. Phlogopite ART analysis is thus likely to be primarily useful in relatively young (< 1 Ma) terrains featuring either recent volcanism or recent, fast exhumation. In such situations, however, it may provide unique information on {{the timing of the}} final stages of unroofing. Comparison of our results with previous studies on ART and fission-track annealing in phlogopite and biotite indicates that these two types of radiation damage anneal at disparate time and temperature conditions in biotite-series micas.
