MethodsFour hundred and thirty-three subjects aged less than 42 years with infertility due to Fallopian tube or male-related factors {{who were willing to}} undertake in vitro fertilization and <b>embryo</b> <b>transplantation</b> were randomly allocated to a Chinese herb intervention group (n= 216) or a conventional treatment control group (n= 217). All subjects received one of four routine ultra-ovulation-promoting therapies at the Reproductive Center in the Third Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University according to their physician's assessments. The subjects in the intervention group received various Chinese herbs depending on their conventional treatment. Endometrial thickness, number of acquired eggs, and rates of normal fertility, high-quality embryos, biochemical and clinical pregnancy of subjects were assessed in both groups. ResultsThe high-quality embryo rate of 51. 9 %, biochemical pregnancy rate of 51. 0 %, clinical pregnancy rate of 44. 2 % and endometrial thickness of (10. 84 ± 1. 75) mm in the intervention group were all significantly higher than those in the control group [48. 7 %, 38. 9 %, 34. 8 %, and (10. 52 ± 1. 50) mm, respectively; P 0. 05) in the average number of acquired eggs within a single cycle, incidence of excessive stimulation of ovary, rates of <b>embryo</b> <b>transplantation</b> or early abortion and birth of living babies between the two groups.

In this study, we assessed the cause of embryonic lethality with respect to the fetal liver hematopoietic system. We found that Ubc was highly expressed in the embryonic liver, and the proliferation capacity of fetal liver cells was reduced in Ubc(-/-) embryos. Specifically, Ubc was most highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, and the proliferation capacity of hematopoietic cells was significantly impaired in Ubc(-/-) embryos. While hematopoietic cell and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) frequency was maintained in Ubc(-/-) embryos, the absolute number of these cells was diminished because of reduced total liver cell number in Ubc(-/-) <b>embryos.</b> <b>Transplantations</b> of fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice by non-competitive and competitive reconstitution methods indicated that disruption of Ubc does not significantly impair the intrinsic function of fetal liver HSCs.

40|$|Objective　To {{study the}} effect of {{elective}} single blastocyst transfer (eSBT) on the pregnancy outcome of women undergoing in vitro fertilization and <b>embryo</b> <b>transplantation</b> (IVF-ET). Methods　A perspective study on eSBT was conducted from March 2007 to December 2011. The patients were divided into three groups based on embryonic development and number of embryos transplanted: group A, single blastocyst transfer (n= 287); group B, two blastocysts transfer (n= 53); group C, cleavage stage embryo transfer (n= 382). The difference in clinical data, laboratory data and pregnancy outcome were compared among the three groups. Patients from group A and B who achieved {{to have at least}} two good blastocysts were reviewed, and divided into twice single blastocyst transfer (T-SBT) group and once two blastocysts transfer (O-DBT) group. With the cumulative transplantation of two blastocysts serving as an example, the pregnancy rate and cumulative pregnancy rate were compared between the T-SBT group and O-DBT group. Results　The clinical pregnancy rate in single transplantation cycle decreased significantly in group A compared with that of group B (P 0. 05), but the implantation rate was increased and multiple pregnancy rate was lower significantly in group A (P 0. 05).

40|$|Assisted {{reproductive}} technologies, such as {{artificial insemination}} and embryo transfer, have produced significant outcomes in cattle. These technologies are useful {{not only for}} improving fertility but also for increasing the rate of genetic change in beef and dairy livestock. Today, embryo transfer in cattle is both practical and commercially viable. However, bovine <b>embryo</b> <b>transplantation</b> still remains suboptimal under on-farm conditions, {{one of the main}} reasons for which may be inefficient nutritional management. The role of nutrition in modulating reproduction and particularly in ovarian function remains unclear. Considerable effort has been made to elucidate the nutritional factors regulating the development of follicles in either a direct or an indirect manner. Moreover, evidence indicates that bovine folliculogenesis is modulated by gonadotropins as well as by metabolic hormones, including growth hormone, leptin, insulin and insulin-like growth factor- 1. In addition, metabolites – such as glucose, urea and non-esterified fatty acids – are considered to play a role in regulating ovarian follicular development. Nutrition affects folliculogenesis indirectly by altering the activity of reproductive hormones. Furthermore, nutrition has local impact on the development of follicles at the ovarian level. As a result, nutrition is possibly decisive to the fate of bovine oocyte development, since oocyte quality influences reproductive outcomes such as fertilization and pregnancy rates. Although numerous reviews in the published literature describe nutritional roles in reproduction, the primary focus of this paper is the effect of nutritional factors on folliculogenesis in cattle. A greater understanding of this influence may facilitate nutritional manipulation in order to enhance fertility in cattle in a cost-effective yet very efficient way...|$|E

To analyse the regulation of the expression of these genes by positional cues, focusing on the stages just preceding the formation of rhombomeres, we have performed ectopic grafts involving single prospective rhombomeres (pr) or couples of pr on 4 – 6 somite avian <b>embryos.</b> <b>Transplantation</b> of pr 6 in the pr 5 position leads to Krox- 20 activation and grafting of pr 7 in the pr 5 position results in mafB/kr activation. Furthermore, pr 6 grafted in the pr 5 position develops an r 5 -like cytoarchitecture. These data establish that rostral transplantation {{can lead to a}}nteriorization within the hindbrain. However, additional experiments indicate that the competence of the transplanted tissue for such anteriorization appears limited and that transformations corresponding to shifts of a single rhombomere are favoured. We also show that caudal transplantation of pr 5 into the pr 6 position can lead to a down-regulation of Krox- 20 expression consistent with posteriorization, suggesting that caudalizing influences are present within the nonsomitic hindbrain after the 4 - to 6 -somite stage. Finally, combinations of extirpation and grafting experiments suggest that the regulation of mafB/kr expression in the r 6 –r 7 region may involve anteriorizing influences in addition to previously identified posteriorizing signals from the somitic region...|$|R

Post-thaw viability of the blastomeres was used to optimize cryopreservation conditions. Donor blastomeres were injected with zebrafish GFP-nos 1 3 ’UTR mRNA and biotin dextran prior to cryopreservation in the optimal freeze medium. Host embryos were injected with zebrafish DsRed-nos 1 3 ’UTR mRNA and reared to the blastula stage. Donor blastomeres were thawed at 25 °C for 10 s and transplanted to the host embryos either immediately or after incubation for 16 h at 20 °C.

40|$|Sheep of five* breeds {{imported}} into New Zealand and {{held at a}} quarantine farm were increased in number {{through the use of}} <b>embryo</b> <b>transplantation</b> (ET) procedures. For this, donor ewes after superovulation treatment were inseminated with fresh semen of rams of their own breed and flushed to recover embryos 5 or 6 day after onset of oestrus. The embryos after classification and processing through ten washes of flushing media were transported to a secondary quarantine farm and transferred into synchronised recipient Coopworth and Romney ewes. Some of the surrogate ewes received intravaginal progesterone supplementation (CIDR) for 14 days after transfer. Details of lamb production were recorded. This thesis reports the results of some factors that can affect the success of a commercial ET programme. Among the donor ewes 87 - 89 % of the animals were in oestrus after synchronisation and gonadotrophin treatment. The ewes not in heat often had low or absent superovulatory responses. Superovulation was induced with either FSH-P or Folltropin given as 7 or 8 intramuscular injections at 12 h interval begining 72 h before withdrawal of the progesterone treatment (CIDR). The gonadotrophin dose levels were modified according to the breed and also as the programme progressed. Most of the data were examined within breed. The superovulatory response to either the type of gonadotrophin preparation or the dose levels did not differ significantly. The variation in recovery rate of embryos was not affected by the type of gonadotrophin used, whether the animals treated were flushed on one or two occasions, whether flushing was done 5 or 6 days after oestrus, or according to the ovulatory response (classed as 1 - 8, 9 - 16 and > 16 corpora lrttea counted). Overall 85 % of the ova were fertilised and had developed into embryos. There {{were no significant differences in}} fertility between inseminations done in the morning or the afternoon, or when flushed once or twice, or when AI was followed by natural mating, or relative to the ovulatory response. Moreover there was no significant difference within the six breeds in the fertility rate. The quality of the embryos, classified as "good" or "poor" on the basis of their appearance and stage of development consistent with the day of flushing (developmental age), was. significantly affected in several of the breeds by the type of gonadotrophin, the dose levels, the ovulatory response and the age of the embryos when recovered. The pregnancy rate after the transfer of two embryos was 59 %, 72 %, 60 %, 53 %, 53 %, 46 % for recipients carrying DT,FT,FINN,GOT,OXD,WHM embryos, respectively. The comparable ·values for embryo survival were 46 %, 57 %, 54 %, 42 %, 40 %, 34 %, respectively. In general among the factors studied involving breed of recipient, degree of synchronisation between donor and recipient, ovulation rate in the recipient, interval from flushing to transplantation and progesterone supplementation it was found that only the latter factor in the DT, FT and OXD breeds of embryos was significant. The results from this multiplication programme after considering 409 treatments with gonadotrophin gave an average of 6. 0 corpora lutea, 3. 9 eggs recovered, 3. 4 eggs fertilised and 1. 5 lambs born per treatment. It is concluded that the low recovery rate and poor survival rate of the embryos are important factors to be overcome if a significant increase in the number of lambs born is to be expected from <b>embryo</b> <b>transplantation.</b> Work to overcome these problems is necessary, but attempts should also be made to increase the OR through modification of the gonadotrophin treatments. Support for this idea is suggested because in some animals with a high OR satisfactory numbers of eggs were fertilised and an increase of good quality embryos was recorded. * Texel (from two sources, Danish (DT) and Finnish (FT) and considered as separate breeds), Finnish Landrace (Finn), Gotland Pelt (Got), Oxford Down (OXD), White Headed Marsh (WHM) breeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD thesis was to {{investigate}} the DNA methylation pattern and influence of DNA demethylating agent 5 -azacitydine (5 azaC) on the development of experimental mouse teratocarcinoma (TCa) obtained by the transplantation of gastrulating mouse embryo (E 7, 5) under the kidney capsule of an adult animal. It was discovered that TCa develops from male embryos only. Investigated 8 - week long period of TCa development started with subtle growth followed by resting phase. TCa development ended with explosive growth paralleled with concomitant increase in expression of Pcna gene (proliferation marker). In vitro experiments have pinpointed the key role of stemness genes Oct 3 / 4 and Nanog expression since their esiRNA induced inhibition caused the suppression of tumour development from the embryo. Through analysis of DNA methylation pattern we discovered continuing hypomethylation of Nanog gene during TCa development compared with normal testicular tissue. Contrary, compared with embryo development, Oct 3 / 4 gene showed hypermethylation reprogramming overlapping with the period of tumour subtle growth and resting phase period. Achieving the maximum hypermethylation phase, TCa initiated the intensive growth correlating with proportion of Oct 3 / 4 demethylated cells. Sox 2 gene, although with low percentage of DNA methylation, showed the promoter methylation reprogramming during TCa development similar to the one established for Oct 3 / 4 gene promoter. Based on the promoter DNA methylation pattern analysis of Scgb 3 a 1, Prss 21, Stat 3, Brca 1, Mgmt, c-Myc, Trrap and Rassf 1 genes and established global methylation pattern based on the analysis of Mml, Mmetnltr and B 1 repetitive DNA sequences it may be concluded that these genes and repetitive sequences are not involved in teratocarcinoma development. 5 azaC applied immediately after the <b>embryo</b> <b>transplantation</b> completely inhibited teratocarcinoma development whereas applied on already developed teratocarcinoma, decreased its growth with statistical significance. Despite the fact that 5 azaC causes global hypomethylation, its application did not influence the methylation status and reprogramming of stemness genes Oct 3 / 4, Nanog and Sox 2. Quite contrary, treatment with 5 azaC inhibited the expression of Oct 3 / 4 and Nanog genes in developed teratocarcinoma by some other mechanisms that did not include DNA methylation change. Our results showed that 5 azaC treatment does not cause changes of oxidative stress markers nor the markers associated with the inflammation process. According to our obtained results it seems that 5 azaC influence the establishment of methyloma which encourages apoptosis and decreases proliferation of TCa stem cells. Our research reveals the epigenetic platform of TCa development and potentials of 5 azaC in the treatment of testicular germ cell tumours...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic animals play an {{important}} role in biomedical research. Their use as animal model is still increasing. Although the process of transgenesis may contribute to refinement of animal use, the application of the biotechnological procedures that are involved in the production of transgenic animals may also cause unexpected, uncontrolled, and even undetected animal suffering. Therefore, the aim of the present thesis was to study the effects of the biotechnological procedures involved in genetic modification on the welfare of the resulting offspring. The two most frequently used techniques for inserting new genetic material into the mammalian germ line, pronuclear microinjection and embryonic stem (ES) cell-mediated gene transfer, have been studied. Different groups of mice were generated, each of which had undergone different aspects of the microinjection technique (Chapters 2 and 3) or of the gene targeting technique (Chapters 4 and 5), in order to determine whether the specific manipulations have any effect on the development or behaviour of the progeny. In this way, the effects of microinjection, electroporation, embryo-culture or <b>embryo</b> <b>transplantation</b> on the development of (chimeric) mice could be studied separately. All mice of the different groups were tested in their pre-weaning (0 - 3 weeks of age) and post-weaning period (4 - 30 weeks of age) for behavioural and morphological/physiological development and for clinical appearance. Thereafter, post-mortem examinations were performed. In addition, the feasibility of the use of score sheets for monitoring the welfare of transgenic mice, as part of the daily care of animals, has been explored (Chapter 6). With both techniques, the biotechnological procedures increased (perinatal) pup mortality and body weight. In addition, with the gene targeting technique, 8 % of the chimeric animals was hermaphrodite. The results so far indicate that, under the present conditions, the biotechnological procedures (microinjection; in vitro culture; embryo transfer) mainly affect the viability of the embryos and seem to have no major effects on the development and behaviour of mice that survive the first 2 - 3 days after birth. However, before drawing general conclusions, more and different transgenic lines should be studied in a comparable way. A scoring system has been developed, containing a limited number of sensitive, easy to determine and non-invasive parameters, selected from our previous studies on implications of transgenesis for the well-being of mice. The feasibility of this scoring system has been tested, to assess the use of score sheets for monitoring the welfare of transgenic mice on a practical basis, as part of the animal technicians daily routine in a transgenic unit. It has been found to be both practical and useful. Therefore, in the production of transgenic animals, the use of score sheets is recommended, in order to detect both the intended and the non-intended (side) effects of the introduced or mutated gene at an early stage of development...|$|E
40|$|Neural crest (NC) is an {{established}} source for many endochondral and intramembranous {{bones in the}} skull and postcranial skeleton in vertebrates.

In the avian shoulder girdle, NC cells from the level of the first two cranial−most somites were only found so far in the clavicle, while in the axolotl, the NC contribution to the shoulder girdle was not found at all. In this study we aimed to determine whether NC cells caudal {{to the level of the}} second somite contribute to the cartilaginous shoulder girdle in birds and to analyse the phylogenetic distribution of NC cells in the vertebrate shoulder girdle. Homotopic quail to chick embryos and GFP+ to wild type chick <b>embryos</b> <b>transplantations</b> of the neural tube including presumptive NC, as well as immunohistochemical detection of NC markers, such as HNK- 1 and PDGFRα revealed no contribution of NC cells from somite levels 3 − 27 to the skeletal elements of the shoulder girdle, including, but not restricting to muscle attachment sites, despite abundance of other NC derivatives. Thus, in birds, NC does not contribute to the formation of the cartilaginous shoulder girdle. The negative result is discussed in a broad evolutionary aspect. It supports the notion of the uniqueness of NC contribution to the variety of endochondral bones in mice (or mammals). In other vertebrates, including birds, only the cells of the cranial NC seem to migrate to the shoulder girdle and contribute to the intramembranous clavicles and/or interclavicle. We critically evaluate the existing hypotheses on evolution of NC contribution to the shoulder girdle in vertebrates...|$|R

Further, we examined the effect of UV irradiation on Japanese newt embryos. Surprisingly, UV-irradiated Japanese newt eggs formed hyperdorsalized embryos. These embryos gastrulated in an irregular circular fashion with goosecoid expression in the circular equatorial region. At tailbud stage, these embryos formed a proboscis which is very reminiscent of that formed in hyperdorsalized Xenopus <b>embryos.</b> <b>Transplantation</b> of the marginal region of the UV-irradiated embryos revealed that the entire marginal zone had organizer activity. Thus we conclude that UV hyperdorsalizes Japanese newt embryos. Finally, lithium treatment of normal embryos at the 32 -cell stage also resulted in hyperdorsalization. Lithium treatment of vegetally deleted embryos had two distinct results. Lithium treatment of permanent-blastula-type embryos {{did not result in}} the formation of dorsal axial structures, while the same treatment reinduced gastrulation and dorsal axis formation in the wasp-shaped embryos. Based on these results, we propose a model for early axis specification in Japanese newt embryos. The model presented here is fundamentally identical to the Xenopus model, with some important modifications. The vegetally located determinants required for dorsal development (dorsal determinants, DDs) are distributed over a wider region at fertilization in Japanese newt embryos than in Xenopus embryos. The marginal region of the Japanese newt embryo at the beginning of development overlaps with the field of the DDs. Gastrulation is very likely to be a dorsal marginal-specific property, while self-constriction is most probably a ventral marginal-specific property in Japanese newt embryos...|$|R

40|$|Distribution {{of water}} and of Na+ and Cl- ions in blood and in allantoic, amniotic, and yolk sac fluids were {{observed}} during ontogeny of the chick embryo. A possible osmoregulatory role for pituitary hormones was inferred from differences in ionic concentrations and volumes of these compartments in partially decapitated (hypophysectomized) embryos and in intact and windowed-control embryos observed on Day 16. 5 of incubation (20 - 21 days to hatching). Na+-K+-ATPase activity was also measured in both mesonephric and metanephric kidneys in control and in hypophysectomized and pituitary transplanted embryos. Some osmoregulatory defects in hypophysectomized embryos were reversed by transplantation of anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary for 1 week beginning on Day 9 of incubation. Allantoic fluid volume was reduced and Na+ and Cl- concentrations were elevated in this compartment in hypophysectomized <b>embryos.</b> Pituitary <b>transplantation</b> restored both measurements to control values. Amniotic fluid volume was not significantly changed by hypophysectomy when compared with windowed controls. Amniotic Cl- concentration was also insensitive to hypophysectomy. Pituitary transplantation lowered amniotic fluid volume slightly, but elevated its Cl- concentration significantly. Hypophysectomy reduced the percentage water content in yolk sac and significantly increased hydration of the <b>embryo.</b> Pituitary <b>transplantation</b> partially restored fractional water content of yolk to control levels and reversed body hydration. Hypophysectomy and transplantation had no significant effects on serum Na+ concentrations in the 16. 5 -day-old embryo. Activities of renal Na+-K+-ATPase were not significantly changed in mesonephros or metanephros by hypophysectomy or transplantation of one pituitary gland. Hormones of the pituitary gland appear to be required for normal distribution {{of water and}} ions in the chick embryo at 16. 5 days of incubation. Possible target organs include both embryonic kidneys, but activities of renal Na+-K+-ATPase seem to be independent of pituitary hormones. Certain corrective actions obtained in response to metabolic hormones (thyroxine and corticosterone) suggest that some osmoregulatory defects observed in hypophysectomized embryos could result from impaired metabolism and a reduced rate of maturation {{rather than from the}} absence of specific osmoregulatory hormones of the pituitary gland...|$|R

These XO gyno-genones showed the same mortality around the time of implantation as did their XX gynogenetic counter-parts. This shows that the lack of a paternally derived autosome set is sufficient to cause gynogenetic in-viability at this stage. Autosomal imprinting and its possible relation to X-chromosome imprinting is dis-cussed...|$|R

He invented many of the infertility treatments in use today in the domain of IVF, sperm retrieval, ICSI, vasectomy reversal, tubal ligation reversal, egg and <b>embryo</b> freezing, ovary <b>transplantation,</b> and the reproductive biological clock. He performed the world's first ovary and testicle transplants, created and popularized the microsurgical vasectomy reversal, and popularized ovarian tissue freezing to preserve female fertility. He was the first to research the genetic causes of infertility in men, and developed the TESE-ICSI technique for extracting sperm from men with low or nonexistent sperm counts and direct injection of the sperm into the egg.

40|$|Somites {{give rise}} to the {{vertebral}} column and segmented musculature of adult vertebrates. The cell movements that position cells within somites along the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes are not well understood. Using a fate mapping approach, we show that {{at the onset of}} Xenopus laevis gastrula-tion, mesoderm cells undergo distinct cell movements to form myotome fibers positioned in discrete locations within somites and along the anteroposterior axis. We show that the distribution of presomitic cells along the anteroposterior axis is influenced by convergent and extension movements of the noto-chord. Heterochronic and heterotopic transplantations between presomitic gastrula and early tail bud stages show that these cells are interchangeable and can form myotome fibers in locations determined by the host <b>embryo.</b> However, additional <b>transplantation</b> experiments revealed differences in the competency of presomitic cells to form myotome fibers, suggesting that maturation within the tail bud presomitic mesoderm is required for myotome fiber differentiation.

40|$|AbstractBackground: In Xenopus, the {{endoderm}} {{germ layer}} {{is derived from}} the vegetal blastomeres of cleavage-stage <b>embryos.</b> Cell <b>transplantation</b> experiments have revealed that the endodermal fate becomes gradually fixed during the late blastula stages. Sox 17 α, Mix. 1, Mixer and GATA- 4 encode vegetal zygotic transcription factors with endoderm-inducing activity. The accumulation of their transcripts during the late blastula stages may cause determination of the endodermal fate. VegT, a T-box transcription factor, the maternal transcripts of which are vegetally localised, is also required for endoderm formation. Results: We analysed the events leading to the progressive accumulation of the transcripts for Sox 17 α, Mix. 1, Mixer and GATA- 4. Two phases could be distinguished in the endodermal programme. In phase 1, Sox 17 α, Mix. 1, and the genes encoding transforming growth factor β-related signalling molecules Xnr 1, Xnr 2 and Derrière were activated cell-autonomously at around the mid-blastula transition (MBT) by maternal determinants. In phase 2, TGFβ signalling, possibly involving Xnr 1, Xnr 2 and Derrière, led to the activation of Mixer and GATA- 4 in late blastula stages and to the reinforcement of the expression of Sox 17 α and Mix. 1. Overexpression of VegT in animal caps triggered a developmental programme qualitatively similar to that observed in vegetal blastomeres, except that Xnr 1 and GATA- 4 were not activated by the early gastrula stage. Conclusions: Our results support a two-step model for endoderm determination between fertilisation and the onset of gastrulation. The initial cell-autonomous activation of early endodermal genes by maternal determinants including, but not limited to, VegT is relayed by the action of zygotic TGFβs such as Xnr 1, Xnr 2 and Derrière...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{powerful}} tools used to gain insight into complex developmental processes is the analysis of chimeric embryos. A chimera is defined as an organism that contains cells from more than one animal; mosaics are one type of chimera in which cells from more than one genotype are mixed, usually wild-type and mutant. In the zebrafish, chimeras can be readily made by transplantation of cells from a donor embryo into a host embryo at the appropriate embryonic stage. Labeled donor cells are generated by injection of a lineage marker, such as a fluorescent dye, into the one-cell stage embryo. Labeled donor cells are removed from donor embryos and introduced into unlabeled host embryos using an oil-controlled glass pipette mounted on either a compound or dissecting microscope. Donor cells can in some cases be targeted to a specific region or tissue of the developing blastula or gastrula stage host embryo by choosing a transplantation site in the host embryo based on well-established fate maps.

40|$|Diploid parthenogenetically {{activated}} oocytes {{were obtained}} after gonadotropin-induced ovulation of virgin females of the LT/Sv (LT) inbred mouse strain. These oocytes cleave spontaneously and develop into blastocysts which implant in the uterus but die {{within a few}} days. We examined the developmental potential of nuclei from parthenogenetic <b>embryos</b> after <b>transplantation</b> into fertilized eggs. The inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) of LT parthenogenetic blastocysts were mechanically isolated and dissociated into single cells. Their nuclei were then injected into fertilized C 57 BL/ 6 J eggs from which {{the male and female}} pronuclei were removed. Of 94 eggs injected with TE cell nuclei, 4 embryos developed to the morula stage; all 4 showed abnormalities and subsequently became arrested in development. Enzyme analysis of these embryos revealed that TE cell nuclei could neither independently initiate or support preimplantation development. However, of 54 eggs injected with nuclei from ICM cells, 3 morulae and 3 blastocysts developed and enzyme analyses of them confirmed that the preimplantation development of 2 embryos was supported by transplanted parthenogenetic nuclei. In another experimental series, 3 morulae and 4 blastocysts developed from 107 eggs injected with ICM nuclei and were transferred to uteri of foster mothers to ascertain their postimplantation development. Four female offspring were born and all of them showed a diploid karyotype and expressed enzyme activity of only the LT genotype. One female proved to be fertile and transmitted the parthenogenetic genome to the next generation. These results demonstrate that the nucleus from LT parthenogenetic blastocysts contains a complete genome necessary to support development of an adult mouse. Therefore, the early postimplantation death of parthenogenetic embryos {{does not seem to be}} related to an aberrant genotype but rather to undefined mechanisms associated with fertilization and normal morphogenetic processes...|$|R
30|$|The {{influence}} of antitumor drugs on glioblastoma, {{as well as}} other tumor, cell activity can be also investigated in in vivo models: animal model (mice, rats) and in ovo model. The advantages of an in ovo model compared to animal models included simple methodology of tumor cell implantation, economical reasons, and high survival rate of embryos. Moreover, being naturally immunodeficient, the chick <b>embryo</b> may accept <b>transplantation</b> from various tissues and species, without immune responses. In contrast to standard mouse models, most tumor cells implanted on the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) blood vessels survive without cell damage. An in ovo model allows a rapid development and vascularization of forming tumors. Tumors growing in an in ovo model are visible within 2 to 5  days after tumor cell implantation, compared to in vivo models, where tumors form within 3 to 6  weeks. A possibility to conduct daily non-invasive observations of growing tumors is also a great advantage of this experimental model [5]. Thus, an in ovo model can be successfully applied in oncological studies [6]. It has been used to culture several types of tumors and to study their growth rate, angiogenic potential, and metastatic capability [5].|$|R
40|$|Models of parent–offspring {{conflict}} concerning {{levels of}} caregiving centre on conflict resolution by offspring control, compromise or offspring ‘honest signalling’ that parents use {{to maximize their}} own fitness. Recent empirical studies on motivational control of parental feeding of offspring are interpreted as supporting the latter model. Here, we examine parental care in an amphipod, Crangonyx pseudogracilis, which directs care to embryos in a brood pouch. <b>Embryo</b> removal and <b>transplantation</b> elucidated causal factors that determine levels of caregiving. In the short-term, females with all embryos removed reduced care activities, but partial embryo removal did not affect caregiving, evidence of ‘unshared’ parental care. In the long-term, females with all embryos removed ceased care. Thus, females have a maternal state that is maintained by stimuli from offspring. Transplantation of early/late stage embryos among females originally carrying early/late stage embryos revealed that stimuli from embryos indicate their age-dependent needs, but only modify caregiving within the constraints of a changing endogenous maternal state. Thus, we demonstrate that mothers and offspring share motivational control of care. However, we highlight the inappropriate use of motivational data in reaching conclusions about the resolution of parent–offspring conflict...|$|R
40|$|Posterior polar plasm of the Drosophila egg {{has been}} shown to {{function}} autonomously in germ cell determination after transplantation to either the anterior or mid-ventral region of the early embryo. By means of similar transplantations, we have tested the ability of polar plasm of Drosophila immigrans to induce the formation of pole cells in a Drosophila melanogaster <b>embryo.</b> After the <b>transplantation</b> of polar plasm, "hybrid" pole cells were found in which both pole cell-specific organelles, the polar granules and nuclear body, were structurally similar to those characteristic of the transplanted cytoplasm. In order to determine whether these hybrid cells can function as germ cell precursors, these cells were transplanted to the posterior tip of genetically marked embryos. Approximately 5 % of the flies obtained from embryos receiving potential pole cells produce offspring derived from the induced pole cells. This result demonstrates that polar plasm can function in interspecific species combinations and indicates that the molecular mechanisms of germ cell determination are conservative in evolution. Finally, in order to test whether there is any evidence for cytoplasmic inheritance of polar granules, embryos derived from hybrid pole cells were examined for their polar granule morphology. The fine structure of the granules conformed to that of the nucleus. Thus, no evidence was found for the cytoplasmic inheritance of these particular organelles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{staging of}} murine cardiomyocyte {{specification}} and determination {{was investigated in}} cultures of tissue explants from pre- and postgastrulated <b>embryos</b> and after <b>transplantation</b> of cardiac or cardiogenic tissues from mouse embryos into 2 -day-old chick embryos in different locations. The development of transplanted and cultured cells in cardiomyocytes was evaluated by testing the expression of several cardiac transcription factor genes (Nkx 2. 5, eHAND, dHAND, GATA- 4), α-cardiac actin mRNA, and β-myosin heavy chain protein. In vitro analyses showed that cells {{with the potential to}} form cardiac muscle were present prior to gastrulation in 6. 5 -day postconception (dpc) epiblasts, as indicated by the expression of Nkx 2. 5, eHAND, dHAND, and GATA- 4 cardiac transcription factors; desmin transgene; α-cardiac actin; and β-myosin heavy chain. Conversely, epiblasts transplanted into the chicken somitic environment did not exhibit full cardiogenic cell differentiation. It was determined that chick host axial structures did not influence cardiogenesis in transplants. Mesoderm from late streak explants was capable of differentiating into the cardiac phenotype in the avian heterotopic environment, indicating that the specification of cardiac precursors (under way by 6. 5 dpc) became irreversible at around the late streak stage in mouse embryo. Although in vitro analyses showed that interaction with endoderm is not required for the specification of murine cardiac cells, the presence of endoderm in explant cultures between mid- and late streak stages stimulated emerging mesodermal cells to adopt a myocardial pathway, whereas ectoderm had no influence on cardiomyogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} a scoring system combining zygote and embryo morphology in predicting the outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Methods: In a study group, 117 consecutive IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles with embryo transfer were carried out and 312 embryos were scored using a combined scoring system (CSS) of zygote and <b>embryo</b> morphology before <b>transplantation.</b> In a control group, a total of 420 IVF or ICSI cycles were carried out and 1176 embryos were scored using a cumulative embryo score (CES). The effects of the combined scoring system on the embryo implantation rate and pregnancy rate per cycle were analyzed. Results: Using the combined scoring system, the embryo implantation rate (27. 6 %) and the clinical pregnancy rate (48. 7 %) {{were significantly higher than}} those in the control group (20. 8 % and 38. 6 %, respectively). Also, the implantation rate of embryos scoring ≥ 70 (38. 5 %: 82 sacs/ 213 embryos) was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than that of embryos scoring < 70 (4 %: 4 sacs/ 99 embryos). The pregnancy rate of patients with embryos scoring ≥ 70 using the combined scoring system (66. 7 %) was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than that of patients with embryos scoring ≥ 20 using the cumulative embryo score (59. 0 %). Conclusion: The results suggest that selecting embryos with a high score (≥ 70) using the combined scoring system could increase the implantation rate and pregnancy rate, and that using a scoring system combining assessments of human zygotes and pre-implantation embryos might predict IVF outcomes more accurately than using a cumulative embryo score...|$|R
40|$|We used {{deterministic}} {{simulation of}} four alternative multiple ovulation and embryo manipulation (MOET) closed nucleus schemes {{to investigate the}} benefits of using marker-assisted selection (MAS) of Nellore (Bos indicus) beef cattle <b>embryos</b> prior to <b>transplantation</b> to reduce the age at first calving (AFC). We found that MAS resulted in increased genetic gain as compared to selection without AFC quantitative trait loci (AFC-QTL) information. With single-stage selection the genetic response (GR) increased as follows: GR = 0. 68 % when the AFC-QTL explained 0. 02 of the AFC additive genetic variance (s 2 A); GR = 1. 76 % for AFC-QTL explaining 0. 05 s 2 A; GR = 3. 7 % for AFC-QTL explaining 0. 1 s 2 A; and GR = 55. 76 % for AFC-QTL explaining 0. 95 s 2 A. At the same total selected proportion, two-stage selection resulted in less genetic gain than single stage MAS at two-years of age. A single stage selection responses of > 95 % occurred with pre-selected proportions of 0. 4 (0. 1 s 2 A explained by AFC-QTL), 0. 2 (0. 3 s 2 A explained by AFC-QTL) and 0. 1 (0. 5 s 2 A explained by AFC-QTL), indicating that the combined use of MAS and pre-selection can substantially {{reduce the cost of}} keeping recipient heifers in MOET breeding schemes. When the number of recipients was kept constant, the benefit of increasing embryo production was greater for the QTL explaining a higher proportion of the additive genetic variance. However this advantage had a diminishing return especially for QTL explaining a small proportion of the additive genetic variance. Thus, marker assisted selection of embryos can be used to achieve increased genetic gain or a similar genetic response at reduced expense by decreasing the number of recipient cows and number of offspring raised to two-years of age...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe used Pax- 2 mRNA {{expression}} and Lim 1 / 2 antibody staining as markers for {{the conversion of}} chick intermediate mesoderm (IM) to pronephric tissue and Lmx- 1 mRNA expression as a marker for mesonephros. Pronephric markers were strongly expressed caudal to the fifth somite by stage 9. To determine whether the pronephros was induced by adjacent tissues and, if so, to identify the inducing tissues and the timing of induction, we microsurgically dissected one side of chick embryos developing in culture and then incubated them for up to 3 days. The undisturbed contralateral side served as a control. Most embryos cut parallel to the rostrocaudal axis between the trunk paraxial mesoderm and IM before stage 8 developed a pronephros on the control side only. Embryos manipulated after stage 9 developed pronephric structures on both sides, but the caudal pronephric extension was attenuated on the cut side. These results suggest that a medial signal is required for pronephric development and show that the signal is propagated in a rostral to caudal sequence. In manipulated embryos cultured for 3 days in ovo, the mesonephros {{as well as the}} pronephros failed to develop on the experimental side. In contrast, embryos cut between the notochord and the trunk paraxial mesoderm formed pronephric structures on both sides, regardless of the stage at which the operation was performed, indicating that the signal arises from the paraxial mesoderm (PM) and not from axial mesoderm. This cut also served as a control for cuts between the PM and the IM and showed that signaling itself was blocked in the former experiments, not the migration of pronephric or mesonephric precursor cells from the primitive streak. Additional control experiments ruled out the need for signals from lateral plate mesoderm, ectoderm, or endoderm. To determine whether the trunk paraxial mesoderm caudal to the fifth somite maintains its inductive capacity in the absence of contact with more rostral tissue, embryos were transected. Those transected below the prospective level of the fifth somite expressed Pax- 2 in both the rostral and the caudal isolates, whereas embryos transected rostral to this level expressed Pax- 2 in the caudal isolate only. Thus, a rostral signal is not required to establish the normal pattern of Pax- 2 {{expression and}} pronephros formation. To determine whether paraxial mesoderm is sufficient for pronephros induction, stage 7 or earlier chick lateral plate mesoderm was cocultured with caudal stage 8 or 9 quail somites in collagen gels. Pax- 2 was expressed in chick tissues in 21 of 25 <b>embryos.</b> Isochronic <b>transplantation</b> of stage 4 or 5 quail node into caudal chick primitive streak resulted in the generation of ectopic somites. These somites induced ectopic pronephroi in lateral plate mesoderm, and the IM that received signals from both native and ectopic somites formed enlarged pronephroi with increased Pax- 2 expression. We conclude that signals from a localized region of the trunk paraxial mesoderm are both required and sufficient for the induction of the pronephros from the chick IM. Studies to identify the molecular nature of the induction are in progress...|$|R
