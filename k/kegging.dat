5|$|In May 2000 the Whitbread Beer Company was {{acquired}} by the Belgian brewer Interbrew, which owned Stella Artois. At that time one in eight barrels of Boddingtons was exported to some 40 countries worldwide, including China, the United States, Taiwan and the West Indies. The Strangeways Brewery <b>kegging</b> facility closed in February 2003 {{with the loss of}} 50 jobs. In August 2003, amidst falling sales, Interbrew relaunched the cask product in the North West of England, with an increased strength. The relaunch was unsuccessful and the changes were reversed.|$|E
5|$|From 1979, keg Stones {{began to}} be {{promoted}} heavily nationwide, and the beer {{was introduced to the}} South of England for the first time. The beer was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the beer would be produced at the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and <b>kegging,</b> but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for the Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s, it was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this was quickly halted after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the beer.|$|E

40|$|What is <b>keg</b> {{registration}} {{and how does}} it work? • <b>Keg</b> registration (or <b>keg</b> tagging) is a tool to identify and punish adults who buy beer <b>kegs</b> for underage youth. • <b>Keg</b> registration policies stipulate that: o Beer <b>kegs</b> are marked with unique identification numbers (using metal or plastic tags, stickers, invisible ink, or engraving). o When a store sells a <b>keg,</b> the <b>keg</b> identification number is recorded along with the purchaser's name, address, telephone number, and driver's license number. These records must be kept for a specified length of time, usually six months to a year. o When a beer <b>keg</b> from which underage youth drink alcohol is confiscated by police, the purchaser of the <b>keg</b> is identified and arrested or fined for supplying alcohol to underage persons. o The <b>keg</b> deposit fee is forfeited if a <b>keg</b> is returned with an identification tag that is defaced or missing...|$|R
50|$|In European {{countries}} {{the most common}} <b>keg</b> size is 50 liters—this includes the UK with its non-metric <b>keg</b> system where the standard <b>keg</b> of 11 imperial gallons is almost exactly 50 liters in the metric system. The German DIN 6647-1 and DIN 6647-2 have also defined <b>kegs</b> in the sizes of 30 and 20 liters. A newer Euro regulation defines 50, 30, 25 and 20 liters where the <b>keg</b> shape is usually thicker but not as tall as the German <b>keg</b> specifications.|$|R
50|$|A cornelius <b>keg</b> (also {{known as}} a Corney or soda <b>keg)</b> is a {{stainless}} steel canister (<b>keg)</b> originally used as containers by the soft drink industry. They {{can be used to}} store and dispense homemade sodas and home brewed beer. Cornelius <b>kegs</b> were originally made by Cornelius, Inc.|$|R
2500|$|The {{corresponding}} term in Australia is dakking, dacking or daxing, which {{originated from}} DAKS Simpson, a clothing brand {{that became a}} generic term for pants and underwear. The term double-dacking is used when both the pants and underwear are pulled down. In Scotland the process is often known as breeking or breekexxing from the word [...] "breeks" [...] meaning trousers. In New Zealand the act is known as giving someone a down trou or [...] "a drou"; in Ireland jocking, zoonking or ka-blinking; {{in the north of}} England <b>kegging</b> (or quegging).|$|E

50|$|A {{crucial part}} of any draft beer system is the <b>keg</b> coupler, the part inside the kegerator that {{actually}} taps the <b>keg.</b> Different types of <b>kegs</b> require different <b>keg</b> couplers, {{so you need to}} consider what you plan on serving and purchase the coupler that is right for you.|$|R
50|$|A sixth barrel <b>keg</b> {{contains}} approximately 5.2 gallons, and {{is becoming}} the choice for many establishments and breweries that wish to use <b>kegs</b> smaller than a half barrel. The sixth barrel <b>kegs</b> are nominally larger in size and volume compared to the Cornelius <b>keg.</b> They are normally fitted with a standard US Type D Sanke coupler on a single downspout; whereas, Corny <b>kegs</b> are normally fitted with a flip-hatch, and a dual connector pin-lock or ball-lock top. Although the sixth barrel torpedo <b>keg</b> is approximately the same height as the standard half barrel, the smaller foot print of the sixth barrel allows retailers have {{a greater variety of}} beer in a small space. This size <b>keg</b> is quickly replacing the quarter barrel size which has the same foot print as a half barrel <b>keg,</b> but is only half as tall. Other than smaller circumference, sixth barrel <b>kegs</b> are very similar to their full-sized counterparts in construction. A stainless Micromatic brand sixth barrel <b>keg</b> weighs approximately 14-15 pounds (6.3-6.8 kg) when empty, and approximately 58-60 pounds (26.3-27.2 kg) when full.|$|R
50|$|The beer vessel supply {{structure}} in the UK and Ireland is quite different, whilst the couplers for <b>kegs</b> have been largely standardised to sankey, grundy and interbrew, a couple of others exist such as UEC and U-Type; however these are much less common. The <b>kegs</b> themselves are made from stainless steel or aluminium. The standard <b>keg</b> size is 11 imperial gallons (50 liter/88 imperial pints approx) {{and the vast majority}} of <b>keg</b> beers are supplied in this <b>keg</b> size. There are also smaller 30 liters (52.76 imperial pints) <b>kegs</b> usually reserved for more specialist and/or premium European beers.|$|R

50|$|The basic {{technique}} for tossing the <b>keg</b> involves swinging the <b>keg</b> in a pendulum like manner and releasing the <b>keg</b> {{when it is}} at its apex. A more experienced athlete uses a spin method similar to a hammer throw. The <b>keg</b> is again released when it is at its apex, allowing for the maximum distance.|$|R
50|$|Draught beer, also spelt draft, is beer served from a cask or <b>keg</b> {{rather than}} from a bottle or can. Draught beer served from a {{pressurised}} <b>keg</b> {{is also known as}} <b>keg</b> beer.|$|R

5000|$|The BBC was criticised {{by several}} teacher unions for a video aired on show of 18 March 2008 that {{apparently}} showed a student running {{up from behind}} and pulling down his teacher's trousers.

While introducing the clip Allen called it <b>kegging</b> and said [...] "It's very childish, but very funny".|$|E
50|$|The mini <b>keg</b> is a 5-liter <b>keg</b> {{produced}} for retail sales. Some brands {{come with a}} spout and pour from the bottom via gravity, while others may use a low cost pressurized tap. Mini <b>kegs</b> are typically not returned to the manufacturer for cleaning and refilling. The disposable <b>kegs,</b> being made of aluminum, may be recycled.|$|R
5000|$|Homebrewers {{often use}} <b>kegs</b> for aging, filtering, and storing beer. These are seldom the {{standard}} <b>kegs</b> used by major brewers to transport draught beer to wholesalers, but instead are reconditioned Cornelius <b>kegs</b> (colloquially known as [...] "cornies") that were originally manufactured to store soda; these vessels are {{much easier to}} fill, clean and maintain than standard beer <b>kegs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Beer <b>kegs</b> {{are made}} of {{stainless}} steel, or less commonly, of aluminium. A <b>keg</b> has a single opening on one end, called a [...] "bung." [...] A tube called a [...] "spear" [...] extends from the opening to the other end. There is a self-closing valve that is opened by the coupling fitting which is attached when the <b>keg</b> is tapped. There is also an opening {{at the top of}} the spear that allows gas (usually carbon dioxide) to drive the beer out of the <b>keg.</b> The coupling fitting has one or two valves that control the flow of beer out of and gas into the <b>keg.</b> The <b>keg</b> must be in the upright position, that is, with the opening on top, for the beer to be dispensed. <b>Kegs</b> can be contrasted to casks, which have two or more openings and no spear. Most major breweries now use internally speared <b>kegs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Sea Dog Brewing Company is a brewery in Bangor, Maine, USA. Sea Dog {{was founded}} by Pete Camplin, Sr. in 1993. Initially, the company {{comprised}} a 240-seat brewpub and a small <b>kegging</b> brewery, located in Camden, Maine. In 1995, Sea Dog {{moved to a new}} facility, comprising a 540-seat restaurant and brewpub {{on the banks of the}} Penobscot River in Bangor. The company is run under the joint ownership of Alan Pugsley and Fred Forsley, who are also the owners of the Shipyard Brewing Company, located in Portland, Maine.|$|E
40|$|A <b>keg</b> asset {{management}} {{system that can}} reduce the annual rate of <b>keg</b> attrition by 5 % to 20 % can deliver significant savings to breweries with large fleets of <b>kegs.</b> A typically large brewery can have at least {{tens of thousands of}} <b>kegs,</b> a sizable investment given an initial cost of around USD 100 per <b>keg.</b> A key element in a <b>keg</b> tracking system is on-line <b>keg</b> identification. This research explores the feasibility of an intelligent machine vision approach to identifying the unique serial number embossed on the dome of each <b>keg</b> at manufacture. The demonstration system developed auto-locates candidate serial numbers and applies optical character recognition (OCR) techniques. The neural network based OCR achieved the best performance over template matching achieving an overall recognition rate of 92 % and no missed digits.
