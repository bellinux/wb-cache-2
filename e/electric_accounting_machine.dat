He worked in sales and managerial positions until his 1931 appointment {{as vice president of}} The Tabulating Machine Company division. In 1933, LaMotte took on the position of general manager of the <b>Electric</b> <b>Accounting</b> <b>Machine</b> Division. He assumed the role of Washington IBM manager for the Washington, D.C. office in 1937. During the 1930s, LaMotte played an integral role in IBM securing a large long-term contract with the Social Security Administration after its creation under the Roosevelt Administration. This contract led to IBM developing the 077 Collator to handle the agency's massive data proceeding needs.|$|E

40|$|Catch Bulletins provide {{records of}} California's {{commercial}} fisheries and their value to fishermen. They also summarize the marine party boat anglers' sport catch. This report for 1961 is the 21 st in the series. Prior records {{have been published}} regularly beginning with those for 1926 and 1927. In recent years, a need for faster publication of catch statistics has made it desirable to publish annually instead of biennially. There has been {{a change in the}} title of the bulletin series from The Marine Fish Catch of California to The California Marine Fish Catch. Each wholesale fish dealer or processor completes a record in quadruplicate of all fish received. The triplicate copy of these receipts is sent to the Department of Fish and Game. Party-boat operators record each trip's catch and these records are also sent to the Department. These data are edited and subsequently processed by <b>electric</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>machines.</b> Published figures are of national and international concern, but they are used primarily by fisheries scientists and legislators to manage and regulate California's important fisheries. Chambers of commerce, members of the fishing industry, educators, and others also find the catch statistics of value in meeting their respective needs...|$|R

50|$|Starting {{at the end}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, well before the advent of {{electronic}} computers, data processing was performed using electromechanical machines called unit record equipment, <b>electric</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>machines</b> (EAM) or tabulating machines.Unit record machines came to be as ubiquitous in industry and government in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century as computers became in the last third. They allowed large volume, sophisticated data-processing tasks to be accomplished before electronic computers were invented and while they were still in their infancy. This data processing was accomplished by processing punched cards through various unit record machines in a carefully choreographed progression. This progression, or flow, from machine to machine was often planned and documented with detailed flowcharts that used standardized symbols for documents and the various machine functions. All but the earliest machines had high-speed mechanical feeders to process cards at rates from around 100 to 2,000 per minute, sensing punched holes with mechanical, electrical, or, later, optical sensors. The operation of many machines was directed by the use of a removable plugboard, control panel, or connection box. Initially all machines were manual or electromechanical. The first use of an electronic component was in 1940 when a gas triode vacuum tube replaced a relay in an IBM card sorter. Electronic components were used on other machines beginning in the late 1940s.|$|R

In recent years, catch bulletins have been published annually instead of biennially. Records are obtained from each wholesale fish dealer or processor who receives fish from fishermen or who processes fish.

Chambers of commerce, members of the fishing industry, educators, and others also find these catch statistics of value. ============================ The Department of Fish and Game's "Catch Bulletins" annually present pounds of salmon landed in the commercial fishery and numbers of salmon taken by anglers on commercial partyboats. These values are compiled from market receipts and from partyboat log books, neither of which separate salmon by species. Minor corrections have been made by the Biostatistical Section to historical commercial troll landing figures. These corrections have been included in Table 1, which therefore varies slightly from previous catch bulletins. The Marine Resources Branch samples both commercial and sport salmon landings to provide estimates of species composition. The sport catch is estimated in number of fish and the commercial catch by both number and weight. Numbers of tagged and marked salmon landed are determined for both fisheries. Estimates are made by port-area and by month. The term "port-area" as used here refers to a group of ports which together form a meaningful unit for separating salmon catches. Ocean skiff fishermen are not required to record their catches, so the sampling system is used to estimate the total landings of this fishery as well as the items mentioned in the preceding paragraph. As used here, the term "skiff" includes all fishing boats other than partyboats or commercial fishing boats...|$|R
