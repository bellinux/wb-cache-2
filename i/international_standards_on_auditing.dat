40|$|The going-concern context {{has been}} the subject of much {{research}} and discussion for many years at both academic and professional levels. The <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>on</b> <b>Auditing</b> (ISA) 570 stipulates that the auditor should consider the appropriateness of managements’ use of the goingconcern assumption and to evaluate whether there are material uncertainties with respect to entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. Regardless of what is stated in the financial statement, the auditor should comment on going-concern uncertainty in the audit report if there is a doubt about firm’s ability to continue as a going concern. There is strong evidence that the auditor’s going-concern decision is a complex task with extensive consequences. The primary purpose of this thesis is to empirically provide significant basis to get better understanding of the challenging nature of the auditor’s going-concern reporting.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>on</b> <b>Auditing</b> number 240 (ISA 240) there has been a paradigm shift in auditing as auditors are now required to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements due to fraud at the financial statement level and to evaluate the sufficiency, implementation and the effectiveness of the controls related to those assessed prone to fraud. This, of course, implies that statutory audit must now take the garb of forensic investigations. The problem with the present system of forensic investigation is that it is focused more on financial transactions than on the totality of the entity’s operations and often time neglects areas where there have been constant leakages of other organizational resources that are of financial consequences but which are not easily detected with a normal analysis of the financial statement.

40|$|Abstract: Sampling {{is widely}} used in market research, {{scientific}} analysis, market analysis, opinion polls and not least in the financial statement audit. We wonder what is actually sampling and how did it appear? Audit sampling involves the application of audit procedures to less than 100 % of items within an account balance or class of transactions. Nowadays the technique is indispensable, the economic entities operating with sophisticated computer systems and large amounts of data. Economic globalization and complexity of capital markets has made possible not only the harmonization of <b>international</b> accounting <b>standards</b> with the national ones, but also the convergence of international accounting and auditing standards with the American regulations. <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>on</b> <b>Auditing</b> 530 and Statement <b>on</b> <b>Auditing</b> <b>Standard</b> 39 are the two main international and American normalized referentials referring to audit sampling. This article discusses the origin of audit sampling, mentioning {{a brief history of}} the method and different definitions from literature review. The two standards are studied using Jaccard indicators in terms of the degree of similarity and dissimilarity concerning different issues. The Jaccard coefficient measures the degree of convergence of <b>international</b> auditing <b>standards</b> (ISA 530) and U. S. auditing <b>standards</b> (SAS 39). <b>International</b> auditing <b>standards</b> and American auditing standards, study the sampling problem, both regulations presenting common points with regard to accepted sampling techniques, factors influencing the audit sample, treatment of identified misstatements and the circumstances in which sampling is appropriate.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} impact of considering key audit matters (KAM) in line with the new IAASB <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>on</b> <b>Auditing</b> ISA 701 <b>on</b> auditor judgment performance related to goodwill impairment testing. Our study uses a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment based on a goodwill impairment testing case. In this experiment with 157 auditors from two Big 4 audit firms in Germany, we manipulated the two independent variables client pressure (high vs. low) and KAM consideration (present vs. absent). Client pressure was manipulated through two different components, client importance and client opposition to making audit adjustments. In the condition in which KAM consideration is present, participants were required to assess the likelihood that they will communicate matters regarding the estimation of the recoverable amount in a separate KAM section of the independent auditor’s report. We opposed this condition with a condition in which participants were only required to assess the likelihood that they will communicate matters regarding the estimation of the recoverable amount with those charged with governance (KAM consideration absent). As dependent variables, we captured skeptical judgment and action as two different facets of auditor judgment performance. Our results suggest that auditors’ reaction to our client pressure manipulation is rather weak (and in fact turns out to be insignificant). If at all, auditors seem to become slightly more skeptical in their judgments and actions when client pressure is high, which might suggest that a reasonableness constraint has been triggered. Furthermore, we find that auditors exhibit significantly less skeptical judgment (and at least possibly also action) when KAM consideration is present than when KAM consideration is absent. This finding suggests that, when considering KAM and due to moral licensing, auditors are more willing to acquiesce to their clients’ desired accounting treatments...|$|R
