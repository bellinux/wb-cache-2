Sometimes, the use of hardware overlays may have to be disabled in the media player. However, some graphics cards have the option to completely redirect hardware overlay to the TV screen.

5000|$|The famous cursive-script logo was {{designed}} by Margaret Grace, a Goldsmith's advertising employee, in October 1946. An updated logo was released in the mid-90s, featuring sans-serif text and a new slogan, [...] "Time After Time". The old logo was never replaced on any existing stores, but the new logo was installed when the new Wolfchase store was constructed. After public outcry {{of the lack of}} the classic logo at the new location, the sans-serif logo was removed after a few weeks and replaced with the classic cursive logo, which remained on all stores until the Macy's name change. While not used on the store buildings themselves, the sans-serif logo was prominently <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> and radio advertisements. For a short time in 2005, advertisements showed a merged [...] "Goldsmith's-Macy's" [...] logo.|$|R
5000|$|Notable works {{include the}} video {{installation}} mmm wow (2012) in which Wong edited together different expressions from Hong Kong television commercials, for example [...] "mmm", [...] "ohhh" [...] and [...] "wow". The looped video works are <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> sets installed with propped up the screens facing the ground. Viewers {{could hear the}} sounds from the TVs, but as the screens faced the ground, they could only see modulating colors reflected {{on the floor as}} the videos looped. In the photographic series Peeled (2010) a watermelon's green rind is peeled to reveal the pink tissue below. The photographs capture a performative gesture which transforms the mundane object of the watermelon into something strange. For Splash (2010), another photographic series, the artist collage cut-out milk splashes from cereal boxes.|$|R

50|$|At the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Sony {{introduced}} the Bloggie 3D MHS-FS3 camcorder with dual lenses and dual sensors that can record video in 3D HD at 1080p with stereo audio.

50|$|Repeater: A {{repeater}} accepts content, decrypts it, then re-encrypts and retransmits the data. It may perform some signal processing, such as upconverting video into a higher-resolution format, or splitting out {{the audio}} {{portion of the}} signal. Repeaters have HDMI inputs and outputs. Examples include home theater audio-visual receivers that separate and amplify the audio signal, while re-transmitting the video for <b>display</b> <b>on</b> a <b>TV.</b> A repeater could also simply send the input data stream to multiple outputs for simultaneous <b>display</b> <b>on</b> several screens.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the representation of}} bodies in todays non-fiction television in Sweden. I have chosen to focus on deviant bodies (sexual, deformed or unhealthy) <b>on</b> <b>display</b> in reality-shows and documentaries <b>on</b> SVT, <b>TV</b> 4 but especially on the commercial channels TV 3 and Kanal 5. Also discussed are the viewers emotional and bodily reactions. Altough these shows are {{different from one another}} in many respects, I argue that there is also a common thread between them. From a sociological and cultural perspective, and with help of some historical examples, I try to illustrate how we view these shows and what their function is. I conclude that the body is a site of powerstruggle and that these shows have many different levels of meaning. We cathegorize and value these deviant bodies but also our own. It is about making creating a ”us and them” and {{in the long run it}} has to do with making class and identity. The voyeuristic pleasure in watching these people <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> is made possible from the safe distance of our livingroom...|$|R
50|$|Other than in {{serviced}} {{restaurants and}} bars, in Japan beer {{can be purchased}} at a wide variety of outlets, including supermarkets, convenience stores, and kiosks at train stations. Beer can also be sold in vending machines although, as of 2012, this has become much less common in major cities. Some vending machines have motion activated advertising that <b>displays</b> <b>on</b> small <b>TV</b> screens embedded into them. They play beer commercials and jingles that are seen <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> and heard <b>on</b> the radio. These vending machines began to be phased out in June 2000, mainly over the concerns of underage drinking.|$|R
50|$|Picture-in-picture (PiP) is {{a feature}} of some {{television}} receivers and similar devices.

40|$|The {{union of}} Interactive Digital TV (IDTV) and Web {{promotes}} {{the development of}} new interactive multimedia services, enjoyable while watching <b>TV</b> even <b>on</b> the new handheld digital TV receivers. Yet, several design constraints complicate the deployment of this new pattern of services. Indeed, for a suitable presentation <b>on</b> a <b>TV</b> set, Web contents must be structured {{in such a way that}} they can be effectively <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> <b>TV</b> screens via low-end Set Top Boxes (STBs). Moreover, usable interfaces for IDTV platforms are needed which ensure a smooth access to contents. Our claim is that the distribution of Web contents over the IDTV broadcast channels may bring IDTV to a new life. A failure of this attempt may put IDTV on a progressive track towards irrelevance. We propose a system for the distribution of Web contents towards IDTV under the Digital Video Broadcasting – Multimedia Home Platform (DVB-MHP) standard. Our system is able to automatically transcode Web contents and ensure a proper visualization on IDTV. The system is endowed with a client application which permits to easily browse contents <b>on</b> the <b>TV</b> via a remote control. Real assessments have confirmed the effectiveness for such an automatic online service able to reconfigure Web contents for an appropriate distribution and presentation on IDTV...|$|R
