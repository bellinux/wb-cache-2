40|$|International audienceAlloy 718 {{is known}} to be {{sensitive}} to <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> formed during ingot solidification. The occurrence of banded grain structures under heat treating conditions close to 1000 ° C related to <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> is often reported. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} this microstructural evolution, an extensive experimental program has been carried out. Consequently, a model taking into account the selective dissolution of δ-phase (Ni 3 Nb) is proposed. A grain growth simulation by Monte-Carlo method is then used to illustrate the grain structure evolution in a banded particle distribution. By comparing experimental data and computer simulation, the relationship between the Monte-Carlo step and the real time is assessed and the range of parameters when heterogeneous microstructures appear is specified...|$|E
40|$|The Ni-base {{superalloy}} MAR-M 246 (Hf) was {{directionally solidified}} during low gravity maneuvers aboard a NASA KC- 135 aircraft. Gravity force variations {{during this process}} yielded a concomitant variation in microstructure and microsegregation. Secondary dendrite arm spacings are noted to be larger in the low-g portion; this, in turn, decreases the extent of <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation.</b> The amount of Hf in both the carbides and interdendritic eutectic increases as the gravity force diminishes. Fewer carbides {{are present in the}} low-g regions...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{correlation}} between segregation of carbide forming elements (vanadium) and void initiation and propagation in low-alloyed Cr-Mo steels. The internal defects are created during blooms straightening in radial type of casting machine due to strain deformation field in the temperature range characteristic for vanadium nitride, carbide or carbonitride precipitation. Based on the statistical analysis (1097 continuously cast blooms) of three low-alloyed Cr-Mo steel variants with different vanadium content, we conclude that the void occurence is strongly associated {{with the level of}} vanadium content. The experiments performed by means of microstructural, fractographic investigations and microchemical point analysis proved that preffered areas for void initiation are <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregations</b> in the core of bloom. We observed vanadium carbide precipitates that are situated close to the cracks, whereas the content of vanadium was 7, 5 times more then in an average smelt composition. The further development of defects is connected with fast heating up to the austenization temperature in soaking pit. Our results confirm that marked decrease of defects can be achieved by optimization of production process, i. e. optimized casting speed, steel overheat above the liquidus temperature and/or application of M-EMS...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of experimental}} nickel-base single crystal superalloys with {{different levels of}} carbon has been studied. The results indicated that with increasing carbon addition, the liquidus temperature decreased obviously and the as-cast microstructures exhibited {{a decrease in the}} amount of γ/γ′ eutectic structure and an increase in the volume fraction of carbides. The carbides formed in these alloys were most script-type MC carbides which appeared continuous dendritic networks in the <b>interdendritic</b> region. The <b>segregation</b> behavior of element W was influenced by the carbon addition...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the characterization of alloy from Fe-Cr-C (carbon content 0. 79 wt. %) system including the microstructure, phase analysis, morphology and hardness in as cast state. The chemical composition was designed to create chromium-rich ferritic matrix with high volume fraction of carbides in form of interdendritic eutectics. The research was carried out on the cross section of the ingot, synthesized in an arc furnace under high purity argon atmosphere and crystallized on water-cooled copper mould. Microstructural characterization was carried out by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Phase identification was performed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD). The microstructure of the investigated alloy is composed of primary and secondary dendrites Fe-Cr solid solution and complex M 23 C 6 and M 7 C 3 carbides in <b>interdendritic</b> areas. <b>Segregation</b> of Cr and C during crystallization causes precipitation of M 7 C 3 carbides.

40|$|Abstract. The microstructures and the {{solidification}} processes {{simulation of}} multi-principal high-entropy alloy FeCoNiCrMn were studied by using both experimental and computational approaches. The microstructures {{were identified by}} methods of XRD, SEM and EDS. The solidification process was simulated by Scheil-Gulliver solidification model. The alloy mainly forms a single FCC solid solution, but Mn atoms, as well as Ni atoms tend to be enriched in residual liquid phase during the solidification process. These atoms show <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation.</b> Present experimental results and computational results are supported each other well...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} shown that it is {{possible}} to design a `pseudo-composite' structure by profiting from <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> in an `as cast' structure at compositions near the austenite and epsiv -martensite regions in Fe-Mn alloys intended for the preparation of new cryogenic materials. In this structure, the center of the dendrites, poor in manganese, undergoes martensitic transformation, thus contributing to reinforcement, while the interdendritic austenite regions-richer in manganese-form a continuous network thus acting as obstacles which renders the propagation of fissures more difficult.

40|$|Abstract. Directional {{solidification}} (DS) of FeCoNiCrAl high entropy alloy {{is carried}} out to investigate the microstructures and microsegregation under controlled solidification conditions. With an increasing solidification rate, the interface morphology grows in a planar, cellular and dendritic manner. The microstructures of the dendritic and <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> areas {{are found to be}} spherical precipitates and basket-weave structures, respectively. With the help of an electron microprobe, microsegregation is determined in directionally solidified FeCoNiCrAl high entropy alloys. In contrast to the as-cast condition, directional solidification can refine microstructures of FeCoNiCrAl high entropy alloy dramatically and reduce microsegregation effectively...|$|E
40|$|Binary Co-Cr alloys {{containing}} various Cr contents were {{vacuum induction}} melted and cast into wedge-shaped copper molds. It {{was intended to}} develop a microstructure (1) free from <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> and porosity; (2) having minimal intermetallic precipitates; and (3) suitable for biomedical applications. The resultant microstructures were evaluated from sections obtained longitudinally and centrally in the plane normal to the diverging wedge faces. All ingots showed a dendritic microstructure with some characteristic features. For instance, in Co- 20 – 30 wt. % Cr alloys, the chilled cast microstructures consisted of columnar dendrites without <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation,</b> a minimum of intermetallic precipitates, {{and the presence of}} a predominantly athermal HCP ε-martensite (> 80 vol. %). In addition, the metastable FCC γ-Co phase was identified by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. In the case of 35 – 44 wt. % Cr cobalt alloys, a eutectic constituent including the σ-phase were found to develop in the interdendritic regions. From this work, a Co- 20 wt. % Cr alloy was chosen for further investigation after heat treating below the γ/ε transition temperature. The resultant tensile strength and ductility were further improved after applying a heat treatment at 730 °C for 30 min, obtaining values of elongation of 26 % as compared with 2. 55 < 5 of elongation in the as cast condition. Also, the alloy corrosion resistance in artificial saliva was investigated. It was found that the exhibited corrosion rates for the as-cast and heat-treated conditions are between those reported for other similar systems...|$|E
40|$|The <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> {{along the}} mushy zone of directionally solidifi ed {{superalloy}} Inconel 718 has been measured by {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) and energy dispersion analysis spectrometry (EDAX) techniques and the corresponding liquid composition profile was presented. The liquid density and Rayleigh number (Ra) profi les along the mushy zone were calculated as well. It {{was found that the}} liquid density difference increased from top to bottom in the mushy zone and there was no density inversion due to the segregation of Nb and Mo. However carbide formation in the freezing range and the preferred angle of the orientated dendrite array could prompt the fl uid fl ow in the mushy zone although there was no liquid density inversion. The largest relative Rayleigh number appeared at 1, 326 篊 for Inconel 718 where the fl uid fl ow most easily occurred...|$|E
40|$|Developing the {{techniques}} of welding materials with higher dynamic strength onto the rolling surfaces of rails {{is one of the}} options for increasing their operational endurance. The subject of this paper is an analyses of heterogeneous weld interfaces experimentally manufactured by welding medium-carbon austenitic steels onto high-carbon unalloyed pearlitic steels. The analyses focus on examinations of the marginal mixing of the materials at the weld interface and the circumstances under which intercrystalline cracks form in the weld deposit layers. Structural analyses, chemical microanalyses and a hardness assessment were performed in order to identify the corresponding structural changes. The proportion of zonal vs. <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> of the alloying elements in the degradation of the welded joint was distinguished. We described the nature of the structural heterogeneities produced, locally connected with the martensitic transformation. The chemical heterogeneity leading to the formation of martensite at grain boundaries was identified as the limiting effect. </p...|$|E
40|$|Electrospark {{deposition}} (ESD) {{was employed}} to clad the AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) on AISI 1045 carbon steel. The relationship between the microstructure and corrosion properties of the HEA-coated specimens was studied and {{compared with that of}} the copper-molded cast HEA material. Two major microstructural {{differences were found between the}} cast HEA material and the HEA coatings. First, the cast material comprises both columnar and equiaxed crystals with a columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET), whereas the HEA coatings consist of an entirely columnar crystal structure. The CET phenomenon was analyzed based on Hunt's criterion. Second, unlike the cast HEA material, there was no obvious Cr-rich <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> and nano-sized precipitate distributed within the dendrites of the HEA coating. With regard to corrosion properties, the corrosion current of the HEA-coated specimen was significantly lower than for the 1045 steel and the cast HEA material. This was attributed to the ESD specimen having a relatively high Cr oxide and Al oxide content at the surface. Moreover, for the ESD specimen, the absence of Cr-rich interdendritic phase and second-phase precipitation resulted in a relatively uniform corrosion attack, which is different from the severe galvanic corrosion attack that occurred in the cast specimen.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that the rare-earth {{elements}} (RE) have exhibited favorable microalloying effects on the microstructure and properties of silver alloys. In the present investigation, {{a detailed description of the}} microstructure of a Silver- 4 wt. %Copper- 0. 3 wt. % Nickle as–cast alloy containing 0. 2 wt. % of a cerium element was presented. Particles types occurring and their distribution in the microstructure, as well as the distribution of elements in the phases were described. The result show that the second phase in Ag-Cu-Ni Alloy is Cu-Ni-rich solution phase, some of which forms <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> in Ag matrix as eutectic colonies. Trace additions of cerium to the alloy decrease eutectic proportion and size of the Cu-Ni-rich phase, result in finer and more uniform secondary phases distributed in the α-Ag matrix. Besides Cu-Ni-rich phase, the Ni-Cu-Ce-rich and Ag-Cu-Ce-rich phases were found in the alloy. The Ni-Cu-Ce-rich should be the (NiCu) 5 Ce, which is distributed as dispersive particle in the Ag matrix, and Ag-Cu-Ce-rich phases should be (AgCu) 4 Ce, which is distributed as fibrous particle of eutectic colonies. Some of (AgCu) 4 Ce phases are located at the interface between α-Ag matrix and Cu-Ni-rich phases, which indicate that Ce could be segregated at the frontier of Cu-Ni-rich phases during the growth, causing Cu-Ni-rich phase refinement...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the formation of}} bimodal ferrite grain structures (i. e. mixed coarse + fine grain sizes) in TMCR HSLA steel plates, as-continuously cast HSLA steel slabs with varying microalloying additions (Ti, Nb and V) were reheated to temperatures in the range 1000 - 1300 °C and deformed at 1110 °C and 980 °C temperatures in Gleeble 3500. The <b>interdendritic</b> <b>segregation</b> during continuous casting and the consequent inhomogeneous microalloying precipitate distributions (with interdendritic regions being the precipitate-rich regions) has resulted in severely bimodal austenite grain structures under certain reheat conditions (due to the significantly higher pinning force in solute-rich regions compared to solute-poor regions). The segregation of microalloying elements can also promote bimodality during deformation by affecting the local recrystallisation kinetics. Notch-bend fracture tests were performed at – 160 °C to investigate {{the effect of a}} bimodal grain size distribution on fracture toughness by comparing local fracture stress values for uniformly fine, uniformly coarse and bimodal ferrite grain structures. Analysis of local fracture stress values suggests that bimodality can raise the scatter in the fracture test results and therefore, it is undesirable. Current methods of measuring bimodality are not useful at consistently quantifying small differences in bimodality between microstructures of steel, and hence, two easy-to-measure parameters (peak height ratio, PHR and peak grain size range, PGSR) have been suggested in this study to quantify bimodality in HSLA steels.
