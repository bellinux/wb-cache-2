2500|$|In finance, a {{convertible}} bond or [...] convertible note or convertible debt (or {{a convertible}} debenture {{if it has}} a maturity of greater than 10 years) is a type of bond that the holder can convert into a specified number of shares of common stock in the issuing company or cash of equal value. [...] It is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>security</b> with debt- and equity-like features. It originated in the mid-19th century, and was used by early speculators such as Jacob Little and Daniel Drew to counter market cornering. [...] Convertible bonds are most often issued by companies with a low credit rating and high growth potential. [...] Convertible bonds are also considered debt security because the companies agree to give fixed or floating interest rate as they do in common bonds for the funds of investor.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hybrid</b> <b>securities</b> are {{becoming}} {{an increasingly important}} component of the capital structure of Australian firms. While displaying characteristics of both debt and equity, one principal equity attribute of hybrids is their ability to pay franked dividends. This enables resident domestic investors to claim corporate tax payments as a credit against personal tax obligations under Australia's dividend imputation tax system. This paper estimates a value for the 'franking credits' that attach to <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities</b> by examining stock price changes around ex-dividend dates. We add to the literature that examines the ex-day price changes of ordinary shares (OS) in that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities</b> we examine have high dividend yields and are relatively insensitive to market movements. Therefore the signal-to-noise ratio is much higher than for OS. Our analysis reveals that cum-dividend day prices on <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities</b> do not include any value for franking credits. This result is consistent with the notion that the price-setting investor in the Australian market is a foreign investor who places no value on franking credits. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors.

40|$|Introducing {{a revolutionary}} new {{quantitative}} approach to <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities</b> valuation and risk management To an equity trader they are shares. For the trader at the fixed income desk, they are bonds (after all, they pay coupons, so what's the problem?). They are <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities.</b> Neither equity nor debt, they possess characteristics of both, and carry unique risks that cannot be ignored, but are often woefully misunderstood. The {{first and only}} book of its kind, The Handbook of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Securities</b> dispels the many myths and misconceptions about <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities</b> and arms you with a quantitative, practical {{approach to dealing with}} them from a valuation and risk management point of view. •Describes a unique, quantitative approach to hybrid valuation and risk management that uses new structural and multi-factor models •Provides strategies for the full range of hybrid asset classes, including convertible bonds, preferreds, trust preferreds, contingent convertibles, bonds labeled "additional Tier 1," and more •Offers an expert review of current regulatory climate regarding hybrids, globally, and explores likely political developments and their potential impact on the hybrid market •The most up-to-date, in-depth book on the subject, this is a valuable working resource for traders, analysts and risk managers, and a indispensable reference for regulatorsnrpages: 408 status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Exchangeable bond (or XB) {{is a type}} of <b>hybrid</b> <b>security</b> {{consisting}} of a straight bond and an embedded option to exchange the bond for the stock of a company other than the issuer (usually a subsidiary or company in which the issuer owns a stake) at some future date and under prescribed conditions.

5000|$|Hybrid {{securities}} have skyrocketed {{in popularity}} since Moody's released {{a new set}} of guidelines for treating debt-equity hybrids in February 2005. The new guidelines establish a [...] "debt-equity continuum" [...] and allow institutions to classify part of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>security</b> as equity and part as debt (in a shift from the previous policy, that counted the entire amount as debt). This change allowed companies to issue hybrid securities at a time of record low interest rates (and thus gain access to cheap capital) and then use the proceeds to repurchase equity shares (which have a very high cost of capital). Since {{only a fraction of the}} recapitalization would be listed as debt on the balance sheet, hybrids allowed companies to repurchase more shares than previously without negatively affecting their credit rating.|$|E

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen high levels {{of growth in the}} use of <b>hybrid</b> {{financial}} <b>securities</b> by Australian corporations. The conventional explanation for this phenomenon has been that <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities</b> represent a highly flexible tool capable of deployment towards the end of reducing overall firm cost of capital, whilst at the same time providing attractive return streams to investors. In this paper, we suggest that this approach to conceptualising and explaining the increasing popularity of <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities</b> is tantamount to asserting the existence of a financial magic pudding. Instead, we contend that the rise in popularity of <b>hybrid</b> financial <b>securities</b> can be better explained by their capacity to assist their issuers take place in sophisticated regulatory arbitrage. We find irony in this, given that the rise in the popularity of instruments whose key purpose is to circumvent regulation has taken place during a period of heightened focus on good corporate governance and transparency and consistency in financial reporting. We tender evidence to support our contention that hybrids are better understood as tools of arbitrage than tools of effective capital management by demonstrating that the cost of <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities</b> is not as low as has been conventionally thought. Further, we present evidence of the material distortions to measures of leverage, earnings and operating cashflows which result when firms use hybrids to play the regulatory arbitrage game. We conclude by arguing that further reform to the current regulatory regime is required in order {{to improve the quality of}} contemporary financial reporting. 26 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{tax rates}} (ETRs) are useful tools to make {{comparisons}} between different tax systems. However, the existing ETR measures {{are based on}} rather simplifying assumptions. In particular, they disregard the existence {{of different kinds of}} debt and <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities.</b> In this paper, we use contingent-claim analysis to calculate the ETR. We will therefore deal with both pure debt and two of the most well-known <b>hybrid</b> <b>securities,</b> that is, convertible and reverse convertible bonds. We will show that effective taxation crucially depends on the characteristics of debt and that the existing measures of ETR can be dramatically biased, since they account neither for default risk nor for the ability to convert debt into equity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this note}} I use a simple method to value a complex <b>hybrid</b> <b>security.</b> I {{evaluate}} a convertible callable bond issue, adopting an incremental approach where the different {{features of the}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>security</b> are added sequentially.

40|$|It {{is getting}} more common for two or more parties to jointly compute some statistics, say for marketing, by {{combining}} information on their private databases without disclosing the private data to the others. The core problem is usually known as secure multi-party computation (SMC). A number of solutions have been proposed. However, {{almost all of them}} assume a semi-honest model which is unrealistic. On the other hand, protocols that work under the malicious model (all participating parties can be malicious) are usually complicated and expensive in terms of communication and computation. In this paper, we try to consider a more reasonable model, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>security</b> model, in which at least one party is semi-honest. We {{want to make sure that}} the malicious parties will not get the correct final result if they perform malicious behaviors. We propose a scheme to solve the two-party weighted average problem (WAP) under this <b>hybrid</b> <b>security</b> model. We also show that the scheme can be extended to work under the malicious model using any fair exchange scheme. We formally show that our schemes are secure. We also implemented the schemes and showed that our scheme under the <b>hybrid</b> <b>security</b> model is reasonably fast and efficient for practical use. © 2012 AICIT. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
