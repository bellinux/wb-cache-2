40|$|<b>Electricity</b> <b>supply</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as the key constraint to industrialization and economic development in Nigeria. Recently, the government of Nigeria has initiated a lot of projects aimed at boosting <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> but this effort seems to yield no positive results. This may be attributed to the inability of policy makers to identify the determinants of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> for actual policy formulation and implementation. Hence, this study analyzed the determinants of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in Nigeria (from 1970 - 2009), using a parametric econometric methodology of ordinary least squares. The results showed that technology, government funding, and the level of power loss were the statistically significant determinants of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in Nigeria and that an average of 40 % of power is lost in transmission per annum. Thus, the government should inject more funds into the power sector to complete power projects with state of the art technology in order to enhance <b>electricity</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R

40|$|Nigeria’s {{economic}} history is coloured with {{various types of}} crises and fluctuations in important macroeconomic variables. These include crises in electricity generation and distribution, domestic and external debt crisis, {{balance of payments disequilibrium}} and fluctuations in key macroeconomic variables such as broad money supply, exchange rate, real GDP growth rate etc. This paper has attempted to investigate the impact of stabilization policies (monetary and fiscal policies) and <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> on economic development in Nigeria using the OLS estimation technique. The time series characteristics of the variables were tested using the Ng and Perron (2001) modified unit root test and the (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration proposed by Pesaran et al (2001). The result of the parsimonious estimates showed that broad money supply, government expenditure and <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> were important determinants of per capita GDP growth rate in Nigeria. To test for the importance of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in the model, we run the regression first without <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> and then with <b>electricity</b> <b>supply,</b> the inclusion of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in the regression significantly improved the diagnostic statistics. The findings of this paper showed that albeit demand management is useful for the purpose of economic stabilization in Nigeria, it is equally important for policy makers to address <b>supply</b> issues, especially <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> This is because as the study shows, <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> is important to drive economic growth and development to the desired threshold...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, 2003. The monopolistic South African <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> {{industry}} {{is undergoing a}} transformation that would change its ownership and market structure. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether the strategic choice to transform the {{industry is}} indeed appropriate. A qualitative, case based study of the existing and proposed South African <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry was performed. Various strategic tools and techniques, related to both strategic theory and <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry models, formed the basis of the evaluation. It was found that to overcome the critical weaknesses in the industry and to take advantage of the opportunities present in the dynamic and complex <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry the restructuring is appropriate. The restructuring would allow the South African Government to meet its objectives of having an efficient <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry and meet the huge suppressed demand for low cost electrification. South Africa intends adopting the wholesale competition model, however this study recommends that it should implement the single-buyer model. Should the restructuring be successfully implemented, customers in the South African <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry can expect high quality electricity at a competitive price...|$|R
