40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a general}} view that {{electronic}} gaming is the most &# 039;addictive&# 039; form of gambling, in that it contributes more to causing problem gambling than any other gambling activity. As such, electronic <b>gaming</b> <b>machines</b> have {{been referred to as}} the &# 039;crack-cocaine&# 039; of gambling. While this analogy has popular appeal, it is only recently that the scientific community has begun to investigate its validity. In line with the belief that electronic gambling has a higher &# 039;addictive&# 039; potential than other forms of gambling, research has also begun to focus on identifying the characteristics of <b>gaming</b> <b>machines</b> that may be associated with problem gambling behaviour. AIMS AND METHODS: Aims and methods This paper will review the different types of modern electronic <b>gaming</b> <b>machines,</b> and will use the introduction of <b>gaming</b> <b>machines</b> to Australia to examine the association between electronic gaming and problem gambling, with particular reference to the characteristics of modern electronic <b>gaming</b> <b>machines.</b> FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Despite overwhelming acceptance that <b>gaming</b> <b>machines</b> are associated with the highest level of problem gambling, the empirical literature provides inconclusive evidence to support the analogy likening electronic gaming to &# 039;crack-cocaine&# 039;. Rigorous and systematic evaluation is required to establish definitively the absolute &# 039;addictive&# 039; potential of <b>gaming</b> <b>machines</b> {{and the degree to which}} machine characteristics influence the development and maintenance of problem gambling behaviour...|$|R
2500|$|WMS {{entered the}} reel-spinning slot machine market in 1994, and its {{products}} {{have helped to}} move the industry trend away from generic mechanical slot machines and toward games that incorporate familiar intellectual properties. [...] For {{more than a century}} beginning in the late 1800s, mechanical slot machine reels employed limited themes: card suits, horseshoes, bells and stars, varieties of fruit, black bars and the Liberty Bell. WMS's video gaming roots would prove to be its strength when, in 1996, it introduced its first hit casino slot machine, Reel ‘em In, a [...] "multi-line, multi-coin secondary bonus" [...] video slot machine. [...] WMS followed this with a number of similar successful games like Jackpot Party, Boom and Filthy Rich. [...] Meanwhile, by 1996, WMS had transferred all of the copyrights and trademarks in its video game library to Midway, including Defender, Stargate, , Joust and Smash TV, as it took Midway public and finally spun it off in 1998. [...] With the closing of its pinball division in 1999, WMS focused entirely on the <b>gaming</b> <b>machine</b> industry. [...] During the 1990s, that industry grew as additional states permitted casino gambling and video lottery games and as Native American tribes built gaming casinos.|$|E
2500|$|One day, Taurus {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from the head of Commodore Europe, wanting to discuss the future of the Amiga, and Taurus' software's suitability for the system. Molyneux was invited to Commodore Europe's headquarters, and he was offered several Amiga systems and a space at a show in Germany. When Molyneux was told that they were anticipating getting his network running on the Amiga, he realised that they had mistaken his company for one called Torus, a producer of networking systems. Molyneux wanted the Amiga systems, so did not inform Commodore of the error. He received them and began writing a database program called Acquisition. Commodore kept asking about the database, and Molyneux gave them excuses because they were threatening to shut Taurus down. When Acquisition was finished, it was shown at the show in Germany, and won product of the year. 2000 copies were sold to a company in the United States, giving Molyneux and Edgar funds to sustain Taurus. Another program Taurus wrote was a Computer Aided Design package called X-CAD. They knew the Amiga was becoming a <b>gaming</b> <b>machine,</b> and a friend of Molyneux's asked him to convert Druid II: Enlightenment from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga. It was around this time Bullfrog was founded in preparation for (according to Edgar) when Acquisition was no longer important and they could focus on games. Bullfrog was originally a brand of Taurus; Molyneux explained that this was because they wanted to avoid confusion over business software and money-making opportunities. The name came from an ornament of a bullfrog located in the office: when asked by [...] why the name [...] "Bullfrog" [...] was chosen, Molyneux stated that they wanted [...] "an idiotic name" [...] without having to find one, and there happened to be a sculpture of a colourful frog on a pedestal labelled [...] "Bull Frog by Leonardo" [...] on the table. Afterwards, Molyneux and Edgar were running out of money, and Edgar suggested that they close the company down. This was when Molyneux {{came up with the idea}} of Populous. The conversion of Druid II: Enlightenment, Populous, and a shoot 'em up game called Fusion were the first games developed under the Bullfrog brand.|$|E
