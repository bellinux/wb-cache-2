25|$|Annual {{fees are}} up to about £27,000 per year for {{boarders}} or about £34,000 for international boarders (2014–15). Like most public schools, King's is a non-profit educational body and a registered charity, and as such benefits from substantial tax breaks. It was calculated by David Jewell, master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks save the school about £1,945 per pupil per year. The school offers bursaries and allowances, £1,575,525 was provided in 2013, and scholarships which totalled £304,197. These include music scholarships—amounting to around two-thirds for choristers whilst serving in the Cathedral Choir, and a third scholarship upon their continuation as a pupil in the Senior School. There are further major and minor scholarships for music, sports and academic performance. The Senior School occasionally offers a large major scholarship for a promising organist or musician who is of a particularly high quality. Like many public schools, King's offers <b>fee</b> <b>reductions</b> when more than one child attends, and {{to the children of}} staff members. There also bursaries for children of the Clergy, Armed Forces and to those who would otherwise {{not be able to afford}} it, on a means tested basis.

50|$|A tie-in {{initiative}} {{associated with}} local government bad conduct events {{can also be}} incorporated into a Proposition 218 compensatory initiative (a compensatory tie-in hybrid initiative). As an example, suppose a local initiative under Proposition 218 is pursued to reduce or repeal a local government utility fee and the local government subsequently sues the initiative proponents to prevent the ballot initiative from proceeding or seeks to invalidate the initiative. As a potential legislative remedy, the initiative proponents could file a compensatory initiative providing for the reduction or repeal of a utility users tax imposed by the local government with a tie-in to local bad conduct events associated with the utility <b>fee</b> <b>reduction</b> or repeal initiative that was previously filed. The practical effect {{of this approach is}} that the local government could be facing a substantial loss of utility user tax revenues if it continues with its bad conduct in connection with the utility <b>fee</b> <b>reduction</b> or repeal initiative. If the local government were to subsequently act more responsibly in connection with the utility <b>fee</b> <b>reduction</b> or repeal initiative (such as dropping a lawsuit and allowing the measure to proceed to the ballot if sufficient signatures are obtained), the loss of utility user tax revenues would be minimal.|$|R

50|$|Completing her {{schooling}} in 1914, Petkova {{worked as}} a teacher {{for two years and}} then entered Sofia University to study law. Though she was allowed to study, prohibitions at the time would not allow her to be employed in the profession. Among her fellow classmates were Dimitrana Ivanova, who would become a leader in the Bulgarian women's movement and an influence on Petkova. Graduating from university in 1922, Petkova began working at the Ministry of Finance.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} at {{the individual}} practice level physician behavioral responses to the Medicare <b>fee</b> <b>reductions</b> mandated in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. Symmetric and nonsymmetric behavioral responses are modeled and investigated. DATA SOURCES: Volume index calculated from data in the Part B Medicare Annual Data (BMAD) Provider Files for 1989 and 1990. The pricing data are from the Procedure Files. STUDY DESIGN: A fixed-effects model in carrier and in specialty is employed. DATA COLLECTION: No direct data collection is required as BMAD files {{are used in the}} study. Price and volume variables are expressed as Fisher indexes of change. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results show nonsymmetrical behavioral response because practices that did not face significant <b>fee</b> <b>reductions</b> do not exhibit behavioral change. By contrast, losers partially compensate for the <b>fee</b> <b>reductions.</b> For every dollar cut in their fees, physicians recoup approximately 40 cents by increasing volume. Loser behavioral responses vary by specialty. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a volume response suggests that price control alone is not sufficient to cap rising healthcare costs. This indicates that additional or other tools must be considered if cost containment is to be attained...|$|E

But there are no long term effects on men affected by the famine in their early years of life. In the third chapter, I investigate the impact of school quality on students’ educational attainment using a regression discontinuity research design that compares students just above and below entrance examination score thresholds that strictly determine admission to the best high schools in China’s rural counties. Using data from Gansu Province in China, I find that attending the best high school in one’s county of residence decreases the probability to take college entrance examination; increases college entrance scores and the probability of entering college...|$|E
