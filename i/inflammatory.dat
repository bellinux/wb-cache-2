5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic <b>inflammatory</b> response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this <b>inflammatory</b> state. The <b>inflammatory</b> cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by <b>inflammatory</b> mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by <b>inflammatory</b> cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to <b>inflammatory</b> mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
5|$|No immune or <b>inflammatory</b> {{response}} to infection.|$|E
5|$|Originally, plantar {{fasciitis}} {{was believed}} to be an <b>inflammatory</b> condition of the plantar fascia. However, within the last decade, studies have observed microscopic anatomical changes indicating that plantar fasciitis is actually due to a noninflammatory structural breakdown of the plantar fascia rather than an <b>inflammatory</b> process.|$|E
5|$|This <b>inflammatory</b> cascade {{typically}} {{leads to}} the formation of <b>inflammatory</b> acne lesions, including papules, infected pustules, or nodules. If the <b>inflammatory</b> reaction is severe, the follicle can break into the deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and cause the formation of deep nodules. Involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned <b>inflammatory</b> cascade leads to activation of matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation.|$|E
5|$|As Johnson became {{successful}} and his reputation grew, other publishers began including him in congers—syndicates that spread {{the risk of}} publishing a costly or <b>inflammatory</b> book among several firms.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used as}} an {{anti-inflammatory}} {{agent for}} both acute and long-term inflammation, {{as well as for}} treatment of <b>inflammatory</b> diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Autoinflammatory syndromes are a {{group of}} {{inherited}} disorders characterized by bouts of <b>inflammatory</b> skin lesions and periodic fevers.|$|E
5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an <b>inflammatory</b> {{lung disease}} of unknown cause. It is a severe, {{progressive}} form of bronchiolitis, an <b>inflammatory</b> {{condition of the}} bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|E
5|$|Eosinophilic {{cutaneous}} conditions encompass a {{wide variety}} of diseases that are characterized histologically by the presence of eosinophils in the <b>inflammatory</b> infiltrate, or evidence of eosinophil degranulation.|$|E
5|$|Lichenoid eruptions are dermatoses {{related to}} the unique, common <b>inflammatory</b> {{disorder}} lichen planus, which affects the skin, mucous membranes, nails, and hair.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a chronic}} <b>inflammatory</b> demyelinating disease {{that affects the}} central nervous system (CNS). Several therapies for it exist, although there is no known cure.|$|E
5|$|Multiple sclerosis, an <b>inflammatory</b> {{process that}} may produce {{a loss of}} the myelin sheathes which {{surround}} the cranial nerves, may cause a variety of shifting symptoms affecting multiple cranial nerves.|$|E
5|$|Nonpathogenic E. coli strain Nissle 1917, {{also known}} as Mutaflor, and E. coli O83:K24:H31 (known as Colinfant) are used as {{probiotic}} agents in medicine, mainly {{for the treatment of}} various gastroenterological diseases, including <b>inflammatory</b> bowel disease.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic <b>inflammatory</b> {{disease or}} pelvic <b>inflammatory</b> {{disorder}} (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia is an <b>inflammatory</b> {{condition}} of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Typically symptoms include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing. Severity is variable.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is a common, chronic, and {{recurrent}} <b>inflammatory</b> {{disease of}} the skin characterized by circumscribed, erythematous, dry, scaling plaques.|$|E
5|$|Reactive neutrophilic {{cutaneous}} conditions {{constitute a}} spectrum of disease mediated by neutrophils, and typically associated with underlying diseases, such as <b>inflammatory</b> bowel disease and hematologic malignancy.|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic {{dermatitis}} is a chronic, superficial, <b>inflammatory</b> disease {{characterized by}} scaling on an erythematous base.|$|E
5|$|Several media {{analysts were}} called by Jordanian {{officials}} and {{told not to}} make <b>inflammatory</b> statements. At least one local journalist working with the foreign media was detained and questioned.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses use serpins {{to disrupt}} {{protease}} functions in their host. The cowpox viral serpin CrmA (cytokine response modifier A) {{is used in}} order to avoid <b>inflammatory</b> and apoptotic responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host's <b>inflammatory</b> response through inhibition of IL-1 and L-18 processing by the cysteine protease caspase-1. In eukaryotes, a plant serpin inhibits both metacaspases and a papain-like cysteine protease.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{bacteria in the}} stomach may be beneficial, reducing the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis, <b>inflammatory</b> bowel disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal cancer by influencing systemic immune responses.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{expression}} is regulated by histone acetylation and deacetylation, and this regulation is also applicable to <b>inflammatory</b> genes. <b>Inflammatory</b> lung diseases {{are characterized by}} expression of specific <b>inflammatory</b> genes such as NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factor. Treatments with corticosteroids and theophylline for <b>inflammatory</b> lung diseases interfere with HAT/HDAC activity to turn off <b>inflammatory</b> genes.|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} CRP in {{differentiating}} <b>inflammatory</b> diseases (including <b>inflammatory</b> bowel disease, intestinal lymphoma, intestinal tuberculosis, and Behcet's syndrome) {{has been investigated}} and compared to other <b>inflammatory</b> biomarkers, such as ESR and WBC.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{indications}} that pelvic <b>inflammatory</b> disease {{may be associated}} with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries. It {{may be due to the}} <b>inflammatory</b> process present with pelvic <b>inflammatory</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} of <b>inflammatory</b> bowel disease and Coeliac disease found that anti-tTG was {{increased}} in <b>inflammatory</b> bowel disease although most cases were not clinical CD. IBD was increased 10 fold in coeliac disease. <b>Inflammatory</b> bowel disease consists of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal {{prolapse}} syndrome (MPS) {{is recognized}} by some. It includes solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, rectal prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and <b>inflammatory</b> polyps. It {{is classified as}} a chronic benign <b>inflammatory</b> disorder.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being the cellular effector of hemostasis, platelets are rapidly deployed to sites of injury or infection, and potentially modulate <b>inflammatory</b> processes by interacting with leukocytes and by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and other <b>inflammatory</b> mediators.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inflammatory</b> {{parameters}} in {{the blood}} may be slightly raised (these include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and white blood cell count), but raised <b>inflammatory</b> markers are strong predictors of other more serious conditions such as septic arthritis.|$|E
25|$|All eczemas are {{characterized}} by spongiosis which allows <b>inflammatory</b> mediators to accumulate. Different dendritic cells subtypes, such as Langerhans cells, <b>inflammatory</b> dendritic epidermal cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells {{have a role to}} play.|$|E
25|$|Integrin ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are {{activated}} by <b>inflammatory</b> cytokines, while ICAM-2 is constitutively expressed by some endothelial cells but downregulated by <b>inflammatory</b> cytokines. ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 share two homologous N-terminal domains; both can bind LFA-1.|$|E
25|$|The {{atherosclerotic}} {{process is}} not fully understood. Atherosclerosis is initiated by <b>inflammatory</b> processes in the endothelial cells of the vessel wall associated with retained low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. This retention may be a cause, an effect, or both, of the underlying <b>inflammatory</b> process.|$|E
25|$|Subepithelial T {{lymphocyte}} <b>inflammatory</b> infiltrate.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis {{typically}} {{causes a}} non-specific and granulomatous <b>inflammatory</b> response. Lymphocytes, histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells and neutrophils are recruited. The host responses are highly variable, often include cyst formation, and vary from weak reaction to an intense <b>inflammatory</b> response {{that results in}} tissue necrosis.|$|E
25|$|The body {{responds}} to postoperative wounds {{in the same}} manner as it does to tissue damage acquired in other circumstances. The <b>inflammatory</b> response is designed to create homeostasis. This first step is called the <b>inflammatory</b> stage. The next stage and wound healing is the infiltration of leukocytes and release of cytokines into the tissue. The <b>inflammatory</b> response and the infiltration of leukocytes occur simultaneously. The final stage of postoperative wound healing is called remodeling. Remodeling restores the structure of the tissue and that tissues ability to regain its function.|$|E
25|$|Both primary {{generalized}} nodal osteoarthritis and erosive osteoarthritis (EOA, {{also called}} <b>inflammatory</b> osteoarthritis) are sub-sets of primary osteoarthritis. EOA {{is a much}} less common, and more aggressive <b>inflammatory</b> form of osteoarthritis which often affects the distal interphalangeal joints of the hand and has characteristic articular erosive changes on x-ray.|$|E
25|$|Diclofenac is used {{to treat}} pain, <b>inflammatory</b> disorders, and dysmenorrhea.|$|E
