5|$|The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, {{has been}} found to have photoreceptors in the skin of <b>its</b> <b>tail,</b> {{allowing}} it to detect light and presumably ensuring it is completely hidden, including <b>its</b> <b>tail,</b> inside coral holes during the day. While other species have not been tested, Aipysurus laevis possibly is not unique among sea snakes in this respect.|$|E
5|$|In some lowland {{areas the}} adult {{salamanders}} will remain active all winter long, excluding cold spells. However, {{during the cold}} winter months in the northern parts of its range, the long-toed salamander burrows below the frost-line in a coarse substrate to hibernate in clusters of 8–14 individuals. While hibernating, it survives on protein energy reserves that are stored in its skin and along <b>its</b> <b>tail.</b> These proteins serve a secondary function {{as part of a}} mixture or concoction of skin secretions that is used for defense. When threatened, the long-toed salamander will wave <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> and secrete an adhesive white milky substance that is noxious and likely poisonous. The color of its skin can serve as a warning to predators (aposematism) that it will taste bad. Its skin colors and patterns are diverse, ranging from a dark black to reddish brown background that is spotted or blotched by a pale-reddish-brown, pale-green, to a bright yellow stripe. An adult may also drop part of <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> and slink away while the tail bit acts as a squirmy decoy; this is called autotomy. The regeneration and regrowth of the tail is one example of the developmental physiology of amphibians that is of great interest to the medical profession.|$|E
5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} is a shy and elusive bird and, if {{seen by a}} human observer, it either freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, {{but it is a}} {{powerful}} runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees and bushes, and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground rollers are solitary outside the breeding season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground rollers. When calling, this ground roller bobs its head and raises <b>its</b> <b>tail.</b> The long-tailed ground roller also raises <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> when it is excited.|$|E
5000|$|If {{threatened}} by a predator, the larva will raise <b>its</b> three <b>tails</b> in a [...] "scorpion posture" [...] to appear larger. It will then project <b>its</b> <b>tails</b> in front and poke the enemy. Most species are sensitive to disturbance.|$|R

5000|$|One of the Tailed Beasts, in the unnamed Naruto universe, {{which is}} the Seven-Tailed beast, and a giant Kabutomushi, was {{revealed}} to be named Chōmei, and the jinchuriki host to the young kunoichi Fū. Has six dragonfly like wings that makes up six of <b>its</b> <b>tails,</b> and a long stem that also makes up <b>its</b> actual <b>tail.</b>|$|R
5|$|The spiny {{plates on}} the back and tail of the tuatara {{resemble}} those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to break off <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail {{is almost}} always on the move and rarely still {{for more than a}} few moments during {{daylight}} hours. Even while perching it will flick <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E
5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E
50|$|The Spencer, a type {{of short}} jacket from which the UK {{military}} mess jacket is derived, is named for George Spencer, reportedly {{because he had a}} tail-coat adapted after <b>its</b> <b>tails</b> were burned by coals from a fire.|$|R
30|$|The BMO-G density {{function}} (4) allows for greater flexibility of <b>its</b> <b>tails</b> {{and can be}} widely applied in many areas. The new family extends several widely-known distributions in the literature. Here, we present a few of its many special models.|$|R
5000|$|Yamata no Orochi 八岐大蛇 [...] "8-branched giant snake" [...] was an 8-headed and 8-tailed dragon slain by {{the god of}} {{wind and}} sea Susanoo, who {{discovered}} the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (legendary sword of the Imperial Regalia of Japan) in one of <b>its</b> <b>tails.</b>|$|R
5|$|Aposematic animals {{often have}} (honest) threat displays; edible prey {{sometimes}} have (bluffing) startle displays. For example the frilled lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, {{is illustrated in}} a drawing by Cott, with <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> raised over the body, stretched up on all four legs, mouth wide open, and frills out {{both sides of the}} head, making it a startling sight.|$|E
5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, it is likely that <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it was probably a non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E

5000|$|Cresponea ancistrosporelloides is {{a species}} of lichen in the family Roccellaceae. Known only from Stirling Range National Park in Western Australia, it was {{described}} as new to science in 2011.

5|$|During the day, {{the solitary}} tasselled {{wobbegong}} can generally be found lying inside caves or under ledges with <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> curled. Individual sharks tend to remain within a local area and have favored resting spots. While resting, it opportunistically ambushes nearby fishes and invertebrates, and also lures in prey by waving <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> {{to mimic the}} appearance of a small fish. At night, it emerges and actively forages for food. This species is aplacental viviparous, though little is known of its life history. The tasselled wobbegong has been reported to bite and kill humans unprovoked; attacks may result from people accidentally disturbing the shark or being misperceived as prey. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as outside of Australia it is threatened by fisheries and habitat degradation.|$|E
5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will defend itself with <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but seldom life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} space (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|It {{has a long}} broad {{nose and}} muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around {{the tip of the}} muzzle. Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows. Both the {{forequarters}} and the hindquarters are well muscled. <b>Its</b> <b>tail</b> typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight.|$|E
40|$|We study two {{families}} of two-dimensional bright lattice solitons in photovoltaic-photorefractive crystals. It is shown that self-focusing and self-defocusing lattice solitons are possible only when their power level exceeds a critical threshold. It is found that self-focusing lattice solitons exist {{not only in}} the semi-infinite band gap, but also in the first band gap, whereas self-defocusing lattice solitons exist only in the first band gap. The structures of these lattice solitons are also analyzed. Our results indicate that a self-focusing lattice soliton in the semi-infinite band gap is more confined than in the first band gap so <b>its</b> <b>tails</b> in the first band gap occupy many lattice sites; when a self-defocusing lattice soliton is close to the second band, the self-defocusing lattice soliton is more confined so <b>its</b> <b>tails</b> occupy a few lattice sites...|$|R

5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near <b>its</b> <b>tail,</b> giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have been}} smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon also may have had large scutes on the underside of <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E
5|$|So-called lobtail feeding was {{observed}} in the North Atlantic. This technique involves the whale slapping {{the surface of the}} ocean with <b>its</b> <b>tail</b> between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} research has {{established that the}} distributions {{of a wide range}} of economic variables are kurtotic in that they have higher peak(s) in the neighborhood of the mean and greater elongation in the tails than the normal distribution. This paper provides a formal characterization of the empirically significant notions of kurtotic distributions by formulating the concept of outer risk. An increase in outer risk corresponds to a dispersion transfer from the center of a distribution to <b>its</b> <b>tails.</b> In terms of the relocation of probability mass, such a dispersion transfer accentuates the peak(s) of the distribution and elongates <b>its</b> <b>tails.</b> It is shown that ordering distributions by outer risk is equivalent to the ordering of distributions resulting from unanimous choice by all individuals whose utility function has a negative fourth derivative. Outer risk, outer risk aversion...|$|R

5|$|The coyote is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} gray wolf, but has longer ears and a relatively larger braincase, {{as well as a}} thinner frame, face, and muzzle. The scent glands are smaller than the gray wolf's, but are the same color. Its fur color variation is much less varied than that of a wolf.
