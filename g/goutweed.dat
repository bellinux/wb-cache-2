60|$|<b>GOUTWEED</b> (AEgopodium Podagra).--Handsome leaves, but a {{troublesome}} weed.|$|E
50|$|Once established, <b>goutweed</b> is {{difficult}} to eradicate. The smallest piece of rhizome left in the ground will quickly form a sturdy new plant. All-green <b>goutweed</b> may be more persistent and spread more rapidly than ornamental, variegated <b>goutweed</b> varieties, making the all-green type particularly difficult to control. However, all-green, wild type forms are known to reappear from seeds of variegated varieties.|$|E
50|$|Integrative {{management}} strategies that combine herbicide with landscape cloth, bark mulch, and hand weeding to control <b>goutweed</b> {{in a garden}} are largely unsuccessful because sprouting occurs from either rhizomes or root fragments left in the soil. Hand pulling, raking, and digging followed by monitoring to control <b>goutweed</b> may be effective; however, caution {{must be taken to}} remove the entire rhizome and root system. Removing flowers before seed set may help control the spread of <b>goutweed.</b> Because goutweed's starch reserves are typically depleted by spring, removal of leaves in spring could be effective in starving the plant. Once <b>goutweed</b> has been removed, the patch should be carefully monitored periodically for a few years. New shoots should be dug up and destroyed. Revegetation with other plant materials is recommended.|$|E

50|$|The most {{well-known}} member is the Aegopodium podagraria, the ground elder {{also known as}} snow-on-the-mountain, Bishop's weed, <b>goutweed,</b> native to Europe and Asia. It is variegated green and white that sometimes reverts to solid green within a patch. Small, white, five-petal flowers are held about three feet high, above the leaves, in flat topped clusters. Underground are long white branching rhizomes that vaguely resemble quackgrass. Regarded as an ecological threat, <b>goutweed</b> is aggressive, invasive and forms dense patches reducing species diversity in the ground layer. On the other hand, because of this, it is often used as a low maintenance ground cover.|$|E
50|$|The most {{effective}} means of control is to prevent its establishment in natural communities. It is thus recommended to plant <b>goutweed</b> only on sites not adjacent to wildlands and in gardens where root spread can be restricted (e.g., between a sidewalk and a house).|$|E
50|$|Many farms grew cabbage, {{cucumbers}}, potatoes, garlic, carrots, beans, beets, turnips, radishes, and pumpkins. In {{summer and}} autumn, {{a great deal}} of fruit were eaten fresh. Pickled cucumbers were used for preparing dishes. Beets and pumpkins were eaten steamed as a dessert. Shschi (cabbage soup) was a traditional soup consisting of cabbage and potatoes cooked in chicken broth with onions and carrots added at the end. Herbs such as watercress, horseradish, onion, cow parsnip, horsetail, nettle, and wild <b>goutweed</b> were used for preparing dishes instead of spices.|$|E

5000|$|Aegopodium podagraria L. {{commonly}} called ground elder, herb gerard, bishop's weed, <b>goutweed,</b> gout wort, and snow-in-the-mountain, and sometimes called English masterwort, and wild masterwort, is a perennial {{plant in the}} carrot family (Apiaceae) that grows in shady places. The name [...] "ground elder" [...] comes from the superficial similarity of its leaves and flowers to those of elder (Sambucus), which is unrelated. It is the type species of the genus Aegopodium.

50|$|Sorrel soup is a soup {{made from}} water or broth, sorrel leaves, and salt. Varieties {{of the same}} soup include spinach, garden orache, chard, nettle, and {{occasionally}} dandelion, <b>goutweed</b> or ramsons, together with or instead of sorrel. It is known in Ashkenazi Jewish, Belarusian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian cuisines. Its other English names, spelled variously schav, shchav, shav, or shtshav, are borrowed from the Yiddish language, which in turn derives from Polish szczaw. The latter together with its Eastern Slavic cognates (Belarusian шчаўе, Russian and Ukrainian щавель, shchavel) comes ultimately from the Proto-Slavic ščаvь for sorrel. Due to its commonness as a soup in Eastern European cuisines, it is often called green borscht, as a cousin of the standard, reddish-purple beetroot borscht. In Russia, where shchi (along with or rather than borscht) has been the staple soup, sorrel soup is also called green shchi. In old Russian cookbooks it was called simply green soup.|$|E
40|$|The article {{summarizes}} data {{concerning the}} biological activity of the promising herbal raw material: aerial part of <b>goutweed</b> (Aegopodium podagraria L., Apiaceae). This plant since time immemorial {{has been used as}} vegetable and fodder plant as well as in folk medicine including the treatment of the metabolic disorders. Nowadays the interest in this plant increases. The technology of obtaining the extract and the tincture from <b>goutweed</b> aerial part is described, the chemical composition of these preparations is elucidated. Pharmacological effects of the preparations obtained from <b>goutweed</b> are characterized with the special emphasis on the possibilities of the lipid metabolism disorders correction and prevention. The presented experimental results substantiate the efficacy of <b>goutweed</b> extract and the tincture under the conditions of alimentary lipemia together with their safety in the intact animals. Thus, the hypolipidemic activity of <b>goutweed</b> extract (1 g/kg intragastrically) and <b>goutweed</b> tincture (1  cm 3 /kg intragastrically) was shown in the test with olive oil loading in rats. The extract appeared to be able to decrease significantly the level of triglycerides in blood plasma, while the tincture reduced the content of plasma total lipids. In the intact rats, the extract at doses of 100  mg/kg and 1 g/kg as well as the tincture at doses of 1  and 5  cm 3 /kg did not influence on the values of the lipid metabolism after 12 days of administration. Total and HDL cholesterol as well as atherogenic index and plasma total lipids level remained unchanged. In contast to the data previously obtained on the models of hyperuricemia, in the intact rats there were no changes in plasma uric acid concentration (which was determined proceeding from the role of the purine metabolism disorders in metabolic syndrome pathogenesis). Thus, <b>goutweed</b> preparations are characterized with the regulatory mode of action and sufficient level of safety. The development of drugs as well as functional foods containing <b>goutweed</b> herbal raw material is promising. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{main reasons}} of liver damage are the {{excessive}} alcohol consumption, viral infections, {{as well as}} drug adverse effects. In addition, hepatic injury develops in surgery, transplantation, tissue resection, thrombosis and atherosclerosis of great vessels. Nowadays liver diseases constitute a significant medical problem of worldwide proportions. On the modern pharmaceutical market the assortment of liver drugs with verified efficacy is not sufficient. Hence, there is an ongoing need for improvement of liver protection methods and for research of new substances that can effectively prevent and cure hepatic damage, minimize drugs adverse effects. Herbal drugs as well as compounds of herbal origin have been intensively studied for their possible beneficial effects in liver injury. Objective. The goal {{of the study was}} to determine the influence of <b>goutweed</b> drugs and certain groups of biologically active substances on the course of liver carbon tetrachoride-induced injury in mice. Materials and methods. The experimental groups were as follows: intact mice, positive control group (only carbon tetrachloride dissolved in olive oil (1 : 1) was given orally at a dose of 10 ml/kg b. w.) and groups where animals received the <b>goutweed</b> roots, leaves, flowers drugs such as the tincture (1 and 5 ml/kg), the extract (200 mg/kg and 1 g/kg), as well as <b>goutweed</b> leaves biologically active substances, namely, protein-polysaccharide complex (200 mg/kg), kaempferol 3 -О-β-D-galactopiranoside (flavonoid trifolin, 50 mg/kg) and reference-drug silibor (200 mg/kg) during 3 days before and 2 hours after intoxication. Survival rate was estimated during the first 24 hours after carbon tetrachloride administration. Afterwards anesthetized animals underwent euthanasia, blood plasma (heparin in vitro was used as an anticoagulant) was used for the measurement of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST and ALT) activity as well as total protein level. Liver and kidney weight ratios and AST/ALT ratio were calculated. Results. The hepatoprotective activity of <b>goutweed</b> (Aegopodium podagraria L.) roots, leaves, flowers extracts and tinctures as well as <b>goutweed</b> biologically active substances have been investigated in mice with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury. Significant reduction in lethality rate is considered to be the integral criterion of hepatoprotective action. This effect was evident in animals treated with most of <b>goutweed</b> drugs. However, only <b>goutweed</b> leaves drugs (the extract, the tincture, protein-polysaccharide complex) and trifolin also counteracted cytolysis and decreased liver weight ratio. They normalized AST/ALT ratio that is the evidence of favourable course of pathological process and proves their protective effect on the liver. The concentration of total protein in plasma had no significant differences in all experimental groups. The effects of the tincture (1 and 5 ml/kg), the extract (200 mg/kg and 1 g/kg), protein-polysaccharide complex (200 mg/kg) of <b>goutweed</b> leaves and trifolin (50 mg/kg) were comparable with that of standard drug silibor (200 mg/kg). Conclusions. These results demonstrate protective effects of the <b>goutweed</b> leaves preparations and biologically active substances against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury and indicate the need for the further in-depth investigation of their hepatoprotective activity mechanisms on the other models of liver injury that differ in pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Seeds of the {{coniferous}} trees Abies balsamea, Picea mariana, and Pinus strobus were sown {{in the laboratory}} in two soils taken from ground‐layer patches differing in species composition, {{one of which was}} dominated by Aegopodium podagraria (<b>goutweed).</b> This permitted inference whether herbaceous species may affect the favorableness of the soil for establishment of these trees. Weibull distributions were fitted to the time course of aggregate seedling emergence and post-emergence mortality, enabling seedling lifespan to be inferred without monitoring of each individual. A higher percentage of Abies seeds developed into emerged seedlings in the <b>goutweed</b> soil, likely because of less preemergence mortality incited by pathogens. Picea and Pinus emergence percentages were similar in both soils. Most emerged seedlings died within weeks, with symptoms of diseases incited by soil‐ or seed‐borne fungi. Although the timing of seedling emergence did not differ between soils, seedlings died more quickly on the <b>goutweed</b> soil, largely because of a faster development of post‐emergence damping‐off. Total post-emergence mortality of Picea and Pinus was greater on the <b>goutweed</b> soil. The relative frequencies of the several symptoms exhibited by dying seedlings varied between the two soils, suggesting that the ground‐layer species differentially affected the microbial community’s composition or interactions with the seedlings. Symptom frequencies differed among tree species. Local spatial variation in herbaceous species composition appeared to produce patchy infectious lethality of soil for tree seedlings, an indirect effect that was observed after the herbaceous plants had been removed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigate}} the sensitiveness of Bishop's <b>goutweed</b> (Aegopodium podagraria L.) to mechanical damages {{in an experiment}} with artificial clipping. Based on personalobservations of A. podagraria during several years I hypothesise that i) A. podagraria indifference with other species, for example different species of grass have difficult to recoverfrom mechanical damages ii) in a site with several other species present A. podagraria willhave harder to recover from mechanical damages than in a pure stand iii) as purer a stand withA. podagraria is, the harder other species will have to establish after the removal of aboveground parts of A. podagraria. The main conclusion of this work is that mechanical damagehas {{a significant effect on}} the vegetation cover of A. podagraria. The experiment also provethat a high grade of monoculture favours the ability of A. podagraria to recover frommechanical damage. It could however not be proven that high grade of monoculture of A. podagraria puts constraints on the ability of other species to establish on plots where A. podagraria is removed...|$|E
