"Now, you see," [...] {{continued}} Rollo's father, [...] "that {{if these}} watches should get lost or injured in any way, {{the question whether}} the watchmaker {{would have to pay}} for them or not, would depend upon the degree of care it would have required to save them. For instance, if he locked them all up with special care, and particularly the repeater, and then the building were struck with lightning and the watches all destroyed, he would not have to pay for any of them; for this would be an <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident,</b> which all his care could not guard against. It would have been as likely to have happened to my repeater, if I had kept it at home.|$|E

If it is {{for the benefit of the}} bailor, that is, the boy who intrusts it, then he can't require the other to pay for it, unless he was grossly negligent.

2500|$|The {{dawn of the}} {{aviation}} age brought <b>inevitable</b> <b>accidents</b> coupled with a growing interest in safety measures, most notably {{in the development of}} an effective parachute. Early parachuting successes, such as those by Louis-Sébastien Lenormand in 1783 and by balloonist Jean-Pierre Blanchard, had used fixed-canopy parachutes (that were already [...] "open" [...] before the jump began), and although André-Jacques Garnerin had invented a frameless parachute suitable for use from high altitudes, by 1910 a parachuting solution that was suitable for use when jumping from a plane or at low altitude had yet to be developed. Reichelt seems to have become interested in parachute design after hearing some of the stories of fatal accidents among the early aeronauts and aviators. His early tests with dummies equipped with foldable silk [...] "wings" [...] were a resounding success: dropped from the fifth floor, they touched down lightly. Attempts to convert the initial prototype parachutes into a workable suit proved difficult. Reichelt's original design weighed around [...] and used [...] of material. He presented his design to the leading aeronautic organization, La Ligue Aérienne at the Aéro-Club de France, hoping that they would test it, but they rejected his designs {{on the grounds that the}} construction of the canopy was too weak, and they attempted to dissuade him from wasting his time on further development. Undaunted by the rejection, Reichelt persevered and conducted experimental drops with dummies from the courtyard of his building at rue Gaillon. None of his tests proved successful.|$|R

Still, he did not take very extraordinary or special care of it. The loss was not owing to <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident.</b> If the bailment was for Rollo's benefit, the care he took was sufficient to save him from being liable; but, if it was for his own benefit, then all he did was at his own risk; and the loss ought to be his loss, and he ought to pay for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed as}} if Tomkins himself had acquiesced in this {{limitation}} of confidence exercised towards him, or that he wished to seem blinder than he really was {{to the presence of}} this stranger in the family.

[...] "He asked no questions about the young stranger," [...] said Joceline--"God avert that he knows or suspects too much!" [...] But his suspicions were removed, when, {{in the course of their}} subsequent conversation, Joseph Tomkins mentioned the King's escape from Bristol as a thing positively certain, and named both the vessel in which, he said, he had gone off, and the master who commanded her, seeming so convinced of the truth of the report, that Joceline judged it impossible he could have the slightest suspicion of the reality.|$|E

Henry bailed Rollo the dipper. This shows the truth of what I said before, that a great many of the disputes among boys arise from cases of bailment. This seems to be a sort of doubled and twisted case. And it all hinges on the question whether Henry or Rollo had the right to the dipper at the time when Henry took it. For, as I have already explained, if Henry had a right to it, then his keeping Rollo's fish in it was for Rollo's advantage, and Rollo ought to bear the loss. But if Rollo had a right to keep the dipper longer, then he bailed the fish to him, {{in order to be able}} to let him have the dipper, for he could not let him have the one without the other; and so it was for Henry's benefit; and, as the loss was not from <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident,</b> Henry ought to bear it." ...|$|E

Due {{to the nature of}} the course and the cohort of students, the current lecturer pedagogic practice has to be behaviourist, but from this a culture of expectancy has developed among the students. It was felt that something had to be done to revitalise student interest in the work they were doing and also give them the chance to address the perceived shortfall in their learning. There was potential for a lot of failures, but also much worse, there was potential for students to engage in unsafe practices with <b>inevitable</b> <b>accidents</b> occurring. The current teaching practice was examined and analysed with a view to changing and improving it. Within the limited scope for change it was decided to try a viable alternative method of student engagement, whereby they would encompass their learning in a portfolio. The hope here was that through reflecting on work done and machines used, the learning experience would improve for the students due to the higher order thinking skills necessary to produce the broader and deeper knowledge required for the portfolio. This would then in turn foster a more focused learning environment and help to ensure that the students take greater control and responsibility of their own learning going into the future. The research has produced encouraging signs and it seems to have had the desired effect of allowing the students to gain a broader knowledge of the subject, to back-up practical classroom experiences and also to allow for a further demonstration of learning and knowledge achieved...|$|R

6000|$|What was {{the secret}} of the force of that suggestion?--which was not, I may say, to be invalidated, to my eyes, by the further {{observation}} of cases and conditions. Was it that the enormous [...] "pull" [...] enjoyed at every point of the general surface the stoutness of the underlying belief in what was behind all surfaces?--so that the particular visible, audible, palpable fact, however small and subsidiary, was incomparably absolute, or had, so to speak, such a conscience and a confidence, such an absence of reserve and latent doubts about itself, as was not elsewhere to be found. Didn't such elements as that represent, in the heart of things, possibilities of scepticism, of mockery, of irony, of the return of the matter, whatever it might be, on itself, by some play or other of the questioning spirit, the spirit therefore weakening to entire comfort of affirmations? Didn't I see that humour itself, which might seem elsewhere corrosive and subversive, was, as an English faculty, turned outward altogether and never turned inward?--by which convenient circumstance subversion, or in other words alteration and variation were not promoted. Such truths were wondrous things to make out in such connections as my experience was then, and for no small time after, to be confined to; but I positively catch myself listening to them, even with my half-awakened ears, {{as if they had been}} all so many sermons of the very stones of London. There, to come back to it, was exactly the force with which these stones were to build me capaciously round: I invited them, I besought them, to say all they would, and--to return to my figure of a while back--it was soon so thoroughly as if they had understood that, once having begun, they were to keep year after year fairly chattering to me. Many of these pages, I fondly foresee, must consist but of the record of their chatter. What was most of all happening, I take it, was that under an absurd special stress I was having, as who should say, to improvise a local medium and to arrange a local consciousness. Against my due appropriation of those originally closest at my hand <b>inevitable</b> <b>accidents</b> had conspired--and, to conclude in respect to all this, if a considerable time was to be wanted, in the event, for ideal certainty of adjustment, half the terms required by this could then put forth the touching plea that they had quite achingly waited.|$|R

One wouldn't have to explain anything to you--you would take it all down in a gulp, the kind of gulp in which one has to indulge to keep from breaking down under the positive pang of comprehension and emotion. Two afternoons ago I caught that gulp, twice over, in the very act--while listening to that dear and affable Emile Boutroux make an exquisite philosophic address to the British Academy, which he had come over for the purpose of, and then hearing the less consummate, yet sturdily sensitive and expressive Lord Chancellor (Haldane) utter to him, in return, the thanks of the select and intense auditory and their sense of the beautiful and wonderful and unprecedented unison of nations that the occasion symbolised and celebrated. In the quietest way in the world Boutroux just escaped [...] "breaking down" [...] in his preliminary reference to what this meant and how he felt, and just so the good Haldane grazed the same almost <b>inevitable</b> <b>accident</b> in speaking for us, all us present and the whole public consciousness, when he addressed the lecturer afterwards. What was so moving was its being so utterly unrehearsed and immediate--its coming, on one side and the other, so of itself, and being a sort of thing that hasn't since God knows when, if ever, found itself taking place between nation and nation. I kind of wish that the U.S.A. were not (though of necessity, I admit) so absent from this feast of friendship; it figures for me as such an extraordinary luxury that the whirligig of time has turned up for us such an intimacy of association with France and that France so exquisitely responds to it. I quite tasted of the quality of this last fact two nights ago when an English officer, a most sane and acute middle-aged Colonel, dined with me and another friend, and gave us a real vision of what the presence of the British forces in the field now means for the so extraordinarily intelligent and responsive French, and what a really unprecedented relation (I do wish to goodness we were in it!) between a pair of fraternising and reciprocating people it represents. The truth is of course that the British participation has been extraordinarily, quite miraculously, effective and sustaining, has had in it a quality of reinforcement out of proportion to its numbers, though these are steadily growing, and that all the intelligence of the wonderful France simply floods the case with appreciation and fraternity; these things shown in the charming way in which the French most of all can show the like under full inspiration. Yes, it's an association that I do permit myself at wanton moments to wish that we, in our high worthiness to be of it, weren't so out of! But I mustn't, my dear Lilla, go maundering on.

40|$|The {{public has}} {{expressed}} concern about the safety of a nuclear power plant after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that was caused by a tsunami on March 11, 2011. There are enough safety systems in nuclear power plants, but the accident occurred owing to an expected, complex natural disaster. If <b>inevitable</b> nuclear <b>accidents</b> take place, we have to consider the best way to mitigate public damage. The leakage of radioactive material from nuclear power plants should be prevented under all circumstances. The integrity of the reactor vessel can be maintained by flooding the coolant around the reactor vessel, which means that the radioactive materials are retained in the vessel. This cooling strategy is called in-vessel corium retention through external reactor vessel cooling (IVR-ERVC). A feasibility study of this cooling strategy was conducted with full-size facilities simulating AP 600 and AP 1000. The stable cooling of a high-power reactor is uncertain in heat removal capacity. We propose a new idea to resolve this issue by inserting liquid metal between the reactor vessel and the flooded water. The liquid metal will function as an intermediate heat transfer medium. A large heat transfer area could thus be ensured for heat removal uncertainty. The likelihood of a steam explosion is strongly prevented because it is due to direct contact of water with the molten fuel. In the current study, this cooling concept is called “liquid metal fin. ” An experimental test and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation confirmed that heat transfer was improved. The heat transfer between the coolant and heated structure was enhanced when the liquid metal was flooded. The highest heat flux of a possibly dangerous region was reduced to 1 / 3 when the liquid metal was used. IVR-ERVC with liquid metal can be established successfully at a high-power reactor through these results. clos...|$|R

How can Free-Will be truly free, if everything is already determined? Science too, is in a similar muddle on the Problem of Free-Will, because it is still unsure whether the Universe runs on a deterministic or indeterministic basis.

Accident records (More than 200 accident records) were obtained from various police divisions of the country particularly in 2013 and 2014 for a selected week. The collection and use of accurate and comprehensive data related to road accident is very important to road safety management.

In order to this, I must return back to the year 1702, about which time some unaccountable turns of fortune attended him in his own private capacity, which must be very surprising and entertaining to my readers, when they find a man, whose foresight was always so great a help and assistance to others, who consulted him in their own future affairs, helpless, as it has been an observation concerning all such men in the account of the second-sight, and blind in his own future affairs, tossed up and down by <b>inevitable</b> and spiteful <b>accidents</b> of fortune, and made the may-game of chance and hazard, as if that wayward and inconstant goddess, was resolved to punish him, when she catched him on the blind side, for having such a quick insight and penetrating faculty in other people's matters, and scrutinizing too narrowly into her mysteries, and so sometimes preventing those fatal intentions of hers, into which she would fain lead many mortals hood-winked, and before they knew where they were.

40|$|In {{the early}} {{pages of his}} {{important}} novel of western life, Zury, The Meanest Man in Spring County, Joseph Kirkland brought the Prouder family to the blazed tree that marked {{the location of the}} Illinois land that was to be their new home, the 2 ̆ 2 woods behind 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 prairie before 2 ̆ 2 them. Herbert Quick halted yOl 1 ng Jacobus Vandemark on the bluffs above Dubuque, where the first great rolling sweep of the prairie grassland lay spread before him, and reported that a great surge of emotion coursed through the boy. John Ise pictured the covered wagon of his parents, Rosie and Henry Ise, on the afternoon when the stocky veteran of the Civil War and his bride reached the plains country homestead that he had been developing in Osborne County, Kansas. Such rendezvous of man, woman, and grassland, fanciful or real, were duplicated in actuality thousands of times during the settlement of the great western interior of the country. Of the three, the later experiences of the Ise family most closely follow the scenario of western settlement that the mass media have implanted in the minds of most Americans. 1 Henry Ise acquired his first land by homesteading. He and his family endured drought, grasshoppers, and the departure of relatives and neighbors. Henry and Rosie were threatened by debt and by prairie fire, blizzard, and dust storms. They feared the depredations of lawbreakers, suffered the <b>inevitable</b> farm <b>accidents,</b> lost a child to death, and watched in helpless sympathy as another suffered crippling paralysis. Yet, amid the hardships, they broke land, built fences, acquired title, and got still more land. A stone addition was joined to the original log cabin and then, after a good year, they built a two-story house. The stock of farm machinery increased, a windmill appeared at the farmstead, and ultimately, a handsome barn was built. When the mortgage was paid off after years of worry, the family held a celebration; Henry and one of his daughters went to the World 2 ̆ 7 s Fair in Chicago in 2 ̆ 793. And during these family trials and triumphs, the community settled up around the Ises, the railroad came, elevators rose beside it, and the days of pioneering faded into memory. The story of the settling-in process {{is only part of the}} history of the grassland since EuroAmericans began to develop an intensive agriculture there. Pioneer farmers confronted the eastern fringes of the grassland in the early nineteenth century. The initial confrontation was still under way on its western rim during the second and third decades of the twentieth century. By that time generations of farmers farther east who had never broken an acre of virgin prairie or plains country had contributed their life histories to the collective record of the grassland. The unique environment of the grassland, coupled with the excesses of the economic system, periodically forced farmers and policy makers to reassess the potential of portions of this great region. So traumatic indeed were the 2 ̆ 2 dirty thirties 2 ̆ 2 that the reevaluation threatened to become a regional postmortem. Actually, grassland farmers were involved in a number of processes that changed through time and space in various respects and at varying rates: (1) Farmers passed through a life course typical of farm experience, and the amount of family labor available and their plans for the next generation influenced their decision making. (2) Whether immigrant or of families long established in America, frontier farmers were culture bearers, carrying values and unique knowledge that might help or hinder them in adjusting to the demands of a strange environment and a changing industry. (3) Pioneer farmers were engaged in creating new farms from virgin land with all that this involved in the way of land cleanng, sod breaking, fencing, and the erection of farm buildings. (4) Frontier farmers also adjusted to the natural environment as they assessed the degree to which the cropping patterns and management practices with which they were familiar were also effective in their new homes. (5) In general, American farmers became increasingly involved in an exchange economy in which they emphasized the farm enterprise, or combinations of enterprises, that gave them the greatest comparative advantage (or perhaps least disadvantage), and they bought an increasing variety of foods, clothing, and production goods. (6) Since transportation facilities and marketing opportunities and prices changed through time, the farmer 2 ̆ 7 s optimal combination of enterprises might also change periodically. (7) Farm technology also changed after 1820 as agricultural inventors sought to adapt the innovations of an industrial age to the service of the farmer-first primarily in the form of horse-powered machinery, and after 1900, utilizing the power of the steam and internal combustion engines and electricity. (8) Finally, farmers were members of neighborhoods, communities, and a larger society that supplied them with economic goods, services, and markets, helped to shape their goals, and provided social contacts, services, and sanctions as well. Agricultural historians, whatever their geographical focus, have displayed more interest in some of these processes than others, but it is important to remember that the complete regional history will deal adequately with them all...|$|R

The crew failed to release ballast and dump instruments due to the design flaw that prevented rapid release of ballast.4. The crew's failure to stabilize vertical speed led to their failure to bail out on parachutes due to erratic tumbling of the gondola.5.

60|$|It enhances {{our sense}} of the grand {{security}} and serenity of nature, to observe the still undisturbed economy {{and content of the}} fishes of this century, their happiness a regular fruit of the summer. The Fresh-Water Sun-Fish, Bream, or Ruff, Pomotis vulgaris, as it were, without ancestry, without posterity, still represents the Fresh-Water Sun-Fish in nature. It is the most common of all, and seen on every urchin's string; a simple and inoffensive fish, whose nests are visible all along the shore, hollowed in the sand, over which it is steadily poised through the summer hours on waving fin. Sometimes there are twenty or thirty nests {{in the space of a}} few rods, two feet wide by half a foot in depth, and made with no little labor, the weeds being removed, and the sand shoved up on the sides, like a bowl. Here it may be seen early in summer assiduously brooding, and driving away minnows and larger fishes, even its own species, which would disturb its ova, pursuing them a few feet, and circling round swiftly to its nest again: the minnows, like young sharks, instantly entering the empty nests, meanwhile, and swallowing the spawn, which is attached to the weeds and to the bottom, on the sunny side. The spawn is exposed to so many dangers, that a very small proportion can ever become fishes, for beside being the constant prey of birds and fishes, a great many nests are made so near the shore, in shallow water, that they are left dry in a few days, as the river goes down. These and the lamprey's are the only fishes' nests that I have observed, though the ova of some species may be seen floating on the surface. The breams are so careful of their charge that you may stand close by in the water and examine them at your leisure. I have thus stood over them half an hour at a time, and stroked them familiarly without frightening them, suffering them to nibble my fingers harmlessly, and seen them erect their dorsal fins in anger when my hand approached their ova, and have even taken them gently out of the water with my hand; though this cannot be accomplished by a sudden movement, however dexterous, for instant warning is conveyed to them through their denser element, but only by letting the fingers gradually close about them as they are poised over the palm, and with the utmost gentleness raising them slowly to the surface. Though stationary, they keep up a constant sculling or waving motion with their fins, which is exceedingly graceful, and expressive of their humble happiness; for unlike ours, the element in which they live is a stream which must be constantly resisted. From time to time they nibble the weeds at the bottom or overhanging their nests, or dart after a fly or a worm. The dorsal fin, besides answering the purpose of a keel, with the anal, serves to keep the fish upright, for in shallow water, where this is not covered, they fall on their sides. As you stand thus stooping over the bream in its nest, the edges of the dorsal and caudal fins have a singular dusty golden reflection, and its eyes, which stand out from the head, are transparent and colorless. Seen in its native element, it is a very beautiful and compact fish, perfect in all its parts, and looks like a brilliant coin fresh from the mint. It is a perfect jewel of the river, the green, red, coppery, and golden reflections of its mottled sides being the concentration of such rays as struggle through the floating pads and flowers to the sandy bottom, and in harmony with the sunlit brown and yellow pebbles. Behind its watery shield it dwells far from many <b>accidents</b> <b>inevitable</b> to human life.|$|R
40|$|A {{few years}} ago one might have seen a small object flying {{overhead}} without any idea what it could be. Today, it is fairly commonplace to see drones flying around our neighborhood skies. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicts there will be seven million drones populating our skies by 2020. In 2015 hobbyists, recreational users, and commercial businesses purchased unmanned aerial vehicles, {{commonly referred to as}} drones, in record-breaking numbers. Estimates reveal that over 4. 3 million drones were sold worldwide in 2015. Trade industry experts predicted that more than 2. 8 million drones would be sold in the U. S. in 2016 and 4. 8 million in 2017. The surge in drone sales means more drones in the sky. The FAA estimates {{that by the end of}} this decade 30, 000 drones will occupy our skies. The privacy concerns relating to drones stem from their capabilities. These aerial observers enable operators to gather information about people and places via cameras, live videostreaming capability, and sensory-enhancing technologies that can be mounted to the drone. Once collected, information can be stored forever and broadly disseminated electronically. Moreover, the drones’ aerial positioning makes it difficult for anyone without prior notice to avoid being caught on their cameras. The FAA’s mandate to integrate unmanned aircraft into U. S. airspace focuses on safety, not privacy. The sheer volume of drones in our skies makes <b>accidents</b> <b>inevitable.</b> At alarming rates, pilots of passenger jets are reporting drones flying near airports, flying in restricted airspace, and interfering with the flight paths of commercial airliners, especially during take-off and landing. There have been reports of drones malfunctioning and falling from the sky, causing injury and damage to people and property. The insurance industry is beginning to respond to this new market as the number of manufacturers, commercial operators, and homeowners seeking to protect themselves from risk and liability grows. If laws do not provide legal redress for those negatively impacted by drone operations, then people will assuredly take matters into their own hands. In some instances where the law is perceived as a fairly blunt tool, people will increasingly resort to self-help remedies. Not only are these measures dangerous, but many will result in criminal prosecutions and civil suits over damaged property. This article sets out to answer these questions at a time when lawmakers are feverishly proposing drone specific legislation. Presently, forty-nine states have considered legislation seeking to regulate drones. Thirty-one states have passed laws that limit the use of drones. The majority of these laws provide for civil penalties and causes of action for capturing images and recordings of individuals via drone without consent. Before the ink dries on these newly minted bills and incidents ripen into lawsuits, we should be asking whether our long-standing common law torts offer remedies of equal or greater value than these rapidly developing new laws. To the extent that common law torts fall short of providing adequate remedies at law, understanding their shortcomings will strengthen future drone legislation. Part I of this article explains the FAA’s current and proposed rules for drone operators in the wake of the massive popularity of drones Part II describes the capabilities of unmanned aircraft to help understand the growing concern over privacy intrusions. Part III examines the legislative activity among states seeking to limit drone use as a means of protecting privacy. Part IV explains the application of the torts of trespass, nuisance, and invasion of privacy to drones, and those claims’ limitations. Part V suggests that state and local governments can implement regulations for low altitude airspace that are designed to safeguard privacy and not conflict with current FAA rules...|$|R
40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2016 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Globalleşmenin etkisi, enerji gereksiniminin artması ve ticaret hacminin büyümesi ile daha az maliyetli olan deniz yolu taşımacılığına olan talep artmıştır. Bu taşıma süresince gittikçe artan bir şekilde deniz kazaları oluşmakta ve deniz ortamı bu kazalar sonucunda denize dökülen petrol ürünlerinden ciddi boyutlarda kirlenmektedir. Bu kirlilik, ekonomik ve çevresel faktörler ile meydana geldiği bölgeyi olumsuz yönde etkilemektedir. Bu çalışmada üç boyutlu hidrodinamik ve taşınım modeli olan MOHID kullanılarak petrol kirliliğinin yayılımı incelenmiştir. Çalışma bölgesi olarak Türkiye için stratejik önemi haiz petrol rafinerilerinin ve dolum istasyonlarının yoğun olduğu Doğu Akdeniz bölgesi seçilmiştir. Doğu Akdeniz jeopolitik konumu ile Türkiye’nin önemli deniz ticaret yollarını ve limanlarını içine almaktadır. Doğu Akdeniz’de gemi trafik akışının yoğun olduğu, Mersin önleri ve İskenderun Körfezi için kaza senaryoları üretilmiştir. Bölgedeki olası gemi kazası sonrası yakıt kirliliği simülasyonu yapılarak, bölgedeki yakıt dağılımı sonlu hacimler yöntemi ile hesaplanmıştır. Model, her bir zaman adımında petrolün alansal dağılımını vermektedir. Model, petrol dağılımını atmosferik koşullara, tanımlanmış başlangıç ve sınır koşullarına göre hesaplamaktadır. Model validasyonu, Coriolis projesi kapsamında Mart 2014 ’de Mersin önlerinde denize bırakılan şamandıranın topladığı verilerin, model verileri ile karşılaştırılması ile yapılmıştır. Model bu tarihlerde çalıştırılmış olup, şamandıra verilerine benzer sonuçlar vermiştir. Simülasyona başlamadan önce modelin stabil olmasını sağlamak için model ısınma periyodunda çalıştırılmıştır. Isınma periyodu iki aşamada gerçekleşmiştir. İlk olarak birincil çalıştırma, müteakiben ikincil çalıştırma yapılmıştır. Birincil çalıştırmada veriler anlık olarak değil belli bir zamana yayılarak uygulanmıştır. Bu şekilde modelin hata vermesi engellenmiştir. İkincil çalıştırma, hesaplamalarına birincil çalıştırmadan elde edilen verileri başlangıç noktası alarak devam etmiştir. Model yaz ve kış mevsiminde meydana gelecek kirlilik senaryoları için dört gün boyunca çalıştırılmıştır. Yaz mevsimi simülasyon sonuçları incelendiğinde, kirliliğin İskenderun Körfezi’nde, İskenderun ve Dörtyol ilçesi kıyılarını etkileyeceği, Mersin bölgesinde ise Kazanlı kıyılarını etkileyeceği beklenmektedir. Kış mevsimi simülasyon sonuçları incelendiğinde ise, İskenderun Körfezi’nde uzunca bir sahil şeridinin kirliliğe maruz kalacağı, Mersin bölgesinde de kirliliğin kıyıya paralel olarak hareket edeceği beklenmektedir. Energy {{demand of}} the world has {{increased}} significantly with the industrial development. However, the development of industries and technology has led to an increase of environmental risks all over the world. With the increasing demand for oil, oil exploration and trasnportation have also increased to meet the demand, leading to an increase in the risk of oil spill accidents Although seaway transportation is cheaper than other types of transportation, it is the riskiest way considering the possible accidents and their widespread effects. Many factors may lead to accidents in the sea and cause irrecoverable man-made disasters. Due to inadequate training of officers and crew, faulty construction of ships, lack of proper equipment, overloading and lack of attention, <b>inevitable</b> ship <b>accidents</b> may occur. Ship accidents negatively affect the region where it takes place by the means of economics and environmental aspects. In the present, main source for energy is oil and transportation of oil is generally done via sea transportation due to relatively low costs. Although increased tanker traffic is the biggest risk for the oil pollution in the seas, {{it is not the only}} one. Dry cargo or container carrying ships also can cause oil spill to the sea in the case of any breakdown or accident in their fuel tanks. In addition to these, illegal discharges to the sea such as bilge or ballast water discharges may cause oil spill to the sea. Oil pollution is one of the most serious environmental problems worldwide, since oil spills are causing significant, long-term impacts on the affected area environmentally, ecologically, and socio-economically. Fresh water and marine environments are seriously affected by oil spill. Besides the point that it affects the natural resources negatively, it also affects a wide range of organisms through the complex food chain and these impacts can even reach to human food resources. Damages after an oil spill can be in different ways in the environment. It can directly affect the environment and wildlife physically, or oil can cause toxicity to the exposed organisms. These impacts depend on several factors, including the physical and chemical properties of the spilled oil, and the fate of it. In this study, three dimensional hydrodynamic and transportation model MOHID was used to simulate oil spill. MOHID software lets the user to build a tree of one-way nested models without limitations on the numerous of nesting levels. In this work, modeling studies performed using two models: one for the whole system (main model), and the other one for the study area (submodel) with a more detailed grid. One-way downscaling scheme (nested models) was used to join these two models. To define the hydrodynamic and water properties, the main model which consisted of a less detailed grid was used and boundary conditions are supplied for the submodel. The connection between the main model and the submodel was provided by the assimilation of the relaxed solutions in a band of cells of the main model by the submodel. The information transfer was maintained as one-way direction, from the main model to the submodel. So, the submodel was enforced to use the boundary conditions acquired from the main model. At the first run of each new simulation, cold start was done for stability purposes. The wind is the main factor affecting hydrodynamic fields. The hydrodynamic fields are used to force a Lagrangean oil spill model to simulate a hypothetical oil spill in potentially risky areas. A finite volume methodology with a generic vertical coordinate system is used in this model. The wind data was slowly imposed to the model over a period of time. This way, the model does not accept any previous results as a starting point. The second run was done after this cold start as a continuous run of the first. This hot start accepted the data from the cold start as the starting point. East Mediterranean contains important sea trade ways and ports because of its important geopolitic location. Therefore, Mersin and İskenderun areas in Turkey was selected as the study area, due to the fact that the area is strategically very important with the refineries and filling stations. Ship accident scenarios were created for the locations where vessel traffic is heavy. Oil spill pollution after possible tanker accidents in the region, were simulated and oil spill was calculated by using finite volumes. Three dimensional developed model provides area distribution in every time step. The model calculates the spread of the oil spill based on the current conditions and predetermined boundary conditions. In the model, constantly changing wind speed and direction were used which were taken from SKIRON forecast system which is a full physics atmospheric model with several unique capabilities that make it appropriate for regional/mesoscale simulations in regions with highly variable physiographic characteristics. Sea water temperature, salinity, water level and current data are initial and boundary conditions. They were obtained from MERCATOR Ocean which is the French Center for analysis and forecasting of the global ocean, as service provider of ocean information in real and delayed time. In the model, different scenarios were created for different coordinates with high accident risks as well as for summer and winter conditions. In March 2014, a drifter was released the cost of Mersin in scope of Coriolis Project and the data were published as an open source. For validating the model results, the time period was selected as March 2014 and model data were compared with real data obtained from the drifter. Also, meteorological and atmospherical data for March 2014 were used. Unlike previous studies, constantly changing wind speed and wind direction data were used instead of constant wind data to get more reliable results from the modeling study. In East Mediterranean, the prevailing wind blows from south west for summer and north and north east for winter. The model was run for the summer and winter separately; the prevailing wind was configured as south west for the summer and north and north east for the winter to obtain a realistic view of pollution in case of any real accident. According to model outputs, in case of an accident off the cost of BOTAŞ in summer conditions, Dörtyol district will be exposed to oil pollution. The pollution reaches to the shore after 43 hours. In winter conditions, a possible pollution in the area would proceed parallel to shore area, and if no precaution is taken, the pollution will reach to the off the cost of baymouth. According to the model outputs, in summer conditions, in case of an accident off the cost of İskenderun, North İskenderun area as well as the iron and steel factory shore area will be exposed to oil pollution. The pollution will reach to the shore after 24 hours. At the end of four days, the pollution would expand towards the coast line, and reach off the cost of Dörtyol district. In winter conditions, a possible pollution will reach to the shore after 24 hours similar to summer conditions. If no precaution is taken, the pollution would affect a long coast line through İskenderun. According to the model outputs, in summer conditions, in case of an accident off the coast of Mersin, Kazanlı coastal area will be exposed to oil pollution. The pollution reaches to the shore after 36 hours. At the end of four days, all the oil would be accumulated in the coastline. In winter conditions, a possible pollution in the area, will distribute parallel to the coast line and at the end of four days, the pollution will reach Erdemli district. In summer and winter conditions, applying a barrier set before oil pollution during emergency situations may prevent the spread of pollution over larger areas. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

This is true at least where the accident victims are as a class economically ill-equipped to carry the burden of serious accident losses.
