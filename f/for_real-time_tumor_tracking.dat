40|$|Real-time tumor {{tracking}} in external radiotherapy can {{be achieved}} by diagnostic (kV) X-ray imaging with a dynamic flat-panel detector (FPD). It is crucial to understand the effects of image lag <b>for</b> <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking.</b> Our purpose in this study was to develop a lag simulation system based on the image lag properties of an FPD system. Image lag properties were measured on flat-field images both in direct- and indirect-conversion dynamic FPDs. A moving target with image lag was simulated based on the lag properties in all combinations of FPD types, imaging rates, exposure doses, and target speeds, and then compared with actual moving targets for investigation of the reproducibility of image lag. Image lag was simulated successfully and agreed well with the actual lag {{as well as with the}} predicted effect. In the indirect-conversion FPD, a higher dose caused greater image lag on images. In contrast, there were no significant differences among dose levels in a direct-conversion FPD. There were no relationships between target speed and amount of image blurring in either type of FPD. The maximum contour blurring and the rate of increase in pixel value due to image lag were 1. 1 mm and 10. 0 %, respectively, in all combinations of imaging parameters examined in this study. Blurred boundaries and changes in pixel value due to image lag were estimated under various imaging conditions with use of the simulation system. Our system would be helpful for a better understanding of the effects of image lag in fluoroscopic images. © 2012 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics...|$|E
40|$|PurposeTo {{determine}} {{the stability of}} markers used <b>for</b> <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> after percutaneous intrapulmonary placement. Methods and MaterialsA total of 42 patients with 44 lesions, 111 markers, and ≥ 2 repeat computed tomography (CT) scans were studied. The tumor on the repeat CT scans was registered with the tumor on the planning CT scan. Next, the three-dimensional marker coordinates were determined on the planning CT scan and repeat CT scans. Marker stability was analyzed by the displacement of the markers and the displacement {{of the center of}} mass (COM) of the marker configurations. In addition, we assessed the reliability of using the intermarker distance as a check for displacements in the COM of the marker configurations. ResultsThe median marker displacement was 1. 3 mm (range, 0. 1 – 53. 6). The marker displacement was > 5 mm in 12 % of the markers and > 10 mm in 5 % of the markers. The causes of marker displacement > 5 mm included marker migration (2 of 13) and target volume changes (5 of 13). Nonsynchronous tumor and marker movement during breathing might have been responsible for the displacements > 5 mm in the other 6 of 13 markers. The median displacement in the COM of the marker configurations was 1. 0 mm (range, 0. 1 – 23. 3). Displacements in the COM of the marker configurations of ≥ 2. 0 mm were detected by changes in the intermarker distance of > 1. 5 mm in 96 % of the treatment fractions. ConclusionThe median marker displacement was small (1. 3 mm). Nevertheless, displacements > 5 mm occurred in 12 % of the markers. Therefore, we recommend the implantation of multiple markers because multiple markers will enable a quick and reliable check of marker displacement by determining the change in the intermarker distance. A displacement in the COM of the marker configuration of ≥ 2. 0 mm was almost always detected (96 %) by a change in the distance between the markers of > 1. 5 mm. This enabled the displaced marker to be disabled, such that tumor localization was not compromised...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Reporting on {{the first}} group of {{patients}} treated with real‐time tumor tracking (RTTT) radiation therapy using the Vero gimbaled linac system and a single implanted fiducial marker. Methods: In total 8 patients diagnosed with NSCLC or oligo‐metastatic disease in lung or liver, and showing substantial breathing related tumor motion were included in this study. One single Visicoil fiducial marker was implanted inside or close to the tumor. SBRT schemes were applied with doses/fraction ranging from 5 Gy up to 20 Gy. Treatment planning was done using both the classic ITV approach as a reference using 5 mm ITV‐PTV margin, and the RTTT planning applying a 5 mm isotropic CTV‐PTV margin. RTTT was driven by a correlation model of external‐to‐internal motion and IR skin markers on the upper abdomen. The correlation model was rebuild multiple times per fraction. Data on the delivery process in terms of performance and time efficiency was accumulated. Results: The observed average peak‐to‐peak tumor motion reached up to 25 mm, the average CTV volume was 9. 0 cc. An average PTV volume reduction was accomplished of 38 %, ranging up to 52 %. For this patient group, the average mean lung dose and mean liver dose were reduced from 2. 6 Gy to 2. 0 Gy, and from 11. 7 Gy to 9. 4 Gy respectively. Maximum average treatment time, including patient setup, ranged up to 35 min. The correlation models were used for 6 min 24 sec on average of which 2 min 50 sec was building time. The probability of the beams‐eye‐view tracking error to be less than 5 mm averaged over all patients was exceeding 98 %. Conclusion: A novel approach <b>for</b> <b>real‐time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> using a gimbaled linac was successfully applied on a first group of patients. An initial evaluation was made of the possibilities of tracking to reduce the PTV volume and reestablish acceptable treatment fraction duration for respiratory correlated treatments.

40|$|PURPOSE: VERO {{is a novel}} {{platform}} for image guided stereotactic body radiotherapy. Orthogonal gimbals hold the linac-MLC assembly allowing <b>real-time</b> moving <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking.</b> This study determines the geometric accuracy of the tracking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the tracking error, an 1 D moving phantom produced sinusoidal motion with frequencies up to 30 breaths per minute (bpm). Tumor trajectories of patients were reproduced using a 2 D robot and pursued with the gimbals tracking system prototype. Using the moving beam light field and a digital-camera-based detection unit tracking errors, system lag and equivalence of pan/tilt performance were measured. RESULTS: The system lag was 47. 7 ms for panning and 47. 6 ms for tilting. Applying system lag compensation, sinusoidal motion tracking was accurate, with a tracking error 90 % percentile E(90 %) < 0. 82 mm and similar performance for pan/tilt. Systematic tracking errors were below 0. 14 mm. The 2 D <b>tumor</b> trajectories were <b>tracked</b> with an average E(90 %) of 0. 54 mm, and tracking error standard deviations of 0. 20 mm for pan and 0. 22 mm for tilt. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of dynamic behavior, the gimbaled linac of the VERO system showed to be an excellent approach <b>for</b> providing accurate <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> in radiation therapy.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of cancer treatment is compromised {{by the need}} to reduce the uncertainties originating from a variety of factors including tumor volume delineation, patient setup, and irregular physiologic motion. In particular, effective yet practical tumor motion management remains a major challenge in current external beam radiation therapy. Many strategies such as motion encompassment, breath-hold techniques, and respiratory gating have been proposed in the literature and implemented clinically. These methods have shown success in certain situations with different limitations. With the advent of image guided radiation therapy, <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> methods have become popular in clinics to proactively address the challenge with on-board tumor localization. Nevertheless, such techniques rely on surrogate signals and have been reported vulnerable to errors. In this dissertation, EGRT is proposed as a new modality for effective and practical management strategy of cancer treatment uncertainties. One implementation of EGRT is to use PET emissions in <b>real-time</b> <b>for</b> direct <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> during radiation delivery. Radiation beamlets are delivered along PET lines of response by a fast rotating ring therapy unit consisting of a linear accelerator and PET detectors. A complete treatment scheme with capabilities of accurate <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> and dose planning is proposed to implement this EGRT concept. Simulation studies with physical phantom, 4 D digital patient model, and clinical patient datasets are carefully designed to evaluate the feasibility and performance of EGRT.

40|$|International audienceTumor motion {{caused by}} {{respiration}} {{is an important}} issue in image-guided radiotherapy. A 2 D/ 4 D matching method between 4 D volumes derived from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and 2 D fluoroscopic images was implemented to <b>track</b> the <b>tumor</b> motion without the use of implanted markers. In this method, firstly, 3 DCBCT and phase-rebinned 4 DCBCT are reconstructed from cone beam acquisition. Secondly, 4 DCBCT volumes and a streak-free 3 DCBCT volume are combined to improve the image quality of the digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). Finally, the 2 D/ 4 D matching problem is converted into a 2 D/ 2 D matching between incoming projections and DRR images from each phase of the 4 DCBCT. The diaphragm is used as a target surrogate for matching instead of using the tumor position directly. This relies on the assumption that if a patient has the same breathing phase and diaphragm position as the reference 4 DCBCT, then the tumor position is the same. From the matching results, the phase information, diaphragm position and tumor position at the time of each incoming projection acquisition can be derived. The accuracy of this method was verified using 16 candidate datasets, representing lung and liver applications and one-minute and two-minute acquisitions. The criteria for the eligibility of datasets were described: 11 eligible datasets were selected to verify the accuracy of diaphragm tracking, and one eligible dataset was chosen to verify the accuracy of <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking.</b> The diaphragm matching accuracy was 1. 88 ± 1. 35 mm in the isocenter plane and the 2 D <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> accuracy was 2. 13 ± 1. 26 mm in the isocenter plane.

The proliferation of IGT technologies {{has been particularly}} significant in image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), {{as a way to}} increase the tumor targeting accuracy.

Different strategies may be applied to mitigate the effects of motion: each technique is related to a different technological effort and complexity in treatment planning and delivery. The objective comparison of different motion mitigation strategies can be achieved by quantifying the residual uncertainties in tumor targeting, to be detected by means of IGRT technologies. Such quantification requires an extension of targeting error theory to a 4 D space, where the 3 D tumor trajectory as a function of time measured (4 D Targeting Error, 4 DTE).

A small size and low power wireless active transponder implanted {{in the vicinity of}} the tumor with a magnetic tracking system placed outside the patient 2 ̆ 7 s body can be used to locate the position of the tumor during the {{radiation therapy}}. The wireless active transponder uses a magnetic sensor to sense the magnetic field generated by the magnetic tracking system, and then transmits the magnetic field information back to the computer wirelessly using on/off keying (OOK) for <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking.</b> One of the challenges faced by an implantable device is that the device must consume as little power as possible for prolonged battery lifetime or battery-less remote-powered operations.

These techniques include low-voltage designs, time-division scheme, a low-power low-area-penalty sensor front-end topology, and low-power voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). Using these low-power techniques, a wireless active transponder is implemented in 130 -nm CMOS technology.

Image lag properties were measured without test devices according to IEC 62220 - 1. Modulation transfer function (MTF) and profile curves were measured on the edges of a moving tungsten plate at movement rate of 10 and 20 mm/s, covering lung tumor movement of normal breathing.

In the measurement of profile curves on the edges of static and moving tungsten material plates, the effect of image lag was seen as blurred edges of the plate.

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: To {{report on}} the first {{clinical}} application of a <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> (RTTT) solution based on the Vero SBRT gimbaled linac system for treatment of moving tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A first group of 10 SBRT patients diagnosed with NSCLC or oligometastatic disease in lung or liver was treated with the RTTT technique. The PTV volumes and OAR exposure were benchmarked against the widely used ITV approach. Based on data acquired during execution of RTTT treatments, a first review was performed of the process. RESULTS: The 35 % PTV volume reduction with RTTT of the studied single lesions SBRT irradiations of small target volumes is expected {{to result in a}} small (< 1 %) reduction of lung or liver NTCP. A GTV-PTV margin of 5. 0 mm was applied for treatment planning of RTTT. From patient data on residual geometric uncertainties, a CTV-PTV margin of 3. 2 mm was calculated. Reduction of the GTV-PTV margin below 5. 0 mm without better understanding of biological definition of tumor boundaries was discouraged. Total treatment times were reduced to 34. 4 min on average. CONCLUSION: A considerable PTV volume reduction was achieved applying RTTT and time efficiency for respiratory correlated SBRT was reestablished with Vero RTTT. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|PURPOSE: In this work, {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{motion of}} lung tumors during radiotherapy {{in real time}} was investigated. Understanding the behavior of tumor motion in lung tissue to model tumor movement is necessary for accurate (gated or breath-hold) radiotherapy or CT scanning. METHODS: Twenty patients were included in this study. Before treatment, a 2 -mm gold marker was implanted {{in or near the}} <b>tumor.</b> A <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> system using two fluoroscopy image processor units was installed in the treatment room. The 3 D position of the implanted gold marker was determined by using real-time pattern recognition and a calibrated projection geometry. The linear accelerator was triggered to irradiate the tumor only when the gold marker was located within a certain volume. The system provided the coordinates of the gold marker during beam-on and beam-off time in all directions simultaneously, at a sample rate of 30 images per second. The recorded tumor motion was analyzed in terms of the amplitude and curvature of the tumor motion in three directions, the differences in breathing level during treatment, hysteresis (the difference between the inhalation and exhalation trajectory of the tumor), and the amplitude of tumor motion induced by cardiac motion. RESULTS: The average amplitude of the tumor motion was greatest (12 +/- 2 mm [SD]) in the cranial-caudal direction for tumors situated in the lower lobes and not attached to rigid structures such as the chest wall or vertebrae. For the lateral and anterior-posterior directions, tumor motion was small both for upper- and lower-lobe tumors (2 +/- 1 mm). The time-averaged tumor position was closer to the exhale position, because the tumor spent more time in the exhalation than in the inhalation phase. The tumor motion was modeled as a sinusoidal movement with varying asymmetry. The tumor position in the exhale phase was more stable than the tumor position in the inhale phase during individual treatment fields. However, in many patients, shifts in the exhale tumor position were observed intra- and interfractionally. These shifts are the result of patient relaxation, gravity (posterior direction), setup errors, and/or patient movement. The 3 D trajectory of the tumor showed hysteresis for 10 of the 21 tumors, which ranged from 1 to 5 mm. The extent of hysteresis and the amplitude of the tumor motion remained fairly constant during the entire treatment. Changes in shape of the trajectory of the tumor were observed between subsequent treatment days for only one patient. Fourier analysis revealed that for 7 of the 21 tumors, a measurable motion in the range 1 - 4 mm was caused by the cardiac beat. These tumors were located near the heart or attached to the aortic arch. The motion due to the heartbeat was greatest in the lateral direction. Tumor motion due to hysteresis and heartbeat can lower treatment efficiency in <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> tracking-gated treatments or lead to a geographic miss in conventional or active breathing controlled treatments. CONCLUSION: The <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> system measured the tumor position in all three directions simultaneously, at a sampling rate that enabled detection of tumor motion due to heartbeat as well as hysteresis.

Methods Eligible patients were treated over a 24 -month period and followed for a minimum of 6 months. Fiducials (3 – 5) were placed in or near tumors under CT-guidance. Non-isocentric treatment plans with 5 -mm margins were generated. Patients received 45 – 60 Gy in 3 equal fractions delivered in less than 2 weeks. CT imaging and routine pulmonary function tests were completed at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months. Results Twenty-four consecutive patients were treated, 15 with stage I lung cancer and 9 with single lung metastases. Pneumothorax was a complication of fiducial placement in 7 patients, requiring tube thoracostomy in 4. All patients completed radiation treatment with minimal discomfort, few acute side effects and no procedure-related mortalities. Following treatment transient chest wall discomfort, typically lasting several weeks, developed in 7 of 11 patients with lesions within 5 mm of the pleura. Grade III pneumonitis was seen in 2 patients, one with prior conventional thoracic irradiation and the other treated with concurrent Gefitinib. A small statistically significant decline in the mean % predicted DLCO was observed at 6 and 12 months. All tumors responded to treatment at 3 months and local failure was seen in only 2 single metastases. There have been no regional lymph node recurrences.

For both imaging modalities, the moving target was localized by detection of an implanted fiducial. The dual-modality tracking verification was validated against a high-precision optical camera in phantom experiments and applied to clinical tracking data from a liver and two lung cancer patients. RESULTS: Both verification modalities showed a high accuracy (< 0. 3 mm) during validation on phantom. Marker detection on EPID was influenced by low image contrast. For the clinical cases, gimbaled tracking showed a 90 th percentile error (E 90) of 3. 45 (liver), 2. 44 (lung A) and 3. 40 mm (lung B) based on EPID fluoroscopy and good agreement with XR-log file data by an E 90 of 3. 13, 1. 92 and 3. 33 mm, respectively, during beam on. CONCLUSION: Dual-modality verification was successfully implemented, offering the possibility of detailed reporting on RTTT performance. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|AbstractBackground and purposeThere are {{concerns}} that radiotherapy doses {{delivered in a}} magnetic field might be distorted due to the Lorentz force deflecting secondary electrons. This study investigates this effect on lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatments, conducted either with or without multileaf collimator (MLC) <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking.</b> Material and methodsLung SBRT treatments with an MR-linac were simulated for nine patients. Two different treatment techniques were compared: conventional, non-tracked deliveries and deliveries with <b>real-time</b> MLC <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking,</b> each conducted either {{with or without a}} 1. 5 T magnetic field. ResultsSlight dose distortions at air-tissue-interfaces were observed {{in the presence of the}} magnetic field. Most prominently, the dose to 2 % of the skin increased by 1. 4 Gy on average. Regardless of the presence of the magnetic field, MLC tracking was able to spare healthy tissue, for example by decreasing the mean lung dose by 0. 3 Gy on average, while maintaining the target dose. ConclusionsAccounting for the magnetic field during treatment plan optimization allowed for design and delivery of clinically acceptable lung SBRT treatments with an MR-linac. Furthermore, the ability of MLC <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> to decrease dose exposure of healthy tissue, was not inhibited by the magnetic field...|$|R
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking,</b> a {{correlation}} model {{is used to}} estimate internal tumor position based on external surrogate motion. When patients experience an internal/external surrogate drift, an update of the correlation model is required to continue <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking.</b> In this study, {{the accuracy of the}} internal tumor position estimation for both the clinical available update at discrete points in time (rebuild) and an in-house developed non-clinical online update approach was investigated. METHODS: A dynamic phantom with superimposed baseline drifts and 14 SBRT patients, treated with <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> (RTTT) on the Vero system, were retrospectively simulated for three update scenarios, respectively no update, clinical rebuild and 0. 5 Hz automated online update of the correlation model. By comparing the target positions based on 0. 5 Hz verification X-ray images with the estimated internal tumor positions regarding all three update scenarios, 95 th percentile modeling errors (ME 95), incidences of full geometrical coverage of the CTV by a 5 mm extended PTV (P₅mm) and population-based PTV margins were calculated. Further, the treatment time reduction was estimated when switching from the clinical rebuild approach to the online correlation model update. RESULTS: For dynamic phantom motion with baseline drifts up to 0. 4 mm/min, a 0. 5 Hz intra-fraction update showed a similar accuracy in terms of ME 95 and P 5 mm compared to clinical rebuild. For SBRT patients treated on Vero with RTTT, accuracy was improved by 0. 5 Hz online update compared to the clinical rebuild protocol, yielding smaller PTV margins (from 3. 2 mm to 2. 7 mm), reduced ME 95, 3 D (from 4. 1 mm to 3. 4 mm) and an increased 5 th percentile P 5 mm (from 90. 7 % to 96. 1 %) for the entire patient group. Further, 80 % of treatment sessions were reduced in time with on average 5. 5 ± 4. 1 (1 SD) min. CONCLUSION: With a fast (0. 5 Hz) automated online update of the correlation model, an efficient RTTT workflow with improved geometrical accuracy was obtained. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Purpose: There is {{a growing}} concern {{regarding}} the dose delivered during x-ray fluoroscopy guided procedures, particularly in interventional cardiology and neuroradiology, and in <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> radiotherapy and radiosurgery. Many of these procedures involve long treatment times, and as such, there is cause for concern regarding the dose delivered and the associated radiation related risks. An insufficient dose, however, may convey less geometric information, which may lead to inaccuracy and imprecision in intervention placement. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate a method for achieving the required tracking uncertainty for a given interventional procedure using minimal dose. Methods: A simple model is used to demonstrate that a relationship exists between imaging dose and tracking uncertainty. A feedback framework is introduced that exploits this relationship to modulate the tube current (and hence the dose) in order to maintain the required uncertainty for a given interventional procedure. This framework is evaluated in the context of a fiducial tracking problem associated with image-guided radiotherapy in the lung. A particle filter algorithm is used to robustly track the fiducial as it traverses through regions of high and low quantum noise. Published motion models are incorporated in a tracking test suite to evaluate the dose-localization performance trade-offs. Results: It is shown that using this framework, the entrance surface exposure can be reduced by up to 28. 6 % when feedback is employed to operate at a geometric tracking uncertainty of 0. 3 mm. Conclusions: The analysis reveals a potentially powerful technique for dynamic optimization of fluoroscopic imaging parameters to control the applied dose by exploiting the trade-off between tracking uncertainty and x-ray exposure per frame...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the clinical outcomes {{of patients with}} pathologically proven, peripherally located, stage I {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) who received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> radiotherapy (RTRT) during the developmental period. Materials and Methods: Forty-one patients were admitted (T 1, 25; T 2, 16) from February 2000 to June 2005. A 5 mm lanning target volume (PTV) margin was added to the clinical target volume determined with computed tomography at the end of expiratory phase. The gating window ranged from ± 2 to 3 mm. The dose fractionation schedule was 40 or 48 Gy in 4 fractions within 7 days. The dose was prescribed {{at the center of the}} PTV, giving more than an 80 % dose at the PTV periphery. Results: For 28 patients treated with 48 Gy in 4 fractions, the overall actuarial survival (OAS) at 3 years was 82 % for stage IA and 32 % for stage IB. For patients treated with 40 Gy/ 4 Fr/ 1 wk, OAS at 3 years was 50 % for stage IA and 0 % for stage IB. There was a significant difference in local control between 40 and 48 Gy in stage IB (p= 0. 0015) but not in stage IA (p= 0. 5811). No serious radiation morbidity was observed in either dose schedule. Conclusion: Forty-eight Gy in 4 fractions in one week was found to be a safe and effective treatment for peripherally located, stage IA NSCLC. A steep dose-response curve between 40 and 48 Gy using a daily dose of 12 Gy delivered in one week was identified for stage IB NSCLC in SBRT using RTRT...|$|R
40|$|<b>Real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> in {{external}} radiotherapy can {{be achieved}} by diagnostic (kV) X-ray imaging with a dynamic flat-panel detector (FPD). It is important to keep the patient dose as low as possible while maintaining tracking accuracy. A simulation approach would be helpful to optimize the imaging conditions. This study was performed to develop a computer simulation platform based on a noise property of the imaging system for the evaluation of tracking accuracy at any noise level. Flat-field images were obtained using a direct-type dynamic FPD, and noise power spectrum (NPS) analysis was performed. The relationship between incident quantum number and pixel value was addressed, and a conversion function was created. The pixel values were converted into a map of quantum number using the conversion function, and the map was then input into the random number generator to simulate image noise. Simulation images were provided at different noise levels by changing the incident quantum numbers. Subsequently, an implanted marker was tracked automatically and the maximum tracking errors were calculated at different noise levels. The results indicated that the maximum tracking error increased with decreasing incident quantum number in flat-field images with an implanted marker. In addition, the range of errors increased with decreasing incident quantum number. The present method could be used to determine the relationship between image noise and tracking accuracy. The results indicated that the simulation approach would aid in determining exposure dose conditions according to the necessary tracking accuracy. © The Author 2012.

40|$|We {{present a}} proof of {{principle}} study of proton radiography and proton computed tomography (pCT) based on time-resolved dose measurements. We used a prototype, two-dimensional, diode-array detector capable of fast dose rate measurements, to acquire proton radiographic images expressed directly in water equivalent path length (WEPL). The technique {{is based on}} the time dependence of the dose distribution delivered by a proton beam traversing a range modulator wheel in passive scattering proton therapy systems. The dose rate produced in the medium by such a system is periodic and has a unique pattern in time at each point along the beam path and thus encodes the WEPL. By measuring the time dose pattern at the point of interest, the WEPL to this point can be decoded. If one measures the time-dose patterns at points on a plane behind the patient for a beam with sufficient energy to penetrate the patient, the obtained 2 D distribution of the WEPL forms an image. The technique requires only a 2 D dosimeter array and it uses only the clinical beam for a fraction of second with negligible dose to patient. We first evaluated the accuracy of the technique in determining the WEPL for static phantoms aiming at beam range verification of the brain fields of medulloblastoma patients. Accurate beam ranges for these fields can significantly reduce the dose to the cranial skin of the patient and thus the risk of permanent alopecia. Second, we investigated the potential features of the technique <b>for</b> <b>real-time</b> imaging of a moving phantom. <b>Real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> by proton radiography could provide more accurate validations of tumor motion models due to the more sensitive dependence of proton beam on tissue density compared to x-rays. Our radiographic technique is rapid (similar to 100 ms) and simultaneous over the whole field, it can image mobile tumors without the problem of interplay effect inherently challenging for methods based on pencil beams. Third, we present the reconstructed pCT images of a cylindrical phantom containing inserts of different materials. As for all conventional pCT systems, the method illustrated in this work produces tomographic images that are potentially more accurate than x-ray CT in providing maps of proton relative stopping power (RSP) in the patient without the need for converting x-ray Hounsfield units to proton RSP. All phantom tests produced reasonable results, given the currently limited spatial and time resolution of the prototype detector. The dose required to produce one radiographic image, with the current settings, is similar to 0. 7 cGy. Finally, we discuss a series of techniques to improve the resolution and accuracy of radiographic and tomographic images for the future development of a full-scale detector...|$|R
40|$|Surgery {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} and widely used procedures in treating human cancers, but a major problem is that the surgeon often fails to remove the entire tumor, leaving behind tumor-positive margins, metastatic lymph nodes, and/or satellite tumor nodules. Here we report the use of a hand-held spectroscopic pen device (termed SpectroPen) and near-infrared contrast agents for intraoperative detection of malignant tumors, based on wavelength-resolved measurements of fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals. The SpectroPen utilizes a near-infrared diode laser (emitting at 785 nm) coupled to a compact head unit for light excitation and collection. This pen-shaped device effectively removes silica Raman peaks from the fiber optics and attenuates the reflected excitation light, allowing sensitive analysis of both fluorescence and Raman signals. Its overall performance has been evaluated by using a fluorescent contrast agent (indocyanine green, or ICG) as well as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) contrast agent (pegylated colloidal gold). Under in vitro conditions, the detection limits are approximately 2 - 5 × 10 (- 11) M for the indocyanine dye and 0. 5 - 1 × 10 (- 13) M for the SERS contrast agent. Ex vivo tissue penetration data show attenuated but resolvable fluorescence and Raman signals when the contrast agents are buried 5 - 10 mm deep in fresh animal tissues. In vivo studies using mice bearing bioluminescent 4 T 1 breast tumors further demonstrate that the tumor borders can be precisely detected preoperatively and intraoperatively, and that the contrast signals are strongly correlated with tumor bioluminescence. After surgery, the SpectroPen device permits further evaluation of both positive and negative tumor margins around the surgical cavity, raising new possibilities <b>for</b> <b>real-time</b> <b>tumor</b> detection and image-guided surgery...|$|R

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} {{the most common cause of}} cancer related death in both men and women. Radiation therapy is widely used for lung cancer treatment. However, this method can be {{challenging}} due to respiratory motion. Motion modeling is a popular method for respiratory motion compensation, while biomechanics-based motion models are believed to be more robust and accurate as they are based on the physics of motion. In this study, we aim to develop a biomechanics-based lung <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithm which can be used during External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT). An accelerated lung biomechanical model can be used during EBRT only if its boundary conditions (BCs) are defined in a way that they can be updated in real-time. As such, we have developed a lung finite element (FE) model in conjunction with a Neural Networks (NNs) based method for predicting the BCs of the lung model from chest surface motion data. To develop the lung FE model for tumor motion prediction, thoracic 4 D CT images of lung cancer patients were processed to capture the lung and diaphragm geometry, trans-pulmonary pressure, and diaphragm motion. Next, the chest surface motion was obtained through tracking the motion of the ribcage in 4 D CT images. This was performed to simulate surface motion data that can be acquired using optical tracking systems. Finally, two feedforward NNs were developed, one for estimating the trans-pulmonary pressure and another for estimating the diaphragm motion from chest surface motion data. The algorithm development consists of four steps of: 1) Automatic segmentation of the lungs and diaphragm, 2) diaphragm motion modelling using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), 3) Developing the lung FE model, and 4) Using two NNs to estimate the trans-pulmonary pressure values and diaphragm motion from chest surface motion data. The results indicate that the Dice similarity coefficient between actual and simulated tumor volumes ranges from 0. 76 ± 0. 04 to 0. 91 ± 0. 01, which is favorable. As such, <b>real-time</b> lung <b>tumor</b> <b>tracking</b> during EBRT using the proposed algorithm is feasible. Hence, further clinical studies involving lung cancer patients to assess the algorithm performance are justified...|$|R
