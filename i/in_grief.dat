5|$|Her {{rule was}} finally ended by the {{politician}} Aulus Postumius, after she opted against Roman suppression. Very {{little is known}} {{of the rest of}} her life, but she was eventually succeeded by Gentius in 181 BC. According to the folklore of the modern inhabitants of Risan, Teuta ended her life <b>in</b> <b>grief</b> by throwing herself from Orjen Peak.|$|E
5|$|As {{the singer}} walks through a forest, {{the father is}} shown resorting to {{drinking}} <b>in</b> <b>grief.</b> A funeral scene follows, showing the girl walking up to her mother's wake. When she sees her mother's lips sealed with thread, she runs away from the wake. Madonna walks through a house, where shadows show the girl being scolded and shouted at by the father. Ultimately she walks to the graveyard and stands beside an old man, implying that she herself is the little girl portrayed. The video ends with the little girl dancing {{in front of her}} mother's grave as snow falls around her.|$|E
5|$|K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was {{watching}} a Marathi film where two warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are attacked by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving Sivaji <b>in</b> <b>grief.</b> Prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote {{a story on the}} theme of reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves a queen. He fights 100 warriors and dies in his attempt to re-enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a Chief Minister or a popular social worker like Medha Patkar. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director S. S. Rajamouli selected this script, but made several changes to it. Rajamouli re-characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt that the relationship between a queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to earn a}} {{good living}} in the village, Harihar travels {{to the city to}} seek a better job. He {{promises}} Sarbajaya that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty. Sarbajaya grows increasingly lonely and bitter. One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in the downpour for too long, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Adequate medical care being unavailable, the fever becomes worse, and on a night of incessant rain and gusty winds, she dies. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. Sarbajaya, who remains silent, breaks down at the feet of her husband, and Harihar cries out <b>in</b> <b>grief</b> as he discovers that he has lost his daughter. The family decide to leave their ancestral home. As they start packing, Apu finds the necklace that Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart.|$|E
25|$|After {{a three-year}} stay, their last stint in Serie A ended <b>in</b> <b>grief</b> in 2002. That season {{emerging}} international talents such as Adrian Mutu, Mauro Camoranesi, Alberto Gilardino, Martin Laursen, Massimo Oddo, Marco Cassetti and coach Alberto Malesani failed to capitalise on an excellent start and eventually dropped into fourth-to-last {{place for the}} first time all season on the very last matchday, enforcing relegation into Serie B.|$|E

25|$|Also in 675, Li Hong the Crown Prince died suddenly—with {{traditional}} historians largely attributing {{his death}} to poisoning by Empress Wu, {{due to her}} anger {{that he tried to}} curb her power grab and had shown sympathy to his two older sisters born of Consort Xiao—Princesses Yiyang and Gao'an. Emperor Gaozong, <b>in</b> <b>grief,</b> posthumously honored Li Hong as an emperor, and he created Empress Wu's second son, Li Xian the Prince of Yong, crown prince.|$|E
25|$|The park {{contains}} three monuments. There is {{a monument}} {{in the north}} side of the park to the General Slocum boating disaster on June 15, 1904. This was the greatest single loss of life in New York City prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks. Over a thousand people, mainly German immigrant mothers and children, drowned in the East River that day. The area near the park, formerly known as Kleindeutschland, effectively dissolved <b>in</b> <b>grief</b> as shattered German families moved away. This disaster is also memorialized in James Joyce's novel Ulysses.|$|E
25|$|Succumbing to Leander's soft words, {{and to his}} {{argument}} that Aphrodite, as goddess of love, would scorn the worship of a virgin, Hero allowed him {{to make love to}} her. This routine lasted through the warm summer. But one stormy winter night, the waves tossed Leander in the sea and the breezes blew out Hero's light, and Leander lost his way, and was drowned. Hero threw herself from the tower <b>in</b> <b>grief</b> and died as well. The name Maiden's Tower might also have its origins in this ancient story.|$|E

25|$|Continuing wars on Earth {{eventually}} led to Armageddon, the apocalyptic event that happened 900 years {{before the start of}} the story, and the colonists returned to Earth to help with rebuilding. However, when the colonists returned to Earth, a war broke out between the Methuselahs and the humans who had remained on Earth. Abel, Cain, and Seth took the Methuselah's side—while Lilith supported the Vatican, which guarded humanity. During the war, Cain went insane and killed Lilith. <b>In</b> <b>grief,</b> Abel took her body to the Vatican where she was buried. Abel remained at her side, weeping for her, for 900 years.|$|E
25|$|The last {{well-known}} use of {{the tomb}} itself was in the Claudio-Neronian period, when the daughter and the grandchild of Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus were buried here. These burials may {{be an attempt to}} emphasize for ideological reasons his descent from the Scipios; on the other hand, the latter speculation seems a harsh view of a man who, on the presumption that he was emotionally normal, must have been <b>in</b> <b>grief</b> at the death of his child. Repairs on the tomb continued until the 4th century. After then the mainly Christian Romans (who did not have the same loyalties to the traditions of pagan Rome) apparently stopped maintaining it and lost track of it.|$|E
25|$|Gilgamesh {{delivers}} a lamentation for Enkidu, {{in which he}} calls upon mountains, forests, fields, rivers, wild animals, and all of Uruk to mourn for his friend. Recalling their adventures together, Gilgamesh tears at his hair and clothes <b>in</b> <b>grief.</b> He commissions a funerary statue, and provides grave gifts from his treasury to ensure that Enkidu has a favourable reception {{in the realm of}} the dead. A great banquet is held where the treasures are offered to the gods of the Netherworld. Just before a break in the text there is a suggestion that a river is being dammed, indicating a burial in a river bed, as in the corresponding Sumerian poem, The Death of Gilgamesh.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year the two married {{and not long}} later, Ellen gave birth to Rose (Georgia Bishop). Rose died from cot death and when David discovered Ellen had cheated on him <b>in</b> <b>grief,</b> he too {{had an affair with}} Bridget Hastings (Katie Wolfe). However, as the year ended he realised he still loved Ellen but Bridget's diagnosis with a brain tumour led him to stay with her. In 1999 David and Ellen began an affair and Bridget soon left him. The happiness was short lived however when David was diagnosed with a rare disorder that would leave him blind. He retired and the couple decided to move to a lifestyle block in the Hawkes Bay. David and Ellen did not return for David's son Fergus' (Paul Ellis) wedding in 2001 as David was too ill.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} year, Caroline's daughter, Princess Charlotte, {{had married}} Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, {{and the future}} of the British monarchy looked bright. Then tragedy struck: in November 1817, Charlotte died after giving birth to her only child, a stillborn son. For the most part, Charlotte had been immensely popular with the public, and her death was a blow to the country. George refused to write to Caroline to inform her, leaving it for their son-in-law Leopold to do, but Leopold was deep <b>in</b> <b>grief</b> and delayed writing. George did, however, write to the pope of the tragedy, and by chance the courier carrying the letter passed by Pesaro, and so it was that Caroline heard the devastating news. Caroline had lost her daughter, but she had also lost any chance of regaining position through the succession of her daughter to the throne.|$|E
500|$|Another dilemma Beeman faced {{was keeping}} the {{performances}} realistic, and not [...] "over-the-top".

Beeman explains, [...] "If you’re in love, you’re head over heels in love. If you’re scared, you’re terrified.

Beatrice tried to console her mother by reminding her that the Duchess of Kent was [...] "in heaven, but Beatrice hopes she will return". This comfort was significant because Queen Victoria had isolated herself from her children except the eldest unmarried, Princess Alice, and Beatrice. Queen Victoria again relied on Beatrice and Alice after the death of Albert, of typhoid fever, on 14 December.|$|E
500|$|At a {{literary}} dinner on May 5, 1874, Coolbrith was elected honorary {{member of the}} Bohemian Club, the second of four women so honored. This allowed {{the members of the}} club to discreetly assist her in her finances, but their help was not enough to cover her full burden. Coolbrith moved to Oakland to set up a larger household for her extended family. Coolbrith's sister Agnes died late in 1874, and the orphaned niece and nephew continued to live with Coolbrith. Coolbrith wrote [...] "Beside the Dead" [...] <b>in</b> <b>grief</b> from the loss of her sister. Her mother Agnes died in 1876.|$|E
