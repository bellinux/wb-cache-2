25|$|In {{the late}} period of Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, kilns with a {{controlled}} atmosphere {{were used for}} pottery production. These kilns were constructed with two separate chambers—the combustion chamber and the filling chamber— separated by a grate. Temperatures in the combustion chamber could reach 1000–1100°C but were usually maintained at around 900°C to achieve a uniform and complete <b>firing</b> of <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The pottery <b>vessels</b> are biscuit <b>fired,</b> usually between 900 ℃ and 1000 ℃. The <b>fired</b> <b>vessel</b> is {{dipped in}} a liquid glaze {{suspension}} which sticks to it, leaving a smooth and absorbent surface when dry. On this surface colours are applied by brush, the colours made from powered oxides mixed {{with water to}} a consistency of water-colour paint, sometimes {{with the addition of}} a binding agent such as gum arabic. The unfired glaze absorbs the pigment like fresco, making errors difficult to correct but preserving the brilliant colors of the oxides when fired. The glazed and decorated vessels are returned to the kiln for a second firing, usually between 1000 and 1120 ℃ (the higher temperatures used by modern potters). Lustered wares have a third firing at a lower temperature, necessitating a delicate control of the amount of oxygen in the kiln atmosphere and therefore a flame-burning kiln.|$|R
