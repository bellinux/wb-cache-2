5|$|In July 2002, Italy {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the Tornado Management Agency (NETMA) and Panavia for the upgrading of 18 IDSs, the first of which was received in 2003. The upgrade introduced improved navigation systems (integrated GPS and laser INS) and the ability to carry new weapons, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, Joint <b>Direct</b> <b>Attack</b> Munition and Paveway III laser-guided bombs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the landing}} at Normandy, {{a revival of}} Anvil became {{increasingly}} attractive to the Allied planners. The Normandy ports had insufficient capacity to handle Allied supply needs {{and at the same}} time French generals under Charles de Gaulle pressed for a <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> on Southern France with participation of French troops. These factors led to a reconsideration of the plan. Despite Churchill's objections, the operation was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff on 14July and then renamed Dragoon on 1August. The landing was scheduled for 15August.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{changing}} security {{environment will}} lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes {{that it needs to}} make a contribution to maintaining the rules based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E

5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, John Howard led the Liberal Party's {{election}} campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, {{there were significant}} reforms to the ADF's force structure and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats. From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} since the Tornado's introduction, {{all of the}} Tornado {{operators}} have undertaken various upgrade and modification programmes to allow recently introduced weapons {{to be used by}} their squadrons. Amongst the new armaments that the Tornado has been adapted to deploy are the enhanced Paveway and Joint <b>Direct</b> <b>Attack</b> Munition bombs, and modern cruise missiles such as the Taurus and Storm Shadow missiles; these upgrades have increased the Tornado's capabilities and combat accuracy. Precision weapons such as cruise missiles have replaced older munitions such as cluster bombs.|$|E

50|$|The game {{tries to}} persuade the player into using counterattacks. The player can {{initiate}} a counterattack by blocking an enemy attack just before it connects. Counterattacks are orders of magnitude more powerful than <b>direct</b> <b>attacks.</b> Counterattacking {{is the only way}} of defeating bosses in a reasonable amount of time, as defeating them with <b>direct</b> <b>attacks</b> can take hours. Electrical and earth-based attacks cannot be countered.|$|R

5|$|Other funded {{improvements}} to the A-10 fleet include a new data link, the ability to employ smart weapons such as the Joint <b>Direct</b> <b>Attack</b> Munition (JDAM) and Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser, {{and the ability to}} carry an integrated targeting pod such as the Northrop Grumman LITENING or the Lockheed Martin Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). Also included is the Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) to provide sensor data to personnel on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Conventional Enhancement Modification (CEM) program {{gave the}} B-52H a more {{comprehensive}} conventional weapons capability, adding the modified underwing weapon pylons used by conventional-armed B-52Gs, Harpoon and Have Nap, and the capability to carry new-generation weapons including the Joint <b>Direct</b> <b>Attack</b> Munition and Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser guided bombs, the AGM-154 glide bomb and the AGM-158 JASSM missile. The CEM program also introduced new radios, integrated Global Positioning System into the aircraft's navigation system and replaced the under-nose FLIR with a more modern unit. Forty-seven B-52Hs were modified under the CEM program by 1996, with 19 more {{by the end of}} 1999.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Defence Force {{consists}} of three services: the New Zealand Army; the Royal New Zealand Air Force; and the Royal New Zealand Navy. New Zealand's national defence needs are modest, since a <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> is unlikely. However, its military has had a global presence. The country fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in Gallipoli, Crete, El Alamein and Cassino. The Gallipoli campaign played {{an important part in}} fostering New Zealand's national identity and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this contribution, the {{vulnerabilities}} of iris-based recognition {{systems to}} <b>direct</b> <b>attacks</b> are studied. A database of fake iris images {{has been created}} from real iris of the BioSec baseline database. Iris images are printed using a commercial printer and then, presented at the iris sensor. We use for our experiments a publicly available iris recognition system, which some modifications to improve the iris segmentation step. Based on results achieved on different operational scenarios, we show {{that the system is}} vulnerable to <b>direct</b> <b>attacks,</b> pointing out the importance of having countermeasures against this type of fraudulent actions...|$|R
50|$|Ranged Combat {{deals with}} four primary stats in CAV: # of Attacks (#DA or #IA), Ranged Attack Value (RAV), Range (Rng) and Defensive Value (DV). First off, {{there are two}} {{different}} types of Ranged Attacks: <b>Direct</b> <b>Attacks</b> (DA) and Indirect <b>Attacks</b> (IA). <b>Direct</b> <b>Attacks</b> may only be performed in there is an un-interrupted Line Of Sight between the acting model and its target. Indirect Attacks may be performed against any target, regardless of Line Of Sight. All weapon systems in CAV are designated as either DA or IA and may only be used to perform those types of attacks.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 2000, German IDS and ECR Tornados {{received}} the ASSTA 1 (Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada) upgrade. ASSTA 1 involved a replacement weapons computer, new GPS and Laser Inertial navigation systems. The new computer allowed {{the integration of}} the HARM III, HARM 0 Block IV/V and TAURUS KEPD 350 missiles, the Rafael Litening II Laser Designator Pod and GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs. The ASSTA 2 upgrade began in 2005, primarily consisting of several new digital avionics systems, a new ECM suite and provision for the Taurus cruise missile; these upgrades are to be only applied to 85 Tornados (20 ECRs and 65 IDSs), as the Tornado {{is in the process of}} being replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon. The ASSTA 3 upgrade programme, started in 2008, will introduce support for the laser-targeted Joint <b>Direct</b> <b>Attack</b> Munition along with further software changes.|$|E
5|$|By March 1906 {{the other}} kingdoms had all fallen, leaving Tiku {{as the last}} Torajan lord. The Dutch took Rantepao without a struggle, unaware that the city's {{surrender}} had been arranged by Tiku. Through a letter, the Dutch commander Captain Kilian told Tiku to surrender, a demand Tiku was unwilling to entertain. Aware of Tiku's gathered forces and numerous fortresses, Kilian did not attempt a <b>direct</b> <b>attack.</b> Instead, in April 1906 he sent an expeditionary party to Tondon. Although the party's approach was not resisted, after nightfall Tiku's troops attacked the Dutch camp in Tondon; this forced the Dutch forces to retreat to Rantepao with Tiku's men in pursuit, suffering numerous casualties along the way.|$|E
5|$|Captain San Pedro {{detected}} {{the movements of}} the American troops from his positions on a nearby hill and ordered his men to open fire. Garretson then ordered a <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> on the Spanish and Puerto Rican forces in the hacienda. At day break, the 6th Massachusetts overran the Spanish forces and suffered four casualties. Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating {{the right wing of the}} Spanish force, which was not overrun, initiated a flanking attack against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength of the Spanish force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to momentarily panic, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off. Puig and his forces suffered two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead.|$|E

5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} {{in summer and}} live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile Atlantic and Pacific salmon, herring, capelin and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.|$|E
5|$|Sweden, at {{that time}} an expansionist empire with an army {{designed}} to be maintained by the revenues of occupied territory, was conscious that a <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> on her main adversary Russia could well result in a Dano-Polish–Russian alliance. Also, Sweden was prevented from forming a Swedish–Polish alliance by the refusal of John II Casimir to drop his claims to the Swedish crown and the unwillingness of the Polish–Lithuanian nobility to make the territorial and political concessions an alliance with Sweden would eventually cost, final negotiations in Lübeck during February 1655 ended without a result. Thus, Sweden opted for a preemptive attack on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to occupy its yet available territories before the Russians.|$|E
5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} {{to be used to}} deal with an external threat approaching from {{the far side of the}} river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards plenty of room to fire. The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> by land.|$|E

40|$|Cyber-attacks {{have become}} {{increasingly}} common and {{are an integral part}} of contemporary armed conflicts. With that premise in mind, the question arises of whether or not a civilian carrying out cyber-attacks during an armed conflict becomes a legitimate target under international humanitarian law. This paper aims to explore this question using three different analytical and conceptual frameworks while looking at a variety of cyber-attacks along with their subsequent effects. One of the core principles of the law of armed conflict is distinction, which states that civilians in an armed conflict are granted a set of protections, mainly the protection from <b>direct</b> <b>attacks</b> by the adversary, whereas combatants (or members of armed groups) and military objectives may become legitimate targets of <b>direct</b> <b>attacks.</b> Although civilians are generally protected from <b>direct</b> <b>attacks,</b> they can still become victims of an attack because they lose this protection “for such time as they take direct part in hostilities. ” In other words, under certain circumstances, if a civilian decides to engage in hostile cyber activities (or “hacktivities”), they may well become a target of a <b>direct</b> lethal <b>attack.</b> I will argue that although the answer is highly nuanced and context dependent, the most salutary doctrinal revision that can be made in this area is that the threshold of harm must adapt to the particular intricacies of cyberspace...|$|R

5|$|Up {{to the end}} of 1940, Coastal Command's Anti-shipping Operations (ASO) {{campaign}} against German seaborne trade in north-west European waters had claimed a <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> on only six vessels, totalling 5,561 tons, and 14 others badly damaged. In exchange, 158 aircraft were shot down or lost to other causes; 26 for every enemy vessel. Human casualties amounted to 600 men including 46 to 50 POWs. Coastal Command's performance contrasted heavily with the service' joint mine-laying effort with Bomber Command, that sank 86 enemy vessels in the same period, (totalling 82,983 tons) and ten others damaged for the loss of just 31 aircraft. The performance of Coastal Command's strike wings was down to poor intelligence and equipment, which it was refused, in favour of diverting them to other roles.|$|E
5|$|After two {{costly and}} {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to seize the}} fort by <b>direct</b> <b>attack,</b> the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, {{on the last day}} of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. Considering the time, effort, and resources spent to capture the small fort, it was a pyrrhic victory for the British. A number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way; but more than any other battle of the war, the fighting around Nalapani established the Gurkhas' reputation as warriors. As a result, they were later recruited by the British to serve in their army.|$|E
5|$|Imam Ahmad bin Yahya {{inherited}} the Yemeni throne in 1948. In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against him. A {{group of soldiers}} under his command surrounded the royal palace of Al Urdhi at Taiz, a fortified stronghold where the Imam lived with his harem, the royal treasure, an arsenal of modern weapons, and a 150 strong palace-guard, and demanded Ahmad's abdication. Ahmad agreed, but demanded that his son, Muhammad al-Badr succeed him. Thalaya refused, preferring the king's half brother, the Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48-year-old Foreign Minister. While Abdullah began forming a new government, Ahmad opened the treasury coffers and secretly began buying off the besieging soldiers. After five days, the number of besiegers was reduced from 600 to 40. Ahmad then {{came out of the}} palace, wearing a devil's mask and wielding a long scimitar, terrifying the besiegers. He slashed two sentries dead before exchanging the sword for a sub-machine gun and leading his 150 guards onto the roof of the palace to begin a <b>direct</b> <b>attack</b> on the rebels. After 28 hours, 23 rebels and one palace guard were dead and Thalaya gave up. Abdullah was later reported executed, and Thalaya was publicly decapitated.|$|E
