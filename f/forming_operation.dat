40|$|Due to the {{requirements}} to reduce significantly the part weights in car manufacturing, the use of lightweight materials {{becomes more and more}} important. Unfortunately, these materials possess often a limited formability. Another challenge which is especially connected with high-strength materials is represented by the high required forming forces and the distinctive springback behaviour. To extend the application oft these materials, it is essential to identify strategies which can contribute to an improvement of their formability. The use of the temperature as a process parameter during <b>forming</b> <b>operations</b> represents a promising solution approach. Temperature supported <b>forming</b> <b>operations</b> offer the chance to improve the formability (achievable strains) and to reduce the required forming forces.

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Friction {{occurs in}} all metal <b>forming</b> <b>operations</b> and, in general, {{it has a}} negative impact on process parameters, die life, as well as workpiece quality. In cold metal forming processes high interface pressures between die and material take place. These pressures can be the limiting factor of application of cold forming. By reducing interfacial friction, contact pressures can be reduced too. Knowledge of friction amount (factor of friction Âµ and/or friction ratio m) is essential for calculation of the main process parameters (load, energy), for choosing a proper lubricant but also for numerical modelling of <b>forming</b> <b>operations.</b> There exist a number of experimental methods to determine friction in metal forming processes. Current paper deals with the possibilities to evaluate friction. It analyses and assesses a number of existing friction models in cold metal operations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: AlâSiCw {{composites}} can {{be readily}} shaped with conventional secondary metalworking techniques. During such <b>forming</b> <b>operations,</b> AlâSiCw composites may experience appreciable amounts of cold work, which may both influence their further <b>forming</b> <b>operations</b> and degrade some mechanical properties. Therefore, after <b>forming</b> <b>operations</b> {{it may be necessary}} to anneal the composites. Mostly, recrystallization annealing is used to achieve this purpose. The purpose of this study is to give useful information on thermomechanical processing of AlâSiCw composites by investigating their recrystallization kinetics. Al/SiC/ 15 w composites are fabricated through a squeeze casting route followed by a hot extrusion at an extrusion ratio of 18 : 1, and cold-rolled to 30, 50, and 70 % of the original thickness, respectively. Then as-cold-rolled Al/SiC/ 15 w composites are heated either con-tinuously or isothermally to make the composites recrystallize. To investigate the kinetics of the cold-rolled composites during heating, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and hardness testing are carried out. It is found that the recrystallization kinetics of Al/SiC/ 15 w composites is strongly dependent on deformation degree...|$|R
