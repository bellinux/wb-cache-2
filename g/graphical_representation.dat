40|$|The {{large number}} of bases in a DNA {{sequence}} and the cryptic nature of the 4 -alphabet <b>representation</b> make <b>graphical</b> visualization of DNA sequences useful for biologists. However, existing 3 D <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> are complicated, whereas existing 2 D <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> suffer from high degeneracy, and many features in a DNA sequence cannot be visualized clearly. This Letter introduces a novel 2 D method of DNA representation: the DB-Curve (Dual-Base Curve), which overcomes some of the limitations in existing 2 D <b>graphical</b> <b>representations.</b> Many properties of DNA sequences can be observed and visualized easily {{using a combination of}} DB-Curves. The new representation can avoid degeneracy completely compared to existing 2 D <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> of DNA sequences. Unlike 3 D <b>graphical</b> <b>representations,</b> no 2 D projection is required for the DB-Curve, and this allows for easier analysis of DNA sequences. The DB-Curve provides a useful graphical tool for the visualization and study of DNA sequences. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|International audiencehis paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> in the teaching-learning process. We investigate the case of earthquakes <b>graphical</b> <b>representations.</b> Indeed, the Earth shakes often, causing sometimes main damages. The March 2011 earthquake off Japan and the December 2004 off Indonesia are recent and impressive samples. The massive media coverage of such events places {{people in front of}} many <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> explicative of seismic phenomena. At the same time, earthquakes are a science education issue where <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> are put at stake. In this context, our case study at grade 5 aims at characterizing what students may learn of earthquakes with the study of <b>graphical</b> <b>representations.</b> We then compare this with news <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> and scientific <b>graphical</b> <b>representations.</b> Our work is situated within the theoretical framework of the JATD or Joint Action Theory in Didactics (Sensevy & Mercier, 2007; Sensevy, 2011 a, 2011 b). In the JATD, teaching-learning practices are modelled as learning games (Sensevy, op. cit.). Learning games are knowledge games where teachers and students act together but from asymmetric positions. They both win if the knowledge at stake is learned. We account for the unfolding of learning games by the means of a system of theoretical categories, notably the didactic contract and milieu (Brousseau, 1997; Chevallard, 1992; Sensevy, op. cit.). Knowledges at stake in learning games are referred to social knowledge practices modelled as epistemic games (Santini & Loquet, 2011). The comparison between learning games and epistemic games allow us in fine to specify what learning might occurr from the didactic action. Within the JATD, we consider representations as public (Hacking, 1983). Concerning earthquakes, <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> are used in classrooms mainly to render present what is not present. On the one hand, they bring some unknownness and uncertainty in the didactic milieu (Kerneis, 2010). On the other hand, <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> also participate to the ecology of didactic actions in their determinations (Sensevy, 2011 c). Moreover, these two didactic roles of <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> are all the more important since representations are not accurate to nature but to current knowledge (Fleck, 1979). Considering these points, and in regard to the mass media coverage of major earthquakes, we address the subsidiary issue of the uses a teacher can have of <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> originated from the news...|$|R

The software shows a <b>graphical</b> <b>representation</b> {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} of exploring usage analysis in learning systems by means of <b>graphical</b> <b>representations.</b> Learning systems collect large amounts of student data {{that can be used}} by instructors to become aware of what is happening in distance learning classes. Instead of being processed with techniques from user modelling, data is displayed “as it is”. Techniques from Information Visualization show how useful insights can be gained from <b>graphical</b> <b>representations.</b> A system called GISMO illustrates the proposed approach. By presenting <b>graphical</b> <b>representations,</b> GISMO allows the user to visualize data from courses collected in real settings. We will show how using <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> of student tracking data enables instructors to identify tendencies in their classes, or to quickly discover individuals who need special attention...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Interactive <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> {{have been}} used and {{promoted}} to facilitate learning (Cheng, 1999). However, not much is known about what kinds of <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> and what forms of interactivity are effective (Rogers, 1999). The present research explores how external cognition affects learning (Scaife and Rogers, 1996; Rogers and Scaife, 1997). More specifically it addresses {{the question of whether}} providing 3 D interactive <b>graphical</b> <b>representations</b> in problems that require the depiction of 3 D properties is beneficial for the learning process. In order to address the research question stated above, four Interactive Learning Environments (ILEs) were created with different <b>graphical</b> <b>representations.</b> Each learning environment tackled the same concept in the same manner, except for differences in the diagrams and interactivity. In total, the ILEs were composed of 15 diagrams distributed along six explanatory steps with accompanying text. So, the ILEs are in fac...|$|R
