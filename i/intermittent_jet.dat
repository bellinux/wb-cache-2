40|$|The prompt {{emission}} of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{is characterized by}} rapid variabilities, which may be a direct reflection of the unsteady central engine. We perform a series of axisymmetric 2. 5 -dimensional simulations to study the propagation of relativistic, hydrodynamic, <b>intermittent</b> <b>jets</b> through the envelope of a GRB progenitor star. A realistic rapidly rotating star is incorporated as the background of jet propagation, and the star is allowed to collapse due to {{the gravity of the}} central black hole. By modeling the <b>intermittent</b> <b>jets</b> with constant-luminosity pulses with equal on and off durations, we investigate how the half-period, T, affects the jet dynamics. For relatively small T values (e. g. 0. 2 s), the jet breakout time t_ bo depends on the opening angle of the jet, with narrower jets more penetrating and reaching the surface at shorter times. For T ≤ 1 s, the reverse shock crosses each pulse before the jet penetrates through the stellar envelope. As a result, after the breakout of the first group of pulses at t_ bo, several subsequent pulses vanish before penetrating the star, causing a quiescent gap. For larger half-periods (T= 2. 0, 4. 0 s), all the pulses can successfully penetrate through the envelope, since each pulse can propagate through the star before the reverse shock crosses the shell. Our results may interpret the existence of a weak precursor in many long GRBs, given that the GRB central engine injects intermittent pulses with half-period T ≤ 1 s. The observational data seem to be consistent with such a possibility. Comment: 19 pages, 15 figures, ApJ accepte...|$|R

We use a simple model for the metal distribution within the host galaxy which includes metal injection via star formation. We carry out 2 D axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of these systems. After having established a cooling flow, two light jets are injected in opposite directions with a range of (intermittent) active phases. We follow the time evolution of the system from the jets' active phases up to 3 Gyr. The general metallicity evolution for all our simulations is very similar on large-scales. The convective flows driven by the jets advect gas and metals from the central galaxy to distances beyond 1. 5 Mpc within the cluster. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>jets</b> are able to distribute metals to grater radii. The metal injection has effects on the general metal abundances present in the ICM, the faster the metal replenishment time the higher the metal abundance.

In particular, we propose that 3 C 273 radio source is intrinsically two-sided, and represents an analogue of double-double radio galaxies, but only inclined at a small angle to the line of sight. In this case, the apparent one-sideness of the kiloparsec-scale radio structure may be due to combined Doppler and time-travel effects alone, if the 3 C 273 large-scale jet itself is relativistic and matter-dominated. We also propose, that knotty morphology of the discussed jet, which is observed now additionally at optical and X-ray frequencies, indicates modulation in the jet kinetic power.

The bright biconical structure of the Red Rectangle nebula can be understood to be composed of a multiple double-ring system. In the proposed shaping process, one among several processes through which a companion can shape the circumbinary gas, the companion accretes mass from the slow wind blown by the evolved mass losing star. An accretion disk is formed, and if mass accretion is larger than a critical value, two jets, or a collimated fast wind (CFW) are blown. If the high mass loss rate duration is long, bipolar lobes are formed. If, on the other hand, mass loss rate is intermittent, and during one orbital period the slow wind fills a region which does not extend much beyond the binary system, then {{only a fraction of}} the double-lobe structure is formed, namely, rings.

We explore {{the effects of this}} ICM weather on the morphological evolution of the AGN jets and lobes. The orientation of the jets is different in the two simulations so that they probe different aspects of the ICM structure and dynamics. We find that even for this cluster that can be characterized as relaxed by an observational standard, the large-scale, bulk ICM motions can significantly distort the jets and lobes. Synthetic X-ray observations of the simulations show that the jets produce complex cavity systems, while synthetic radio observations reveal bending of the jets and lobes similar to wide-angle tail (WAT) radio sources.

For AGN population synthesis models to replicate the peak region of the CXB (~ 30 keV), a highly obscured and therefore nearly invisible class of AGN, known as Compton thick (CT) AGN, must be assumed to contribute {{nearly a third of the}} CXB. In order to constrain the CT fraction of AGN and the CT number density we consider several hard X-ray AGN luminosity functions and the contribution of blazars to the CXB. Following the unified scheme, the radio AGN luminosity function is relativistically beamed to create a radio blazar luminosity function. An average blazar spectral energy density model is created to transform radio luminosity to X-ray luminosity. We find the blazar contribution to the CXB to be 12 % in the 0. 5 - 2 keV band, 7. 4 % in the 2 - 10 keV band, 8. 9 % in the 15 - 55 keV band, and 100 % in the MeV region.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of exposure to <b>intermittent</b> <b>jet</b> aircraft noise (70 dBA or 95 dBA maximum intensity) and knowledge of results concerning signal detections (hit-KR) on performance efficiency and perceived workload in a 40 -min visual vigilance task. The noise featured a Doppler-like quality in which planes seemed to approach from the monitor's left and recede to the right. Perceptual sensitivity (d) was poorer in the context of noise than in quiet but only in the presence of hit-KR. The lack of noise-related performance differences in the absence of hit-KR most likely reflected a "floor effect " rather than some special relation between noise and feedback. When compared to subjects performing in quiet, those who operated in noise were less able to profit from hit-KR, a result that may reflect the effects of noise on information processing. In addition to its negative effects on signal detectability, noise elevated the perceived workload, as measured by the NASA-TLX. This effect was robust; it was independent of the presence of hit-KR, even though hit-KR generally lowered the overall level of perceived workload. The results provide the initial experimental demonstration that perceived workload is a sensitive measure of the effects of aircraft noise in monitoring tasks.

40|$|The solar {{chromosphere}} contains thin, highly dynamic {{strands of}} plasma known as spicules. Recently, {{it has been}} suggested that the smallest and fastest (Type II) spicules are identical to <b>intermittent</b> <b>jets</b> observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. These jets appear to expand out along open magnetic field lines rooted in unipolar network regions of coronal holes. In this paper we revisit a thirty-year-old idea that spicules may be caused by upward forces associated with Alfven waves. These forces involve the conversion of transverse Alfven waves into compressive acoustic-like waves that steepen into shocks. The repeated buffeting due to upward shock propagation causes nonthermal expansion of the chromosphere and a transient levitation of the transition region. Some older models of wave-driven spicules assumed sinusoidal wave inputs, but the solar atmosphere is highly turbulent and stochastic. Thus, we model this process using the output of a time-dependent simulation of reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting mode-converted compressive waves are strongly variable in time, with a higher transition region occurring when the amplitudes are large and a lower transition region when the amplitudes are small. In this picture, the transition region bobs up and down by several Mm on timescales less than a minute. These motions produce narrow, intermittent extensions of the chromosphere that have similar properties as the observed jets and Type II spicules.

40|$|Short abstract: We present fully 3 -D {{simulations}} of supersonic, radiatively cooling <b>intermittent</b> <b>jets</b> with intermediate and long variability periods (that is, periods {{of the order}} of or longer than, the dynamical time scale of the jet). Variations of intermediate period elucidate the formation and evolution of chains of internal regularly spaced radiative shocks, which in this work are identified with the observed emission knots of protostellar jets. Variations of long period elucidate the formation of multiple bow shock structures separated by long trails of diffuse gas, which resemble those observed in systems like HH 111 and HH 46 / 47. The time variability of the outflow is probably associated with observed irruptive events in the accretion process around the protostars. In our simulations, the outflow variations are produced by periodically turning on the outflow with a highly supersonic velocity and periodically turning off it to a low velocity regime. In the case of velocity variations of intermediate period, we find, as in previous work, that the shock structures form a train of regularly spaced emitting features which move away from the source with a velocity close to that of the outflow, have high radial motions, and produce low intensity spectra, as required by the observations. As they propagate downstream, the shocks widen and dissipate due to the expulsion of material sideways to the cocoon by the high pressure gradients of the postshock gas. This fading explains the most frequent occurence of knots closer to the driving source. In the case of the long period velocity variability, our simulations have produced a pair of bow-shock-like structures separated by a trail almostComment: accepted by ApJ, LaTex file, 33 pages; 7 Figures availableon request, USP-IAG pre...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Gravity {{waves on}} the sea surface reflect {{coupling}} between the atmo-sphere and ocean. They play important dynamical roles in the transfer of momen-tum, heat, and scalars, but how they interact with background oceanic (and atmo-spheric) turbulence is still not well understood. This is especially true under high winds where waves foster Langmuir circulations but also break intermittently. Results from high-resolution large eddy simulations (LESs) that include stochas-tic breaking waves and the Craik-Leibovich “vortex force ” are analyzed. Under certain sea states turbulence (anisotropic seed vorticity) generated by breaking waves initiates Craik-Leibovich instabilities that lead to coherent structures, viz., Langmuir cells and <b>intermittent</b> downwelling <b>jets</b> both of which impact ocean mixing. We suggest a mechanism as to how breaking waves couple with the vortex force {{that leads to the}} formation of these flow structures. 1...|$|R
