40|$|This project investigates {{how the new}} segment {{has placed}} the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in an {{aberrant}} and stigmatized position, and how it has influenced {{the location of the}} injection room and the physical surroundings on Plads til Alle. This study shows that the new segment of residents and the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> use the urban space in different ways. The behaviour of <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in the public space varies from the norm, which places them in a deviated position. Because of the greater contrast between the two segments, the physi- cal characteristics of the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> have been more distinct. This leads to a further stig- matization of the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts.</b> The residents of Inner Vesterbro wish to help the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> and they are in favour of an injection room. However they don’t want the injection room placed too close to their homes, and therefore they have a NIMBY-attitude towards the injection room.

40|$|Background: Drug {{abuse is}} on the rise. Drug {{addiction}} lowers the general immunity of the body. Tuberculosis {{is known to be}} one of the major infectious diseases with a high incidence among <b>drug</b> <b>addicts.</b> Treatment of <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> suffering from tuberculosis is a challenge to the treating physician. Methods: An interventional prospective study which involved free de-addiction drugs and motivation along with free anti tubercular drugs under Revised National Tuberculosis Programme was undertaken among <b>drug</b> <b>addicts.</b> Sixty <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> suffering from tuberculosis, registered under RNTCP in SPM marg TB Clinic (Pili Kothi) between 2002 - 2007 and treated under DOTS along with de-addiction treatment by an NGO (Sharan) formed the study sample.

Results: Extensive counselling for de-addiction and motivation of the study patients along with nutritional food supplements improved the compliance and adherence to treatment with equal success rates as in non-addict tuberculosis patients.

40|$|From contact {{investigation}} to tuberculosis screening of <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> and homeless persons in Rotterdam Gerard de Vries and Rob A. van Hest Background: In early 2001 there were indications that tuberculosis (TB) was increasingly becoming a problem among <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> and homeless persons in Rotterdam, after a periodical screening was discontinued in 1997. A contact investigation around a homeless <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> man in Rotterdam with infectious pulmonary TB is described. Contact investigation: A total of 507 <b>drug</b> <b>addicts,</b> homeless persons, and staff of facilities for these risk groups were examined with tuberculin skin testing (TST) and chest radiography. DNA fingerprinting of mycobacteriological cultures through Restricted Fragment Length Polymorphism methodology and molecular epidemiology investigation through cluster analysis were performed. Outcome: TST showed an infection prevalence of 29 %, especially among staff {{of services for}} <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> and homeless persons.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I address {{the quality of}} life of <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in {{dependence}} on the duration of their drug use and their age. <b>Drug</b> <b>addicts</b> have a number of social problems and are also exposed to health risks. The objective of my thesis was to determine the quality-of-life score of those persons, and to ascertain whether their quality of life differs in comparison with the general population and also in comparison between the individual groups into which the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> were divided according to the period of the drug use. In order to achieve these objectives, I raised hypotheses H 1 : <b>Drug</b> <b>addicts</b> have lower quality of life than the general population, H 2 : The quality of life of <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> deteriorates in relation with the length of the addiction, and H 3 : The quality of life of <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> is lower with increased person age. The method used in my work was SF- 36 questionnaire. From the results of my work it follows that, in statistic terms, <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> have considerably lower quality of life than the control group in all 8 examined fields (domains). Actually, in three domains the average score achieved by the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> did not reach even a half of the score achieved by the control group. Hypothesis H 1 was confirmed. Comparison of individual groups of <b>drug</b> <b>addicts,</b> namely the persons addicted for 11 - 15 years and the group of users (0 - 5 years), revealed an interesting value of emotional restriction of roles. From this comparison it follows that the persons who have been <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> for rather a long time have not been able to hold their social roles in the society in emotional terms any more, which confirms also hypothesis H 2. In the end was hypothesis H 3 confirmed. It is also obvious from the results of my work that, while working with <b>drug</b> <b>addicts,</b> the attention needs to be given to their motivation to undertake treatment so that their quality of life ceases to deteriorate and, on the contrary, improves again in their life without drugs...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Many {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> individuals exhibit impaired performance on executive function tests but {{a few studies have}} been conducted on executive functions of <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in Iran. To contribute to this understanding, the present study was designed to assess some domains related to executive functions including cognitive flexibility, attention and speed of mental processing in a sample of <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in comparison with a sample of non-drug addicts. Methods: 155 male addicts between 25 to 35 years of age were selected from outpatient addiction clinics in Karaj, Iran. This group consisted of 3 subgroups of opium (n= 40), hydrochloride heroin (n= 63), and methamphetamine (n= 52) addicts. A control group was selected matching the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in gender, age, education and scio-economic status and included 130 healthy non-drug taking males. A battery of standardized executive function tests including the Color trail making test, Stroop color word test, and Symbol digit modalities test were administered. Data analysis was conducted by performing Co-variance (MANCOVA) in SPSS. v. 16. 0. Results: The study findings indicated that the group of <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects performed significantly worse compared with the controls on all executive measures. There were also significant differences among the 3 subgroups. The hydrochloride group had the worst performance compared the methamphetamine and opium groups respectively. <b>Drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects with longer duration of drug addiction were much worse on all measures in comparison with <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects with shorter duration of drug addiction. Discussion: The study results confirmed that the functions of specific brain regions underlying cognitive flexibility, attention and speed of mental processing were significantly impaired in the group of <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects. These impairments were also significantly related to type of drug used and duration of drug addiction that may contribute to most of behavioral disturbances found in <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> and need specific attention for intervention and treatment programs...|$|R
