5|$|The Great Depression {{took its}} toll on the congregation, and {{membership}} dropped.

5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, the two new leaders of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has <b>individual</b> <b>members</b> linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with <b>individual</b> <b>members</b> remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Prime Minister's {{own party}} was {{breaking}} down underneath him. There {{had been no}} official party platform yet agreed to, and <b>individual</b> <b>members</b> had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation. The government's existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, {{as a result of}} by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and Edward Mann were two of the government's most ardent opponents in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to <b>individual</b> <b>members</b> of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E

5|$|The book {{begins as}} a chronological {{narrative}} of Suzuki's life with photographs {{of his family and}} friends.

The CJOPS commands the Headquarters Joint Operations Command (HQJOC) as well as temporary joint task forces. These joint task forces comprise units assigned from their service to participate in operations or training exercises.|$|E
5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. <b>Individual</b> <b>members</b> then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E

While the band is acclaimed for its large catalog of hits, with over 300 songs composed since 1972, its members are also admired for their commitment to live the message of solidarity for national development that features in most of their music. Each band member has gone on to cultivate a primary career in addition to his participation in Mahaleo in areas ranging from medical care and sociology to farming and politics. The band has collectively launched two development initiatives, in addition to numerous other activities managed by <b>individual</b> <b>members</b> of the group.|$|E
