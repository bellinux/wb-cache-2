Sequential choices represent an opportunity to manage the pursuit of one's multiple personal goals. Consumers typically manage these personal goals by combining indulgent and virtuous choices. When choosing <b>for</b> <b>others,</b> however, {{this is not the}} case. Consumers then focus on a pleasure-seeking goal, which leads to indulgent choices <b>for</b> <b>others.</b> Six experiments demonstrate this phenomenon and uncover conditions that encourage more virtuous choices <b>for</b> <b>others.</b> (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Caring <b>for</b> <b>others</b> {{is often}} costly, {{which is why}} care work is {{associated}} with the “care penalty”. This penalty is so named because a person’s work caring <b>for</b> <b>others</b> is often not compensated by any monetary means. It has been suggested that individuals who don’t take care of others—especially the next generation—will not be capable of reproducing themselves. The implication is that the receipt of care is often necessary for individuals to reach the stage of life where they can go on to care <b>for</b> <b>others.</b> This argument suggests that care is necessary for the development of human life and, on a larger scale, for functional societies. The target of teaching individuals to care <b>for</b> <b>others</b> may lead to forms of distributional struggle, particularly along gender lines.|$|R

Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her.

40|$|Modern {{societies}} have reconciled the dilemma between self-interest and caring <b>for</b> <b>others</b> by dividing {{women and men}} into different moral categories. Women {{have been expected to}} seek personal develop-ment by caring <b>for</b> <b>others,</b> while men care <b>for</b> <b>others</b> by sharing the rewards of their independent work achievements. Changes in work and family life have undermined this framework but have failed to offer a clear avenue for creating new resolutions. Instead contradictory social changes have produced new moral dilemmas. Women must now seek economic self-sufficiency even as they continue to bear respon-sibility for the care of others. Men can reject the obligation to provide <b>for</b> <b>others,</b> but they face new pres-sures to become more involved fathers and partners. Facing these dilemmas, young women and men must develop innovative moral strategies to renegotiate work-family conflicts and transform traditional views of gender, but persisting institutional obstacles thwart their emerging aspirations to balance per-sonal autonomy with caring <b>for</b> <b>others.</b> To overcome these obstacles, we need to create more humane, less gendered theoretical and social frameworks for understanding and apportioning moral obligation. Choosing between self-interest and caring <b>for</b> <b>others</b> {{is one of the most}} fundamen-tal dilemmas facing all of us. To reconcile this dilemma, modern societies in gen-eral—and American society in particular—have tried to divide women and me...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many {{situations}} {{require us}} to generate external cues to support later retrieval frommemory. For instance, we create file names in order to cue our memory to a file’s contents, and instructors create lecture slides to remember what points to make during classes. We even generate cues <b>for</b> <b>others</b> when we remind friends of shared experiences or send colleagues a computer file that is named {{in such a way}} so as to remind them of its contents. Here we explore how and how well learners tailor retrieval cues for different intended recipients. Across three experiments, subjects generated verbal cues for a list of target words for themselves or <b>for</b> <b>others.</b> Learners generated cues <b>for</b> <b>others</b> by increasing the normative cue-to-target as-sociative strength but also by increasing the number of other words their cues point to, relative to cues that they generated for themselves. This strategy was effective: such cues sup-ported higher levels of recall <b>for</b> <b>others</b> than cues generated for oneself. Generating cues <b>for</b> <b>others</b> also required more time than generating cues for oneself. Learners responded to the differential demands of cue generation <b>for</b> <b>others</b> by effortfully excluding personal, episodic knowledge and including knowl-edge that they estimate to be broadly shared...|$|R

To test this, we elicit loss aversion in three treatments: making risky decisions for oneself, <b>for</b> one <b>other</b> subject, or <b>for</b> the decision maker and another person combined.
