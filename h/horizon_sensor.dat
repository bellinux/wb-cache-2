50|$|Similar to the {{way that}} a {{terrestrial}} gyrocompass uses a pendulum to sense local gravity and force its gyro into alignment with Earth's spin vector, and therefore point north, an orbital gyrocompass uses a <b>horizon</b> <b>sensor</b> to sense the direction to Earth's center, and a gyro to sense rotation about an axis normal to the orbit plane.

Pitch and roll were sensed by two hermetic integrating gyro units. A rate gyro unit determined yaw error by sensing orbital rate.

50|$|The Wake Shield Facility {{deployment}} {{operation was}} canceled on Saturday. This delay {{was the result}} of several factors, including radio interference and an inability to read the Wake Shields status lights when the orbiters payload bay is in full sunlight. Deployment originally was scheduled for 10 am CST, but after grappling the free-flyer and lifting it out of the cargo bay and into the pre-deploy position, crew members and investigators on the ground were unable to tell whether power and transmitter status lights were giving the proper indications. After determining that the problem was not a systems failure, but difficulty in reading the status lights, the crew and flight controllers prepared for another release attempt. Interference between the radio transmitter on the Wake Shield Facility and the receiver on its payload bay carrier resulted in a one-day delay.Wake Shield deployment was also cancelled on Sunday, 6 February 1994 during its orbit 53 opportunity at 12:25 pm WSF and flight controllers worked on problems with the Pitch and Roll sensors on WSFs Attitude, Direction and Control system. Astronaut N. Jan Davis moved the wrist joint on the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) arm to try to point WSFs <b>Horizon</b> <b>Sensor</b> into the Sun in an attempt to warm up the sensors electronics package. The last deployment opportunity for Sunday was a 50-minute window beginning at 2:23 EST on orbit 54 but WSF was not ready. It was left mounted on the RMS during the crew sleep period while ground controllers considered their options. On its perch {{at the end of the}} RMS over night, WSF was able to grow 2 Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) thin films. The next deployment opportunity on 7 February 1994 would have been during orbit 67 but payload controllers and flight controllers determined that there would be insufficient time to safely develop contingency procedures in the event that WSF was unable to maintain stable attitude control without the use of its <b>Horizon</b> <b>Sensor.</b> It was decided that for the remainder of the mission, all WSF operations would take place at the end of the RMS and there would be no WSF free-flying operations on the mission.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. Horizon sensing is an {{effective}} way to determine the pitch and roll of a LEO satellite and Earth horizon sensors that operate in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum are commonly used. These sensors have the disadvantage that they cannot operate when the satellite is in eclipse. Earth horizon sensors that operate in the infrared spectral range are a solution to take attitude measurements when the satellite is in eclipse. Until recently infrared detectors could only operate at very low temperatures and needed to be cryogenically cooled. The result was that their power consumption and physical characteristics (like dimensions and mass) were such that they were not suitable for use in small and medium LEO satellites. As a result of technology expansion in the field of infrared imagers the past few years, infrared imagers were developed which do not require cooling. The scope of this project was to develop and implement an Earth <b>horizon</b> <b>sensor</b> by using a low-cost, uncooled infrared imager. The performance and physical characteristics of various imager were evaluated and it was decided to select a low resolution thermopile imager mainly {{as a result of the}} cost limitations of the project. Software algorithms were then evaluated and selected for horizon detection and attitude determination. The Earth <b>horizon</b> <b>sensor</b> that was developed did not comply with the accuracy requirement (3 s < 0. 1 o) that was set for the project because of the low resolution of the sensor. Methods to improve the accuracy were investigated and finally a sub-pixel edge estimation algorithm was developed and implemented which resulted in an improvement of 69 % in the pitch accuracy and 49 % in roll accuracy. With the sub-pixel edge estimation algorithm implemented the <b>horizon</b> <b>sensor</b> almost met the accuracy requirements (s < 0. 0811 o for pitch and s < 0. 2944 o for roll). This project confirms that, with further improvement to the design and test facilities, developing a low-cost, uncooled infrared Earth <b>horizon</b> <b>sensor</b> that meets the accuracy requirements is feasible...|$|E

30|$|The {{attitude}} of a sounding rocket {{launched in the}} DELTA (Dynamics and Energetics of the Lower Thermosphere in Aurora) campaign was determined with IR <b>horizon</b> <b>sensors</b> and geomagnetic sensors. Since the payload was separated into two portions, two sets of attitude sensors were needed. A new IR sensor was developed for the present experiment, and found the zenith-angle of the spin-axis of the rocket with an accuracy of 2 °. By combining information obtained by both type of sensors, the absolute attitudes were determined. The auroral green line emission rate was measured by a photometer on board the same rocket launched under active auroral conditions, and the energy flux of the auroral particle precipitation was estimated.|$|R
50|$|Scanning Earth <b>horizon</b> <b>sensors</b> use a {{spinning}} mirror or prism and focus a narrow {{beam of light}} onto a sensing element usually called a bolometer. The spinning causes the device to sweep out the area of a cone and electronics inside the sensor detect when the infrared signal from Earth is first received and then lost. The time between is used to determine Earth’s width. From this the roll angle can be determined. A factor that plays into the accuracy of such sensors is the fact the Earth is not perfectly circular. Another is that the sensor does not detect land or ocean, but infrared in the atmosphere which can reach certain intensities due to the season and latitude.|$|R
