5|$|Tycho {{and others}} had {{observed}} the supernova of 1572. Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and discussed Kepler's supernova in 1604. Since these new stars displayed no detectable diurnal parallax, Galileo concluded that they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in the <b>immutability</b> of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{apparent}} <b>immutability</b> of the heavens, Chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could appear. In 185 AD, {{they were the first}} to observe and write about a supernova, now known as the SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.|$|E
5|$|In October 1604, {{a bright}} new evening star (SN 1604) appeared, but Kepler {{did not believe}} the rumors until he saw it himself. Kepler began {{systematically}} observing the nova. Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a fiery trigon, the start of the about 800-year cycle of great conjunctions; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of Charlemagne (c. 800 years earlier) and the birth of Christ (c. 1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor. It was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his De Stella Nova. In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating. He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the <b>immutability</b> of the heavens (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the celestial spheres were perfect and unchanging). The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens. In an appendix, Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the Star of Bethlehem—analogous to the present new star—would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle.|$|E

Neuroscientific research indicates that experience can actually change both the brain's physical structure (anatomy) and functional organization (physiology). , neuroscientists {{are engaged in a}} reconciliation of critical-period studies (demonstrating the <b>immutability</b> of the brain after development) with the more recent research showing how the brain can, and does, change in response to hitherto unsuspected stimuli.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{the coming}} into effect of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1985 saw {{a shift in the}} gay rights {{movement}} in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the <b>immutability</b> of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{creation}} of the Mudawana in Moroccan law represented a major step in the political and legal unification of Morocco after it gained independence from the French. Its first version was written in 1957-8 by a group of ten male religious scholars (Ulama) working {{under the auspices of the}} monarchy; its substance drew heavily on classical Maliki law. As the French had ruled Morocco with a policy of legal pluralism (maintaining, for example, the existence of Berber customary law within Berber communities), the new Mudawana was intended to signify the nation’s unity, Islamic identity, and modernity. It did this in part by codifying the system of existing patriarchal, kin-based social structures within the newly independent state. In addition, the Mudawana is the only section of Moroccan law that relies primarily on Islamic sources, rather than Spanish or French civil codes, which gave it a greater sense of <b>immutability</b> and contributed to the difficulty of reforming it later on. A state's family or personal status law has wide-ranging implications for citizens' daily lives, but many gender equality advocates point out its particular significance for women, as it governs the age at which they may be married, issues of divorce and child custody, and their right to work and travel outside the home. Even as various Muslim-majority states have expanded public civil and political rights for women, separate family laws rooted in Shari'a have often remained unchanged; for many Muslims, these family laws remain an untouchable symbol of Muslim identity.|$|E

Waugh's first fiction with a Catholic theme was the short story [...] "Out of Depth" [...] (1933) about the <b>immutability</b> of the Mass. From the mid-1930s onwards, Catholicism and conservative politics were much featured in his journalistic and non-fiction writing before he reverted to his former manner with Scoop (1938), a novel about journalism, journalists, and unsavoury journalistic practices.|$|E
500|$|Rider Haggard {{returned}} to Britain in 1881. At the time, England was increasingly beset {{by the social}} and cultural anxieties that marked the fin de siècle. One of the most prominent concerns was the fear of political and racial decline, encapsulated in Max Nordau's Degeneration (1895). Barely half a century earlier, Thomas Babington Macaulay had declared [...] "the history of England" [...] to be [...] "emphatically the history of progress", but late-Victorians living in the wake of Darwinian evolution had lost the earlier positivism of their age. Uncertainty over the <b>immutability</b> of Britain's historical identity, what historian Tim Murray has called the [...] "threat of the past", was manifested in the Victorian obsession with ancient times and archaeology. Haggard was greatly interested in the ruins discovered at Zimbabwe in the 1870s. In 1896, he provided the preface to a monograph that detailed a history of the site, declaring: ...|$|E
500|$|In Great Britain, the {{philosophy}} of natural theology remained influential. William Paley's 1802 book Natural Theology with its famous watchmaker analogy had been written {{at least in part}} {{as a response to the}} transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin. Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck, Grant, and Vestiges. Although Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the <b>immutability</b> of species, and in his Principles of Geology, he criticized Lamarck's theories of development. Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in embryology, as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of [...] "archetypes" [...] in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as vertebrate limbs. Owen led a public campaign that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, and the controversy surrounding Vestiges, showed him the need to ensure that his own ideas were scientifically sound.|$|E

2500|$|From Pharisaic times, {{there has}} always been some level of {{opposition}} to the concept of a [...] "Dual Torah" [...] within the umbrella of Judaism, although today only the Karaite sect formally opposes the incorporation of any extra-biblical law into their practice.

2500|$|Cuvier's {{claim that}} new fossil forms appear {{abruptly}} in the geological record and then continue without alteration in overlying strata {{was used by}} later critics of evolution to support creationism, to whom the abruptness seemed consistent with special divine creation (although Cuvier's finding that different types made their paleontological debuts in different geological strata clearly did not).

2500|$|... 18th-century {{scientist}} Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) published Systema Naturae (1735- [...] ), a book {{in which}} he considered that new varieties of plants could arise through hybridization, but only under certain limits fixed by God. Linnaeus had initially embraced the Aristotelian idea of <b>immutability</b> of species (the idea that species never change), but later in his life he started to challenge it.

2500|$|In the 8th century, John of Damascus listed {{eighteen}} attributes for God in his An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith (...) [...] These eighteen attributes {{were divided}} into four groups based on time (e.g., being everlasting), space (e.g., being boundless), matter or quality and the list continues to be influential to date, partially appearing in some form in various modern formulations. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas focused on a shorter list of just eight attributes, namely: simplicity, perfection, goodness, incomprehensibility, omnipresence, <b>immutability,</b> eternity and oneness. Other formulations include the 1251 list of the Fourth Lateran Council which was then adopted at Vatican I in 1870 and the Westminster Shorter Catechism in the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders situates open theism {{as a form}} of freewill theism {{which goes}} back to the early church fathers and in Protestantism, it is {{prominent}} in the Arminian-Wesleyan traditions. In freewill theism God does not micromanage the creation, {{as is the case in}} theological determinism, but instead exercises “general sovereignty” by which God enacts the overarching structures in which creatures operate. Humans have libertarian free will such that for a free act the individual could have acted differently from reality. God does not determine or tightly control what humans do which means that God takes risks that humans might do things (likebsin) that God does not want them to do. The divine will, for some things, can be thwarted. Freewill theists have emphasized reciprocal relations between humans and God when it comes to salvation and prayer. They believe that God graciously initiates the call to redemption by granting enabling grace but that humans are free to accept it or reject it. When believers petition God in prayer what the believer prays can have an effect on God. Some divine decisions are contingent upon our actions. In other words, God responds to what creatures do, and what happens in history makes a difference to the way God acts in history. When such ideas are applied to the divine attributes, freewill theists reject “strong” divine <b>immutability</b> (God cannot change in any respect) and “strong” impassibility (God cannot be affected by what creatures do). Freewill theists do affirm “weak” impassibility (God is not overcome by emotions as humans are apt to be) and “weak” <b>immutability</b> (the divine nature [...] never changes).|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "negligible senescence" [...] {{was first}} used in the early 1990s by {{professor}} Caleb Finch to describe organisms such as lobsters and hydras, which do not show symptoms of aging.

To this end, SENS identifies seven categories of aging [...] "damage" [...] and a specific regenerative medical proposal for treating each.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{observations}} by Protestant botanists Carl Friedrich von Gärtner (1772-1850) and Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter (1733-1806) {{denied the}} <b>immutability</b> of species, which (according to Christian apologists) the Bible never teaches. Kölreuter {{used the term}} [...] "transmutation of species" [...] to refer to species which have experienced biological changes through hybridization, although they both were inclined to believe that hybrids would revert to the parental forms by a general law of reversion, and therefore, would not {{be responsible for the}} introduction of new species. Later, in a number of experiments carried out between 1856 and 1863, the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel (1822-1884), aligning himself with the [...] "new doctrine of special creation" [...] proposed by Linnaeus, concluded that new species of plants could indeed arise, although limitedly and retaining their own stability.|$|E

2500|$|Fine {{emphasized}} how the 1841-2 debate delineated {{the positions}} {{around which the}} three different factions would coalesce in the coming decade, the most crucial era {{in the history of}} modern Jewish denominations. The main issue was the divine origin and, consequently, <b>immutability</b> of the chain of traditional interpretation and ruling, independent of critical analysis of past circumstances. [...] "Geiger could not understand that for Bernays, the study of history did not necessarily dictate contemporary praxis. For him, historical research was permitted, even lauded, but results had no halakhic authority. This is the form that modern Orthodoxy would eventually take under Hildesheimer... The difference between Reform Judaism that stemmed from Geiger and the Positive-Historical (and later, Conservative) Judaism that stemmed from Frankel was whether history commanded for change or conservatism. The lessons of research could be disputed, but both of them believed history to be the source of authority." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Owen {{had been}} the first to respond to the {{complimentary}} copies, courteously claiming that he had long believed that [...] "existing influences" [...] were responsible for the [...] "ordained" [...] birth of species. Darwin now had long talks with him, and told Lyell that [...] "Under garb of great civility, he was inclined to be most bitter & sneering against me. Yet I infer from several expressions, that at bottom he goes immense way with us." [...] Owen was furious at being included among those defending <b>immutability</b> of species, and in effect said that the book offered the best explanation [...] "ever published of the manner of formation of species", though he did not agree with it in all respects. He still had the gravest doubts that transmutation would bestialise man. It appears that Darwin had assured Owen that he was looking at everything as resulting from designed laws, which Owen interpreted as showing a shared belief in [...] "Creative Power".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the last}} minute, {{late in the}} evening of 30 June, Lyell and Hooker {{forwarded}} the Wallace and Darwin papers to the Secretary John Joseph Bennett, to be read at the meeting the next day. Mrs. Hooker had spent the afternoon copying out extracts from the handwritten documents Darwin had sent with his letter of the previous night, presumably chosen by Hooker to suit the verbal presentation, and Lyell and Hooker wrote a short introductory letter. The papers entitled respectively On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, incorporated Wallace's pages; and extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray. At the meeting the Secretary read the papers out, before going on to six other papers, and there was no discussion of them {{at the end of the}} meeting, perhaps because of the amount of business that had been dealt with including an obituary notice for Robert Brown given by Lyell, or possibly due to reluctance to speak out against a theory supported by the eminent Lyell and Hooker. Thomas Bell, who had written up the description of Darwin's reptile specimens from the Beagle expedition, presided over the meeting. He apparently disapproved, and in his annual presidential report presented in May 1859 wrote that [...] "The year which has passed has not, indeed, been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear". However, the Vice-President promptly removed all references to <b>immutability</b> from his own paper which was awaiting publication.|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} <b>immutability</b> of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E
