500|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> {{with the}} loss of my mother and then {{had to deal with the}} guilt of her being gone and then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> {{with the loss}} of my father when he married my stepmother. So I was just one angry {{abandoned}} girl. I'm still angry. The part of me that goes around saying [...] "Fuck you! Fuck you!" [...] is the part that's covering up the part that's saying [...] "I'm hurt!" [...] I guess all of this came through in the video.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{commented on}} the writing process: [...] "The theme <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with in Inchon was too big for a movie that was less than two hours. When Toho was {{originally}} involved, they wanted a love story between an American boy and a Korean girl. My technique is to research and then fictionalize, a technique I used successfully in French Connection. But I had to fictionalize the real landing at Inchon, making it seem that a lighthouse was a pivotal factor when in fact it wasn't. I couldn't do that, which is why other writers were brought in." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Times wrote, [...] "In glorifying {{those who}} are first, the second is often forgotten... Larry Doby {{integrated}} all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And {{he did it with}} class and clout." [...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, [...] "Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear." [...] "Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the same thing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'" [...] Doby said.|$|E

2500|$|Upon his departure, Garcia said, [...] "Have {{somebody}} {{step into}} {{my shoes and}} feel what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with throughout that whole time in San Francisco. The dust would start to settle, {{and all of a}} sudden, more fuel was thrown into the fire. It was such a negative situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Where as {{his rule}} of Wazirabad is {{described}} as just and rigorous, his governorship of Peshawar is depicted {{as a rule of}} [...] "gallows and gibbets". Avitabile boasted: [...] "When I marched into Peshawar, I sent on in advance a number of wooden posts which my men erected around the walls of the city. The men scoffed at them and laughed at the madness of the feringhee , and harder still when my men came in and laid coils of rope {{at the foot of the}} posts...However, when my preparations were completed and they found one fine morning danging from these posts, fifty of the worse characters in Peshawar, they thought different. And I repeated the exhibition every day till I had made a scarcity of brigands and murderers. Then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the liars and tale bearers. My method with them was to cut out their tongues. When a surgeon appeared and professed to be able to restore their speech, I sent for him and cut out his tongue also. After that there was peace".|$|E
2500|$|Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, whose {{previous}} film credits included Three Men and a Baby, La Bamba and Near Dark, {{approached the}} film {{with a unique}} documentary-style technique. Commenting on the initial photography lighting tests, Greenberg remarked, [...] "The first ones were a disaster. They didn't look good at all. I didn't know how to photograph these aliens. It {{was the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with this kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests." [...] At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent up and have artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, [...] "I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a big party. I wasn't going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps on the tables. The problem was, the hotel management wouldn't let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they had told us we could hang lights, but I didn't believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Jake," [...] said Andrew cautiously, [...] "rather puzzles me: I can get {{so little}} out of him, though I like the man. As you seem to know the people <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with, is there anybody else whose {{trustworthiness}} you would vouch for?" ...|$|R
2500|$|During the 2011 G-20 Cannes summit, then French {{president}} Nicolas Sarkozy was overheard {{saying to}} then U.S. President Barack Obama, [...] "I cannot bear Netanyahu, he's a liar", and Obama reportedly responded, [...] "You're {{fed up with}} him, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with him every day." ...|$|R
2500|$|Richard I {{had merely}} crossed the English Channel to claim back his territories that John Lackland betrayed Philip II by murdering the {{garrison}} of Évreux and handing the town down to Richard I. [...] "He had first betrayed his father, then {{his brother and}} now our King" [...] said William the Breton. Sancho the Strong, the future King of Navarre, joined the conflict and attacked Aquitaine, capturing Angoulème and Tours. Richard himself {{was known to be}} a great military commander. The first part of this war was difficult for Richard who suffered several setbacks, as Philip II was, as described by John Gillingham, [...] "a shrewd politician and a competent soldier." [...] But by October the new Count of Toulouse, Raymond VI, left the Capetian side and joined Richard's. He was followed by Baldwin IV of Flanders, the future Latin Emperor, as this one was contesting Artois to Philip II. In 1197, Henry VI died and was replaced by Otto IV, Richard I's own nephew. Renaud de Dammartin, the Count of Boulogne and a skilled commander, also deserted Philip II. Baldwin IV was invading Artois and captured Saint-Omer while Richard I was campaigning in Berry and inflicted a severe defeat on Philip II at Gisors, close to Paris. A truce was accepted, and Richard I had almost recovered all Normandy and now held more territories in Aquitaine than he had before. Richard <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with a revolt once again, but this time from Limousin. He was struck by a bolt in April 1199 at Châlus-Chabrol and died of a subsequent infection. His body was buried at Fontevraud like his father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Same here," [...] was the response. [...] "At first, before I {{knew who}} it was, I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with an {{ordinary}} trading captain. That's why you've got me bottled up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Mr. Sumner, I {{started on}} my theory and I wish {{to finish the}} work. I {{did not know how}} desperate the men were with whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal,</b> but in the future I shall be {{prepared}} for them. And I wish to ask a favor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about it," [...] said the Doctor, [...] "and I don't WANT to know. I {{attended}} him for a broken finger--Married and Single cricket match--and that's when I struck the nonsense. That's all. But it shows you the sort of stuff <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with, anyhow, eh? Nice to get modern sanitary ideas into a people like this!" ...|$|R

60|$|Jac. And if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> {{with another}} servant, I would learn more wit than to tempt him in disguises: for that's {{to throw a}} Venice-glass to the ground, to try if it would not break.|$|E
6000|$|Hippolyta behaved well. She came up {{holding out}} her hand, and saying, [...] "Well, Mr. Alison, {{if one is}} to fall, it is a {{pleasure}} to have so mighty a victor.

6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{but as it}} is no impertinent curiosity of mine, {{but real}} necessity, that obliges me to make these inquiries, I hope {{you will not be}} {{offended}} at my pressing for a little farther information. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal,</b> on my father's account, with several gentlemen of these wild countries, and I must trust your good sense and experience for the requisite lights upon the subject." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pitty {{gave the}} season a {{negative}} review, {{and at the}} end of the season wrote: [...] "I'm okay with any given season not being primarily focused on mother-meeting, but this season, the characters seemed to regress -- particularly Barney and Ted. Usually, when a season ends, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with a week or two weeks' worth of letdown. Right now, all I'm feeling is relief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I take a {{successful}} {{man at the}} acme of his success, and study him in a succession of scenes that bring out the fact of his prosperity {{in a way to}} strike the imagination of the audience, even the groundlings; and, of course, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with success of the most appreciable sort--a material success that is gross and palpable. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use a large canvas, as big as Shakespeare's, in fact, and I put in a great many figures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. 'Shouldn't {{have allowed}} it if I had; but I've seen the corpses.

6000|$|Waldershare heartily congratulated him. [...] "You {{have got}} what I most wished {{to have in}} the world; but I will not envy you, for envy is a vile passion.

6000|$|... "The {{very last}} dispatches <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with," [...] Sir Alfred continued, [...] "made allusion to him.

60|$|There was {{something}} in the earnestness of my manner, and the figurative style of my language, that caught the excited imagination of Leslie.

60|$|I did so, {{making my}} own {{likeness}} quite a pleasant {{relief to the}} ugliness of my brother-in-law's. It was my intention to send both portraits to the Royal Academy Exhibition, to get custom, and show the public generally what I could do. I knew the institution with which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal,</b> and called my own likeness, Portrait of a Nobleman.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of all {{the ridiculous}} young fellows that ever <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with,' resumed Mrs Todgers, 'that {{is the most}} ridiculous and unreasonable. Mr Jinkins is hard upon him sometimes, but not half {{as hard as he}} deserves. To mention such a gentleman as Mr Jinkins in the same breath with HIM--you know it's too much! And yet he's as jealous of him, bless you, as if he was his equal.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's honest on my part, {{knowing the}} people with whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal.</b> If <b>I</b> were to lay down the strict minimum which he should grant, he would add other things which would cause him to act not in {{accordance}} with my advice. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make allowance for his folly,--a sort of windage, which is not dishonest.

5000|$|Shih himself explains: [...] "My {{music is}} not traditional, but {{conscious}} of tradition.

Of course I can turn my back, say farewell to tradition and live wholly for the experiment. But in doing so, one soon becomes lonely - {{not only as a}} human being, but also as an artist. It is necessary to be conscious of one’s cultural-historical past to arrive at an artistic, i.e. individual present." ...|$|R
