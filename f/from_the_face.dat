The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} nucleus represents touch-position sensation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> It {{is located}} in the pons, near the entrance for the fifth nerve. Fibers carrying touch-position information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and mouth via cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X are sent to this nucleus when they enter the brainstem.|$|E
25|$|Touch-position {{information}} from the body is carried to the thalamus by the medial lemniscus, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> by the trigeminal lemniscus (both the anterior and posterior trigeminothalamic tracts). Pain-temperature {{information from}} the body is carried to the thalamus by the spinothalamic tract, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> by the anterior division of the trigeminal lemniscus (also called the anterior trigeminothalamic tract).|$|E

25|$|All sensory {{information}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> both touch-position and pain-temperature, {{is sent to}} the trigeminal nucleus. In classical anatomy most {{sensory information}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> is carried by the fifth nerve, but sensation from parts of the mouth, parts of the ear and parts of the meninges is carried by general somatic afferent fibers in cranial nerves VII (the facial nerve), IX (the glossopharyngeal nerve) and X (the vagus nerve).|$|E
25|$|Exactly how pain-temperature fibers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> are {{distributed}} to the spinal trigeminal nucleus is disputed. The present general understanding is that pain-temperature information from {{all areas of the}} human body is represented in the spinal cord and brainstem in an ascending, caudal-to-rostral fashion. Information from the lower extremities is represented in the lumbar cord, and that from the upper extremities in the thoracic cord. Information from the neck and {{the back of the head}} is represented in the cervical cord, and that <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and mouth in the spinal trigeminal nucleus.|$|E

25|$|The motor {{division}} of the trigeminal nerve derives from the basal plate of the embryonic pons, and the sensory division originates in the cranial neural crest. Sensory information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and body is processed by parallel pathways in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Pathways for touch-position and pain-temperature sensations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> {{and body}} merge in the brainstem, and touch-position and pain-temperature sensory {{maps of the}} entire body are {{projected}} onto the thalamus. From the thalamus, touch-position and pain-temperature information is projected onto the cerebral cortex.|$|E
25|$|Touch-position {{information}} from the body {{is sent to the}} ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. Touch-position information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> is sent to the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus. From the VPL and VPM, information is projected to the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in the parietal lobe.|$|E

25|$|The Chief's rock faces, {{especially}} the Grand Wall, exhibit the unique textural patterns which {{result from the}} process of granitic exfoliation. This is the natural means by which large, high-quality granite formations weather, erode, and age. Rather than crumbling and slowly wearing away, large flakes of granite tend to shear off and drop <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> in layers. On impact with the ground below, the shattered flakes become boulders and talus.|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of ZnO is wurtzite and the stacking sequence of atomic layers along the “c” axis is not symmetric. As a result, a ZnO crystal surface that is normal to the c axis exposes {{one of two}} distinct polar faces, with (0001 ̄) being considered <b>the</b> O <b>face</b> and (0001) <b>the</b> Zn <b>face.</b> Photoluminescence (PL) measurements on <b>the</b> two <b>faces</b> reveal a striking difference. Two transitions are observed in PL that are dominant <b>from</b> <b>the</b> O <b>face</b> and barely observed in PL <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Zn <b>face.</b> These lines are identified as phonon replicas of a particular D 0,X transition using energy separations, excitation dependence, and time-resolved PL measurements. In addition, PL emission from free excitons {{is found to be}} more intense <b>from</b> <b>the</b> O <b>face</b> than <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Zn <b>face...</b>|$|R

25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can aspirate the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action is to open the free flow valve, preferably before vomiting, and to inhale as carefully as possible.
