The proposed model calculates overflow at fixed weir and gate discharge controlled by movable weir depending on the computed water stages on the upstream and downstream reach compared to conventional model applying internal boundary condition specified as prescribed stage or rating curve. In addition, it can predict time-dependent scour depth considering soil properties under unsteady state in order to investigate the hydraulic effects on bridge structure located downstream. A historical flood event was applied to demonstrate the ver-ification of the model as simulation results were compared with observations on monitoring station.

They were known as the 1927 Feltham Stock, although the door plates carried the date 1928, and they were not delivered until 1929 and 1930. The lightweight construction caused problems in later years, when the seat risers and body bolsters developed fractures.

40|$|Fast, high-fidelity {{single and}} two-qubit gates are {{essential}} to building a viable quantum information processor, but achieving both in the same system has proved challenging for spin qubits. We propose and analyze an approach to perform a long-distance two-qubit controlled phase (CPHASE) gate between two singlet-triplet qubits using an electromagnetic resonator to mediate their interaction. The qubits couple longitudinally to the resonator, and by driving the qubits near the resonator's frequency they {{can be made to}} acquire a state-dependent geometric phase that leads to a CPHASE gate independent of the initial state of the resonator. Using high impedance resonators <b>enables</b> <b>gate</b> times of order 10 ns while maintaining long coherence times. Simulations show average gate fidelities of over 96 % using currently achievable experimental parameters and over 99 % using state-of-the-art resonator technology. After optimizing the gate fidelity in terms of parameters tuneable in-situ, we find it takes a simple power-law form in terms of the resonator's impedance and quality and the qubits' noise bath.

40|$|Strained Si is {{recognised}} as {{a necessary}} technology booster for the nanoelectronics regime. This work shows that high levels of stress attainable from globally strained Si/SiGe platforms can benefit gate leakage and reliability in addition to MOSFET channel mobility. Device self-heating due to the low thermal conductivity of SiGe is shown to be the dominating factor behind compromised performance against short channel strained Si/SiGe MOSFETs. Novel thin virtual substrates aimed at reducing self-heating effects are investigated. In addition to reducing self-heating effects, the thin Virtual substrates provide further improvements to gate oxide integrity, reliability and lifetime compared with conventional thick virtual substrates. This is attributed to tire lower surface roughness of the thin virtual substrates which arises due to the reduced interactions of strain-relieving misfit dislocations during thin Virtual substrate growth. Good agreement between experimental data and physical models is demonstrated, <b>enabling</b> <b>gate</b> leakage mechanisms to be identified. The advantages and challenges of using globally strained Si/SiGe to advance MOS technology are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Depending on the unzipping procedures, {{different kinds of}} re-organization are found to occur, mainly evidenced by {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED) and by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) analyses coupled to transmission and scanning electron microscopy observations. Such combined investigations in the real and reciprocal space represent an <b>enabling</b> <b>gate</b> able to provide structural information at the nanoscale on the clustering of graphitic layers in platelets or/and assembly into highly ordered (single-crystal) nano-sheets.

This work focused on the results achieved through such characterization methodology, evidencing the presence of different self-assemblies of graphene depending on the rotational and/or translational stacking faults of the hexagonal basal planes.

Studies of capillary effects, enhanced by miniaturization, present experimental challenges in the nanoscale regime thus making molecular simulations an important complement to direct measurement. In a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, exchange ofwater between the pores and environment requires modeling of coexisting confined and bulk phases, with confined water under the field maintaining equilibrium with the unperturbed environment. In the present article, we discuss viable methodologies for MD sampling in the above class of systems, subject to size-constraints and uncertainties of the barostat function under confinement and nonuniform-field effects. Smooth electric field variation is shown to avoid the inconsistencies of MD integration under abruptly varied field and related ambiguities of conventional barostatting in a strongly nonuniform interfacial system. When using a proper representation of the field at the border region of the confined water, we demonstrate a consistent increase in electrostriction {{as a function of}} the field strength inside the pore open to a field-free aqueous environment...|$|R

High-quality 31 P NMR spectra were reproducibly obtained from the medial head of the quadriceps muscle of the right leg of eight healthy subjects during two-legged high-frequency pedaling (80 revolutions per minute) at three incremental workloads, including maximal. Muscle phosphocreatine content dropped 82 %, from 32. 2 ± 1. 0 mM at rest to 5. 7 ± 1. 1 mM at maximal workload (mean ± standard error; n = 8), indicating that the majority of quadriceps motor units were recruited. The cardiovascular load of the exercise was likewise significant, as evidenced by heart rates of 150 (± 10 %) beats per minute, measured immediately afterward. As such, the newly developed MR bicycling exercise equipment offers a powerful new tool for clinical musculoskeletal and cardiovascular MR investigation.
