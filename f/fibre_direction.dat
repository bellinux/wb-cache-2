40|$|The {{knowledge}} of thermal diffusivity data of thick fibre-elastomer composites {{is very important}} in heat conduction analysis of rubber products. The method of linear increase of surface temperature was used to determine the thermal diffusivity of thick fibre reinforced-rubber composites at temperatures ranging from 20 to 170 oC. In this paper the results of thermal diffusivity measurements of some rubber compounds reinforced with textile cords are presented. The values of the thermal diffusivity of thick fibre reinforced-rubber composite materials decrease with temperature. The thermal diffusivity parallel to the <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> is compared to the thermal diffusivity perpendicular to the <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> and to the thermal diffusivity of the matrix. It was found experimentally that the thermal diffusivity of rubber compounds reinforced with polyamide textile cords parallel to the <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> is approximately 1. 6 time higher than the thermal diffusivity perpendicular to the <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> and the thermal diffusivity of the matrix.

40|$|A {{finite element}} (FE) {{model has been}} {{developed}} to simulate the double diaphragm forming (DDF) process, to identify potential defects when forming complex 3 D preforms from 2 D biaxial non-crimp fabric plies. Three different metrics have been introduced to predict and characterise defects, which include local shear angles to determine ply wrinkling induced by over-shear, compressive strains in the primary <b>fibre</b> <b>directions</b> to determine bundle wrinkling, and tensile stresses in the primary <b>fibre</b> <b>directions</b> to determine fabric bridging. The FE simulation is in good agreement with experiments performed on a demonstrator component. Results indicate that fabric bridging occurs in large-curvature regions, which is the dominant defect in DDF, as wrinkling is generally lower than in matched-tool forming due to relatively low forming pressures (up to 1 bar).

The goal {{of this study is to}} model changes in collagen fibre content and orientation in soft connective tissues due to mechanical stimuli. A theory is presented describing the mechanical condition within the tissue and accounting for the effects of collagen fibre alignment and changes in fibre content. A fibre orientation tensor is defined torepresent the continuous distribution of collagen <b>fibre</b> <b>directions.</b> A constitutive model is introduced to relate the fibre configuration to the macroscopic stress within the material.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} composites {{constitute a}} relevant class of materials used chiefly in lightweight constructions {{for example in}} fuselages or car bodies. The spatial arrangement of the fibres and in particular their direction distribution have huge impact on macroscopic properties and, thus, its determination is an important topic of material characterisation. The <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> distribution is defined on the unit sphere, and it is therefore preferable to work with fully three-dimensional images of the microstructure as obtained, e. g., by computed micro-tomography. A number of recent image analysis algorithms exploit local grey value variations to estimate a preferred direction in each fibre point. Averaging these local results leads estimates of the volume-weighted <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> distribution. We show how the thus derived <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> distribution is related to quantities commonly used in engineering applications. Furthermore, we discuss four algorithms for local orientation analysis, namely those based on the response of anisotropic Gaussian filters, moments and axes of inertia derived from directed distance transforms, the structure tensor, or the Hessian matrix. Finally, the feasibility of these algorithms is demonstrated for application examples and some {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the underlying methods are pointed out...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} validation of a method for digitally reconstructing white matter fibre tracts in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The technique uses diffusion weighted MRI to estimate a likelihood distribution function for the <b>fibre</b> <b>direction(s)</b> in each imaging voxel, and subsequently infers connectivity from any point in {{the central nervous system}} to another. The fibre tracking algorithm addresses issues that can confound fibre tract reconstruction, such as imaging noise, subvoxel partial volume averaging of <b>fibre</b> <b>directions,</b> and problems with the estimate of the diffusion probability density function (pdf). It can take as input a diffusion pdf estimated using either the traditional diffusion tensor approach or more recent high angular resolution diffusion approaches. The fibre tracking technique is validated using in vivo human brain diffusion imaging data and using a phantom constructed from excised rat spinal cord, which provides a "gold standard" connectivity map. The results are promising, especially for regions of the brain where tracking using previously described algorithms has been difficult to perform, for example, the regions of complex fibre structure near the cortex. As the cortex is critical for functional activity in the brain, this may have widespread implications for our understanding of the human brain in healthy subjects and in disease...|$|R

40|$|SiC-fibre {{reinforced}} titanium matrix composites {{are marked}} by exceptional high specific strength and stiffness at temperatures up to 550 °C. That is why these materials are considered as promising materials for components of future aeronautic gas turbines. Tensile and fatigue properties have been investigated precisely in the past. Although the compression strength of titanium matrix composites {{is expected to be}} very high {{there is a lack of}} knowledge and test results. However, some intended applications require compression strength. These are e. g. torque loaded components like shafts having tensile and compressive mean stresses. To support the design of low pressure shafts for aeronautic gas turbines within the European Project VITAL (enVIronmenTALly friendly aero engine) a test matrix has been set up to investigate the tension and compression properties of SiC-fibre reinforced titanium matrix composites with different fibre volume contents at room temperature and at 550 °C. The tests were conducted in <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> and transverse to the fibres. Here, the results of the compression tests are presented and discussed. In <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> the compression strength increases with increasing fibre volume content. At room temperature maximum compression stress values over 5000 MPa at room temperature and of about 3700 MPa at 550 °C were reached. Thus the compression strength is more than twice as high as the tensile strength. Transverse to the <b>fibre</b> <b>direction</b> the strength is limited by matrix flow. The influence of the fibre volume content is smaller and the strength level is influenced more by temperature than by fibre volume content.
