This paper proposes a systematic approach {{to simulate the}} vibroacoustic characteristics of an axial piston pump using a hybrid lumped parameters/finite element/boundary element (LP/FE/BE) model, and large amount of experimental work was performed to validate the model. The LP model was developed to calculate the excitation forces and was validated by a comparison of outlet flow ripples. The FE model was developed to calculate the vibration of the pump, in which the modeling of main friction pairs using different spring elements was presented in detail, and the FE model was validated using experimental modal analysis and measured vibrations. The BE model was {{used to calculate the}} noise emitted from the pump, and a measurement of sound pressure level at representative field points in a hemianechoic chamber was conducted to validate the BE model. Comparisons between the simulated and measured results show that the developed LP/FE/BE model is effective in capturing the vibroacoustic characteristics of the pump.

The approach is based on recursive identification of low order models of the dynamics from valve input to actuator position and effective load pressure respectively. The model parameters are used to compute a regulator that gives a well damped system with good servo properties. The identification is carried out on-line in closed loop with no other signals than those present in normal operation. Here RLS with variable forgetting factor is used. The method does not, however, need not more parameters to be set a priori than ordinary RLS with fix forgetting factor. In this way an easily tuned and robust identification algorithm is obtained.

40|$|Modeling of <b>fluid</b> <b>power</b> <b>components</b> {{and systems}} is a {{challenge}} {{at the best of}} times. As knowledge of physical components becomes more focused on micro-properties, the describing equations become more comprehensive and reflect dynamic performance that in the past has not been possible to accurately model. Usually the equations are very nonlinear which make the resulting describing differential equations difficult to solve. But perhaps a more substantial problem in modeling is being able to assign values to a large number of parameters which are used to describe the system. A further complication arises in that the parameters are functions of operating conditions. An alternate approach to modeling is to use a “black box ” in which equations which reflect physical properties are replaced by input/output data relationships. Neural networks are common forms of the mechanism which govern the foundation of the black box in which neurons are trained to “learn ” the input/output relationships of a physical system through training and testing processes. The authors have examined various types of neural network morphologies in an attempt to model a load sensing pump using this approach. In a pape...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{comprehensive}} review of the compressed-air hybrid technology in a passenger and commercial vehicle since the beginning of its discovery to date. Hybrid technology has become popular in the automotive industry since the technology proven to improve the vehicle efficiency, saving in fuel use and green environmental. The well-known hybrid technology is hybrid electric. Nevertheless, the price of the hybrid electric automobile is high, the arrangement is complex, and it is not completely green. These disadvantages have triggered innovation in a hybrid technology called compressed-air hybrid technology. The compressed-air hybrid technology uses a combination of ICE and <b>fluid</b> <b>power</b> <b>components</b> as a propulsion unit and compressed-air energy as a power source. The energy stored in the tank/accumulator. Once the energy in the storage is low, the system utilizes energy losses in braking and recovers into useful energy. This article concentrates on the hybrid compressed-air design, components, latest finding, technology breakthrough, benefit and drawback of the system. The review also encompasses the most recent prototype that has been tested. Based on the study, the literature has shown that the compressed-air hybrid system is proven to work. Nevertheless, further research needs to extend out to resolve a few topics such as amending the energy capability and lightweight system design. The two-subsystem are promising, but nevertheless far from the point of commercialization. However, the three-subsystem has been proven in saving energy and fuel consumption. Although it still needs to be further refined, it has a huge potential to get into the market. The compressed-air hybrid technology in a passenger car is still new. There is a huge room to explore. If the hybrid compressed-air technology is successful, clearly it will benefit the future in the aspect of energy efficiency, cost saving, and reduce the pollution...|$|R
