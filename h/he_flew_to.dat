5|$|On 6 March 1943 MacLachlan {{began the}} journey back to Britain. <b>He</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Canada in a Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar {{where he spent}} eight days with the RAF Ferry Command in Montreal flying B-25 Mitchells. MacLachlan flew one of these {{aircraft}} under the railway bridge in Quebec. From Canada <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Bluie West, Greenland then to Reykjavik, Iceland. MacLachlan reached Prestwick on 3 April 1943. MacLachlan visited his comrades in 1 Squadron based nearby at Ibsley {{before moving on to}} Hunsdon to see night fighter officer John Cunningham. MacLachlan may have wanted another squadron command but on 15 April 1943 MacLachlan was sent back to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Wittering.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} he {{received}} permission for another daylight sortie. Squadron Leader Robertson joined him on this occasion as his flight engineer. <b>He</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Lasham {{to pick up a}} Mosquito. His target on this occasion would be Denmark. The Luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in the region so <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Coltishall in Norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during the sortie. Near Aalborg he sighted two aircraft. So far away from the battle zones, the Germans did not expect to be attacked by the enemy. Neither made much attempt to defend themselves. The first, a Junkers W 34 transport, was shot down and the second, a Junkers Ju 52, tried a crash-landing only to nose-over and crumple the wings. Braham strafed it to ensure destruction. His gun cameras filmed the action during which he fired 320 rounds. On 4 April he returned to France. Lacking radar, Braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft. <b>He</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Bordeaux looking for He 177s that intelligence suggested were operating against Atlantic convoys from Bordeaux–Mérignac. Braham only encountered a Bücker Bü 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire.|$|E
5|$|After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a {{representative}} of the Fidel Castro government asked Árbenz to come to Cuba, to which he readily agreed, sensing an opportunity to live with fewer restrictions on himself. <b>He</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Havana in July 1960, and, caught up {{in the spirit of the}} recent revolution, began to participate in public events. His presence so close to Guatemala once again increased the negative coverage he received in the Guatemalan press. He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome.|$|E

5|$|Halvorsen {{then became}} the Commander of the 7350th Air Base Group at Templehof Central Airport, Berlin, Germany, in February 1970. It {{was the very}} same {{airfield}} <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> daily during the Berlin Airlift. During this period, he also served as the US Air Force Europe Representative in Berlin, as well as completing a master's degree in Guidance and Counseling from Wayne State University through an on-base educational program. His final assignment was as the Inspector General, Ogden Air Materiel Center, Hill AFB, Utah. Halvorsen retired on August 31, 1974, having accumulated over 8,000 flying hours and 31 years of military service.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{remained}} in England until July 1918 {{when he was}} given command of No. 60 Squadron RAF. <b>He</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Farnborough in a Vickers F.B.16 to collect his new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a before returning to France to lead his new Squadron. On 3 July he flew back in this fighter and over his home in Kingston upon Thames, taking the aircraft to 17,000 feet and circling London for an hour. When he landed he made his last entry into his log book. His total flying time had reached 872 hours and 40 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators, led by Brezhnev, First Deputy Premier Alexander Shelepin, and KGB Chairman Vladimir Semichastny, {{struck in}} October 1964, while Khrushchev was on {{vacation}} at Pitsunda, Abkhaz ASSR with his close ally Anastas Mikoyan. On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly {{on the subject of}} agriculture. Even though Khrushchev suspected the real reason for the meeting, <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Moscow, accompanied by the head of the Georgian KGB, General Aleksi Inauri, but otherwise taking no precautions.|$|E

"Oh, if {{you don't}} know, I won't tell, for that wouldn't be fair," [...] replied Sammy, {{and tried to}} look very honest and innocent, and then <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> over <b>to</b> the Green Forest.

5|$|Various regiments were {{stationed}} at Craigiehall Camp during the Second World War, including Royal Artillery, Royal Signals, and anti-aircraft units. On 12 May 1945, {{the surrender of}} German forces in Norway was negotiated and signed at Craigiehall. A rumour, related in Major Innes' book, states that Rudolf Hess was brought to Craigiehall after <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Scotland in 1941 to contact the Duke of Hamilton. This rumour {{is based on a}} photograph of Hess supposedly once on display at Craigiehall, although the story is not corroborated.|$|E
5|$|Bok {{applied for}} and {{received}} UN refugee status on September 15, 1999, and {{after several months}} of waiting, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to allow Francis {{to move to the}} U.S. Bok flew from Cairo to New York City on August 13, 1999, and from there <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Fargo, North Dakota. His journey was sponsored by Lutheran Social Services and a United Methodist Church, both worked together to provide an apartment for Francis in Fargo and helped him find a job. Bok worked several jobs, making pallets and plastic knobs for the gearshift of cars. He heard of a large population of Dinka in Ames, Iowa, and moved to Ames after several months in Fargo. It was while living in Ames that he was contacted by Charles Jacobs, founder of the American Anti-Slavery Group based in Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|He {{was shot}} down most {{probably}} by Italian Spanish Civil War ace Tenente Lieutenant) Franco Lucchini of 90a Squadriglia, 10° Gruppo ("group"), 4° Stormo ("wing"). He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He started to walk towards the Allied lines and crossed the border at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as an embarrassment and regarded the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was also determined not {{to get lost in}} the desert again so <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Alexandria and bought a compass which he never flew without.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hastings has no refuge here. Let him {{run from}} law to law; let him fly {{from the common}} law and the sacred {{institutions}} {{of the country in}} which he was born; let him fly from acts of Parliament, from which his power originated; let him plead his ignorance of them, or fly in the face of them. Will <b>he</b> <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> the Mahomedan law? That condemns him. Will <b>he</b> <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> the high magistracy of Asia to defend taking of presents? Padishah and the Sultan would condemn him to a cruel death. Will <b>he</b> <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> the Sophis, to the laws of Persia, or to the practice of those monarchs? I cannot utter the pains, the tortures, that would be inflicted on him, if he were to govern there as he has done in a British province. Let him <b>fly</b> where <b>he</b> will, from law to law; law, I thank God, meets him everywhere, and enforced, too, by the practice of the most impious tyrants, which he quotes as if it would justify his conduct. I would as willingly have him tried by the law of the Koran, or the Institutes of Tamerlane, as on the common law or statute law of this kingdom.|$|R

5|$|Raised in {{a family}} {{concerned}} with social issues, in 2003 Gyllenhaal participated in an advertising campaign by the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization his entire family strongly supports. Environmentally conscious, he recycles regularly, and {{said in an interview}} that he spends $400 a year to have trees planted in a Mozambique forest, partly to promote the Future Forests program. After filming The Day After Tomorrow, <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> the Arctic to promote awareness of climate change. Gyllenhaal is the Honorary Chair of the New Eyes for the Needy Advisory Board, and has signed on to help the TV fundraiser Stand Up to Cancer. Gyllenhaal is on the board of directors for the Anti-Recidivism Coalition and volunteered in California juvenile detention centers with Scott Budnick.|$|E
5|$|The Checkers {{speech or}} Fund speech was an address made on September 23, 1952, by the Republican {{candidate}} {{for vice president}} of the United States, California Senator Richard Nixon. Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. With his place on the Republican ticket in doubt, <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) to tell it whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated that regardless of what anyone said, he intended to keep one gift: a black-and-white dog who had been named Checkers by the Nixon children, thus giving the address its popular name.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after filming Basic Instinct 2, {{he began}} work on The Reaping (2007) in Louisiana, in which he played science teacher Doug Blackwell {{opposite}} Hilary Swank. The role had been offered to him quite late in pre-production, and <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Baton Rouge the Monday after Basic Instinct 2 wrapped. He took the role {{because he was a}} fan of Swank, and Hopkins' film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004), and he preferred the thriller aspect of the Reaping script above the horror aspect. After a week of filming, production had to be suspended when Hurricane Katrina hit the state. He found the filming schedule quite demanding, particularly the three weeks of night filming and a scene in which his character is attacked by a plague of locusts, most of which were computer-generated in post-production but some were real on camera. The Reaping was released in 2007 and performed badly in cinemas. Despite the failures of both films, Morrissey was grateful that they opened him up to more film offers from Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|MacLachlan {{travelled}} {{to flight}} schools across America. In November <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Orlando, Florida and across to Galveston, Texas near Palm Beach. The lecturing tour {{took him to}} Los Angeles California {{at the end of}} 1942. By January 1943 he had also visited Arizona and Texas. His flight log had expanded throughout this period to include a variety of types. Using his privileged position he flew the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Through flying MacLachlan felt the urge to participate in combat operations again but he enjoyed American hospitality immensely. In February he flew at an aerobatic show in Mesa, Arizona. On 18 February 1943 MacLachlan had a close call. While flying from Fort Stockton to El Paso, he force-landed in the desert when he ran out of fuel. According to a legend, MacLachaln used a local pipeline to fill the tanks. While in America he undertook several public relations tours and met movie stars such as Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine when he visited Hollywood for autographed photo-shoots.|$|E
5|$|Pattle worked {{toward this}} goal for some time until, in late 1935, by chance, {{he picked up a}} copy of the Johannesburg Star newspaper. The paper {{contained}} an advertisement by the Royal Air Force (RAF) which was offering five-year short service commissions for cadets throughout the British Empire. The RAF expansion schemes required a great influx of capable personnel into the organisation as rearmament and the need for fighting men heightened. Pattle decided that a career in the RAF offered better prospects than as an instructor in South Africa and applied. Early in 1936, he was invited to Britain as an applicant. <b>He</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> London at his own expense to attend the selection processes and was offered a commission by the selection board. He immediately returned to South Africa to arrange his migration to Britain and left aboard SS Llandovery Castle on 30 April 1936.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1998, the RUF {{began to}} re-mobilise in {{northern}} Sierra Leone. As tensions escalated, the FCO ordered an evacuation of British citizens just before Christmas. Penfold believed the evacuation—the eighth of his career—was unnecessary and argued against it; his objections were over-ruled and {{he was ordered to}} evacuate his staff, though he was allowed to remain in Freetown with his military protection detail. The Royal Air Force evacuated approximately 35 people, but many British people chose to stay. Penfold travelled to Abidjan after Christmas for an international summit on Sierra Leone, but the FCO refused to allow him to return to Sierra Leone, so he again based himself in a hotel in Conakry. The RUF attacked Freetown on 6 January 1999. After 10 days of fighting, the rebels were pushed back and Penfold was transported back to Sierra Leone by a British warship. <b>He</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Freetown for daily meetings with Kabbah, but was not allowed to move back into his residence and so temporarily lived on the ship. Later in 1999, the Sierra Leone government entered into negotiations which resulted in the Lomé Peace Agreement. Penfold opposed power-sharing with the RUF, and believed he was excluded from the talks in Lomé because of his views. The agreement did not hold, and violence again broke out in early 2000.|$|E

5|$|There was {{evidence}} that Braham's judgement was becoming impaired. He had not taken much leave {{since the war began}} in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short-tempered with his family and those around him. He had spent much of the previous two years leading from the front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory. On 7 May 1944 he collected navigator Flight Lieutenant Donald Walsh from Group headquarters. He borrowed a Mosquito from 21 Squadron at Gravesend. <b>He</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit, 141 Squadron, and spent the night at West Raynham. Over Roskilde, Denmark, he caught a Ju 88 after a 10-minute chase and shot it down—his 28th victory. On 12 May Braham repeated the operation. This time he took Bill Gregory with him. Operating over the Aalborg–Copenhagen line he spotted a Fw 190 near Hurning. Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109—his presence clearly detected by German radar. His Mosquito was hit in the port wing and the fuel line were ruptured. The Bf 109 then disappeared. Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190. At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames, stalled and crashed near Aalborg. The range was so close—around 100 yards—the Focke-Wulf nearly collided with Braham. The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground, meant that the chances of reaching England were slim. He climbed to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received. He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half. They took the dingy and watched the tail and wings remain afloat. He was retrieved with Gregory by air-sea rescue. Royal Navy trawlers sank the sections of aircraft remaining afloat. Regardless of the venture, on 13 June 1944 he received his final award—a second bar to his DSO.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> Baghdad {{to attempt}} to {{negotiate}} the release of aircraft passengers and other British nationals taken hostage when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. After the events of Black Wednesday in 1992, he stated in the House of Commons that government should build a fund of reserves to counter currency speculators.|$|E
25|$|Levi {{became a}} major {{literary}} figure in Italy, and his books were translated into many other languages. The Truce became a standard text in Italian schools. In 1985, <b>he</b> <b>flew</b> <b>to</b> the United States for a 20-day speaking tour. Although he was accompanied by Lucia, the trip was very draining for him.|$|E
25|$|An {{argument}} against the South Pacific is that the seasons in Oz are shown as the same seasons in the United States at the same time.
