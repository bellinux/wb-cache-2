5|$|Eurogamer {{noted the}} {{annoyance}} {{of returning to}} defend over 20 towns each with recurring zombie problems, but said that the game mechanic is never too bothersome and even appreciated its element of time management, {{similar to that of}} the Dead Rising game series. IGN thought that the lack of <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> was an impediment. Reviewers also noted technical issues with moving Marston's character, especially when climbing ladders and outrunning zombies.|$|E
5|$|Joule navigates {{the open}} world of Far Eden either on foot {{equipped}} with rocket boosters on {{her shoes and}} her back, across platforms with the grappling hook or via <b>fast</b> <b>travel.</b> The scenery may be altered by sandstorms, unveiling new areas to explore. Corebots can speak their own language called DigiMode, which the players are permitted to translate. Dungeons leading to progression in the story and containing resources {{that can be used}} for crafting are scattered throughout the world for Joule to unlock by way of collecting cores.|$|E
5|$|The game {{introduces}} a <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> system, allowing Batman to remotely summon his plane (the Batwing) to transport him {{to other areas}} of the game world quicker than gliding or grappling could. Enemy tower installations prevent Batman from summoning the craft in some areas, and must be disabled to make the Batwing (not player-controlled) available. Some towers may be disabled only when the player has the necessary equipment.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, Players can {{customize}} the protagonist's gender, body type, hairstyle, and outfit using the character creator. Players may also alter the look of their customized character at any point during the game by approaching a vendor named Callista. After creating their characters, players proceed to the game's open world, which is free for players to explore at any time. A <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> system is provided allowing players to reach different locations and to navigate the world quickly. The game features a main campaign with story elements and side-missions, which are triggered automatically when players enter certain locations in the city. These quests mainly involve players delivering objects to other non-playable characters and collecting items from the world. Some of these quests have time limits.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming dash for the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to shake the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement {{it was noted that}} Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{important}} {{locations are}} {{located within the}} world: these include Terminals that give access to a <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> system; the Junk Shop, which acts as a vendor for buying and selling items; Rag's Jewelry, where gems collected during gameplay can be traded for rare items and unique demons; and the Fountain of Life, where the Protagonist and other party members can receive treatment for ailments, heal them of damage, or revive characters knocked out in battle. An optional location separate from the Vortex World is the Amala Labyrinth, accessed after the Protagonist has reached {{a certain point in}} the story. The Labyrinth is a dungeon divided into multiple floors or Kalpa, each housing both demon enemies and brokers which sell demons to the Protagonist. Each Kalpa is connected by a Warp Zone, in which the Protagonist can collect currency and items while avoiding or destroying obstacles. Proceeding through the levels of the Labyrinth requires the protagonist to find and fight Fiends carrying Candelabra, which unlock barriers. The Candelabra also act as a means of locating and either engaging or avoiding Fiends.|$|E

50|$|A <b>faster</b> <b>travel</b> version called Die Jagd Nach Mister X {{exists that}} {{functions}} quite differently. In this version, Mr. X's location is only hidden when a black travel token is used, {{and the game}} is essentially an open chase around London. Evasion is accomplished with black tokens and using the <b>fastest</b> <b>travel</b> to distant locations. In this version, each player takes turns as Mr. X, and points collected (in {{the form of the}} detectives' used travel tokens) determine the overall winner.|$|R
5|$|Donkey Kong 64 is a 3D {{platforming}} adventure game {{in which}} the player, as Donkey Kong and his friends, explores an island and collects items to progress through minigames and puzzles. The game follows a traditional storyline for the series: King K. Rool and his reptilian Kremlings invade Donkey Kong's idyllic island and kidnap his friends. After a tutorial, the player embarks as Donkey Kong to rescue them from the kidnappers. While exploring the in-game world and completing puzzle minigames, the player collects bananas; enough of these will grant the player access to boss fights, which, in turn, unlock new in-game worlds. Most of the game's puzzles are simple, and involve rearranging items, manipulating switches and tiles, or matching items as in the game Concentration. Minigames include races, minecart rides, and barrels that shoot the characters as projectiles. There are five such banana-rewarding objectives for each of five playable characters across eight themed worlds—200 goals in total, {{in addition to a}} connecting overworld. Unlike in prior Donkey Kong games, the objectives can be completed in any order. The player can <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> between sections of the level with designated warp pads, and can swap between characters in designated swap barrels. The player also collects banana coins, which unlock new weapons and abilities, and other collectibles such as weapon ammunition and blueprint puzzle pieces. As in other games by the developer, the player often encounters an impossible situation (e.g., an indestructible object or out-of-reach area) and must eventually backtrack to resolve the impasse after acquiring a new ability.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an open world environment with a day-night cycle and dynamic weather system {{which can be}} seamlessly explored. The map is composed of forest, jungle, desert, and snowy mountain regions. Mountainous terrain is traversed with the employment of parkour, which is aided {{by the use of}} zip-lines installed throughout the world. Corruption Zones constitute areas that heighten difficulty and are populated by corrupted machines that behave with more aggression. To uncover more of the map, one must scale large giraffe-like machines known as Tallnecks. Twenty-five robotic creature designs are present in the game. Save points and <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> can be accessed by interacting with campfires, once discovered. The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of tribes, while the main story covers the entire world. Side quests involve Aloy completing tasks, like gathering materials, coming to the aid of individuals in danger of being killed, solving mysteries, assuming control of bandit camps, eliminating criminals and more difficult machines, accomplishing various challenges at any of the five Hunting Grounds, and obtaining an ancient armour that makes Aloy almost impervious to damage. A dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-playable characters. Collectibles include vantages that offer visual information of the Old World; metal flowers, which when acquired contain poetry; and old relics, such as ancient mugs and tribal artefacts.|$|E
25|$|Other {{gameplay}} {{features include}} a <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> system between discovered locations in-game, and a detailed quest log with a tracker {{and history of}} quests completed.|$|E

50|$|During weekday peak times, {{a number}} of the Ipswich {{services}} skip stations between Darra and Milton, stopping only at Indooroopilly for <b>faster</b> <b>travel</b> times for commuters working in the Brisbane central business district.|$|R
25|$|Players gain {{influence}} {{in areas of}} the world by capturing keeps or forts. This is achieved by defeating the occupants of the keep or fort or establishing camps, which are used to provide <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> and resupply points. Operations can be discovered to repair various structures and pathways, such as bridges or collapsed caves. These operations will allow exploration of previously unreachable locations and side quests.|$|E
25|$|An in-game {{currency}} of gold, silver and copper coins permits player characters to profit by completing quests and selling obtained loot and crafted items to NPCs or human players. Currency {{can also be}} used to acquire equipment from NPCs or other players, pay to repair equipment after combat, equip characters with traits, <b>fast</b> <b>travel,</b> buy crafting materials, and purchase a house. Players can trade face-to-face, via in-game mail, or at in-game Auction Houses. In update 11, Mithril Coins (available for purchase with real world money or LotRO points in the LotRO Store) were added as a meta-currency for game-related purchases.|$|E
25|$|Horses play {{a larger}} role in Brotherhood, not only used as a means of {{transport}} (inside the city for the first time) but as a component of acrobatic sequences and advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. Brotherhood also introduces various types of horse-related assassinations, featuring horse-to-horse assassinations. There are environmental objects like the flower pot in Assassin's Creed II to move faster inside the city (a system of tunnels around the city allow <b>fast</b> <b>travel),</b> as well as new objects such as merchandise lifts to quickly climb up high buildings or structures.|$|E
50|$|The plan intends {{for these}} toll expressways to decongest {{traffic on the}} main roads by {{providing}} an option to those road users {{willing to pay a}} toll fee in exchange for <b>faster</b> <b>travel</b> time.|$|R
50|$|Harts Place was a Mojave Desert {{roadside}} gas station, cafe, store, and garage {{on the old}} State Route 14, {{south of}} the junction with U.S. Route 395 in California, until <b>faster</b> <b>travel</b> in the late 1960s.|$|R
25|$|On December 11, 2000, Amtrak began {{operating}} its higher-speed Acela Express service. <b>Fastest</b> <b>travel</b> time by Acela {{is three}} and a half hours between Boston and New York, and two hours and forty-five minutes between New York and Washington, D.C.|$|R
25|$|A second main {{proposal}} {{was launched in}} 2011, whereby the metro would follow a new route. It would leave Majorstuen in its own right-of-way in a tunnel. It would turn ninety degrees and run under the Frogner Park to a station at Skøyen. From there it would run close to Bestumkilden, with an intermediate station at Vækerø before reaching Lysaker. The line would have three stations on Fornebu: Telenor Arena, Flytårnet (Telenor) and Fornebu Senter. Ruter recommended this alternative, based on its combination of <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> time to the city center and that a metro alternative is the only service which can be guaranteed to have sufficient capacity in the long run. Ruter estimated {{the cost of a}} metro via Ullernåsen at 3.0 billion kroner and via Skøyen at 4.5 billion kroner in 2011.|$|E
500|$|South Park: The Stick of Truth is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} that is viewed from a 2.5D, third-person perspective. The player controls the New Kid as he explores the fictional Colorado town of South Park. The player can freely {{move around the}} town although some areas remain inaccessible until specific points in the story are reached. Notable characters from the series—including Cartman, Butters, Stan, and Kyle—join the New Kid's party and accompany him on his quests, though only one character can be active at any time. The game features a <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> system, allowing the player to call on the character Timmy to quickly transport them to any other visited <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> station. At {{the beginning of the}} game, the player selects one of four character archetypes; the Fighter, Thief, Mage (which represent standard fantasy types), and the Jew. The Jew class specializes in [...] "Jew-jitsu" [...] and long-range attacks. Each class has specific abilities; armor and weapons are not limited by class, allowing a Mage to focus on melee attacks like a Fighter.|$|E
500|$|Undead Nightmare {{removes the}} {{traditional}} <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> {{features of the}} base game, and this encourages the player to use settlements to store their caravan. Marston rides undead horses in Undead Nightmare, which he can summon by whistling. Four mythical horses—the four horses of the apocalypse—with faster abilities are scattered throughout the game for the player to find, tame, and ride. Other mythical creatures to hunt include Sasquatch, El Chupacabra, and a unicorn. Also included are two new outfits for Marston, other cosmetic options for weapons and player horses ("mounts"), and achievements ...|$|E
60|$|The {{boat was}} not fifty yards off: but <b>fast</b> <b>travelling</b> over the pebbles was impossible, and long ere half the {{distance}} was crossed, the negroes {{were on the}} beach, and the storm burst. A volley of great quartz pebbles whistled round their heads.|$|R
50|$|After German Reunification, {{the railway}} was {{restored}} and since 2000 {{is part of}} the Inter-City Express (ICE) network with hourly trains linking Berlin and Munich. As the winding line however does not allow <b>fast</b> <b>travelling,</b> it is to be replaced by the Nuremberg-Erfurt high-speed railway.|$|R
50|$|The Louisville and Frankfort Railroad (later {{purchased}} by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad) was built through the area in 1849. The development of an interurban rail line in 1901 allowed <b>faster</b> <b>travel</b> between Anchorage and Louisville, {{as well as other}} towns in the area.|$|R
500|$|Oblivion is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{that incorporates}} open-ended gameplay. The player can follow side-quests, interact with NPCs, dispatch monsters, develop their character, and travel {{anywhere in the}} province of Cyrodiil at any time while playing the game (provided that the areas are not quest-specific and otherwise inaccessible when not questing). The game never ends, and the player can continue playing after completing the main quest. The gameplay includes a [...] "fast travel" [...] system, in which an icon appears on the game world map every time the player visits a new location. This excludes the game world's main cities which are already unlocked for <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> {{from the start of the}} game. The player can arrive at the desired location instantaneously by selecting the icon on the map.|$|E
500|$|Arthur Gies of Polygon {{took the}} view that, however strong a first {{impression}} the fundamentals and ideas yielded, the game's overall quality was reduced by being drawn out beyond its capabilities with superfluous material. A more favorable aspect was the combo system, which {{was said to}} channel [...] "early '00s Japanese action games {{in a way that}} feels hard to resist". Traversal challenges and controls were also lauded. Further, Polygon disparaged the design for the game's considerable length, and sensed it was to compensate for the small number of story missions. The loot and crafting system appeared minimal in action and the grinding involved was found to be [...] "annoying" [...] and [...] "a real chore". Mike Williams of USgamer endorsed the combat and platforming's reminiscence to Mega Man Legends and Metroid Prime, respectively. Williams wrote that the corebots were one of ReCores strongest aspects, exhibiting [...] "clear and endearing personalities" [...] notably complemented in cutscenes and gameplay. He judged exploration to be the most robust feature and its <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> system [...] "generally easy", but thought the story was obstructed by the level-based progression.|$|E
500|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne {{is a set}} in a post-apocalyptic {{version of}} modern-day Tokyo: aside from the opening segment, post-apocalyptic Tokyo, {{also known as the}} Vortex World, is the main setting. From the outset, the player can select two {{difficulty}} settings: Normal and Hard. The player controls a silent protagonist who is given a name during the opening. The player navigates the Vortex World through both a 2D world map, and to-scale 3D environments used in dungeons. While navigating the world map, the Protagonist's party and other non-player characters (NPCs), interactive objects and landmarks are represented by symbols: these objects and NPCs include containers holding items, spirits that will heal the party, and a globe in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen shows the party's approximate location on the world map. During dungeon navigation, the Protagonist navigates grid-based, multi-leveled areas. Different areas are accessed via doors, and as the Protagonist progresses the area is automatically mapped. While exploring dungeons, the in-game camera can be freely rotated, and a [...] "Look" [...] action allows the player to see environments in first-person. The game world can be navigated either on foot or by using a <b>fast</b> <b>travel</b> system unlocked at a certain point in the game.|$|E
50|$|Introduction of {{a direct}} service to Rome (axed in 2003) has begun in September 2016. The {{reinstated}} former Eurostar-Italy high-speed service now operates with Frecciargento carriages: the <b>fastest</b> <b>travel</b> time between Mantua and Modena is 35-40 minutes (1 hour 10 minutes by regional trains).|$|R
5000|$|Some A-class and B-class {{roads in}} the Highlands are still single-track, {{although}} many sections have been widened {{for the sake of}} <b>faster</b> <b>travel.</b> In 2009, the A830 [...] "Road to the Isles" [...] and A851 on Skye have had their single-track sections replaced with higher-quality single-carriageway road.|$|R
