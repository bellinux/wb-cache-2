60|$|But {{what were}} these chains {{a type of}}? I answer, they were, perhaps, a type of those bonds which attend the gospel, by which souls taken are tied fast to the horns of the altar. Gospel grace, and gospel obligations, are ties and binding things; they can hold those that are {{entangled}} by the word. 'Love is strong as death'; bands of love, and the cords of a man, and chains take <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> that are taken by the gospel (Hosea 11; Cant 8:6).|$|E

60|$|Secondly, The Dissenters are now tolerated by law; {{neither do}} we observe any murmurs at present from that quarter, except those {{reasonable}} complaints they make of persecution, {{because they are}} excluded from civil employments; but their number being very small in either House of Parliament, they are not yet in a situation to erect a party: Because, however indifferent men may be with regard to religion, they are now grown wise enough to know, that if such a latitude were allowed to Dissenters; the few small employments left us in cities and corporations, would find other hands to lay <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|Nares on {{his part}} knew that Ormsgill was well in front of him, and Ormsgill as a rule {{traveled}} fast, but {{it was evident that}} he must have made a long journey already, and the Mission boys were fresh. That, at least, was clear by the pace they made, but it did not greatly slacken when weariness laid <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> They pushed on without flagging through the unlifting shade, and the ashes of their cooking fires marked their track across leagues of forest, until late one night they stopped suddenly in a more open glade, and Nares, flung forward in his hammock, seized the pole and swung himself down.|$|E
6000|$|Neither may it be {{imagined}} {{that these men}} were, before grace laid <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>them,</b> better than other men; for then {{they would not have}} been saved by grace; grace should not have had the dominion and glory of their salvation.

No, in no wise; for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sin" [...] (Rom 3:9).

They would have recollected that on the old principle (and a very sound one) of a bird in the hand being worth two in the bush, the minister of a congregation would feel it his duty, as well as his interest, not to defraud his flock of his labours by spending valuable time on a secular subject like sanitary reform, in the hope of possibly preserving a few human beings, whose souls he might hereafter (and that again would be merely a possibility) benefit.|$|E

60|$|Russegger {{compares the}} Dinkas, {{and all the}} {{neighbouring}} peoples who hold the same beliefs, to modern Deists.[2] They are remote from Atheism and from cult! Suggestions about an ancient Egyptian influence are made, but popular Egyptian religion was not monotheistic, and priestly thought could scarcely influence the ancestors of the Dinkas. M. Lejean says these peoples are so practical and utilitarian that missionary religion takes no <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> Mr. Spencer does not give {{the ideas of the}} Dinkas, but {{it is not easy to}} see how the too beneficent Dendid could be evolved out of ghost-propitiation, 'the origin of all religions.' Rather the Dinkas, a practical people, seem to have simply forgotten to be grateful to their Maker; or have decided, more to the credit of the clearness of their heads than the warmth of their hearts, that gratitude he does not want. Like the French philosopher they cultivate l'indépendance du coeur, being in this matter strikingly unlike the Pawnees.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. A {{second thing}} whereby {{the love of}} Christ is some degrees of it may be known, is this: That he should pass by angels and take hold of us. Who so considereth the nature of spirits, as they are God's workmanship, must needs confess, that as such, they have a pre-eminency above that which is made of dust: This then was the {{disparity}} 'twixt us and them; they being, by birth, far more noble than we. But now, when both are fallen, and by our fall, both {{in a state of}} condemnation, that Jesus Christ should choose to take up us, the most inconsiderable, and pass by them, to their eternal perdition and destruction: O love! love in a high degree to man: For verily he took not hold of angels, but of the seed of Abraham he took hold (Heb 2:16). Yet this is not all: In all probability this Lord Jesus has ten times as much to do now he has undertaken to be our Saviour, as he would have had, had he stepped over us and taken <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|As we {{approached}} famous and formidable Plum Point, darkness fell, {{but that was}} nothing to shudder about--in these modern times. For now the national government has turned the Mississippi {{into a sort of}} two-thousand-mile torchlight procession. In the head of every crossing, and in the foot of every crossing, the government has set up a clear-burning lamp. You are never entirely in the dark, now; there is always a beacon in sight, either before you, or behind you, or abreast. One might almost say that lamps have been squandered there. Dozens of crossings are lighted which were not shoal when they were created, and have never been shoal since; crossings so plain, too, and also so straight, that a steamboat can take herself through them without any help, after she has been through once. Lamps in such places are of course not wasted; it is much more convenient and comfortable for a pilot to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> than on a spread of formless blackness that won't stay still; and money is saved to the boat, at the same time, for she can of course make more miles with her rudder amidships than she can with it squared across her stern and holding her back.|$|E

These arrow buttons existed until Mac OS X 10.7 where they were dropped in favor of trackpad gestures and scroll-wheel mice.|$|R
