5|$|Many of {{the changes}} Henry {{introduced}} during his rule had long-term consequences. His legal innovations form part of the basis for English law, with the Exchequer of Pleas a forerunner of the Common Bench at Westminster. Henry's <b>itinerant</b> justices also influenced his contemporaries' legal reforms: Philip Augustus' creation of <b>itinerant</b> bailli, for example, drew on Henry's model. Henry's intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland had a significant long-term impact {{on the development of}} their societies and governments.|$|E
5|$|Beckingham at {{the time}} he was {{mentioned}} in 1258 was working, probably as chief clerk, for Gilbert of Preston, the English crown's senior royal justice. This was an <b>itinerant</b> position, travelling in a circuit (or eyre); Gilbert's last eyre–and therefore also Beckingham's as his chief clerk–was that of 1268–72. In 1274, Beckingham himself was named an <b>itinerant</b> justice for Middlesex, although as yet this was not a permanent position and he was replaced by the next year. At this time he seems to have held the rank of king's serjeant. He received the commission of justice of assize in 1276. From 1273 to 1278, he was a senior clerk to the Court of Common Pleas, and was then made keeper of the writs and rolls of the court (custos rotulorum et brevium de banco) until 1285. In that year, Beckingham was appointed a Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E

In the study an identity construction perspective is applied on four in-depth interviews with Swedish international <b>itinerants.</b> Categories of narratives are identified where the <b>itinerants</b> experience ambiguities and paradoxes in their identity construction, what they identify with and implications are discussed. international assignments, international <b>itinerants,</b> identity construction, career, social identity...|$|R

5|$|Marsh joined Alexander's Hippodrome Company, {{travelling}} around Australia in a sideshow, {{where his}} cricketing fame brought much attention.

In retirement, Marsh drank heavily and was jailed for 14 days for committing an assault in Melbourne in 1909, something he blamed on alcohol.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1930s, Barbadian calypso {{was called}} banja, and was {{performed}} by laborers in village-tenantry areas. <b>Itinerant</b> minstrels like Mighty Jerry, Shilling Agard and Slammer were well-known forerunners of modern Barbadian calypso. Their song tradition embraced sentimentality, humor, and opinionated lyrics that continued to the 1960s, often by then accompanied by guitar or banjo.|$|E
5|$|Registered merchants {{were forced}} {{by law to}} wear white-colored clothes, an {{indication}} of their low status, and could be singled out for conscription into {{the armed forces and}} forced to resettle in lands to the deep south where malaria was known to be prevalent. In contrast, <b>itinerant</b> merchants were often richer due to their trade between a network of towns and cities and their ability to avoid registering as merchants. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, registered merchants were banned from wearing silk clothes, riding on horseback, or holding public office. This is in stark contrast to unregistered <b>itinerant</b> merchants who Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) states wore fine silks, rode in carriages pulled by fat horses, and whose wealth allowed them to associate with government officials.|$|E
5|$|Charles Albert Tindley, born in 1851 in Berlin, Maryland, {{would become}} the first major {{composer}} of gospel music, a style that drew on African American spirituals, Christian hymns and other folk music traditions. Tindley's earliest musical experience likely included tarrying services, a musical tradition of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, wherein Christian worshipers prayed and sang throughout the night. He became an <b>itinerant</b> preacher as an adult, working at churches throughout Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, then settled down as a pastor in Philadelphia, eventually opening a large church called Tindley Temple United Methodist Church.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Sadler began giving {{lectures on}} the Chautauqua adult-education circuit, which {{featured}} <b>itinerant</b> speakers discussing self-help and morality. Sadler often spoke about attaining {{physical and mental}} health without drugs. He also promoted hydrotherapy and discussed moral issues that related to men. Sadler, his wife, her sister, and a friend, formed a four-member lecture company that gave two- or three-day engagements, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra. Newspapers published favorable reviews of the productions. The lectures proved to be a lucrative endeavor: it was rumored that {{he became one of the}} best-paid Chautauqua speakers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his colonization policies, Stephen restored Crown lands that had been lost {{during the civil war}} that followed Alexander the Good's rule, either through buying or confiscating them. On the other hand, he granted much landed property to the Church and to the lesser noblemen who were the main supporters of the central government. His <b>itinerant</b> lifestyle enabled him to personally hold court in the whole of Moldavia, which contributed to the development of his authority.|$|E
5|$|Italian opera became {{immensely popular}} in the 19th century and was known across even the most rural {{sections}} of the country. Most villages had occasional opera productions, and the techniques used in opera influenced rural folk musics. Opera spread through <b>itinerant</b> ensembles and brass bands, focused in a local village. These civic bands (banda communale) used instruments to perform operatic arias, with trombones or fluegelhorns for male vocal parts and cornets for female parts.|$|E

5|$|Marsh {{was born}} into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar, which sits on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales.

Details of Marsh's <b>itinerant</b> pre-cricket life are scarce, because Aborigines were not on the electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with others because he was illiterate.|$|E

5|$|Public school {{instruction}} in music in Baltimore began in 1843.

Music institutions like the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra sometimes have programs aimed at youth education, and other organizations have a similar focus. The Eubie Blake Center exists to promote African American culture, and music, to both youth and adults, through dance classes for all age groups, workshops, clinics, seminars and other programs.|$|E

He operated a 'floating store' which was anchored at Chatsworth Island during the sugar-cane harvesting season when hundreds of <b>itinerant</b> labourers moved into the district. His steam launch Jinnie Rush was used as a mobile general store, delivering goods to farmers and villagers along the river. Rush also bought several racing boats, importing ‘riggers’ from England, as well as ordering them custom-made from local boat-builders.|$|E
5|$|The Mingshi – the {{official}} {{history of the}} Ming dynasty compiled by the Qing dynasty in 1739 – states that the Ming established <b>itinerant</b> commanderies overseeing Tibetan administration while also renewing titles of ex-Yuan dynasty officials from Tibet and conferring new princely titles on leaders of Tibetan Buddhist sects.

Wylie states that censorship in the Mingshi in favor of bolstering the Ming emperor's prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of Sino-Tibetan relations during the Ming era.|$|E
