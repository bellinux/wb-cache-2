40|$|Self-leadership is a {{comprehensive}} self-influence perspective that concerns leading oneself toward the performance of naturally motivating tasks and managing oneself to do work that must be done {{but that is not}} naturally motivating. Contract employment is increasingly becoming a trend among higher education institutions to address nursing faculty shortages. Therefore, self-leadership may be challenging for contract employers to remain positive about their temporary employment status. Studies highlight that <b>contract</b> <b>staff</b> continue to feel under-valued and that job insecurity and fewer benefits may decrease their level of motivation and self-leadership in an organisation. Self-leadership, however, may assist <b>contract</b> <b>staff</b> to regulate their own actions, personally and professionally, because the motivation to lead may promote higher productivity and a more fulfilling career. A review of literature on self-leadership was conducted within the conceptual framework This paper provides a review of literature on self-leadership that was integrated into a conceptual framework of using power, authority and influence in the context of <b>contract</b> <b>staff</b> at an undergraduate nursing school. This concept paper therefore outlines a new framework on how self-leadership of contract workers can enhance their personal and professional development.

40|$|Among all {{the human}} {{resources}} management and actions in a government department, recruitment plays {{a vital role in}} support of its daily operation and service delivery, where the Hongkong Post is no exception. In particular, the Hongkong Post is operated in a dual mode of a government department and business-like organization, thus the process of drawing in suitable employees through recruitment means to facilitate the department in meeting the organizational objectives, sustaining its financial viability and extending its service scope is above all important. Given the increasing workforce of non-civil service <b>contract</b> <b>staff</b> in the Hongkong Post, the traditional recruitment policy for civil servants is considered not applicable or feasible so that a tailor-made recruitment policy has to be formulated and implemented for employing non-civil service <b>contract</b> <b>staff</b> from managerial to non-managerial levels and at frontline and backend positions. This dissertation is going to study the characteristics and uniqueness of the recruitment policy of the Hongkong Post for employing non-civil service <b>contract</b> <b>staff.</b> Upon close examination of the recruitment policy, it is identified that even though the Hongkong Post is conditioned by the service-wide requirements as laid down by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for recruiting non-civil service <b>contract</b> <b>staff,</b> it is able Upon close examination of the recruitment policy, it is identified that even though the Hongkong Post is conditioned by the service-wide requirements as laid down by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for recruiting non-civil service <b>contract</b> <b>staff,</b> it is able to develop its own features and put in place tailor-made arrangements in such recruitment policy to suit its operational needs and manpower requirements. On this, remarkable dynamics {{can be seen in the}} recruitment policy for non-civil service <b>contract</b> <b>staff</b> when it interacts with external environment and evolves within the department in the light of internal human resources process. It also reveals the fluid, ever-changing and adaptable nature of the recruitment policy, which stands peculiar to the Hongkong Post given its unique mode of operation. The study on the recruitment policy of the Hongkong Post will be based on a solid academic ground which is formed by different but relevant concepts and theories of studying recruitment policies and actions of government departments under the New Public Management and other associated development, which touches on both the closely intertwined aspects of the external environment and internal process. It is delightful to note that while the Hongkong Post meets the advocacies of a majority of the available academic framework, it can supplement the academic reference through its practical experience and implementation. All these facilitate the in-depth analysis of the topic at the moment as well as shed lights for the future study of similar subjects in similar organizations. published_or_final_versionPolitics and Public AdministrationMasterMaster of Public Administratio...|$|R
