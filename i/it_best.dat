5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers thought <b>it</b> <b>best</b> {{to wait until}} the harbor had frozen over. In February, when the water had frozen between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the {{zoologist}} Joel Asaph Allen {{discovered the}} remains of Canis mississippiensis (Allen 1876) and associated these with C.dirus (Leidy 1858) and Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could be found to reveal their relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 {{he had found a}} skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name C.dirus (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, C.dirus. In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared C.indianensis a synonym of C.dirus. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos, terrible and cyon, wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, but not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of C.dirus by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of C.dirus in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.|$|E

25|$|In March 1657, an Ottoman Armada emerged {{through the}} Dardanelles, {{slipping}} through a Venetian blockade, {{with the objective}} of retaking the island but did not attempt to do so, concerned by the Venetian fleet. In July 1657, Pasha made a decision to break the Venetian blockade and retake the territory. The Peace Party in the Venetian senate thought <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to not defend Tenedos, and Lemnos, and debated this with the War Party. Pasha ended the argument by recapturing Tenedos on 31 August 1657, in the Battle of the Dardanelles (1657), the fourth and final one.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, Augustus placed Germanicus, {{the son of}} Drusus, {{in charge}} of the forces of the Rhine and he after dealing with a mutiny of the troops {{proceeded}} against the Cherusci and their allies, breaking their power finally at the battle of Idistavisus, a plain on the Weser. All eight legions and supporting units of Gauls were required to do that. Germanicus' zeal led finally to his being replaced (17 AD) by his cousin Drusus, Tiberius' son, as Tiberius thought <b>it</b> <b>best</b> to follow his predecessor's policy of limiting the empire. Germanicus certainly would have involved the Suebi, with unpredictable results.|$|E
25|$|The HS.404's predecessor, the Oerlikon type S auto-cannon, {{was rather}} heavy {{and this and}} the {{movement}} of the heavy bolt made <b>it</b> <b>best</b> suited in static and maritime anti-aircraft defence. In contrast the lighter bolt of the HS.404 made it well suited to mounting on vehicles. The M16, an anti-aircraft version of the M3 Half-track, could be equipped with single or double American made copies of the Hispano-Suiza auto-cannon. This variant of the M3 Half-track was used by US and Commonwealth forces late in the Second World War and in the Korean War and was further developed by Israel in the post-war era.|$|E

25|$|On August 12, seeing {{no threat}} of relief Maurice {{returned}} to the siege. Mining and sapping continued for the besiegers - their pioneers and engineers constructed dams that cut off the canal that fed the ditch lines which were dug up to it from which the water was drained. This resulted in the problem of lack of fresh water for the garrison in the city. Some of them thought <b>it</b> <b>best</b> that they should make terms with Maurice but van den Bergh refused. He had the confidence that Francisco Verdugo together with other Spanish commanders would provide the relief of the city.|$|E

25|$|A wound {{measuring}} 10â€“15mm {{in diameter}} can be reconstructed with a single-stage modified bilobed flap, because <b>it</b> <b>best</b> matches the skin {{color and the}} skin texture of the wounded aesthetic subunit. Although not every scar can be hidden {{at the margins of}} the aesthetic nasal subunits concerned, the superior scarring ability of those nasal skin areas minimizes such an histologic disadvantage. In a patient whose basal-cell carcinoma was excised with Mohs surgery, the scar of the nasal reconstruction (an 11mm full-thickness, laterally based, bilobed-flap applied down to the bone and the cartilage), was hidden by aligning the axis of the second lobe to and emplacing the skin graft at the junction of the nasal dorsum and the lateral wall of the nose.|$|E
