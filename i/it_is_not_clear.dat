5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> how the ARBiH and the HVO coordinated {{before their}} advance to Kupres.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> what {{portion of}} the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses {{to decide whether the}} dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> that such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> how olfactory cues are used.|$|E
