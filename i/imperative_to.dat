5|$|Due {{to safety}} {{concerns}} with viral vectors, nonviral delivery methods, typically employing lipid-based or polymeric vectors, are also promising candidates. Computational modeling of nonviral siRNA delivery paired with in vitro and in vivo gene knockdown studies elucidated the temporal behavior of RNAi in these systems. The model used an input bolus dose of siRNA and computationally and experimentally showed that knockdown duration was dependent {{mainly on the}} doubling time of the cells to which siRNA was delivered, while peak knockdown depended primarily on the delivered dose. Kinetic considerations of RNAi are <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> safe and effective dosing schedules as nonviral methods of inducing RNAi continue to be developed.|$|E

However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E

5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Nhu {{began work}} on the ambitious Strategic Hamlet Program, an attempt to build {{fortified}} villages that would be secure zones for rural Vietnamese. The objective was to lock the Vietcong out {{so that they could}} not operate among the villagers. Thảo supervised these efforts, and when told that the peasants resented being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and put into forts that they were forced to build, he advised Nhu and Tuyến that it was <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> build as many hamlets as fast as possible. This pleased the Vietcong, who felt that Thảo's efforts were turning the rural populace against Saigon. Thảo specifically had villages built in areas that he knew had a strong Vietcong presence. This increased the number of communist sympathisers who were placed inside the hamlets and given identification cards. As a result, the Vietcong were able to more effectively penetrate the villages to access supplies and personnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1943, his forces {{advanced}} forward towards the Belarusian city of Vitebsk. One of the key elements to Bagramyan's success was {{that many of the}} soldiers were part of veteran units that had been trained in the Arctic regions of Siberia, enabling them to easily push through entrenched defenses the Germans had spent months preparing. Among the key locations <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> reach Vitebsk was the small town of Gorodok, which served as a communications hub that the Germans had heavily fortified. Despite the heavy defense preparations, Bagramyan was able to utilize his heavy artillery and air support from the Red Air Force in late December to bombard the town and then launch a three-pronged attack from the ground. The German garrison was overwhelmed, and by 24 December, two infantry divisions and one tank division had surrendered. In Moscow, the news of the victory at Gorodok prompted a 124-cannon salute in honor of Bagramyan and the First Baltic Front.|$|E

5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E
5|$|Though uninvolved {{in foreign}} affairs, and {{therefore}} obliged to follow Britain's lead, the colony enthusiastically supported the mother country during the Second World War, symbolically affirming the British {{declaration of war}} before {{any other part of}} the Empire. During the ensuing conflict over 26,100 Southern Rhodesians of all races served in the armed forces, pro rata to white population a higher contribution of manpower than any other British colony or dominion, and more than the UK itself. George VI knighted Huggins in 1941, and, with the war still ongoing, Britain made overtures towards dominion status. Huggins dismissed this, saying it was <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> win the war first. The idea of dominionship was raised again in 1952, but Salisbury once more did not pursue it, instead following the results of a referendum held early the next April to enter an initially semi-independent Federation with the directly administered British colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.|$|E

5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was <b>imperative</b> <b>to</b> the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E
