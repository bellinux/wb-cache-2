5|$|The commander, Bill Shepherd, was {{a former}} Navy SEAL, whose only spaceflights were on shuttle missions, and at the {{beginning}} of the mission his total time in space was about two weeks. Questions had been raised by the Russian space agency about the choice of Shepherd as mission commander due to his lack of experience. Flight engineer Sergei Krikalev had spent over a year in orbit, mostly on Mir, and would become the first person to visit the ISS twice. He had felt <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> have been one of the first people to enter the Zarya module (the first component of the space station) in 1998, during STS-88, and was looking forward to returning. Yuri Gidzenko was designated commander and pilot of the two-day Soyuz mission to the station, had one previous spaceflight, which was a 180-day stay aboard Mir.|$|E
25|$|The {{race was}} broken into two ten-lap, green flag segments. The field was then {{inverted}} {{for the second}} ten-lap segment. Prize money was awarded for both segments for all positions. The race was broken up into two segments mainly {{because it had been}} lacking competitiveness since restrictor plates were introduced in 1988. The inversion rule added some needed <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> the event, but its popularity continued to wane.|$|E

They would also promote shows in the US. Shaefer stated in a press release that he had intended to promote in the UK for some years and spoke of his <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> be in partnership with Haye.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s {{were another}} period of change for Six Flags Over Texas. The park added three roller {{coasters}} {{as well as}} a children's section themed after Pac-Man in 1983 and later changed to Looney Tunes in 1985. Six Flags Over Texas also introduced three popular festivals in this decade. Spring Breakout, introduced in 1984, brought live bands and <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> the park for students on Spring Break. Six Flags also introduced Fright Fest and Holiday in the Park to increase attendance and extend the season.|$|E
25|$|Other Jacobite {{recruits}} {{could be}} described as adventurers– desperate men who saw the cause as a solution to their (usually financial) problems. Although small in number and varying from unemployed weavers looking for <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> impoverished gentry like William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock who served Charles as a colonel and became a general after the Battle of Falkirk, they contributed significantly to the daring that brought the Jacobites a prospect of success in their campaigns. However, other such mercenaries often became spies and informers.|$|E
25|$|Swallows {{are able}} to produce many {{different}} calls or songs, which are used to express <b>excitement,</b> <b>to</b> communicate with others of the same species, during courtship, or as an alarm when a predator is in the area. The songs of males {{are related to the}} body condition of the bird and are presumably used by females to judge the physical condition and suitability for mating of males. Begging calls are used by the young when soliciting food from their parents. The typical song of swallows is a simple, sometimes musical twittering.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of The Big Time Fanny alienated the public, lost her {{contract}} with the BBC and became fair game for harsh criticism by the media, which revealed that she and Major Cradock were not married. An entry in the Dictionary of National Biography suggested that she embellished her surname as Primrose-Pechey, when it derived from her paternal grandfather John Thomas Primrose Pechey. Subsequent celebrity chefs have brought a sophistication to British cooking which was {{not a part of}} Fanny's repertoire, but have acknowledged her pioneering work, when purple piped potato brought <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> a Britain of liver and bacon suppers.|$|E
25|$|Back at {{the main}} crusaders' camp, two Turkish spies had spread rumor that the Germans who had taken Xerigordos had also taken Nicaea, which caused <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> get there as soon as {{possible}} to share in the looting. The Turks were waiting on the road to Nicaea. Peter the Hermit had gone back to Constantinople to arrange for supplies and was due back soon, and most of the leaders argued to wait for him to return (which he never did). However, Geoffrey Burel, who had popular support among the masses, argued that it would be cowardly to wait, and they should move against the Turks right away. His will prevailed and, on the morning of 21 October, the entire army of 20,000 marched out toward Nicaea, leaving women, children, the old and the sick behind at the camp.|$|E
25|$|The Cardinals–Cubs rivalry, {{also called}} the Route 66 rivalry and The Downstate Illinois rivalry, refers to the rivalry between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs both of the National League (NL), {{one of the most}} bitter rivalries in Major League Baseball and in all of North American {{professional}} sports. The Cubs lead the regular season series 1,2101,158, with 19 ties, through , while the Cardinals are third in NL pennants with 19, to the Cubs' 17. However, the Cardinals have a clear edge when it comes to World Series success, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' 3. Games between the two clubs see numerous visiting fans in either St. Louis's Busch Stadium or Chicago's Wrigley Field. When the NL split into two, and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs always remained together. This has added <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> numerous pennant races over the years.|$|E

25|$|The capable {{coaching}} of John Kennedy aside, the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s were lean {{years for the}} Kangaroos. However, the rebuilding of the club was taking place. The Krakouer brothers (Jim and Phil) brought a spark into the side and lifted many hopes for North supporters and the <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> the general football public. The innovative idea of night games was instigated by the club and meeting the challenges, the club survived. One major highlight was the recruitment of forward John Longmire in 1989, who topped the club goalkicking over five consecutive seasons (1990–1994) and won the Coleman medal in 1990 with 98 goals. At {{the beginning of the}} 1993 season, in a dramatic and controversial move, the board of the club sacked coach and long-time player Wayne Schimmelbusch, and appointed Denis Pagan in his place. Results were immediate, as North reached the finals {{for the first time in}} nearly a decade.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} immediate {{threat to the}} existence of wild tiger populations is the illegal trade in poached skins and body parts between India, Nepal and China. The governments of these countries have failed to implement adequate enforcement response, and wildlife crime remained a low priority in terms of political commitment and investment for years. There are well-organised gangs of professional poachers, who move from place to place and set up camp in vulnerable areas. Skins are rough-cured in the field and handed over to dealers, who send them for further treatment to Indian tanning centres. Buyers choose the skins from dealers or tanneries and smuggle them through a complex interlinking network to markets outside India, mainly in China. Other factors contributing to their loss are urbanization and revenge killing. Farmers blame tigers for killing cattle and shoot them. Their skins and body parts may however {{become a part of the}} illegal trade. In Bangladesh, tigers are killed by professional poachers, local hunters, trappers, pirates and villagers. Each group of people has different motives for killing tigers, ranging from profit, <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> safety concerns. All groups have access to the commercial trade in body parts.|$|E

While the promo clip offers some of the intended thrill, the track itself - single number eight from I Am... lacks the sparkle of previous offerings. It may provide a brief rush of <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> the loins, but ultimately leaves you feeling fluffed rather than serviced by the twosome." ...|$|E
500|$|In Alastair Sooke's 2013 BBC Four {{documentary}} {{that took}} place in front of Whaam! at the Tate Modern, British comic book artist Dave Gibbons disputed Sooke's assertion that Lichtenstein's painting improved upon Novick's panel, saying: [...] "This to me looks flat and abstracted, to the point of view that to my eyes it's confusing. Whereas the original has got a three-dimensional quality to it, it's got a spontaneity to it, it's got an <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> it, and a way of involving the viewer that this one lacks." [...] Gibbons has parodied Lichtenstein's derivation of the Novick work.|$|E

When asked about using fake blood in future performances, King remarked: [...] "It's time to move on, but never say never. I know Japan never saw it, South America and Australia never saw it. So you never know." [...] In 2008 the band performed Reign in Blood in its entirety once again, this time in Paris, France, during the third European Unholy Alliance Tour.|$|E

Lasseter described how the boy's <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> show it to his father touched him deeply. [...] Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only, but rather it belonged to others, as well. [...] The memory was a defining factor in the production of Toy Story 2, with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved the characters.|$|E

[...] "Aside from the content in his message, and the fact that he's the founder of the Church of Scientology and Dianetics, the thing I loved about Hubbard was the aesthetics of his writing.

500|$|It was in Dallas that Nash {{established}} himself as a formidable point guard, beginning a decade as one of the game's top players. During his first year as a Maverick (the lockout-shortened [...] ) he started in all 40 games he played in, and averaged 7.9 points, 2.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game. The 19–31 Mavericks failed to make the playoffs but in the 1999–2000 season, the team's prospects improved considerably. Nash missed 25 mid-season games due to an ankle injury, but came back to record six double-doubles in the last month of play. He finished the season with averages of 8.6 points and 4.9 assists per game. More importantly for the team, second-year teammate and friend Dirk Nowitzki was blossoming quickly into a top player, veteran Michael Finley was having an All-Star-calibre year, and the team's new owner, billionaire Mark Cuban, was bringing new energy and <b>excitement</b> <b>to</b> the franchise. Nash now had a supportive environment in which he could thrive.|$|E
