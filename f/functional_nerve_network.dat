After sciatic nerve crush, fibrin is deposited and its clearance correlates with remyelination. Fibrin induces phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and production of p 75 NGF low-affinity receptor in Schwann cells and maintains them in a nonmyelinating state, suppresses fibronectin production, and prevents synthesis of myelin proteins. In mice depleted of fibrin(ogen), remyelination of myelinated axons is accelerated due to the faster transition of the Schwann cells to a myelinating state. Regulation of fibrin clearance and/or deposition could be a key regulatory mechanism for Schwann differentiation after nerve damage...|$|R

40|$|A large {{range of}} neuroadaptations develop in {{response}} to chronic opioid exposure and these {{are thought to be}} more or less critical for expression of the major features of opioid addiction: tolerance, withdrawal and processes that may contribute to compulsive use and relapse. This review considers these adaptations at different levels of organization in the nervous system including tolerance at the μ-opioid receptor itself, cellular tolerance and withdrawal in opioid-sensitive neurons, systems tolerance and withdrawal in opioid-sensitive <b>nerve</b> <b>networks,</b> as well as synaptic plasticity in opioid sensitive <b>nerve</b> <b>networks.</b> Receptor tolerance appears to involve enhancement of mechanisms of receptor regulation, including desensitization and internalization. Adaptations causing cellular tolerance are more complex but several important processes have been identified including upregulation of cAMP/PKA and cAMP response element-binding signalling and perhaps the mitogen activated PK cascades in opioid sensitive neurons that might not only influence tolerance and withdrawal but also synaptic plasticity during cycles of intoxication and withdrawal. The potential complexity of network, or systems adaptations that interact with opioid-sensitive neurons is great but some candidate neuropeptide systems that interact with μ-opioid sensitive neurons {{may play a role in}} tolerance and withdrawal, as might activation of glial signalling. Implication of synaptic forms of learning such as long term potentiation and long term depression in opioid addiction is still in its infancy but this ultimately has the potential to identify specific synapses that contribute to compulsive use and relapse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Laminated {{composite}} material plates {{have been widely}} used in the aerospace field owing to its specific merits of high tenacity and rigidity. However, parts of their structures are inevitably impacted in the process of manufacture and service, as the dam-age caused by the impact will greatly decrease their mechanic performance. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the damaged laminated composite structures for their security. The location of the damage could be rapidly found generally by monitoring the location of the impact load on the structure in order to reduce time of maintain structures. A novel localization method of loads on piezoelectric smart structures has been introduced in the paper. It combines the finite element inverse analytic method with the BP <b>nerve</b> <b>network</b> and proposes a way to identify the localization of the impact force acting on composite plates. Firstly, the multi-groups of strain values obtained by exerting the identical load in different positions are calculated respectively through finite element method. And then the collective electric charges of the piezoelectricity element corresponding to each group of strain values are calculated through the piezoelectricity equation. Finally, taking these electric charges as the sample to train the <b>nerve</b> <b>network,</b> the localization of impact load on the structure could be identified.
