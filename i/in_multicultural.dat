2500|$|Another {{contrary}} {{view has}} been recently proposed by Arun Bala in his dialogical {{history of the}} birth of modern science. Bala proposes that the changes involved in the Scientific Revolution—the mathematical realist turn, the mechanical philosophy, the atomism, the central role assigned to the Sun in Copernican heliocentrism—have to be seen as rooted <b>in</b> <b>multicultural</b> influences on Europe. [...] He sees specific influences in Alhazen's physical optical theory, Chinese mechanical technologies leading to the perception of the world as a machine, the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, which carried implicitly a new mode of mathematical atomic thinking, and the heliocentrism rooted in ancient Egyptian religious ideas associated with Hermeticism.|$|E

2500|$|As {{modernisation}} has increased, it {{has brought}} along with it an increase in secularism. In urban areas, the switch to more western dress such as miniskirts and jeans is of concern to religious authorities. Nightclubs and bars thrive in the cities. However, in the time since independence other areas have become more islamicised. At the time of independence women wore tight-fitting outfits, but now wear headscarves. Muslim prayers are played through the speaker systems of government buildings, and some feel Malaysia is becoming a more Islamic than secular state, with critics complaining that Islam is gaining greater influence in governance. [...] The issue of how the Malay identity should be developed has increasingly come under debate. While the ruling government believes that attaining economic power will empower the Malay population, PAS sees that as an erosion of Islamic values. However, PAS is often seen as to {{not be able to}} relate Islamic beliefs to modern society, especially <b>in</b> <b>multicultural</b> Malaysia.|$|E

40|$|The aim {{with this}} essay is to examine in which way self-realizing and {{solidarity}} can be reconciled <b>in</b> a <b>multicultural</b> society. The essay is a sociological literature study which examines the self- realizing process and puts it <b>in</b> a <b>multicultural</b> perspective. The issues are Which role does self-realizing play for solidarity? How is solidarity created <b>in</b> a <b>multicultural</b> society? Can everyone be self-realized <b>in</b> a <b>multicultural</b> society? Conditions and problems for self-realizing processes are examined and are treated mainly {{on the basis of}} Jeffrey C. Alexander and Axel Honneth theories. In the essay is established that self-realizing and society-solidarity is mutually interdependent and that solidarity requires a form of shared value, but it doesn’t need to be based in the traditional values that common history, ethnicity or culture. It can instead be based on a kind of generally recognizing that the value about multiculturalism is good and will be respected. First then can everyone in the society, self-realize on equal conditions...|$|R
