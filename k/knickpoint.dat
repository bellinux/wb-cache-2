Shoshone Falls flows over a 6-million-year-old rhyolite or trachytf lava flow that intersects the weaker basalt layers comprising the surrounding Snake River Plain, creating a natural <b>knickpoint</b> that resists water erosion.

About [...] of water were released–1500 times the average annual flow of the Snake River at Twin Falls. The massive flow of water carved the Snake River Canyon in a matter of several weeks, sculpting falls such as Shoshone Falls where the local geology intersected harder underlying rock layers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of different geomorphic contexts in the Puy-en-Velay Tertiary basin (Massif central, France) reveals {{the importance of}} <b>knickpoints</b> in active landslide patterns at different spatial scales. At the watershed scale (mesoscale), landslides are essentially located downstream of <b>knickpoints</b> {{as a result of}} headward erosion dynamics driven by the incision of the river Loire and local base level lowering. At the hillslope scale, <b>knickpoints</b> illustrate morphostructural conditions and landslide dynamics, dependent on the elevation of the crystalline basement relative to the lowering of the hydrographic network. Hillslopes currently connected with the hydrographic network are still active, while disconnected hillslopes are fossilised. Finally, <b>knickpoints</b> can be considered as being strong discontinuities separating different geomorphologic units. The latter form as a result of variable adjustment tendencies to the base level (present or old) and consequently different hillslope dynamics.

We present a two-part approach to solving this nonlinear equation analytically {{and explore the}} implications for evolving river profiles. First, a method for non-dimensionalizing the stream power equation transforms river profiles in steady state with respect to uniform uplift into a straight line in dimensionless distance-elevation space. Second, a method that tracks the upstream migration of slope patches, which are mathematical entities that carry information about downstream river states, provides a basis for constructing analytical solutions. Slope patch analysis explains why the transient morphology of dimensionless river profiles differs fundamentally if the exponent on channel slope, n, is less than or greater than one and why only concave-up migrating <b>knickpoints</b> persist when n[*] [*] 1. At migrating <b>knickpoints,</b> slope patches and the information they carry are lost, a phenomenon that fundamentally limits the potential for reconstructing tectonic histories from bedrock river profiles. Stationary <b>knickpoints,</b> which can arise from spatially varying uplift rates, differ from migrating <b>knickpoints</b> in that slope patches and the information they carry are not lost. Counterparts to migrating <b>knickpoints,</b> called “stretch zones,” are created when closely spaced slope patches spread to form smooth curves in distance-elevation space.

50|$|Head cut in stream {{geomorphology}} is an erosional {{feature of}} some intermittent and perennial streams where an abrupt vertical drop, {{also known as}} a <b>knickpoint</b> in the stream bed occurs. The <b>knickpoint,</b> where a head cut begins, can be as small as an overly-steep riffle zone or as a large as a waterfall. When not flowing, the head cut will resemble a very short cliff or bluff. A small plunge pool may be present {{at the base of the}} head cut due to the high energy of falling water. As erosion of the <b>knickpoint</b> and the streambed continues, the head cut will migrate upstream.|$|E

40|$|The Nepalese Himalaya, one of {{the most}} active regions within the Himalayan Mountain belt, is {{characterized}} by a thick succession of Miocene age Siwalik sedimentary rocks deposited at its foreland basin. To date, much of its tectonic evolution, including exhumation in the Nepalese Siwalik, is poorly understood. This study of a quantitative analysis of the bedrock river parameters should provide crucial information regarding tectonic activities in the area. The study investigated geomorphic parameters of river longitudinal profiles from 54 watersheds within the Siwalik section of the Nepalese Himalaya, for the first time. A total of 140 bedrock rivers from these watersheds were selected using stream power-law function and 30 -meter resolution ASTER DEM. The quantitative data from the river longitudinal profiles were integrated with published exhumation ages. Results of this study show, first, a presence of major and minor <b>knickpoints,</b> with a total of 305 <b>knickpoints</b> identified, of which 180 were major <b>knickpoints</b> and the rest were minor <b>knickpoints.</b> Further classifications of <b>knickpoints</b> were based on structures (lineaments extracted from SRTM DEM), lithology, and possible uplift. Second, the Normalized Steepness index (ksn) values exhibited a range from 5. 3 to 140. 6. Third, the concavity index of streams in the study area ranged from as low as - 12. 1 to as high as 31. 1 and the values were consistently higher upstream of the <b>knickpoints.</b> Finally, integration of the river profile data with the published exhumation ages show that the regions with a high ksn value correspond to the regions with higher incision and, therefore, are likely to have high uplift. The presence of a break in ksn in the eastern section of the study area suggests that the incision is likely accelerated by Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) movements. Erosion of the thrust sheet could have influenced the rapid uplift of the Siwalik due to isostatic processes. Thus, the timing of the source-region exhumation and its rate suggests that MFT-related tectonics, and/or climate processes, likely influenced the landscape evolution of the study area.

40|$|In {{the region}} of Mearim and Grajaú rivers, the Parnaíba Basin relief is {{composed}} of small hills mostly associated with sandstones of the Itapecuru Formation. Furthermore, interspersed valleys with Podzolic soils are derived from shales, siltstones, marls and limestones of Codó and Grajaú formations. The longitudinal profiles of about 356 rivers were analyzed in order to verify if the degree of fluvial incision of topography is controlled only by lithologic variation. Three geomorphometric indices were used: stream&# 8208;length gradient, normalized steepness, and spatial distribution of <b>knickpoints.</b> All indices {{are based on the}} identification of slope changes along longitudinal profiles. The stream&# 8208;length gradient index (Hack index) reflects the power flow of a river and is calculated by multiplying the slope and upstream length of the channel at a given point. The normalized steepness index is obtained by combining the slope and drainage area of river sections on a log-log graph. For the extraction of <b>knickpoints,</b> which represent convex reaches interrupting the typically concave river profiles, a new approach was used based on automatic identification of minimum and maximum slopes on the Distance-Slope graph. This procedure is more sensitive in defining <b>knickpoints</b> than the visual inspection of longitudinal profiles alone. Comparison of results with geological and geophysical data permitted to consider that relief incision is controlled not only by lithology but also by geologic structure, as suggested by the spatial coincidence of <b>knickpoints</b> with basement faults and crustal domain boundaries.

40|$|International audienceSpatial {{variations}} of gradients in landscapes {{may be used}} to identify and quantify recent deformation. The problem with doing this is to determine whether tectonic or climatic forcing is responsible for these variations, especially for low uplift rate environments (≪ 1 mm yr- 1) where climate changes may have erased tectonic features. We evaluate the respective contribution of low uplift rate (0. 1 mm yr- 1) and Pleistocene climate oscillations on gradient {{variations of}} two comparable river profiles crossing different uplift zones in the southern Upper Rhine Graben. We compare the observed points of discontinuity in river profile (<b>knickpoints)</b> and convex portions (knickzones) with those predicted by a detachment-limited model that includes stochastic short-term and cyclic long-term variations in climate, a bedrock detachment threshold and rock uplift. The detachment-limited model is chosen as it predicts the development of persistent <b>knickpoints.</b> Differing values of the shear stress exponent, erosion threshold, climate variability and uplift pattern have been checked. Our modeling suggests that climate changes had no significant effects on profiles and that anomalies are more likely due to anticline growth. This surprising result arises from the combination of a very low regional uplift rate and the detachment-limited assumption. The detachment-limited model implies an upstream propagation of <b>knickpoints</b> and knickzones generated by uplift at the outlet during dry climate periods of low erosion. The greater the uplift rate, the larger the variations in river bed elevation. Thus, for high uplift rate, <b>knickpoints</b> and knickzones generated by climate oscillations are more likely to hide tectonic features. This result seems counterintuitive because it suggests that tectonic knickzones will be better preserved in low uplift rate environments, provided that the lithology is homogeneous...|$|R
40|$|Active margins host {{more than}} half of {{submarine}} canyons worldwide. Understanding the coupling between active tectonics and canyon processes is required to improve modeling of canyon evolution and derive tectonic information from canyon morphology. In this paper we analyze high-resolution geophysical data and imagery from the Cook Strait canyon system (CS), offshore New Zealand, to characterize the influence of active tectonics on the morphology, processes, and evolution of submarine canyons, and to deduce tectonic activity from canyon morphology. Canyon location and morphology bear the clearest evidence of tectonic activity, with major faults and structural ridges giving rise to sinuosity, steep and linear longitudinal profi les, cross-sectional asymmetry, and breaks in slope gradient, relief, and slope-area plots. Faults are also associated with stronger and more frequent sedimentary fl ows, steep canyon walls that promote gully erosion, and seismicity that is considered the most likely trigger of failure of canyon walls. Tectonic activity gives rise to two types of <b>knickpoints</b> in the CS. Gentle, rounded and diffusive <b>knickpoints</b> form due to short-wavelength folds or fault breakouts. The more widespread steep and angular <b>knickpoints</b> have migrated through canyonfloor slope failures and localized quarrying and/or plucking. Migration is driven by base-level lowering due to regional margin uplift and deepening of the lower Cook Strait Canyon, and is likely faster in larger canyons because of higher sedimentary flow throughput. The <b>knickpoints,</b> nonadherence to Playfair"s Law, linear longitudinal profiles, and lack of canyon-wide, inverse power law slope-area relationships indicate that the CS is in a transient state, adjusting to perturbations associated with tectonic displacements and changes in base level and sediment fluxes. We conclude by inferring unmapped faults and regions of more pronounced uplift, and proposing a generalized model for canyon geomorphic evolution in tectonically active margins...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of lithological {{variation}} {{in the evolution of}} topography remains a fundamental issue, especially in the neglected post-orogenic terrains. Such settings represent the major part of the Earth's surface and recent modelling suggests that a range of interactions can account for the presence of residual topography for hundreds of millions of years, thereby explaining the great antiquity of landscapes in such settings. Field data from the inland flank of the SE Australian high-elevation continental margin suggest that resistant lithologies act to retard or even preclude the headward transmission of base-level fall driven by the isostatic response to regional denudation. Rejuvenation, be it episodic or continuous, is ‘caught up’ on these resistant lithologies, meaning in effect that the bedrock channels and hillslopes upstream of these ‘stalled’ <b>knickpoints</b> have become detached from the base-level changes downstream of the <b>knickpoints.</b> Until these <b>knickpoints</b> are breached, therefore, catchment relief must increase over time, a landscape evolution scenario that has been most notably suggested by Crickmay and Twidale. The role of resistant lithologies indicates that detachment-limited conditions are a key to the longevity of some post-orogenic landscapes, whereas the general importance of transport-limited conditions in the evolution of post-orogenic landscapes remains to be evaluated in field settings.

40|$|Many of {{the water}} mills on Scotland's east coast streams, unlike those {{discussed}} recently by Downward and Skinner (2005 Area 37 138 – 47), are found in predominantly bedrock reaches immediately downstream of <b>knickpoints</b> (i. e. bedrock steps). Bedrock <b>knickpoints</b> in the lower reaches of Scottish rivers are a widespread fluvial response to the glacio-isostatic rebound of northern Britain. These steps in the river profile propagate headward over time, but for intervals of a few centuries or so they are sufficiently stable to be exploited for the elevational fall necessary to power the mill wheel. Many of these mills were apparently powered by ‘run-of-the-river’, as are some today that formerly had mill dams. The typical lack of sediment storage along the erosional lower reaches of many Scottish rivers means that failure of mill structures in Scotland will probably have less dramatic geomorphological and management implications than those suggested by Downward and Skinner for southern English rivers...|$|R

We extracted <b>knickpoints,</b> landslide erosion rates, and topographic metrics across the region modified by Mendocino Triple Junction migration. Landslide erosion rates mapped from aerial imagery are consistent with modeled uplift and exhumation, while hillslope gradient is invariant across the region, suggesting that landslides accommodate uplift, as predicted by the threshold slope model. Landslides are concentrated along steepened channel reaches downstream of <b>knickpoints</b> generated by base-level fall at channel outlets, and limit slope angles and relief. We find evidence that landslide-derived coarse sediment delivery may suppress catchment-wide channel incision and landscape denudation over the time required for the uplift wave to traverse the region.
