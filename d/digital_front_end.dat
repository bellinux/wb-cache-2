40|$|In this paper, we can {{conclude}} {{that there is a}} reduction of power consumption by modifying the existing system of software define radio receiver (SDR). From the existing module, the <b>digital</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> architecture of SDR contains the two processors known as AGC (Automatic Gain Controller) processor and pre synchronization processors to perform the signal detection and pre synchronization operations. The AGC is used to optimize the ADC range based on the analog front end control things. After the AGC detection, the synchronization operation is done by an application specific processor. In this system, when the sync signal is asserted the <b>digital</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> power management can disable the synchronization process and wakeup base band part of the SDR. In the proposed system, the AGC controller and pre synchronization engine processors are integrated into a single processor with different ALUs working for AGC and pre synchronization operations. An ASIC code for detection and synchronization is executed using VLIW processor operation and power management is performed. When AGC is on, the pre synchronization ALU and remaining parts are off. When AGC is completed, the pre synchronization processor is on and AGC is power down. At the end an interrupt is generated to wake up the base band processor.

30|$|Half-duplex (HD) systems, such as time {{division}} duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD), are commonly employed in current wireless communication systems. Theoretically, the full-duplex (FD) communication system has potential to achieve double-spectral efficiency, compared with the HD communication system. However, when each node transmits and receives signals simultaneously through the same resource, the transmitted signal from each node interferes its own received signal, which is known as self interference [1 – 4]. The self interference should be mitigated because the power of it is much larger than that of desired signal. In [1], Choi et al. proposed the antenna cancellation scheme using two transmit antennas and one receive antenna to cancel the self interference in analog to <b>digital</b> converter <b>front</b> <b>end.</b> If a device has multiple antennas, the self interference can be also cancelled by using the beamforming scheme [5, 6].|$|R
40|$|International audienceSystemC AMS is a {{simulation}} framework, {{which is used}} for the hardware/software co-design of heterogeneous systems on chip. The increasing integration of digitally-assisted multiphysical components into these systems makes the bond graph formalism an excellent candidate to augment the modeling capabilities of SystemC AMS to enable the description of their energy-conserving behavior. Bond graphs integrate well with the block diagram formalism to describe continuous-time non-conservative behavior. The latter formalism also facilitates a seamless interaction with models using the Discrete Event (DE) and Timed Data Flow (TDF) models of computation of SystemC AMS. Therefore, both formalisms have been implemented into a dedicated Bond Graph (BG) model of computation for SystemC AMS, which architecture and usage is presented.
