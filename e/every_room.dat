5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be kept in <b>every</b> <b>room</b> in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and {{over a quarter of}} a million people lived here. Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in <b>every</b> <b>room.</b> These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E

5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over <b>every</b> <b>room</b> and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E
5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the dining room and center hall. <b>Every</b> <b>room</b> featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E

25|$|The rooms {{within the}} {{elongation}} are accessed through a 48-foot long, 6-foot wide gallery. The gallery is enclosed in its full length {{through the use}} of an original row of wooden balustrade, supporting operable wooden transoms, movable wooden louvers and wooden shutters, simultaneously providing shade and air, two important local design considerations, as Ponce is known for its hot weather and its implacable sun. Another significant design in Casa Vives related to Ponce's climate is the treatment given to the air circulation within the living quarters. The house has high ceilings, ranging from 14 to 15 feet, to give hot air more space to rise. Adorned ventilation holes are strategically located at the four corners of <b>every</b> <b>room's</b> ceiling, allowing for the heat to exit through the roof and letting the cool air circulate throughout the entire house. The fresh air is captured at the roof through a set of brick and masonry ventilation structures, oriented in an east-to-west direction (the usual direction of the wind currents), and channelized to the house interior. <b>Every</b> single <b>room</b> in the house connects to the adjacent room through wooden double doors (some with louvers and shutters, other of solid construction), allowing air to circulate from one space to another. Furthermore, many of the interior doors are crowned with wooden transoms, facilitating the air conduit even with the doors closed. In addition, <b>every</b> single <b>room</b> has, at least, one wooden double door that open toward the exterior.|$|R
25|$|Under the 1830 Act any householder {{who paid}} rates could apply, with a one-off payment of two guineas (roughly equal in value to £ today), to sell beer or cider {{in his home}} (usually the front parlour) and even to brew his own on his premises. The {{permission}} did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines, and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined. Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays. The beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels {{on a table in}} the corner of the room. Often profits were so high the owners were able to buy the house next door to live in, turning <b>every</b> <b>room</b> in their former home into bars and lounges for customers.|$|E
25|$|The MUM Sustainable Living Center was {{designed}} to surpass LEED Platinum qualification. The Maharishi University of Management (MUM) in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (best known for having brought Transcendental Meditation to the West) incorporates principles of Bau Biology (a German system that focuses on creating a healthy indoor environment), as well as Maharishi Vedic Architecture (an Indian system of architecture focused on the precise orientation, proportions and placement of rooms). The building {{is one of the}} few in the country to qualify as net zero, and one of even fewer that can claim the banner of grid positive via its solar power system. A rainwater catchment system and on-site natural waste-water treatment likewise take the building off (sewer) grid with respect to water and waste treatment. Additional green features include natural daylighting in <b>every</b> <b>room,</b> natural and breathable earth block walls (made by the program’s students), purified rainwater for both potable and non-potable functions; and an on-site water purification and recycling system consisting of plants, algae, and bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Camarillo Ranch House’s ideal {{location}} in Southern California, {{back in the}} early 1900s the home struggled to stay warm. Almost <b>every</b> <b>room</b> in the house has a fireplace in it. Adolfo looked to technology as a way to remedy problems that would arise on the ranch. He was the first farmer to ever purchase a refrigerator, which at that time, would take up an entire room in the house. However, he was able to safely store perishables {{for the first time in}} his life. He also had multiple heaters installed throughout the house in hopes of providing more warmth to his family. The most beautiful room in the Camarillo Ranch house belonged to Adolfo's middle daughter Carmen. Carmen was an avid equestrian who learned how to care for and maintain the horses from the Ranch Manager, Meliton Ortiz. Up until Meliton Ortiz’ death in 2010, he would visit the Camarillo Ranch House frequently to provide stories and details about his life growing up on the ranch. The home was remodeled in 1914, when the oldest daughter Carmen married. They opened many rooms by taking down walls and changing the stair design. The grand parlor had the greatest changes from this, causing it to go from multiple to rooms to one giant open grand parlor. This was in the hopes that it would open up the house more.|$|E
