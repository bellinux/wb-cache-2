The Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit {{with close ties to}} civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard <b>deployment</b> <b>time</b> is 10 hours) and efficient SAR unit.

25|$|Incident Response Vehicles (IRV) or 'Pandas' are {{generally}} used when a '999' call has been received regarding an ongoing incident or emergency. Usually an IRV would {{be assigned to}} the call, as their continual patrol of an area reduces their <b>deployment</b> <b>time.</b> Response vehicles tend {{to be capable of}} the safe use of speed, common types include, Ford Focus or Vauxhall Astra. These are usually fitted with engines with a size of around 1.6 to 1.8 litres. Although petrol-powered engines once dominated, diesel engines are now becoming more common due to their superior fuel economy and therefore lower operating costs.|$|E

RAND released a report in 2007 on seabasing that suggested a higher ratio of CH-53Ks to MV-22s would reduce <b>deployment</b> <b>times</b> from naval ships.|$|R
40|$|Although {{biological}} fouling {{has always been}} an issue for water quality data collection, longer <b>deployment</b> <b>times</b> are now more common due to advances in electronics and equipment design. Considering this, manufacturers are actively pursuing anti-fouling methods to reduce the impact of biofouling on the quality of collected data. Researchers with YSI Incorporated tested anti-fouling materials for two years at six different sites. This paper examines data from two of these sites. Deployments indicate that anti-fouling hardware on water quality sondes effectively provides viable data for extended deployments of more than 40 days. In contrast, biofouling more rapidly affected the control instruments used in these experiments. Battling Biofouling Collecting viable water quality data always has challenges. Water and weather conditions, as well as site location and access are some of the difficulties faced when trying to collect high quality data. On the technology side, improved sensor stability, longer battery life and lower power consumption allow for longer sensor <b>deployment</b> <b>times</b> at lower operating costs. These factors create new questions about sensor maintenance intervals due to biofouling; the longer an instrument stays in the field, the greater the risk for biofouling. For our purposes, biofouling is defined as th...|$|R

The potential was created by connecting pieces of copper or stainless steel to a layer of Indium/Tin Oxide semiconductor deposited on glass.

As the conductive layer is transparent, the technique was used to protect the windows of commercial optical instruments. This technology could provide an inexpensive way of extending <b>deployment</b> <b>times</b> for marine instruments...|$|R

30|$|For {{computing}} monetary {{costs of}} deployments, we use parameters {{taken from the}} advertised Amazon EC 2 service where {{the cost of an}} extra large EC 2 instance is $ 0.48 /hour and the cost of data transfer is $ 0.12 /GB. To evaluate deployment costs, we apply these machine and data transfer costs to the performance results from Section  6.1, scale the ten minute <b>deployment</b> <b>times</b> to one month, and gradually change the ratio of premise-to-cloud deployment costs to assess the effects of varying cost of private premise on the overall deployment costs. As these input parameters are changed, we re-run the new inputs through our tool, deploy the generated source code partitions from the tool as separate Java “war” archives, and run each experiment.|$|R
40|$|Many {{pervasive}} computing {{systems have been}} built for using mobile computers to interact with networked devices. To deploy a device’s user-interface, several systems dynamically generate the user-interface on a mobile computer. While this approach has several advantages, empirical results from different generators show {{that it takes a}} relatively long time for a mobile computer to create a user-interface from scratch. This paper shows {{that it is possible to}} overcome this limitation by efficiently mapping or retargeting a previously generated user-interface of one (source) device to another (target) device of the same or different type. Using the implementation of an existing generator and a set of real-world scenarios, we show that user-interface retargeting can yield <b>deployment</b> <b>times</b> that are often as good as or noticeably better than the approach of locally loading pre-existing manually-written user-interface code...|$|R

40|$|Many {{applications}} in pervasive computing environments {{are subject to}} resource constraints in terms of limited bandwidth and processing power. As such applications grow in scale and complexity, these constraints become increasingly difficult to predict at design and <b>deployment</b> <b>times.</b> Runtime adaptation is hence required for the dynamics in such constraints. However, to maintain the lightweightness of such adaptation {{it is important to}} statically gather relevant program information to reduce the runtime overhead of dynamic adaptation. This paper presents methods that use both static program analysis and runtime profiling to support the adaptation of producer/consumer-style pervasive applications. It demonstrates these methods with a network traffic-centric cost model and a program execution time-centric cost model. A communication bandwidth critical application and a computation intensive application are used to demonstrate the significant performance improvement opportunities offered by these methods under the presence of respective resource constraints...|$|R
