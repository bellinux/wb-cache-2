5|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) <b>is</b> <b>trapped</b> in a prison from which escape is impossible, the TARDIS has blown up with River Song (Alex Kingston) inside, and the Doctor's companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) has been shot and killed by an Auton replica of her fiancé Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). As the universe is collapsing, the Doctor uses time travel to solve these problems and ultimately reboot the universe.|$|E
5|$|In some European countries, such as Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, the muskrat is {{considered}} an invasive pest, as its burrowing damages the dikes and levees on which these low-lying countries depend for protection from flooding. In those countries, it <b>is</b> <b>trapped,</b> poisoned, and hunted to attempt to keep the population down. Muskrats also eat corn and other farm and garden crops growing near water bodies.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the killer}} is hunting {{for his next}} victim. While unknown to him, the murderer <b>is</b> <b>trapped</b> {{in a world of}} {{grotesque}} hallucinations. Later that night, local police officers spot his latest victim. Frank visits the crime scene, which gives him a vision of the crime, again startling his colleague Bletcher. Later on, Frank presents his finding to the local homicide department, saying that the murderer is obsessed with apocalyptic prophecies and maddened by twisted sexual guilt.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder <b>is</b> <b>trapped</b> in a car by a seemingly deranged man, and Scully races {{to determine if the}} man is suffering from a deadly illness—and if Mulder is in danger of becoming the next victim of some sort of government conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|These geyser observations, {{along with}} the finding of {{escaping}} internal heat and very few (if any) impact craters in the south polar region, show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus <b>is</b> <b>trapped</b> in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its interior, possibly driving the geological activity.|$|E

Patterns with large differences in wavelength in each direction and simultaneous generation of different patterns for each population are demonstrated. Particles <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> at nodal positions of orthogonal standing wave fields in patterns determined by device voltage amplitudes and frequencies. 10 -μm beads <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> at points {{at the intersection of}} the pressure nodes of the SAW and BW fields, and 1 -μm beads <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> in lines at the pressure nodes of the SAW field, producing a multi-scale pattern...|$|R

5|$|Xenon {{can also}} form endohedral {{fullerene}} compounds, where a xenon atom <b>is</b> <b>trapped</b> inside a fullerene molecule. The xenon atom {{trapped in the}} fullerene can be observed by 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the sensitive chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed. These observations are not without caveat, however, because the xenon atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{southern}} carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold. Colonies are becoming concentrated into the national parks and the Zambezi Valley. The well-studied European bee-eater <b>is</b> <b>trapped</b> and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.|$|E

After all of the Watchdog’s EMPs are disabled around the world, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Jeffrey Mace looks to avoid mass fear and anti-Inhuman feelings by announcing S.H.I.E.L.D. as a public organization after working in secret for years. Senator Ellen Nadeer, {{the leader of the}} Humans First political movement, later speaks out against S.H.I.E.L.D.
