40|$|Two new analogs (III and VII) of succinoadenine {{have been}} synthesized. Starting from 7 ‐chlorothiazolo[5, 4 ‐d]pyrimidine (I), {{the first one}} has been {{prepared}} by reaction with <b>diethyl</b> <b>D,L‐aspartate,</b> followed by alkaline hydrolysis. On the other hand, direct amination of 7 ‐methylthiothiazolo[5, 4 ‐d]pyrimidine (IV) with D,L‐aspartic acid has given a product formulated as 5 ‐formamido‐ 4 ‐mercapto‐ 6 ‐methylthiopyrimidine (V). An authentic specimen has been prepared for comparison by formylation of 5 ‐amino‐ 4 ‐chloro‐ 6 ‐methylthiopyrimidine (VIII) and replacement of the chlorine atom with sodium hydrosulfide. The second analog has been obtained either by reaction of 7 ‐chlorothiazolo[5, 4 ‐d] pyrimidine (I) with D,L‐mercaptosuccinic acid or by alkylation of 7 ‐mercapto‐thiazolo[5, 4 ‐d]pyrimidine (VI) with D,L‐bromosuccinic acid.
