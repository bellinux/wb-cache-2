40|$|Integrated multi-trophic {{aquaculture}} (IMTA) is {{a promising}} {{direction for the}} sustainable development of aquaculture. Microalgae have good potential to be integrated with recirculating aquaculture systems because they can use the nitrogen excreted from fish and share the same optimal pH value as in aquaculture. As a byproduct, the microalgae biomass {{can be used for}} fish feed or biofuel. However, the recirculating fish-microalgae IMTA system is under constant threat from fish pathogens and phytoplankton-lytic bacteria. Therefore, it is necessary to apply proper disinfectants as prophylaxis or treatment which are effective against these threats, but safe to fish and microalgae. For this purpose, peracetic acid (PAA) is a valid option because it is highly effective against fish pathogens and bacteria at low concentrations and degrades spontaneously to <b>harmless</b> <b>residues.</b> In the present study, we exposed the culture of a marine microalgae Tetraselmis chuii once per day for four days to four PAA products with differing hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) /PAA proportions at two concentrations (1 and 2  mg L− 1 PAA). The H 2 O 2 solutions at equivalent total peroxide (H 2 O 2  + PAA) concentrations were tested in parallel. The results show that the growth and photosynthesis of T. chuii were not affected by three of the PAA products (Wofasteril® E 400, Wofasteril® E 250 and Applichem® 150) and equivalent H 2 O 2 solutions at both concentrations. In contrast, Wofasteril® Lspez and an equivalent H 2 O 2 solution at both concentrations caused irreversible culture collapse, photosynthesis dysfunction and irreversible cell damage. In conclusion, PAA products with low proportions of H 2 O 2 are optimal disinfectants for fish-microalgae IMTA systems...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Arthropod {{biological}} control agents (BCAs) are commonly released for greenhouse vegetable insect pest management. Nevertheless, chemicals remain a necessary control tactic for certain insect pests and diseases {{and they can}} have negative impacts on BCAs. The compatibility of some formulated reduced risk insecticides (abamectin, metaflumizone and chlorantraniliprole) and fungicides (myclobutanil, potassium bicarbonate and cyprodinil + fludioxonil) used, or with promise for use, in Canadian greenhouses with Orius insidiosus (Say), Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) and Eretmocerus eremicus (Rose & Zolnerovich) was determined through laboratory and greenhouse bioassays. RESULTS: Overall, the insecticides and fungicides were <b>harmless</b> as <b>residues</b> to adult BCAs. However, abamectin was slightly to moderately harmful to O. insidiosus and A. swirskii in laboratory bioassays, whereas metaflumizone was slightly harmful to E. eremicus. CONCLUSIONS: In general, these products appear safe to use prior to establishment/release of these adult BCAs...|$|R
