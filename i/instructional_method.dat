40|$|We {{surveyed}} 40 reference instructors at 28 North American ALA-accredited {{programs of}} library and information studies about <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> they used in teaching about reference sources {{in print and}} electronic formats. Results indicated that instructors spent more time teaching students about electronic than about print sources. General reference courses included a larger variety of <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> for teaching print sources than did subject-specific courses. Commonly-used <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> for print sources included instructor-led discussion of the sources and hands-on assignments completed outside of class time. For electronic reference sources, commonly-used <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> were instructor-led discussions and modeling searches.

Training {{has been shown}} to be effective in teaching judgment and ADM; therefore, it is important to include these concepts in the flight training environment to reduce the chances of a pilot being involved in an accident. This study examined a collegiate aviation program to determine: (a) which elements of ADM are important in flight instruction, (b) which elements of ADM are being taught in flight instruction, (c) if there is a difference between the ADM elements that should be taught and the ADM elements that are being taught, (d) which <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> should be used to teach ADM, (e) which <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> are being used to teach ADM, and (f) if there is a difference between the <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> that should be used to teach ADM and the <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> that are being used to teach ADM. Surveys were used to assess the status of the flight training environment. It was determined that flight instructors were not incorporating some of the <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> or teaching the elements of ADM that the faculty thought they should be teaching.

40|$|Mastering {{academic}} language (AL) by {{elementary school students}} is important for achieving school success. The extent to which teachers {{play a role in}} stimulating students’ AL development may differ. Two types of AL stimulating behavior are distinguished: aimed at students’ understanding and at triggering students’ production of AL. As mathematics requires abstract language use, AL occurs frequently. The <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> teachers use during mathematics instruction may offer different opportunities for AL stimulating behavior. In our first study, based on expert opinions, <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> were categorized according to opportunities they offer for stimulating students’ AL development. In the second study, video-observations of mathematics instruction of elementary school teachers were analyzed with respect to AL stimulating behavior and <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> used. Results showed that actual AL stimulating behavior of teachers corresponds to the expert opinions, except for behavior shown during task evaluation. Teachers differ in time and frequency of their use of <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> and therefore in opportunities for stimulating AL development. Four teaching profiles, reflecting different AL stimulating potential, were constructed: ‘teacher talking’, ‘balanced use of methods’, ‘getting students at work’ and ‘interactive teaching’. Teachers showed more types of behavior aimed at students’ AL understanding than at production...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between the use of student-centered <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> in teaching mathematics and science, and achievement of fourth graders in these subjects. The context for analyzing this relationship is the post-Soviet region, with Kazakhstan selected as the main focus of the study, and the object of its in-depth qualitative case analysis. The measures of student-centered <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> are drawn from student surveys administered as part of the 2007 TIMSS study, while the TIMSS test scores serve as measures of student achievement. The quantitative analysis finds that student-centered <b>instructional</b> <b>methods</b> generally show no statistically significant relationship with student achievement across all country datasets included in this analysis. The qualitative case study follows up on these results in the context of Kazakhstan, and finds that while student-centered instruction is hailed as the pathway to reform of education in this post-Soviet country, the state lacks the capacity to engage in instructional reform and improvement of teacher quality, while the teachers look to the state to guide them in choosing the right <b>instructional</b> <b>methods.</b> As a result, instructional transformations take place in highly haphazard, heterogeneous ways, while teachers require direction, guidance, and support from the central state to effectively implement student-centered methods in their lessons...|$|R

Four tutoring simulations use different instructional approaches emphasizing specific types of knowledge.

Eighty novice adults were randomly assigned to the four tutors for training. Planned comparisons of learner achievement indicate greater learning with knowledgeable diagnosis and feedback, compared to correctness feedback. Analysis of variance to detect predicted linear trends shows increased instructional effectiveness across versions. Results are not simply a function of differences in training time.
