5|$|At {{their last}} session, Kaira admits to Jug {{that she has}} grown to like him. Jug {{responds}} that it is normal for a patient to feel this way about his/her therapist and while he likes <b>her</b> <b>too,</b> she is still his patient and he, her psychologist, and a relationship would not be possible. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves.|$|E
5|$|Ernie says Scully is now marked and the {{creature}} will go after <b>her</b> <b>too.</b> When his ground radar goes off, Scully goes outside. Ernie stays inside and is butchered by the bat creature. Scully returns {{to see it}} ravaging Ernie; she manages to shoot it before being knocked down. Doggett appears and shoots {{the creature}} several more times, saving Scully. The creature disappears into the night while Scully helps the injured Doggett.|$|E
5|$|His story complete, Tom awakens to find Anne by his side. She {{tells him}} she knew he’d return for his sons. He tells {{her that he}} came back for <b>her</b> <b>too.</b> Tom then reunites with his {{children}} before greeting fellow members of the 2nd Mass. They appear happy to see him. Pope (Colin Cunningham), however, appears not {{so happy to see}} Tom. He tells Weaver about his suspicions.|$|E

5|$|Howe and Queen Charlotte led {{the fleet}} by example, sailing {{directly}} at the French flagship Montagne. Passing between Montagne and the next in line Vengeur du Peuple, Queen Charlotte raked both and hauled up close to Montagne {{to engage in a}} close-range artillery battle. As she did so, Queen Charlotte also became briefly entangled with Jacobin, and exchanged fire with <b>her</b> <b>too,</b> causing serious damage to both French ships.|$|E
5|$|Out of sympathy, Gian Gastone befriended his unhappy sister-in-law, Duchess Violante Beatrice of Bavaria. Her husband, Grand Prince Ferdinando, thought <b>her</b> <b>too</b> {{ugly and}} too dull for him. At the same time, Gian Gastone sank {{into a state}} of melancholy. In an attempt to rouse him from this condition, Cardinal Francesco Maria often summoned Gian Gastone to festivities at his villa, Lappeggi. However, these soirées had no effect and Gian Gastone {{continued}} to weep unceasingly in his private rooms.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{took part}} in the {{operation}} off Lissa in 1866 during the Third Italian War of Independence. There, was tasked with neutralizing the Austrian coastal batteries protecting the port at Comisa, which placed <b>her</b> <b>too</b> far away {{to take part in the}} ensuing Battle of Lissa. The ship's postwar career was limited due to a combination of drastically reduced naval budgets and the appearance of more modern ironclads. In 1885, Terribile was withdrawn from service for use as a training ship. She remained in service until 1904 when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
60|$|She was not beautiful, {{as she sat}} stiffly; <b>her</b> underlip <b>too</b> prominent; <b>her</b> nose <b>too</b> large; <b>her</b> eyes <b>too</b> near together. She was a thin girl, with {{brilliant}} {{cheeks and}} dark hair, sulky just now, or stiff with sitting. When Bramham snapped his stick of charcoal she started. Bramham was out of temper. He squatted before the gas fire warming his hands. Meanwhile she looked at his drawing. He grunted. Fanny threw on a dressing-gown and boiled a kettle.|$|R

5|$|Violante Beatrice of Bavaria (Violante Beatrix; 23 January 167330 May 1731) was Grand Princess of Tuscany as {{the wife}} of Grand Prince Ferdinando of Tuscany and Governor of Siena from 1717 until her death. Born a Duchess of Bavaria, the {{youngest}} child of Elector Ferdinand Maria, she married {{the heir to the}} Tuscan throne, Ferdinando de' Medici, in 1689. Violante Beatrice loved him but Ferdinando did not return her affection, declaring <b>her</b> <b>too</b> ugly and too dull. Her brother-in-law, Prince Gian Gastone, befriended her out of sympathy, a friendship that lasted until Violante Beatrice's demise.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated <b>her</b> <b>too</b> much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to a marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, and if anything, of higher social standing. They thought him too old for their daughter, <b>her</b> <b>too</b> young to marry. Maybe Sophia Brittan {{did not want to}} lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertained guests, as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself. But Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, which required moving to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, before the newly-weds moved to the capital.|$|E
5000|$|Élisabeth was not {{regarded}} to be {{as pretty}} as her twin: her nose was considered too short and <b>too</b> broad, <b>her</b> face <b>too</b> plump, <b>her</b> forehead <b>too</b> high and <b>her</b> complexion <b>too</b> dark and sometimes blotchy. As a person, she was sometimes described as dull and indolent, but usually as vivacious and decided: it was said of her that she [...] "knew how to exact obedience and to get her own way", and she was generally considered as quite charming and a [...] "pleasing, piquant and intelligent personality".|$|R
60|$|Ginger said {{it would}} be very nice if she thought it wouldn't make <b>'er</b> <b>too</b> tired, and afore Sam or Peter could think of {{anything}} to say, she was upstairs putting 'er bonnet on. They thought o' plenty to say while they was sitting alone with Ginger waiting for 'er.|$|R

5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed <b>her</b> <b>too,</b> he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
5|$|The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now {{executive}} director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy a facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed <b>her</b> <b>too</b> dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him {{into the heart of the}} Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.|$|E
5|$|The {{king and}} queen were not pleased with married life. The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the {{submissive}} role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made <b>her</b> <b>too</b> independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a false pregnancy or miscarriage in 1534, he saw her failure {{to give him a}} son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine. Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with Margaret ("Madge") Shelton in 1535, although historian Antonia Fraser argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister Mary Shelton.|$|E

5|$|Assisted in her {{investigations}} by , Arisa's classmate who learns Tsubasa's identity, she encounters , Arisa's {{best friend}} whom the King manipulates; , Arisa's boyfriend; , a transfer student whom Arisa had befriended online and {{who serves as}} the messenger of the King; and , Manabe's childhood friend who lost the use of her legs after a failed suicide attempt provoked by the King. Arisa awakens from her coma, but pretends to have amnesia and returns to Midori's side. She reveals {{that she was the}} original King: although she granted harmless wishes in the beginning, she eventually stole the answers to an exam for Mariko's wish, fearing disappointment if she refused. Midori caught her in the act, and she shared the task of granting the class's wishes with him, until he injured her mother, in an attempt to grant her wish. Midori then replaced her as King, using violence and bullying to grant wishes. Horrified by his cruelty and the perceived similarities between them, she then reached out to her twin, hoping that Tsubasa would be able to uncover the truth. Tsubasa learns that Midori suffered psychological trauma in his childhood after being abandoned by his mother and witnessing his twin, Akari, die of neglect. She later foils his attempt to kill her mother, as he hated his own mother and believed that Arisa hated hers as well. Arisa confesses that she loves him for noticing her loneliness, and he realizes that he loves <b>her</b> <b>too.</b> In the conclusion, Arisa's mother spends more time with her, and Arisa reconciles with Tsubasa.|$|E

25|$|Phyllis meets {{some old}} school friends, {{including}} Eve Halliday, an assertive {{young girl who}} pities the once-rich Phyllis, believing <b>her</b> <b>too</b> soft to cope with penury.

25|$|Matsuōmaru's wife, Chiyo, {{arrives at}} the school {{to pick up her}} son, and Genzō and Tonami fear for a moment that they may have to kill <b>her</b> <b>too,</b> rather than reveal their deception. But Matsuōmaru himself arrives, and {{explains}} to all involved that the boy killed was his own son, and that he did this intentionally, in order to make up for his past transgressions against Kan Shōjō and the Court, and his involvement in Shihei's schemes.|$|E
60|$|There was {{too much}} colour in <b>her</b> cheeks, <b>too</b> much energy in <b>her</b> manner, <b>too</b> much {{firmness}} in her voice.
