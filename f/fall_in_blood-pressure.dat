40|$|The {{action of}} the protoplasmic poisons on the circulatory system as on all living tissues {{consists}} of a temporary stimu-lation followed by depression. In the case of phenol itis stated {{that there is a}} rise of blood-pressure with acceleration of the pulse and that these symptoms are followed by a fall of blood-pressure accompanied with slowing and weakening of the heart. Sollmann and Brown (1) showed that a marked fall of blood-pres-sure occurs after even small intravenous injections of phenol. After a few minutes the pressure is restored to normal. The action appeared to be both cardiac and vasomotor. SoU. mann, Hanzlik and Pilcher (2) demonstrated that there is considerable slowing in the intestinal circulation after intravenous injection of carbolic acid. Pilcher and Sollmann (3) state that the vaso-motor center is depressed as a rule although the effect may be masked by an indirect stimulation due to the convulsions and other symptoms. Pomaret (4) states that the <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood-pressure</b> under arsphenamin is due to the phenol part of the molecule. The present author has investigated the action of phenol on the circulation in an endeavor to determine what part is played by heart muscle and what part by the nervous mechanism. A. ACTION ON THE ISOLATED MAMMALIAN HEART The action of phenol on the isolated mammalian heart was observed by perfusing the excised heart of the cat or rabbit by Langendorif’s method.

40|$|The various {{hypotheses}} of {{the mechanism}} of coma resulting from cerebral trauma are discussed. Experimental evidence shows {{that there are two}} kinds of transient abolition of cerebral function by trauma—acceleration concussion, and compression concussion. The former is a passing paralysis which occurs in all brain-stem mechanisms examined and is brought about at and beyond a threshold value of change in velocity. A lesser degree of change causes momentary depression of function, a greater degree prolongs the phase of paralysis before recovery occurs. Movement of the head is necessary for the usual kind of concussion to occur, as also for contre-coup injury. Compression concussion has much more selective incidence on the respiratory centre, and appears to require an extreme crushing injury or penetration of the skull by a relatively large object. Acceleration concussion is that accompanying closed head injury and is not accompanied by any significant change in C. S. F. pressure. The cerebral blood flow is verv greatly increased in this variety owing to stimulation of the vagoglossopharyngeal nerves at the foramen magnum. With more severe blows subpial or intramedullary lesions may occur in this situation, indicating that distortion at the foramen magnum occurs. No evidence of vascular spasm or paralysis is found. An immediate brief rise of blood-pressure is due to stimulation of the vasomotor centre. Vagal effects may not appear until the traumatic paralysis of all centres begins to pass off. A delayed <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>blood-pressure</b> lasting many minutes may follow severe vagal effects, and appears comparable to acute surgical shock as produced by intense stimulation of any other visceral nerve. Death occurs from failure of blood-pressure, an intensification of shock with shallow respiration and intense constriction of viscera...|$|E
40|$|The beta-adrenoceptor {{blocking}} {{effects of}} orally administered atenolol on tachycardia induced by intravenous isoprenaline or by exercise {{have been studied}} in normal volunteers, and compared {{with the effects of}} similar doses of propranolol. The blood levels of atenolol at various times after oral administration were determined by g. l. c. and correlated with the degree of inhibition of tachycardia. Atenolol was shown to be a beta-adrenoceptor blocker in man, as in animals, in that it antagonized the chronotropic effects of isoprenaline and of exercise. The inhibitory effect of atenolol on exercise-induced tachycardia was evident at a concentration in blood of 0. 2 mug/ml and virtually complete at 0. 5 mug/ml. Higher concentrations than this did not produce significantly greater blockade. The effects of atenolol on exercise-induced tachycardia were similar to those of propranolol but it was less effective in blocking the rise in heart rate and <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> diastolic <b>blood-pressure</b> induced by intravenous infusion of isoprenaline. This separation of effects is considered characteristic of drugs causing preferential blockade of cardiac beta-adrenoreceptors. The half-life of atenolol in blood was calculated to ablut 9 hours...|$|R
40|$|The angiotensin-II {{analogue}} sar 1 -ala 8 - Summary angiotensin II ('Saralasin') {{was administered}} intravenously in different doses to two patients with unilateral renovascular hypertension. On a sodium intake of 100 meq., infusion of the analogue {{resulted in a}} decrease <b>in</b> <b>blood-pressure</b> by 10 - 20 mm. Hg, a striking sodium retention, and a <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> effective renal plasma flow. In one patient the analogue infusion was repeated after sodium depletion : blood-pressure fell to normal within 10 minutes. After corrective surgery plasma-renin activity returned to normal within 1 day, but <b>in</b> both patients <b>blood-pressure</b> reached normal values only 2 - 3 weeks later. These results suggest that two mechanisms are acting jointly in {{the maintenance of the}} hypertension in these two cases of unilateral renal-artery stenosis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{sequence}} {{method was}} first described by Di Rienzo in cats and applied in different species including humans. Until now, no systematic study of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) has been {{performed by the}} sequence method in mice. This study aimed to characterize the best estimates of BRS using the sequence method by tuning all the possible parameters, specifically, the number of beats involved in a sequence, the minimal changes <b>in</b> <b>blood-pressure</b> (BP) ramps, and the minimal changes in pulse-interval (PI) ramps. Also, the relevance to set a minimal correlation coefficient in the regression line between BP and PI was tested. An important point was the delay to be applied between BP and PI. This delay represents the physiological time for the baroreflex loop to efficiently correct the BP variations...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}}  the {{potential impact}} of inhibitors of proton-pump <b>in</b> <b>blood-pressure..</b> Methods : <b>In</b> a 24 -hour-ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring (AMBP) -database we analyzed records of 462 -hypertensive-patients according Proton-Pump Inhibitors (PPI). 150 (33 %) -patients were regularly users of PPI, and 312 (67 %) nonusers of PPI. Ambulatory-blood-pressure was measured non-invasively for 24 [...] hours by the Spacelab-devices programmed-to-measure every 20 -minutes during-daytime and every 60 -minutes during-nighttime. Results : Systolic-blood-pressure(SBP) was lower in the Proton-Pump-Inhibitors (PPI) -group (135 ± 20. vs. 139 ± 16 mmHg, p= 0, 02) as well as diastolic-blood-pressure (DBP) (76 ± 10. vs. 83 ± 10 mmHg, p< 0. 001). Multivariate-analysis showed that use of beta-blocker(OR, 2. 60) and PPI(OR, 2. 70), were independently associated with blood-pressure-control. Conclusions : This study shows that concomitant PPI therapy in hypertensive-patients {{was associated with a}} small but statistically significant-reduction in 24 -hours-BP, even after multivariate-adjustment. However, This statistical difference seems to lack clinical relevance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Observational {{studies have}} shown that {{asymptomatic}} hyperuricemia is associated with increased risks of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Whether these factors represent cause, consequence or incidental associations, however, remains uncertain. Hyperuricemia could be a consequence of impaired kidney function, diuretic therapy or oxidative stress, such that elevated serum urate level represents a marker, rather than a cause, of CKD. On the other hand, small, short-term, single-center {{studies have shown}} improvements <b>in</b> <b>blood-pressure</b> control and slowing of CKD progression following serum urate lowering with allopurinol. An adequately powered randomized controlled trial is required to determine whether uric-acid-lowering therapy slows the progression of CKD. This article discusses the rationale for and the feasibility of such a trial. International collaboration is required to plan and conduct a large-scale multicenter trial in order to better inform clinical practice and public health policy about the optimal management of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in patients with CKD. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|Both {{physical}} {{as well as}} mental demands {{result in}} an increased activity in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) with changes <b>in</b> <b>blood-pressure</b> and heart-rate. Through local release of catecholamines, e. g. noradrenaline (NAd) SNS exerts various actions at the muscle level. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the effects of low-load repetitive work alone and in combination with mental demands on local muscle interstitial noradrenaline concentration [NAd](i), muscle activity and oxygenation, assessed with microdialysis, surface electromyography, and near-infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Healthy females (n = 15) were exposed to (1) 30 min repetitive work (RW) and (2) 30 min repetitive work with superimposed mental load (RWML) on two different occasions. Muscle [NAd](i) and muscle activity increased significantly in response to RW, but did not increase further during RWML. For RW, [NAd](i) was found to be inversely correlated to muscle activity. Oxygenation decreased significantly during work, independently of occasion. Our findings indicate that low-load work causes significantly increased trapezius muscle [NAd](i) in healthy females, and short periods of superimposed mental load do not add to this increase and further, that both muscle activity and oxygenation were unaffected by the superimposed mental load...|$|R
