5|$|Mackintosh {{arrived in}} Australia in October 1914 {{to take up}} his duties, and was {{immediately}} faced with major difficulties. Without warning or notification, Shackleton had cut the Ross Sea party's allocated funds in half, from £2,000 to £1,000. Mackintosh was instructed {{to make up the}} difference by soliciting free gifts, and to mortgage the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the purchase of Aurora had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts to mortgage it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an extensive overhaul, which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government. The task of <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a negative image of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public. Some members of the party resigned, others were dismissed; recruiting a full complement of crew and scientific staff involved some last-minute appointments which left the party noticeably short of Antarctic experience.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} Bayesian {{integration}} {{is based on}} the fact that the brain must deal with a number of inputs, which vary in reliability. In <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> inputs, it must construct a coherent representation of the world that corresponds to reality. The Bayesian integration view is that the brain uses a form of Bayesian inference. This view has been backed up by computational modeling of such a Bayesian inference from signals to coherent representation, which shows similar characteristics to integration in the brain.|$|E
25|$|However, Haig, who in <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> matters favoured {{confirming}} {{the death sentence}} for the perceived ringleader while commuting similar sentences for other soldiers involved in the same incident, deemed Braithwaite the responsible party for the mutiny and as was his habit, confirmed the sentence of death. The sentences passed onto the Australians were commuted to two-years punishment with hard labour. Braithwaite was shot by a firing squad {{early in the morning}} of 29 October 1916. The only New Zealand soldier executed for mutiny during the war, he is buried in the St Sever Cemetery Extension in the city of Rouen.|$|E
25|$|While defeated, however, {{these states}} were not destroyed; if Hammurabi {{had a plan}} for welding them to Babylon he did not {{live long enough to}} see it through. Within a few years of his death, Elam and Assyria had {{withdrawn}} from Babylon's orbit and revolutions had started in all the conquered territories. The task of <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> troubles—and others—fell to Samsu-iluna. Though he campaigned tirelessly and seems to have won frequently, the king proved unable to stop the empire's unwinding. Through it all, however, he did manage to keep the core of his kingdom intact, and this allowed the city of Babylon to cement its position in history.|$|E

25|$|In real {{materials}} the Lorentz {{force is}} inadequate {{to describe the}} collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle {{and as a matter}} of computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the E and B fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the Boltzmann equation or the Fokker–Planck equation or the Navier–Stokes equations. For example, see magnetohydrodynamics, fluid dynamics, electrohydrodynamics, superconductivity, stellar evolution. An entire physical apparatus for <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> matters has developed. See for example, Green–Kubo relations and Green's function (many-body theory).|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} these campaigns marked {{a turning point in}} Rangers' history. The U.S. Army could provide only limited and thinly {{stretched}} protection in the enormous territory of Texas. In contrast, the Rangers' effectiveness when <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> threats convinced both {{the people of the state}} and the political leaders that a well-funded and organized local Ranger force was essential. Such a force could use the deep familiarity with the territory and the proximity with the theater of operations as major advantages in its favor. This option was not pursued in the light of the emerging national political problems, and the Rangers dissolved until 1874. However, the conviction of their usefulness had become firmly established, and the agency was eventually reconstituted.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{concepts}} such as the serpent being identified as Satan, Eve's sin being sexual temptation, or Adam's first wife being Lilith, come from literary works found in various Jewish apocrypha, but not found anywhere in the Book of Genesis or the Torah itself. Writings <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> subjects are extant literature in Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Armenian and Arabic, going back to ancient Jewish thought. There influential concepts were then adopted into Christian theology, but not into modern Judaism. This marked a radical split between the two religions. Some of the oldest Jewish portions of apocrypha are called Primary Adam Literature where some works became Christianized. Examples of Christianized works is The Book of Adam and Eve, known as the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, translated from the Ethiopian Ge'ez by Solomon Caesar Malan (1882) and an original Syriac work entitled Cave of Treasures which has close affinities to the Conflict as noted by August Dillmann.|$|E

500|$|Grunge lyrics {{developed}} {{as part of}} [...] "Generation X malaise", reflecting that demographic's feelings of [...] "disillusionment and uselessness". Grunge songs about love were usually about [...] "...failed, boring, doomed or destructive relationships." [...] (e.g., [...] "Black" [...] by Pearl Jam). Grunge songs contained explicit references to drug addiction, notably in Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley's songs [...] "Junkhead", [...] "Godsmack" [...] and [...] "Angry Chair", which express a [...] "...heroin philosophy of misery and hopelessness." [...] "Dirt" [...] and [...] "Hate to Feel" [...] also have heroin references. Grunge lyrics {{tended to be more}} introspective and aimed to enable the listener to see into [...] "hidden" [...] personal issues and examine the [...] "depravity" [...] of the world. This approach can be seen in Mudhoney's song [...] "Touch Me, I'm Sick", which includes lyrics with [...] "deranged imagery" [...] which depict a [...] "broken world and a fragmented self-image"; the song includes the lines [...] "I feel bad, and I've felt worse" [...] and [...] "I won't live long and I'm full of rot". Nirvana's song [...] "Lithium", from their 1991 album Nevermind, is about a [...] "...man who finds faith after his girlfriend's suicide"; it depicts [...] "...irony and ugliness" [...] as a way of <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> [...] "dark issues".|$|E

40|$|The {{answering}} machine paradox has relatively recently sparked some debate regarding Kaplan’s Demonstrative (1977). A popular approach {{to solve the}} {{answering machine}} paradox has been to reject Kaplan’s proper context thesis whilst largely maintaining his framework for indexicals. In this thesis I will firstly present two new answering machine type cases and argue that the existing solutions to the answering machine paradox cannot <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> cases. Then, I will propose a near-side pragmatic solution to the answering machine paradox that adequately <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> new answering machine cases {{in a way that}} adheres with our pre-theoretical intuitions...|$|R
