40|$|Abstract—Reminiscent of the parity {{function}} in network coding for the butterfly network, it is shown that <b>forwarding</b> an even/odd <b>indicator</b> <b>bit</b> for a scalar quantization of a relay observation recovers 1 {{bit of information}} at the two destinations in a noiseless interference channel where interference is treated as noise. Based on this observation, a coding strategy is proposed to improve the rate of both users {{at the same time}} using a relay node in a noisy interference channel. In this strategy, the relay observes a linear combination of signals sent by the two sources, and broadcasts a common message to the two destinations over a shared out-of-band link of constant rate R 0 bits per channel use. The relay message consists of the bin index of a structured binning scheme obtained from a 2 R 0 -way partition of the squared lattice in the complex plane. We show that such scalar quantization-binning relay strategy asymptotically achieves the cut-set bound in an interference channel with a common out-of-band relay link of limited rate, improving the sum rate by two bits for every bit relayed, asymptotically at high signal to noise ratios (SNR) and when interference is treated as noise. We then use low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes along with bit-interleaved coded-modulation (BICM) as a practical coding scheme for the proposed strategy. We consider matched and mismatched scenarios, depending on whether the input alphabet of the interference signal is known or unknown to the decoder, respectively. For the matched scenario, we show the proposed strategy results in significant gains in SNR. For the mismatched scenario, we show that the proposed strategy results in rate improvements that, without the relay, cannot be achieved by merely increasing transmit powers. Finally, we use generalized mutual information analysis to characterize the theoretical performance of the mismatched scenario and validate our simulation results. I...|$|R

When uniform gain allocation is used with the relay selection, only a single value (the common power gain) can be broadcasted by the destination. If conventional power allocation is used with the relay selection, the number of selected relays need to be broadcasted by the destination. As mentioned before, we employ uniform gain allocation in this article because it has slightly better performance than the conventional power allocation when no relay selection is used, which will be shown in the simulation results.|$|R

5000|$|Since most {{instructions}} were 16 bits long, {{there was no}} room in an instruction for both a full 15-bit memory address and a meaningful instruction code. Memory was therefore addressed in terms of [...] "pages" [...] of 1,024 words each. Instructions that reference memory had 10 bits for a page offset (supporting values from 0 through 1023 decimal) and a single bit for a [...] "zero/current" [...] page indicator. If the page <b>indicator</b> <b>bit</b> was set the 10 bits were interpreted as an offset within the page that contained the instruction being executed; in other words, the high five bits of the operand address were taken from the P-register, the program counter. If the page <b>indicator</b> <b>bit</b> was clear, the offset represented an address within page zero. Thus 2,048 words could be addressed at once: 1,024 of them within page zero and another 1,024 within the same page as the instruction performing the reference. If necessary to access other memory locations the instruction could have its high bit set, denoting indirect addressing as described previously; the location addressed by the instruction would then contain the full 15-bit operand address (unless it too had its indirect bit set, etc.).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- A novel joint data-hiding and {{compression}} {{scheme for}} digital images using side match vector quantization (SMVQ) and image in painting. The two functions of data hiding and image compression {{can be integrated}} into on single module seamlessly.

Vector quantization is also utilized for some complex blocks to control the visual distortion and error diffusion caused by the progressive compression.

In this paper, a novel joint data hiding and compression system is ventured based on VQ, SMVQ andimage inpainting. Data hiding and compression scheme are melded into a single unit which will increase the efficiency of communication. As a pre-processing step, the image is divided into non overlapping blocks. The topmost and leftmost blocks are compressed by employing VQ and the residual blocks are embedded with secret data and compressed simultaneously by SMVQ or image inpainting adaptively according to the secret bit to be hidden. VQ is also employed on a threshold basis for some blocks to control the distortion. The concatenated codes received are segmented into indices and secret bits according to the <b>indicator</b> <b>bits.</b> On the receiver side, FoE based inpainting was used for reconstructing lost parts of image.

Digital images are increasingly conveyed over vulnerable channels such as the Internet. Protecting digital product is going to become important issue to ensure the secure transmission of the digital items. The existing algorithms cannot guarantee the whole security of the contents or ownership verification. The embedded watermark or data hiding into image can be used to identify the owner of the image. Also, The Block Truncation Coding (BTC) is one of the effective and real time application for data hiding. Most present BTC based watermarking methods cannot completely exploit visual perception of the cover images and do not obtain high data embedding rate. For more exploiting visual perception and high data embedding, an enhanced data hiding scheme based on BTC is proposed. In proposed method, considering the texture sub blocks and Least Significant Bits (LSBs of higher mean value and lower mean value) substitution combine together for designing improved the BTC watermarking scheme. It can obtain good balance between high embedding rate (capacity) and high quality. So, the texture sensitivity is exploited to recognize whether the image blocks or are smooth or complex. On the other hand, the LSB substitution method is employed to hide the <b>indicator</b> <b>bits</b> of each image block or sub block.

Because of noise traders (Morck et al. 2000; Xiong and Yu 2011) and political interruptions (Brunnermeier et al. 2017) in the Chinese stock market, the market value used to calculate TOBINQ is vulnerable to irrational trading and macro shocks, which makes TOBINQ less efficient as an indicator of investors’ belief about the firm’s future performance.

We also include year and industry dummies to control for fixed effects. For the firms using a product differentiation strategy, we predict the coefficient of R&D (%) to be significantly positive, but the coefficient of R&D 2 (%) to be insignificant, which means there is a linear relationship between R&D spending and future performance, and the firms can improve their performance with more R&D spending. On the other hand, the firms which adopt a cost leadership strategy should have a positive coefficient of R&D (%) and a negative coefficient of R&D 2 (%), indicating an inversed U-shape between R&D spending and future performance.|$|R
