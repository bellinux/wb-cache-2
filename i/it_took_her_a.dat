5|$|Born in Brussels on 15 September 1505, between ten {{and eleven}} in the morning, Archduchess Mary of Austria {{was the fifth}} child of King Philip I and Queen Joanna of Castile. Her birth was very difficult; the Queen's life was in danger and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> month to recover. On 20 September, she was baptized by Nicolas Le Ruistre, Bishop of Arras, and named after her {{paternal}} grandmother, Mary of Burgundy, {{who had died in}} 1482. Her godfather was her paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.|$|E
25|$|In June 1940, {{at the age}} of 34, {{she married}} Tom Cookson, a teacher at Hastings Grammar School. After {{experiencing}} four miscarriages late in pregnancy, it was discovered she was suffering from a rare vascular disease, telangiectasia, which causes bleeding from the nose, fingers and stomach and results in anemia. A mental breakdown followed the miscarriages, from which <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> decade to recover.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a small}} {{theater at}} the studio where {{contract}} players put on plays. While Kanin was acting in Irwin Shaw's Bury the Dead, {{she came to the}} attention of Michael Kanin, who had just been hired as a writer in the B unit. Michael was trained as an artist and had turned to commercial art and painting scenery for burlesque houses to help support his parents during the Depression. They were introduced by a mutual friend, and Michael practically asked Kanin to marry him right then and there, but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> little while to come around to the idea.|$|E

500|$|Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly was {{positive}} towards both this episode and the season premiere, [...] "Within," [...] awarding the episodes an [...] "A-". George Avalos and Michael Liedtke from the Contra Costa Times praised the episode {{and noted that}} the Scully/Dogget dynamic and the hunt for Fox Mulder worked towards the show's strengths. Tom Janulewicz from Space.com positively commented on Scully's conversion from skeptic to believer, writing, [...] "Regardless of whether it's aliens, flukemen, or pizza delivering vampires, The X-Files is all about phenomena that don't stand {{in the face of}} 'rational' explanations. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long time, but like Mulder before her, Scully eventually came to accept that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in her philosophy." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|At VidCon 2015, Black {{revealed}} {{that she had}} been working on an album which she hoped to release by the end of 2015. According to her, the album will not be anything like her previous songs. She had been working on the album since releasing her song Friday; however, but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> while to be free from Ark Music Factory and find producers with whom she was comfortable. However, no album or new original songs were released. Towards the end of 2015, Black performed a cover of [...] "Wild" [...] by Troye Sivan. Black created a web video in January 2016 on Go90 called [...] "Life After Friday". In the show, Black graduates from high school, tells her parents she is not going to college, and follows her adventures after moving to Los Angeles.|$|E

50|$|A 1st-year high-schooler from Kukonochi Academy. Has {{black hair}} tied into two low tails and big black eyes. Although soft spoken and shy, she tends {{to express her}} dark {{emotions}} in a notebook. Because of her lonely attitude, she is not paired with anyone. She also becomes Sable's second pilot replacing Heito. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> while to accept Emiru as her LIM. While searching on her old writings, she finds her connection with Emiru; when they were kids she noticed her loneliness and her desire of being noticed, so she wrote in <b>her</b> notebook <b>a</b> note that expressed her understanding of their feelings that were similar. After that epiphany the MA-Vess fully accepts her.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> but <b>an</b> instant to bend {{her face}} and kiss him, and {{something}} {{in the manner of}} it, and in the way her hands clasped and locked his head while he felt the cool charity and virtue of her lips, something in all this beatitude somehow answered everything.|$|R
2500|$|When Oppewall was {{assigned}} art {{director for the}} 2006 spy film [...] The Good Shepherd, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> week to organize the number of set locations due to the large amounts of settings in the script, which included Cuba, Guatemala, Léopoldville, London, Moscow, New York and New Haven, Connecticut, among other places. Although {{the vast majority of}} the movie was filmed in New York, the only scenes that are actually set in New York take place in a house in Far Rockaway, Queens. As a result, many sets had to be constructed under Oppewall's direction, including a Skull and Bones headquarters and the Berlin set, which was built on the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Oppewall built sets based on Skull and Bones, Central Intelligence Agency and other clandestine organizations after she consulted with a former CIA operative and researched books of interviews with spy agency insiders. Since the lead character played by Matt Damon originally aspired to be a poet, Oppewall incorporated many visual poetic symbols into the film, including a large number of mirrors to represent the duplicity of the CIA, full rigged ships as symbols of the state and eagle symbols, which were used in ironic situations such as suspect interrogations.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs and Apple {{became more}} successful, and his {{relationship}} with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now {{a part of their}} relationship, [...] and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple [...] Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take [...] "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." [...] Both Holt and Jobs felt {{that it would be a}} good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan [...] "turned ugly" [...] at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: [...] "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that." [...] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could [...] "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is." [...] Brennan however notes that she [...] "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we're fellow-critics, father"--she {{accepted}} this opening. [...] "I perfectly adopt your term." [...] But <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> minute to go further. [...] "I saw Mr. Crim-ble here {{half an hour}} ago." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bramble E. Wentworth: Bramble is sly, fiery, and {{the most}} rebellious of the group, as well as {{frequently}} being childish. Out of all the girls she reacts harshest to the King's actions, declaring that she hates him after he leaves for the war and taking the longest to forgive him. She {{falls in love with}} Lord Teddie, although <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long time to admit this, as he's not the sort she would expect to fall for and she resents him for supposedly [...] "stealing" [...] her mother's portrait. She has dark red hair and yellow-green eyes, and is fifteen {{at the start of the}} book. According to Azalea, Bramble is the best at doing curtsies out of all of the girls.|$|R
50|$|Tomorrow is a {{novel by}} Graham Swift first {{published}} in 2007 about the impending disclosure of a family secret. Set in Putney, London {{on the night of}} Friday, 16 June 1995, the novel takes the form of an interior monologue by a 49-year-old mother addressed to her sleeping teenage children. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> few hours—from late at night until dawn—to collect her thoughts and rehearse what she and her husband, who is asleep next to her, are going to tell their son and daughter on the following morning, which for the latter will amount to a rewriting of the family history reaching back as far as 1944. The family narrative completed, the novel ends {{in the early hours of}} Saturday, 17 June 1995, before anybody has stirred.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> but <b>an</b> instant more--she {{performed}} the great repudiation quite as {{she might be}} prepared to sweep, in the Presence impending, her grandest curtsey. [...] "Not, you sweet suspicious thing, for my great-grandmother!" [...] And then as his glare didn't fade: [...] "Bender makes my life a burden--for {{the love of my}} precious Lawrence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Katharine directly, {{but she did}} not {{remember}} when or where she had seen him. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> moment or two to remember why Mary should ask her if she had seen Ralph.|$|E
60|$|Her {{voice broke}} {{in a kind}} of passionate sob, and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> moment or two to recover herself, even while Clyffurde stood by, mute and with well-nigh broken heart, his very soul so filled with sorrow for her that there was no room in it even for resentment.|$|E
60|$|It {{took her}} two seconds {{to realize that}} the 'One in Authority' was a miserable incompetent, {{incapable}} of recognizing merit when it was displayed before him. It took her five minutes to dress. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> minute to run downstairs and out to the news-stand {{on the corner of the}} street. Here, with a lavishness which charmed and exhilarated the proprietor, she bought all the other papers which he could supply.|$|E
50|$|Regina {{attempts}} {{to stop her}} but Zelena throws her back with her power, knocking Regina out. Zelena says that Hook has failed her and {{she is about to}} kill Henry, when Emma uses her power to release Henry from Zelena's grip with a blaze of light. Zelena disappears, allowing him to escape. Henry worriedly shakes Regina and calls out to <b>her</b> but <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> while to come around. Regina promises Henry that she will never let him go again and, as she kisses him on the forehead, the curse breaks as the kiss is born from true motherly love. Emma then learns from Mary Margaret that back in the Enchanted Forest, it was she, not Zelena, that cast the new curse, but Emma questions how that can be when Mary Margaret and David are still alive.|$|R
60|$|Nanina debated {{with herself}} {{for a moment}} whether she should answer the letter in the hardest way, to her, by writing, or, in the easiest way, in person; and decided on going to the studio and telling the master-sculptor {{that it would be}} {{impossible}} for her to serve him as a model, at least for some time to come. <b>It</b> would have <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long hour to say this with due propriety on paper; <b>it</b> would only <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> few minutes to say it with her own lips. So she put on her mantilla again and departed for the studio.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "she keeps it, and {{in more ways}} than one. You see, when Dan'el died--and that was two years ago last March--he left {{everything}} to Calthea, and the store with the rest. Before he died he told her what he had done, and advised her to sell out the stock, and put the money into somethin' that would pay good interest, and this she agreed to do, and this she is doing now. She wouldn't consent to no auction, for she knew well enough the things wouldn't bring more 'n half they cost, so she undertook herself to sell 'em all out at retail, just as her father intended they should be sold when he bought 'em. Well, <b>it's</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long while, and, in the opinion of most folks, it'll <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long while yit. You see she don't lay in no new goods, but just keeps on sellin' or tryin' to sell what she's got on hand.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> {{minute to}} say, while her fine eye only rolled; {{but when she}} spoke that organ boldly rested and the truth vividly appeared. [...] "I ask because people like you, Lord John, strike me as {{dangerous}} to the--how shall I name it?--the common weal; and because of my general strong feeling that we don't want any more of our national treasures (for I regard my great-grandmother as national) to be scattered about the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|The child, after nodding {{her head}} and smiling as she read each fresh invitation, turned the slate over, and, with some little triumph at showing that she could write too, began slowly to trace some large text letters in {{extremely}} crooked lines. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long time--especially as Mr. Blyth was breathlessly {{looking over her shoulder}} all the while--to get through these words: [...] "Thank you for being so kind to me. I will go with you anywhere you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I drew a breath, set my teeth, {{gripped the}} {{starting}} lever with both hands, {{and went off}} with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.|$|E
50|$|Loukianenko {{emerged as}} a top class {{competitor}} at the 1992 World Championships in Brussels, Belgium. A broken ankle prevented her from competing in the 1993 World Championships and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> nearly <b>a</b> year to recover. She made a come-back at the 1994 European Championships. She swept the 1993 Grand Prix Final winning the All-around and the event finals in hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon.|$|R
60|$|From {{the day of}} her compact of {{friendship}} with Jack her appearance and demeanour had been gradually changing. From the first her wild unkempt hair had been smoothly combed and braided, though none but herself knew what hours of pain and trouble <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> bit of a comb with three teeth alone remaining, to reduce the tangled mass of hair to order.|$|R
50|$|Steve is now {{anxious for}} them to leave but Sam has to intubate Luka as {{he will not be}} able to breathe for another half-hour. As they don't want to be murderers they let Sam do it but she is nervous and shaking and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> while. At the same time Abby comes looking for Luka. Mary points <b>her</b> in <b>a</b> {{different}} direction just as Rafe is aiming his gun at her. Abby turns and leaves, narrowly avoiding disaster. Sam tubes Luka with the help of Steve and starts to squeeze in air. His eyes flutter and for the moment he is okay. For the criminals this means that it's time to go, they grab Sam and drag her away despite her protests that Luka still needs help. Mary goes to fetch the van giving Rafe a kiss to indicate they are together.|$|R
60|$|When {{the witch}} {{came up to}} it, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long time before she found a place which she could ford over on her broom-stick; but at last she got across, and {{continued}} the chase faster than before. And as the children ran they heard a sound, and the little sister put her ear to the ground, and heard the broom sweeping the earth close behind them; so, quick as thought, she threw the comb down on the ground, and in an instant, as the cat had said, a dense forest sprung up, in which the roots and branches were so closely intertwined, {{that it was impossible}} to force a way through it. So when the witch came up to it on her broom she found that there was nothing for it but to turn round and go back to her hut.|$|E
60|$|This {{unexpected}} salutation alarmed {{the girl}} {{no more than}} the presence of the fierce inhabitants of the woods. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> little by surprise, it is true, but she was in a measure prepared for some such meeting, and the creature who stopped her was as little likely to excite terror as any who ever appeared in the guise of an Indian. It was a girl, not much older than herself, whose smile was sunny as Judith's in her brightest moments, whose voice was melody itself, and whose accents and manner had all the rebuked gentleness that characterizes the sex among a people who habitually treat their women as the attendants and servitors of the warriors. Beauty among the women of the aboriginal Americans, before they have become exposed to the hardships of wives and mothers, is by no means uncommon. In this particular, the original owners of the country were not unlike their more civilized successors, nature appearing to have bestowed that delicacy of mien and outline that forms so great a charm in the youthful female, but of which they are so early deprived; and that, too, as much by the habits of domestic life as from any other cause.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't see it properly," [...] muttered Potts, [...] "windows want washing, haven't {{been done}} since my wife died, and that's twenty years ago. Miss her very much, of course, but thank God there's no spring-cleaning now. The things I've seen broken in spring-cleaning! yes, and lost, too. It was {{after one of}} them that I told my wife that now I {{understood}} why the Mahomedans declare that women have no souls. When she came to understand what I meant, which <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> long time to do, we had a row, a regular row, and she threw a Dresden figure at my head. Luckily I caught it, having been a cricketer when young. Well, she's gone now, and no doubt heaven's a tidier place {{than it used to}} be--that is, if they will stand her rummagings there, which I doubt. Look at that Venus, ain't she a beauty? Might have been done by Titian when his paints ran out, and he had to take to a hot iron to express his art. What, you can't see her well? Wait a bit and I'll get a lantern. Can't have a naked candle here--things too valuable; no money could buy them again. My wife and I had another row about naked candles, or {{it may have been a}} paraffin lamp. You sit in that old prayer-stool and look at the work." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, on the {{occasion}} referred to, Angela had just regained her board after taking a toss, when a great beastly shark came along and cannoned into it, flinging her into the salty once more. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> quite <b>a</b> bit {{of time to get}} on again and make the motor-boat chap realize what was up and haul her to safety, and during that interval you can readily picture her embarrassment.|$|R

50|$|In 1970 Lovelace married Bennie Lovelace, a non-Aboriginal, and had {{one child}} with him. After they divorced, she {{moved back to}} her reserve, but found {{that she and her}} {{children}} were deprived of status rights because of her marriage. This affected her family's housing, health and education for <b>her</b> children. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> nearly <b>a</b> decade to reclaim her First Nations status, leading to <b>her</b> work as <b>an</b> activist on this and related issues for women and children's rights.|$|R
