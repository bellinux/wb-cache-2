5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> {{the only}} {{musician}} {{with whom he}} remained a close personal friend, Ignaz Moscheles, was of an older generation and equally conservative in outlook. Moscheles preserved this outlook at the Leipzig Conservatory until his own death in 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} a sacramental rather than {{educational}} purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel {{would have been}} left on the high altar {{of the church and}} removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy, where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility.|$|E
5|$|Manuscripts 1eap and 1rK Erasmus {{borrowed}} from Johannes Reuchlin. The {{rest of the}} manuscripts he {{borrowed from}} Dominicans. It <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> he {{did not use the}} Codex Basilensis, which was held at the Basel University Library, and was available for him. Erasmus had three manuscripts of the Gospels and Acts, four manuscripts of the Pauline epistles, but only one manuscript with the Book of Revelation. In every book of the New Testament he compared three or four manuscripts, except the last book, Book of Revelation. Unfortunately, this manuscript was not complete, it lacked the final leaf, which contained the last six verses of the book. Instead of delaying the publication, on account of the search for another manuscript, he decided to translate the missing verses from the Latin Vulgate into Greek. He used an inferior manuscript of Vulgate with textual variant libro vitae (book of life) instead ligno vitae (tree of life) in Rev 22:19. Even {{in other parts of the}} Book of Revelation and other books of the New Testament Erasmus occasionally introduced self-created Greek text material taken from the Vulgate. F. H. A. Scrivener remarked, that in Rev 17:4 he created a new Greek word: ἀκαθαρτητος (instead τὰ ἀκάθαρτα). There is no such word in Greek language as ακαθαρτητος. In Rev 17:8 he used καιπερ εστιν (and yet is) instead of και παρεσται (and shall come). In Acts 9:6 the question that Paul asks at the time of his conversion on the Damascus road, Τρέμων τε καὶ θαμβὣν εἲπεν κύριε τί μέ θέλεις ποιῆσαι ("And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do?") was incorporated from the Vulgate.|$|E

5|$|The {{lease on}} Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was {{extended}} {{on an annual}} basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on other days. Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in the quarry gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway {{as long as he}} was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom. Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the Aberllefenni Slate Quarry purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway. On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.|$|E
25|$|Socially, it <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that,</b> {{initially}} {{built for}} the wealthy, Caves House became much more accessible over the years, especially after public motor transport became widely available, exemplifying the growth of social homogeneity in Australia.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that special relativity is unable to handle accelerating objects or accelerating reference frames. Special relativity handles such situations quite well. It is only when gravitation <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> general relativity is required.|$|E
60|$|Arnold {{sprang to}} his feet. It <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that,</b> {{after his first}} surprise, he spoke to Fenella with his head half turned towards his companion, and an {{encouraging}} smile upon his lips.|$|R
60|$|Dale's {{movements}} were quick and stern. It <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> he chose his heavier rifle, and, mounting, {{with a sharp}} call to Pedro, he rode off without another word to the girls.|$|R
50|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> the Philippopolis Inscription honours Marcianus {{as the man}} {{who raised}} the siege, an action which seems to have taken place at this time, and makes no {{reference}} to Claudius.|$|R
25|$|Even without {{written record}} of his exploits, Bedle's {{reputation}} was known and shared by a public that was growing increasingly interested in cricket. As Bowen comments in his history, it <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> he was remembered as {{the best player in}} England some forty years after his career ended.|$|E
25|$|Boniface {{was killed}} in an ambush by the Bulgarians on 4 September 1207, and his head was sent to Bulgarian Tsar Kaloyan. The loyal Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, who had {{followed}} him to the East, probably died with him: it <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> he composed no planh (lament) in his memory.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that special relativity is applicable only to inertial frames, {{and that it is}} unable to handle accelerating objects or accelerating reference frames. Actually, accelerating objects can generally be analyzed without needing to deal with accelerating frames at all. It is only when gravitation <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> general relativity is required.|$|E
60|$|Suspicion {{flashed on}} Grant; {{the man had}} led him {{to believe he was}} a {{stranger}} to the locality, and it <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> he should insist upon their stopping and harnessing the second team.|$|R
60|$|He {{followed}} her without a word. It <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> his first impulse {{had been to}} shrink away from her as one dreading to receive a hurt. She seemed to notice it and smiled.|$|R
60|$|The girl fancied {{that she}} {{understood}} him, but {{she wondered how}} far it <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> they should slide out into the flood of radiance together when he once more drove the light craft ahead.|$|R
25|$|Together with Guánica Light, Cardona Light is {{the western}} minor light which connects Cabo Rojo Light and Caja de Muertos Light and guides the {{entrance}} to a port that, during the course of last century, exported millions of pounds of sugar particularly to the United States. Architecturally, it <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> it is the only 6th order lighthouse with a cylindrical attached tower. Also, the original brick roof and firewood beams are practically intact.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} ad-libbing (often {{laced with}} double entendre) of the presenters, including voice-over man John Blackman, soon attracted a cult following among {{younger and older}} viewers alike. The show's style was variously influenced by vaudeville, the American Tonight Show format, the Marx Brothers, The Goon Show and Monty Python. Somers was also strongly influenced by comedy duo Graham Kennedy and Bert Newton, and it <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> Carroll wrote for In Melbourne Tonight (IMT) for many years.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{criticism}} {{and the public}} response to it indicate a deepening level of dissent, not only within the kingdom's religious establishment, but also among the public. It <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> the question was asked and answered in a public forum, and then reprinted in the media -- including the Arabic and English language newspapers. Similar questions of legitimacy will arise in coming months, with the kingdom's religious, political and perhaps military leaderships becoming the focal points for increasingly intense criticism.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> {{nobody had}} asked the member of the Provincial Legislature to sit down, and he leaned {{on the arm of}} a big lounge as though he {{required}} support, and blinked at them.|$|R
50|$|Around the 10th century, {{a kind of}} {{defensive}} settlement was created here. It soon changed its function into a market settlement. It <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> the town lay on the trade route joining Greater Poland with northern Masovia and Pomerelia.|$|R
50|$|Taxonomies are a {{necessary}} but not sufficient condition for adequate {{evaluation of a}} given data set. While the taxonomic categorizations and sub-categorizations do enhance understanding, it may <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> the lack of detail in describing objects or elements creates room for ambiguity.|$|R
25|$|His {{investigation}} was opposed by powerful mining interests, {{in particular the}} powerful Count of San Mateo Valaparaíso and his allies. Faced with the supporters of the Count in Zacatecas and among the oidores of the Audiencia of Guadalajara (as well as the support of one previous viceroy, Archbishop Juan Antonio de Vizarrón y Eguiarreta), Echávarri was unable to accomplish much. It <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> in this on-going investigation (from 1739 to 1751), the central government of the colony took no action against the mineowners.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> {{the main}} target of Tet was the GVN, the party tasked with pacification, the weak {{link in the}} defense of South Vietnam. Contrary to NLF dogma and expectations, the hoped for {{uprising}} of the masses never occurred. The South Vietnamese did not embrace the cause, and many ARVN units stood firm and fought back. Nevertheless, Tet demonstrates how Communist strategy was focused on the key element in a People's War- the population – whether to control it or demoralize it, while American strategy focused on kill ratios and attrition.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of ethanol {{can lead to}} the formations of non-lamellar phases also known as non-bilayer phases. Ethanol has been recognized as being an excellent solvent in an aqueous solution for inducing non-lamellar phases in phospholipids. The formation of non-lamellar phases in phospholipids is not completely understood, but it <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> this amphiphilic molecule is capable of doing so. The formation of non-lamellar phases is significant in biomedical studies which include drug delivery, the transport of polar and non-polar ions using solvents capable of penetrating the biomembrane, increasing the elasticity of the biomembrane when it is being disrupted by unwanted substances (viruses, bacteria, solvents, etc.) and functioning as a channel or transporter of biomaterial.|$|E
50|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> George Sandys <b>was</b> {{located near}} Richard Pace, {{and may have}} been one of the first to whom Pace passed on the warning. A map of {{settlements}} and plantations along the James shows the Treasurers land near Paces Paines.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{felt his}} heart beat as he saw Clare. She was dressed in white, and the silver clasp gleamed against a {{lavender}} band at her waist. It <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> she wore it, {{but he could not}} see her face clearly. Then Ida beckoned Jake.|$|R
60|$|Father Sebastian looked up, as if {{to thank}} him, and Marston saw Harry had taken the proper line. He felt there was no use in trying to persuade Don Felix he was not very ill. It <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> the priest had not tried.|$|R
25|$|There is, however, no {{consensus}} among scholars about Finberg's suggestion. Simon Keynes and Gale R. Owen object {{that there is}} no sign of royal relatives or connections in Wynflæd's will and Finberg's assumptions about Ælfgifu's family therefore stand on shaky ground. Andrew Wareham is less troubled about this and suggests that different kinship strategies may account for it. Much of the issue of identification also seems to hang on the number of years by which Wynflæd can plausibly have outlived her daughter. In this light, it <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> on palaeographical grounds, David Dumville has rejected the conventional date of c. 950 for the will, which he considers “speculative and too early” (and that one Wynflæd was still alive in 967).|$|E
25|$|Louis Feldman {{states that}} it <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> the {{passages}} on James, John and the Testimonium {{are found in the}} Antiquities and not in the Jewish Wars, but provides three explanations for their absence from the Jewish Wars. One explanation is that the Antiquities covers the time period involved at a greater length than the Jewish Wars. The second explanation is that during the gap between the writing of the Jewish Wars (c. 70 AD) and Antiquities (after 90 AD) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the Antiquities. Another explanation is that the passages were added to the Antiquities to highlight the power of the Pharisees, but he considers the last explanation less likely than the others.|$|E
25|$|Marlovians {{suggest it}} <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>that</b> every person {{involved}} in the incident {{seems to have been}} associated {{in one way or another}} either with his friend and patron Thomas Walsingham (Frizer and Skeres) or with his employers the Cecils (Poley, Bull and Danby). They point to the lengthy period (10 hours) in which the four men remained together at Eleanor Bull's house that day, and suggest this seems unnecessary if the intent had been simply to dispose of Marlowe. The most likely reason for the get-together, they say, would have been to save him in some way from the peril facing him. They claim that the faking of his death fits more of the facts as known than any other scenario. That Poley, Frizer and Skeres all made a living from being able to lie convincingly may have been relevant too.|$|E
