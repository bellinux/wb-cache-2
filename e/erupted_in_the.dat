5|$|After the {{adoption}} of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in November 1947, a civil war <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Mandate of Palestine. The Jews living in Jerusalem constituted one of the weak points of the Yishuv and a main cause for concern to its leaders. With nearly 100,000 inhabitants, a sixth of the total Jewish population in the Mandate, the city was isolated in the heart of territory under Arab control.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the loss}} of {{territory}} required for the peace treaty, the embittered aristocracy started forming independent states within the Sasanian Empire. This divided {{the resources of the}} country. Furthermore, dams and canals became derelict, and a devastating plague <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western provinces of Iran, killing half of the population along with Kavadh II, who was succeeded by Ardashir III.|$|E
5|$|Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano has {{its origins}} in {{continental}} rifting—a long rupture in the Earth's crust where the lithosphere is being pulled apart. This incipient rifting has formed {{as a result of}} the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create effusive eruptions. The rift zone has existed for at least 14.9million years, and has created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Several dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active, with The Volcano being one of the three having <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few hundred years. Tseax Cone, which last <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, is the southernmost volcano in the province, while Prindle Volcano in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted more than 10,000years ago, is generally considered the northernmost.|$|E

Elmer admits his guilt and asks Sharon for {{forgiveness}} as chaos <b>erupts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tabernacle. The electric cross shorts out and the tabernacle catches fire. Horrified by Elmer's deceit, Sharon refuses his help <b>in</b> escaping from <b>the</b> fire; she and her followers burn to death as Elmer escapes.|$|R
50|$|A second {{civil war}} even <b>erupts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Eventually, the {{pandemic}} begins to subside.

5|$|Most of the {{activity}} at the Marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals; ~3422mya, 2214mya and 95mya. Dacites and andesites were erupted above an evolving batholith in the first interval. Crystal-rich ash from the 27-million-year-old (myo) Three Creeks caldera, 24myo Big John caldera and 23myo Monroe Peak caldera hardened into tuff. The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites. Alkali-rich rhyolite <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second interval from the 19myo Mount Belknap caldera.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March, {{violence}} <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bekkersdal township in Gauteng, {{the scene}} of violent service delivery protests in 2013. Residents staged a protest over a planned ANC campaign in the area, barricading the streets with rocks and burning tyres and pelting ANC officials and police vehicles with stones. Police responded to the volatile situation by firing rubber bullets at residents.|$|E
5|$|Pollard was at {{the center}} of a small brawl with the San Francisco 49ers in their game on September 28, 1953.

5|$|Tennessee {{defeated}} Connecticut {{again in}} the 1997–98 regular season. A mini controversy <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days after the game when Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw {{was quoted in the}} papers as saying UConn looked scared during the game; Auriemma denounced that quote. With Shea Ralph and senior Nykesha Sales out for the entire season, freshman Svetlana Abrosimova led a young UConn team to the NCAA Tournament Regional Final where they eventually lost to North Carolina State 60–52.|$|E
5|$|The KLA's {{popularity}} skyrocketed {{after the}} VJ and MUP attacked the compound of KLA leader Adem Jashari in March 1998, killing him, his closest associates {{and most of}} his family. The attack motivated thousands of young Kosovo Albanians to join the ranks of the KLA, fueling the Kosovar uprising that eventually <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 1998.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, a labour strike <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This {{strike was}} led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. The strike lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. A {{crackdown}} was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another wished to continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E
25|$|The Chechen separatist {{movement}} {{has taken on}} a new role as the official ideological, logistical and, probably, financial hub of <b>the</b> new insurgency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Caucasus. Increasingly frequent clashes between federal forces and local militants continue in Dagestan, while sporadic fighting <b>erupts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other southern Russia regions, most notably in Ingushetia, but also elsewhere, notably in Nalchik on 13 October 2005.|$|R
50|$|By 1915 with {{stalemate}} on the Western Front and {{the losses}} of the 10th (Irish) Division <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dardanelles at Cape Helles, enthusiasm began to wane. O'Brien had warned {{a decade earlier}} of the resurgence of revolutionary nationalism evolving out of the sectarian basis of national action, subsequently <b>erupting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1916 Rebellion. This was to have serious ramifications for Ireland's subsequent history.|$|R
25|$|Mixed {{dentition}} starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years. Permanent teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maxilla <b>erupt</b> <b>in</b> a different order from permanent teeth on the mandible. Maxillary teeth <b>erupt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth <b>erupt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Since there are no premolars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars. If any primary teeth are lost before permanent teeth are ready to replace them, some posterior teeth may drift forward and cause space to be lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth. This may cause crowding and/or misplacement once the permanent teeth erupt, which is usually referred to as malocclusion. Orthodontics may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight set of teeth.|$|R
5|$|In the {{meantime}} fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued. Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour, especially around the Kotel Pass and the Varbitsa Pass. The Bulgarian positions there were surrounded {{both from the}} north and the south. The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Tehama collapsed along a series of fault lines which criss-crossed it. The trigger for th{{is possible}} collapse {{may have been the}} release of the extensive amounts of lava that formed the dacite domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that were easily eroded by glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 years ago and dacite <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area between 250,000 and 200,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago through the present.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn was {{considered}} the most secular of the four Ngô brothers who controlled Vietnam's domestic affairs. With the appointment of elder brother Thục as the Archbishop of Huế in 1961, Cẩn became less influential as Thục aggressively blurred the distinction between church and state. In early 1963, Nhu sent an emissary from Saigon telling Cẩn to retire and leave for Japan. Unrest <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1963. After the flying of Vatican flags was permitted at a celebration for the anniversary of Thục's consecration as a bishop, the flying of Buddhist flags on 8 May to commemorate Vesak — the birth of Gautama Buddha — was banned. Cẩn's subordinates ordered government forces to fire on the unarmed Buddhist crowd protesting the ban, killing nine. Cẩn believed the United States, whose relations with South Vietnam had become strained, caused an explosion during the Vesak shootings, to destabilise his family's regime.|$|E
50|$|A protest <b>erupts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> women's cell block, {{beginning}} with a hunger strike organized by Joan's cell mate, Brenda Martin, then turning into a full-scale riot.

5|$|Hunter gatherers {{settled the}} {{territory}} in the stone and iron ages, followed later by Bantu peoples. The population coalesced first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-18th century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during the First World War. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990. Social tensions <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1.3 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1766, Hyder Ali, {{the ruler}} of Mysore invaded {{northern}} Kerala. His son and successor, Tipu Sultan, launched campaigns against the expanding British East India Company, resulting {{in two of the}} four Anglo-Mysore Wars. Tipu ultimately ceded the Malabar District and South Kanara to the company in the 1790s; both were annexed to the Madras Presidency of British India in 1792. The company forged tributary alliances with Kochi in 1791 and Travancore in 1795. By the end of 18th century, the whole of Kerala fell {{under the control of the}} British, either administered directly or under suzerainty. There were major revolts in Kerala during the independence movement in the 20th century; most notable among them is the 1921 Malabar Rebellion and the social struggles in Travancore. In the Malabar Rebellion, Mappila Muslims of Malabar rioted against Hindu zamindars and the British Raj. Some social struggles against caste inequalities also <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early decades of 20th century, leading to the 1936 Temple Entry Proclamation that opened Hindu temples in Travancore to all castes.|$|E
5|$|In early 1937, Tătărescu {{rejected}} the proposal of Józef Beck, Poland's Minister of Foreign Affairs, to withdraw Romania's support for Czechoslovakia and attempt a reconciliation with Hungary (the following year, Romania withdrew {{its support for}} the former, indicating, just before the Munich Agreement, {{that it was not}} in a position to guarantee Czechoslovakia's frontiers). This was accompanied by Czechoslovak initiatives to establish close contacts between the Little Entente and the Soviets: a scandal <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year, when the country's ambassador to Romania, Jan Šeba, published a volume calling for Soviet-Entente military cooperation (despite the Soviet-Romanian conflict over Bessarabia) and expressing the hope that the Soviet state would extend its borders into West Belarus and Ukraine. Kamil Krofta, Czechoslovakia's Foreign Minister, received criticism for having prefaced the book, and, after Tătărescu paid a visit to Czechoslovak Prime Minister Milan Hodža, Šeba was recalled to Prague.|$|E
50|$|Gilbert's {{by-election}} {{victory in}} Drummond—Arthabaska, a riding once held by Laurier himself, was {{interpreted as a}} sign that the once solid support for Laurier's Liberals in Quebec was eroding, a trend that would contribute to Laurier's defeat at the hands of Robert Borden's Conservatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1911 federal election. Gilbert's victory also indicated a growing nationalist mood in Quebec, which would later <b>erupt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Conscription Crisis of 1917.|$|R

5|$|Mortar and {{artillery}} exchange between the South Ossetian and Georgian forces <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon of 6 August along {{almost the entire}} line of contact, which lasted until the dawn of 7 August. Exchanges resumed following a brief gap in the morning. South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity announced that {{the armed forces of}} South Ossetia were ready to go on the offensive in the next few hours. At 14:00 on 7 August, two Georgian peacekeepers were killed in Avnevi as a result of Ossetian shelling. At about 14:30, Georgian tanks, 122mm howitzers and 203mm self-propelled artillery began heading towards South Ossetia to dissuade separatists from additional attacks. During the afternoon, OSCE monitors recorded Georgian military traffic, including artillery, on roads near Gori. In the afternoon, Georgian personnel left the Joint Peacekeeping Force headquarters in Tskhinvali.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{conflict}} known as the Halloween War, the fight started after a single player controlling a space station in the star system B-R5RB accidentally failed to make a scheduled in-game routine maintenance payment which made the system (a key staging area used by N3/PL in the war) highly vulnerable to capture. The CFC and Russian coalitions began pouring players into the system in a swift offensive, and N3/PL moved in a large fleet of players as a response as well. A massive battle <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system and numerous smaller engagements occurred throughout the game universe as players attempted to block reinforcements from joining the battle. CFC/Rus gained a clear win by inflicting heavy losses on N3/PL and successfully capturing B-R5RB. The losses totaled 576 capital ships including 75 Titans (the largest ships available to players), along with thousands of smaller vessels.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{realised}} {{that his}} life was in danger but struggled to decide upon {{a course of action}} and remained at Antioch. He sent a force of cavalry commanded by Ulpinus Julianus to regain control of the rebels, but they failed and Ulpinus died in the attempt. This failure further strengthened Elagabalus' army. Soon after, a force under Elagabalus' tutor Gannys marched on Antioch and engaged Macrinus' army on 8 June 218 near the village of Immae, located approximately 24 miles from Antioch. At some point during the ensuing Battle of Antioch, Macrinus deserted the field and returned to Antioch. Macrinus was then forced to flee from Antioch as fighting <b>erupted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city as well. Elegabalus himself subsequently entered Antioch as the new ruler of the Roman Empire. Macrinus fled for Rome; he traveled as far as Chalcedon before being recognized and captured. His son and co-emperor Diadumenianus, sent to the care of Artbanus V of Parthia, was himself captured in transit at Zeugma and killed in June of 218. Diadumenianus' reign lasted a total of 14 months, and he was about 10 years old when he died. Macrinus, upon learning of his son's death, tried to escape captivity, but he injured himself in the unsuccessful attempt and was afterward executed in Cappadocia; his head was sent to Elegabalus. Much like Macrinus, Diadumenianus' head was also cut off and sent to Elegabalus as a trophy.|$|E
