25|$|Iodine-131 is {{also one}} of the most {{commonly}} used gamma-emitting radioactive industrial tracer. Radioactive tracer isotopes are injected with hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluid</b> to determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of tapping the Marcellus Shale are hotly debated. The effects of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing on the surface water, groundwater, the chemicals used in fracturing, the disposal of toxic <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluid,</b> air pollution, drilling safety, spills, forest fragmentation, encroachment on residential communities, road use, and land reclamation are all contentious issues.|$|E
30|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> that can achieve the {{aforementioned}} properties. <b>Fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> can be classified into conventional and unconventional <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> (Gupta 2009).|$|R
30|$|Many {{reservoir}} {{rocks are}} sensitive to fluids and additives present in <b>fracture</b> <b>fluids.</b> Therefore, {{the sensitivity of the}} formation and formation fluids must be considered before the selection of a <b>fracture</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{the coding}} of {{vertical}} and horizontal fractures, three different types of <b>fracture</b> <b>fluids</b> have been coded in the system which are viscosity controlled fluids, reservoir controlled fluids and wall-building fluids. Viscosity controlled fluids comprise of viscous or semi-viscous fracture fluids; reservoir controlled <b>fluids</b> consist of <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> with low viscosity and high fluid loss characteristic, while wall-building fluids build a temporary filter cake. The user can select either viscosity controlled fluids, reservoir controlled fluids or wall-building <b>fluids</b> as the <b>fracture</b> <b>fluids</b> type to be used.|$|R
25|$|While {{conclusions}} regarding {{groundwater pollution}} {{as the result}} to hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluid</b> flow is restricted in both space and time, researchers have hypothesized that the potential for systematic stray gas contamination depends mainly on {{the integrity of the}} shale oil/gas well structure, along with its relative geological location to local fracture systems that could potentially provide flow paths for fugitive gas migration.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1940s, {{radioactive}} tracers {{have been used}} by the oil industry. Tagged at the surface, water is then tracked downhole, using the appropriated gamma detector, to determine flows and detect underground leaks. I-131 has been the most widely used tagging isotope in an aqueous solution of sodium iodide. It is used to characterize the hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluid</b> to help determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, it is {{theorized that}} {{contamination}} could also {{result from the}} capillary migration of deep residual hyper-saline water and hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluid,</b> slowly flowing through faults and fractures until finally making contact with groundwater resources; however, many researchers argue that the permeability of rocks overlying shale formations are too low to allow this to ever happen sufficiently. To ultimately prove this theory, {{there would have to}} be traces of toxic trihalomethanes (THM) since they are often associated with the presence of stray gas contamination, and typically co-occur with high halogen concentrations in hyper-saline waters. Besides, highly saline waters are a common natural feature in deep groundwater systems.|$|E

With the International Energy Agency (IEA) {{projecting}} {{that the}} global demand for natural gas to increase by 50 % from 2010 to 2035, the exploration of unconventional gas reserves (e. g. shale gas, tight gas and coal bed methane) will gain increasing importance as conventional gas reserves become more depleted. To enhance the production of unconventional gas and oil, water-based <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> are extensively used for the stimulation of North American shale plays because they are inexpensive and offer excellent proppant transport into the fracture when used with gelled polymers. However, in circumstances where water-based <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> are unsuitable due to concerns related to water sensitivity and clay swelling, alternative <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> are used such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide treatments. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> are particularly advantageous in depleted and shallow formations because they offer a non-damaging effect around the fracture, rapid cleanup of flowback fluid, and reduced water requirements compared to conventional water-based <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids.</b> Much research has been published about water-based fracture treatments, therefore, this review paper considers the use of nitrogen and carbon dioxide <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> used for the stimulation of unconventional shale plays, mainly in North America. By analysing selected literatures studies, this review paper summarises the utilization of {{the various types of}} nitrogen and carbon dioxide treatments (i. e. straight gas, foam, energized, cryogenic liquids) across various shale plays such as the Montney play, the Devonian play, and the Marcellus play. The paper further identifies the major benefits and challenges of nitrogen and carbon dioxide treatments documented by well operators, which will facilitate knowledge transfer about the applicability of nitrogen and carbon dioxide <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids.</b> Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

Non-potable groundwater is a potential alternative to fresh water in making hydraulic <b>fracture</b> <b>fluids.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the technical feasibility of using non-potable waters from the Southern Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer to make hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluids</b> in the Eagle Ford play. The first phase of the research is to compare <b>fracture</b> <b>fluid</b> compositional requirements with the water compositions of the Southern Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer by searching through literature, manufacturer?s, and service company?s specifications. The second phase of the research is to evaluate the performance of two different types of <b>fracture</b> <b>fluids</b> using synthetic saline water in the laboratory. Two major lab experiments will be conducted: (1) using a flow loop system to test for friction reducer performance in slickwater and (2) performing viscosity measurements and ?lipping gel? experiments for crosslinked gel performance. After completing literature reviews and laboratory evaluations, a conclusion of the technical feasibility of using non-potable groundwater to make these <b>fracture</b> <b>fluids</b> can be derived. This research will demonstrate the possibility of eliminating the use of fresh water by utilizing the available abundant non-potable groundwater from the Southern Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer in hydraulic fracturing...|$|R
25|$|In northeastern Pennsylvania and New York a {{study of}} 68 private {{drinking}} wells, which included the Dimrock Township site, the methane concentration was high {{in close proximity to}} the natural gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The average was within the defined action level of less than 28mg/L and greater than 10mg/L for hazard moderation which is recommended by the U.S. Department of the Interior but the maximum of 64mg/L was above that threshold. The study found no evidence of contamination by Marcellus saline brines or by hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluid.</b> John Hanger, former head of the Pennsylvania DEP, blamed the methane contamination on poor well construction, though he could not rule out fracking as the cause.|$|E
25|$|Though widespread, {{systematic}} contamination by {{hydraulic fracturing}} has been heavily disputed, one {{major source of}} contamination that has the most consensus among researchers of being the most problematic is site-specific accidental spillage of hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluid</b> and produced water. So far, a significant majority of groundwater contamination events are derived from surface-level anthropogenic routes rather than the subsurface flow from underlying shale formations. Examples of such events include: a fracking fluid spillage in Acorn Fork Creek, Kentucky that caused a widespread death among aquatic species in 2007; a 420,000 gallon spillage of hyper-saline produced water that turned a once very-fertile farmland in New Mexico into a dead-zone in 2010; and a 42,000 gallon fracking fluid spillage in Arlington, Texas that necessitated an evacuation of over a 100 homes in 2015. While the damage can be obvious, and much more effort {{is being done to}} prevent these accidents from occurring so frequently, the lack of data from fracking oil spills continue to leave researchers in the dark. In many of these events, the data acquired from the leakage or spillage is often very vague, and thus would lead researchers to lacking conclusions.|$|E
50|$|During the process, <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluid</b> leakoff (loss of <b>fracturing</b> <b>fluid</b> {{from the}} {{fracture}} channel {{into the surrounding}} permeable rock) occurs. If not controlled, it can exceed 70% of the injected volume.
