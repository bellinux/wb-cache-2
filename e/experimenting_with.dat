5|$|At {{the time}} when the {{wireless}} network was under consideration, various other American cities already had such networks or {{were in the process of}} constructing them. Chaska and Moorhead, both in Minnesota, had city-owned and -operated wireless networks, while Philadelphia was considering building its own and Corpus Christi, Texas, was <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> a specialized government-use-only network.|$|E
5|$|At this time, McCudden's Squadron {{was also}} <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> {{wireless}} technology. Captain D.S Lewis who commanded the headquarters Flight fitted his B.E.2a {{with a set}} to help direct artillery fire. In April 1915 he commanded 3 Squadron and became McCudden's commanding officer. He was killed a year later {{when he was shot}} down by ground-fire. It is unknown whether McCudden participated in these pioneering ventures.|$|E

5|$|She was {{converted}} to an anti-submarine warfare carrier in early 1956, re-designated CVS-21. She completed another {{tour of the}} western Pacific in late 1956 and early 1957, which was her tenth and final deployment to the area. In late 1957, the navy began <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> {{the concept of a}} carrier operating entirely with attack helicopters, and Boxer was used to test the concept.|$|E
5|$|The band's early {{sound was}} rooted in post-punk and pop but {{eventually}} grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. In 2010, they began <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> acoustic music, (obvious in 2014 release Unbroken, Untied) a theme that would expand and develop their sound and audience.|$|E
5|$|The late 1960s {{and early}} 1970s saw several {{countries}} <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> gas turbine trains. The UAC TurboTrain {{had been in}} revenue service in the United States and Canada since 1968, with mixed results. British Rail began testing the APT-E in 1972; {{for a variety of}} reasons, British Rail did not pursue gas turbine propulsion.|$|E

5|$|While <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> the {{products}} of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that {{there appeared to be}} more than one element at each position on the periodic table.

5|$|A {{wide range}} of foreign music styles have been popularized in Madagascar, {{including}} French chanson performed by artists such as Poopy, reggae, gospel music, and pop rock performed by bands such as Green and AmbondronA. Jazz has been popularized by artists such as Nicolas Vatomanga. Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid-nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists such as Da Hopp and 18,3. More recently bands like Oladad are <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> the fusion of hip-hop and traditional Malagasy musical styles and instruments.|$|E
5|$|After <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> poison {{fails to}} kill the larvae in Charlie's body, Walter {{believes}} that mixing the chimera's blood with Charlie's will stop the larvae from attacking and bursting out of his body, {{as they did in}} the other victims' corpses. Olivia learns one of the victims, Jonathan Swift, was the son of a scientist who tests on animals, and was killed while breaking into his father's lab. They also realize the chimera was created based on work by one of Walter's peers, not Walter himself.|$|E

50|$|BIOS-3 {{facilities}} {{were used to}} conduct 10 manned closure <b>experiments</b> <b>with</b> a one to three man crew. The longest <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> a three-man crew lasted 180 days (in 1972-1973). The {{facilities were}} used for the tests at least until 1984.|$|R
5|$|After <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> porting the {{original}} The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy Color, the Flagship team, supervised by Yoshiki Okamoto, began developing three interconnected Zelda games {{that could be}} played in any order. The complexity of this system led the team to cancel one game. Both Seasons and Ages were a critical success, and together sold eight million units. Critics complimented the gameplay, colorful designs and graphic quality, but criticized the inconsistent sound quality.|$|E
5|$|After recuperating from {{a bout of}} phlebitis, Crowley {{set sail}} for the United States aboard the RMS Lusitania in October 1914. Arriving in New York City, he moved into a hotel and began earning money writing for the American edition of Vanity Fair and {{undertaking}} freelance work for the famed astrologer Evangeline Adams. In the city, he continued <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> sex magic, {{through the use of}} masturbation, female prostitutes, and male clients of a Turkish bathhouse; all of these encounters were documented in his diaries.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon, the Slasher of Veils, while <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at the doorway to gain entrance.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{pulled his}} first {{selection}} surprise of 2007, <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> Hunt at halfback {{for the opening}} game of the season. At the time Bennett maintained {{that this would be}} a long term switch, but due to the Broncos' poor form, Hunt returned to fullback for Round 3. Hunt was selected to play for the Australian national team at fullback in the 2007 ANZAC Test match against New Zealand, scoring a try in the Kangaroos' 30-6 victory.|$|E
5|$|By 6000 BC, {{the early}} {{inhabitants}} of Mesoamerica were <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> the domestication of plants, {{a process that}} {{eventually led to the}} establishment of sedentary agricultural societies. The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes. All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology; after c. 1000 AD copper, silver and gold were worked. Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were <b>experimenting</b> <b>with</b> {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.|$|E
