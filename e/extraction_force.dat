5000|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1911 the GP 11 cartridge featured some technical development.

GP 11 cartridges were mass-produced for the Swiss military in the ammunition factories in Altdorf and in Thun until 1994. The last 1994 produced ammunition had Lot No. 349-94.

40|$|Objectives The {{evaluation}} of iatrogenic dentinal defects in extracted teeth {{may be influenced}} by <b>extraction</b> <b>forces</b> and prolonged dry times. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the presence of dentinal defects in freshly extracted, periodontally compromised teeth with those in a group of teeth with uncontrolled <b>extraction</b> <b>forces</b> and storage time. Materials and Methods The experimental group consisted of eighteen roots obtained from teeth extracted due to periodontal reasons with class II or III mobility. They were kept in saline and sectioned within 1 hour following extraction. The control group consisted of matched root types obtained from an anonymous tooth collection, consistent with previous dentinal defect studies. The slices were obtained at 3, 6, and 9 mm from the apex. The imaging process exposed all specimens to no more than 60 seconds of dry time. The × 12. 8 magnification was used for the 9 mm slices and × 19. 2 magnification for the 3 mm and 6 mm slices under light-emitting diode (LED) transillumination. The root canal spaces and periodontal tissues were masked to minimize extraneous factors that might influence the evaluators. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis.

5000|$|Operation Anaconda: During March 2002, {{members of}} the 3 PPCLI Battle Group were in the {{mountains}} of Paktia Province east of Gardez on Operation Anaconda, a U.S.-led coalition effort to search the mountains for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters, capture them, and destroy their shelters. The Canadian contingent comprised 16 soldiers, including six snipers led by MCpl Graham Ragsdale and an emergency <b>extraction</b> <b>force</b> of medical, security and transport personnel with vehicles specialized for winter operations. These soldiers came under fire and engaged the enemy; as a result, some al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters were killed. The coalition force met with determined resistance, and the enemy demonstrated that they were well organized and well supplied. Throughout Operation Anaconda, the Canadian sniper teams were noted for the deadly accuracy with which they suppressed enemy mortar and heavy machine-gun positions. One Canadian sniper, Corporal Rob Furlong, achieved the longest-distance sniper kill ever recorded: over 2,400 m. These operations are credited with preventing or stopping attacks that could have taken the lives of many U.S. soldiers. Joint Task Force 2 provided surveillance and strike teams for Task Force K-Bar in the war against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. For its service in Afghanistan, Task Force K-Bar, in which JTF2 members took part, was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (United States) in 2004.|$|E

In this study, the <b>extraction</b> <b>force</b> was over 10.3  N in PVC trials with none lubricant or water, suggesting the risk of pharyngeal pain in clinical settings.|$|E

A force measuring device {{was used to}} accurately measure the <b>extraction</b> <b>force</b> for stylet removal. The <b>extraction</b> <b>force</b> was significantly smaller with the Sn stylet compared to the PVC stylet, regardless of the lubricant used for all three tracheal tubes with different diameters tested (P <  0.05). In comparisons by lubricant, lidocaine and olive oil resulted in significantly lower extraction forces than with no lubricant or water with the PVC stylet for all tracheal tubes tested. In contrast, {{there were no significant}} differences in <b>extraction</b> <b>force</b> by lubricant for the Sn stylet across all tracheal tubes tested.|$|E
30|$|Another {{factor to}} {{consider}} in ex vivo models is the storage conditions of the teeth.

This was shown by assessing fresh, periodontally compromised teeth that were extracted atraumatically. The fresh roots with minimal <b>extraction</b> <b>forces</b> presented 16.6 % of dentinal defects, while teeth with no control of such conditions presented 71 % of specimens with defects. Lim et al. obtained similar results using a micro-CT methodology; specimens in dry conditions presented dentinal defects after root canal instrumentation, while specimens kept in humid conditions had no defects after the same procedures (Lim et al. 2016).|$|R

To this end, the AFM tip was attached to the C-terminus of hAQP 1 and secondary structure elements were extracted from the membrane while the single-molecule force-extension curve was being recorded. Force peaks, reflecting the unfolding of secondary structure elements, could be interpreted in depth using the atomic model of hAQP 1. Different classes of force-extension curves indicated the existence of alternative unfolding pathways for individual proteins. In addition, transmembrane helices at the periphery of the hAQP 1 tetramer exhibited smaller <b>extraction</b> <b>forces</b> than helices at the interface between hAQP 1 monomers.

30|$|Root-sectioning {{techniques}} {{have been applied}} {{for many years to}} assess the influence of root canal instrumentation (Bier et al. 2009), root canal obturation (Shemesh et al. 2009; Shemesh et al. 2010), and retreatment (Ustun et al. 2015) on dentinal defect creation. This methodology relies on an un-instrumented group that serves as a control, compared to the experimental groups that have been submitted to different endodontic procedures. Roots are sectioned with a low-speed saw under water irrigation at different distances from the apex; pictures are taken under magnification and then evaluators can assess the presence/absence of dentinal defects. In spite of it being commonly used, this methodology has been criticized for poor sensitivity and specificity. It is sometimes hard to have proper control through ex vivo models as <b>extraction</b> <b>forces</b> and/or the diamond low-speed saw could either create or propagate dentinal defect (Coelho et al. 2017).|$|R
