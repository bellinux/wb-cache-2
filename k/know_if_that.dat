500|$|On August 6, 1984, Gardner {{escaped from}} custody at the University of Utah Hospital after faking an illness by vomiting. He {{attacked}} transportation officer Don Leavitt and {{forced him to}} unlock his shackles by telling him: [...] "I guess you <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> doctor comes back, I'll have to kill you both." [...] In {{the course of the}} escape, Gardner struck Leavitt so hard that he needed wires to reconstruct his face. Gardner forced a medical student named Mike Lynch to take him from the premises on a motorcycle while pointing a gun into his back. On August 11, a letter carrier found Leavitt's firearm in a mailbox with a note from Gardner that said, [...] "Here's the gun and wallet taken from the guard at the hospital. I don't want to hurt no one else. I just want to be free." ...|$|E

Maybe I'll be doing {{something}} with the guys, maybe in the studio, but no touring." [...] The band played their final concert on 4 February 2017 in Birmingham. The final song was streamed live on the band's Facebook page and fireworks went off as the band took their final bow. Iommi {{has said that he}} does not rule out the possibility of one-off shows, [...] "I wouldn't write that off, if one day that came about. That's possible. Or even doing an album, 'cause then, again, you're in one place. But I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> would happen." [...] In an April 2017 interview, Butler revealed that Black Sabbath considered making a blues album as the follow-up to 13, but added that, [...] "the tour got in the way." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2001, {{deciding}} {{that he would}} not be able to reach the major leagues as a starter, López converted to a submariner and moved to the bullpen. He said, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> was desperation as much as it was admitting failure." [...] He began the season with Arizona's A-Advanced affiliate, which was now the Lancaster JetHawks. In 17 games, he had a 1–3 record, a 2.62 ERA, 18 strikeouts, and one save in 24 innings pitched. He was promoted to the El Paso Diablos of the AA Texas League that season, where he had a 1–0 record, a 7.42 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and 40 innings pitched in 22 games (one start, his last professionally). In 2002, he played in 61 games for El Paso as a reliever, allowing only a [...]204 opponent batting average. That year, he went 2–2 with a 2.72 ERA, 47 strikeouts, and six saves in [...] innings.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E
500|$|On several occasions, {{people within}} the {{television}} and entertainment industry have suggested that Holby City {{is a waste of}} the television licence fee, with some suggesting that it ought to be cancelled. In August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised BBC programming as being [...] "humdrum" [...] and [...] "formulaic", saying of Holby City and the police procedural Mersey Beat: [...] "One begins to wonder what really is the point of the BBC bringing this to us. Let's have something a bit different." [...] Then head of BBC drama Jane Tranter responded that Bolt's examples were [...] "highly selective" [...] as well as [...] "hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like Holby City – week in, week out". Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told The Guardian: [...] "Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons." [...] Also in 2002, David Cox of the New Statesman criticised BBC One's 2001 Christmas schedule, for airing Holby City against a contemporary version of Othello. On this basis, Cox advocated the abolition of the licence fee, explaining: [...] "The BBC was invented in a period when the elite decided what the population should <b>know.</b> <b>If</b> <b>that</b> has gone, then the licence fee should go too." [...] At the 2003 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BSykB chief executive Tony Ball called for stricter restrictions on how the BBC spent licence payers' money, suggesting that Holby City be sold to the channel's commercial rivals, with the proceeds used to develop more original programming. The BBC refused Ball's suggestion, responding in a statement: [...] "This speech clearly reflects BSkyB's view that programmes are merely a commodity to be bought and sold." [...] In June 2004, Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV plc questioned the amount of funding spent on lengthened episodes of Holby City, and in January 2010, Janet Street-Porter of The Independent, opined Holby City had [...] "come to the end of [...] natural life" [...] and should be cancelled.|$|E

2500|$|Heseltine {{was brought}} up in {{relative}} luxury at No. 1, Uplands Crescent (now No. 5). Heseltine told Tatler interviewer Charlotte Edwardes in 2016: [...] "At prep school, I started a birdwatching club called the Tit Club. Every member was named after a member of the tit family: the Marsh Tit, the Blue Tit. I was the Great Tit". He once feared the story might reach the press: [...] "I just <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> had got out when I was in active politics, I would never have recovered".

2500|$|The press duly {{built the}} series up as a must-see, but {{the players were}} far more reticent {{than they had been}} during the {{adjacent}} encounter three years before. [...] Early in December, however, Australian captain Ricky Ponting drew considerable criticism for his comments about the ICC's wines and spirits. [...] "It has taken us a long time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to get us to that number-one spot", Ponting declared, speaking to the Associated Press. [...] "If South Africa beat us three-nil I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> gives them enough points to get over us. [...] But if they won the series one-nil or two-one, I don't think that would mean that they deserve to take over that mantle. [...] It's a bit the same with India last series. [...] Just because they beat us, the number-one team, doesn't necessarily mean they go from the number four or number five in the world to number one in the world, because it's something that's accrued {{over a long period of}} time." [...] The remark was seen as fatalist and trivialising, suggesting that the rubber hardly mattered and, in the eyes of many, that Ponting's hopes of securing a series victory were low.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 February 2013, {{speaking}} at the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden said that the Obama Administration [...] "would be prepared to meet bilaterally with the Iranian leadership. We would not make it a secret that we were doing that. We would let our partners <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> occasion presented itself. That offer stands, {{but it must be}} real and tangible, and {{there has to be an}} agenda that they’re prepared to speak to. We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise." [...] A few days later Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the offer and added ambiguously: [...] "The U.S. policies in the Middle East have failed and the Americans are in need of a winning hand. That is bringing Iran to the negotiating table." [...] On 4 February the Italian news-wire [...] "Agenzia Nova", citing [...] "sources in Teheran," [...] reported that [...] "from the beginning of the year Ali Larijani, Speaker of the (Iranian) Parliament, secretly traveled twice to the United States" [...] to launch direct negotiations with the Obama Administration. The Italian Agency explained that U.S. diplomacy was waiting for the Presidential election in Iran, that most probably will see a dramatic change in Iranian approach. It was reported on 17 June Iran’s newly elected president Hassan Rohani had expressed readiness for bilateral talks with Washington, with conditions.|$|E

Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man said he did not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me.

And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!"
