5|$|Despite {{its limited}} chemistry, the orthonitrate anion is {{interesting}} from a structural {{point of view}} due to its regular tetrahedral shape and the short N–O bond lengths, <b>implying</b> significant polar character to the bonding.|$|E
5000|$|... if p, q and r {{are three}} {{arbitrary}} propositions, then either p <b>implies</b> q or q <b>implies</b> r. This is because if q is true then p <b>implies</b> it, {{and if it}} is false then q <b>implies</b> any other statement. Since r can be p, it follows that given two arbitrary propositions, one must <b>imply</b> the other, even if they are mutually contradictory. For instance, [...] "Nadia is in Barcelona <b>implies</b> Nadia is in Madrid, or Nadia is in Madrid <b>implies</b> Nadia is in Barcelona." [...] This truism sounds like nonsense in ordinary discourse.|$|R
50|$|We {{already said}} that NC <b>implies</b> GS which <b>implies</b> SI, and that SI <b>implies</b> MX. This closes the loop and shows that all these {{properties}} are equivalent (there is also a direct proof that SNC <b>implies</b> MX).|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} other results in this family, the strong three exponentials {{conjecture}} <b>implies</b> the sharp three exponentials conjecture which <b>implies</b> the three exponentials conjecture. However, the strong and sharp three exponentials conjectures are <b>implied</b> by their four exponentials counterparts, bucking the usual trend. And the three exponentials conjecture is neither <b>implied</b> by nor <b>implies</b> the four exponentials conjecture.|$|R

5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, <b>implying</b> that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the gravitational acceleration given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has logg=4.15, <b>implying</b> a surface gravity of 140 m/s², which is {{about half of the}} gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Sun (274m/s²).|$|E
5|$|Another dromaeosaurid species, Deinonychus antirrhopus, may display partial flight capacities. The {{young of}} this species bore longer arms and more robust {{pectoral}} girdles than adults, and which {{were similar to those}} seen in other flapping theropods, <b>implying</b> that they may have been capable of flight when young and then lost the ability as they grew.|$|E
5|$|Arrian and Plutarch {{claimed that}} Alexander was {{speechless}} by this point, <b>implying</b> {{that this was}} an apocryphal story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of propositions <b>imply</b> SCH. As was noted above, GCH <b>implies</b> SCH. On the other hand, the proper forcing axiom which <b>implies</b> [...] and hence is {{incompatible}} with GCH also <b>implies</b> SCH. Solovay showed that large cardinals almost <b>imply</b> SCH—in particular, if [...] is strongly compact cardinal, then the SCH holds above [...] On the other hand, the non-existence of (inner models for) various large cardinals (below a measurable of Mitchell order [...] ) also <b>imply</b> SCH.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse and empirically test how to unlock {{volatility}} information from option prices. The information content of three option based forecasts of volatility: Black- Scholes <b>implied</b> volatility, model-free <b>implied</b> volatility and corridor <b>implied</b> volatility is addressed, with the ultimate plan of proposing a new volatility index for the Italian stock market. As for model-free <b>implied</b> volatility, two different extrapolation techniques are implemented. As for corridor <b>implied</b> volatility, five different corridors are compared. Our results, which point to a better performance of corridor <b>implied</b> volatilities with respect to both Black-Scholes <b>implied</b> volatility and model-free <b>implied</b> volatility, are in favour of narrow corridors. The volatility index proposed is obtained with an overall 50...|$|R
40|$|Neumann and Skiadopoulos (2013) {{document}} {{that although the}} <b>implied</b> volatilities are predictable, their economic pro ts become insignificant once the cost is accounted for. We show that the trading strategies based on the predictability of <b>implied</b> volatilities could generate significant risk-adjusted returns after controlling for the transaction cost. The <b>implied</b> volatility curve information is useful for the out-of-sample forecast of <b>implied</b> volatilities up to one week. Short-maturity <b>implied</b> volatilities {{tend to be more}} predictable than long-maturity <b>implied</b> volatilities. Although the long-maturity options are much less traded than the short-maturity options, their <b>implied</b> volatilities provide much more information on the price discovery...|$|R
5|$|Bush portrayed {{himself as}} a {{compassionate}} conservative, <b>implying</b> he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing {{the size of the}} United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas, {{unlike other}} Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight. However, {{they do not}} walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel {{distances}} greater than a few centimetres. Cicadas can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, <b>implying</b> elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|E
5|$|Countershading {{existed in}} marine {{reptiles}} in the Cretaceous period. Fossilised skin pigmented with dark-coloured eumelanin reveals that both leatherback turtles and mosasaurs had dark backs and light bellies. The ornithischian dinosaur Psittacosaurus similarly {{appears to have}} been countershaded, <b>implying</b> that its predators detected their prey by deducing shape from shading. Modelling suggests further that the dinosaur was optimally countershaded for a closed habitat such as a forest.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the net {{volatility}} calculated above is, in fact, the <b>implied</b> {{volatility of}} this synthetic forward option. While {{it may seem}} counter-intuitive that one can create a synthetic option whose <b>implied</b> volatility {{is lower than the}} <b>implied</b> volatilities of its components, consider that the first <b>implied</b> volatility, 18.1%, corresponds to the period from today to May expiration, while the second <b>implied</b> volatility, 14.3% corresponds to the period from today to September expiration. Therefore, the <b>implied</b> volatility for the period May to September must be less than 14.3% to compensate for the higher <b>implied</b> volatility during the period to May.|$|R
50|$|If the {{valuation}} {{function is}} monotone, then GS <b>implies</b> SI and SI <b>implies</b> NC and NC <b>implies</b> GS, so these three conditions are equivalent.|$|R

5|$|During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned {{heavily on}} the {{platform}} that Carter was weak on defense, citing the cancellation of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s. During this time Carter's defense secretary, Harold Brown, announced the stealth bomber project, apparently <b>implying</b> {{that this was the}} reason for the B-1 cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, <b>implying</b> that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, <b>implying</b> there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E
5|$|General Abercrombie {{reported}} 547 killed, 1,356 wounded, and 77 missing. Lévis in {{one report}} {{claimed that the}} French recovered 800 British bodies, <b>implying</b> that Abercrombie may have underreported the actual death toll. Chartrand estimates the number of British killed (or died of their wounds) at about 1,000 for the main battle, with about 1,500 wounded. The skirmish on July 6 cost the British about 100 killed and wounded, {{and the loss of}} General Howe.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the price}} of a call or put option, the Black-Scholes <b>implied</b> {{volatility}} is the unique volatility parameter for which the Bulack-Scholes formula recovers the option price. This article surveys research activity relating to three theoretical questions: First, does <b>implied</b> volatility ad-mit a probabilistic interpretation? Second, how does <b>implied</b> volatility behave as a function of strike and expiry? Here one seeks to characterize the shapes of the <b>implied</b> volatility skew (or smile) and term structure, which together constitute what can be termed the statics of the <b>implied</b> volatility surface.
