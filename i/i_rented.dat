The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010, and according to West, {{is a response to}} thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. [...] "The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'. <b>I</b> <b>rented</b> a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house that felt like it was {{out in the middle of}} nowhere. And I spent two months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories," [...] the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com. Matthew is also starring in The Heart of Christmas.|$|E

60|$|From an East London standpoint, {{the room}} <b>I</b> <b>rented</b> for six shillings, or a dollar and a half, per week, {{was a most}} {{comfortable}} affair. From the American standpoint, on the other hand, it was rudely furnished, uncomfortable, and small. By the time I had added an ordinary typewriter table to its scanty furnishing, I was hard put to turn around; at the best, I managed to navigate it by a sort of vermicular progression requiring great dexterity and presence of mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{was both}} {{living in a}} little town in the San Luis valley, running some flocks of sheep and a few cattle. We were partners, but, as usual, we didn't live together.

60|$|However, <b>I</b> <b>rented</b> no rooms, but {{returned}} to my own Johnny Upright's street. What with my wife, and babies, and lodgers, and the various cubby-holes into which I had fitted them, my mind's eye had become narrow- angled, and I could not quite take in all of my own room at once. The immensity of it was awe-inspiring. Could this be the room I had rented for six shillings a week? Impossible! But my landlady, {{knocking at the door}} to learn if I were comfortable, dispelled my doubts.|$|E

It is about sixty years old--the oldest house in Four Winds. But it has been kept in pretty good repair, and was all done over about fifteen years ago--shingled, plastered and re-floored. It was well built to begin with. I understand {{that there was some}} romantic story connected with its building, but the man <b>I</b> <b>rented</b> it from didn't know it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's the {{property}} of the Glen St. Mary Presbyterian Church now, and <b>I</b> <b>rented</b> it from the trustees. But it belonged until lately to a very old lady, Miss Elizabeth Russell. She died last spring, and as she had no near relatives she left her property to the Glen St. Mary Church. Her furniture is still in the house, and I bought most of it--for a mere song you might say, because it was all so old-fashioned that the trustees despaired of selling it. Glen St. Mary folks prefer plush brocade and sideboards with mirrors and ornamentations, I fancy. But Miss Russell's furniture is very good and I feel sure you'll like it, Anne." ...|$|E
60|$|All this, however, {{is a mere}} preamble, {{and leads}} {{up to the fact}} that after ten years or so of {{drudgery}} I inherited a legacy which, though small, was sufficient to satisfy my simple wants. Finding myself independent, <b>I</b> <b>rented</b> a quiet house removed from the uproar and bustle of London, and there I settled down with the intention of producing some great work which should single me out from the family of the Smiths, and render my name immortal. To this end I laid in several quires of foolscap, a box of quill pens, and a sixpenny bottle of ink, and having given my housekeeper injunctions to deny me to all visitors, I proceeded to look round for a suitable subject.|$|E

60|$|It was by a mere {{accident}} that I went West, some years ago, {{and settled in}} an active and thriving town {{near one of the}} Great Lakes. The air and bustle and smack of life about the place attracted me, and <b>I</b> <b>rented</b> an office and continued to read law, from force of habit, I suppose. My experience in the service {{of one of the most}} prominent of New York lawyers stood me in good stead, and gradually, in addition to a heterogeneous business of mines and lumber, I began to pick up a few clients. But in all probability I should be still pegging away at mines and lumber, and drawing up occasional leases and contracts, had it not been for Mr. Farquhar Fenelon Cooke, of Philadelphia. Although it has been specifically written that promotion to a young man comes neither from the East nor the West, nor yet from the South, Mr. Cooke arrived from the East, and in the nick of time for me.|$|E
60|$|Many persons {{would like}} to have the society of cats during the summer {{vacation}} in the country, but they deny themselves this pleasure because they think they must either take the cats along when they return to the city, where they would be a trouble and an encumbrance, or leave them in the country, houseless and homeless. These people have no ingenuity, no invention, no wisdom; or it would occur to them to do as I do: rent cats by the month for the summer and return them to their good homes at the end of it. Early last May <b>I</b> <b>rented</b> a kitten of a farmer's wife, by the month; then I got a discount by taking three. They have been good company for about five months now, and are still kittens--at least they have not grown much, and to all intents and purposes are still kittens, and as full of romping energy and enthusiasm {{as they were in the}} beginning. This is remarkable. I am an expert in cats, but I have not seen a kitten keep its kittenhood nearly so long before.|$|E
60|$|The regimental bands at {{that day}} were kept up partly by pay from the government, and partly by pay from the regimental fund. There was {{authority}} of law for enlisting {{a certain number}} of men as musicians. So many could receive the pay of non-commissioned officers of the various grades, and the remainder the pay of privates. This would not secure a band leader, nor good players on certain instruments. In garrison there are various ways of keeping up a regimental fund sufficient to give extra pay to musicians, establish libraries and ten-pin alleys, subscribe to magazines and furnish many extra comforts to the men. The best device for supplying the fund is to issue bread to the soldiers instead of flour. The ration used to be eighteen ounces per day of either flour or bread; and one hundred pounds of flour will make one hundred and forty pounds of bread. This saving was purchased by the commissary {{for the benefit of the}} fund. In the emergency the 4th infantry was laboring under, <b>I</b> <b>rented</b> a bakery in the city, hired bakers--Mexicans--bought fuel and whatever was necessary, and I also got a contract from the chief commissary of the army for baking a large amount of hard bread. In two months I made more money for the fund than my pay amounted to during the entire war. While stationed at Monterey I had relieved the post fund in the same way. There, however, was no profit except in the saving of flour by converting it into bread.|$|E

40|$|My Supervised Agricultural Experience {{involves}} raising {{wheat and}} growing stocker cattle. My operation consists of about 70 acres of wheat land and 50 acres of grass land I own. In addition, <b>I</b> <b>rent</b> grass {{land in the}} summer and wheat pasture during the winter months from local farmers. I am able to run 65 steers each summer and can manage about 160 steers each winter. These calves are purchased weighing around 400 pounds and are sold when they reach 750 pounds. By using my family’s livestock handling facilities, I receive, process, background and deliver the cattle. The cattle operation is enhanced by a wheat enterprise. I plant hard red winter wheat each fall using a combination of minimum and conventional tillage practices. During the winter months, wheat provides excellent pasture for stocker cattle. Cattle are grazed on my wheat ground and on wheat pasture rented from other area wheat farmers. In early spring, the cattle are removed so the wheat can be harvested for grain. <b>I</b> <b>rent</b> necessary equipment to harvest wheat each summer.
