If homogeneous, unconsolidated materials are assumed, the measured thermal inertias of these deposits imply <b>effective</b> <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> that range from 0. 1 mm to 1 cm, with a modal value of 0. 9 mm. Even though these deposits are coarser and darker than the surrounding terrains and the greater part of the Martian surface, they are not compositionally distinct from materials with similar albedos. It is thought most likely that these features were formed by entrapment of marginally mobile material that can be transported into, but not out of, crater depressions by the wind. Most of the 'splotch' deposits are coarser than the dune-forming materials occurring in the north polar region and inside extreme southern latitude craters; they probably form low, broad zibar dunes or lag deposits. The distribution of intracrater deposits is seen as suggesting that the intracrater features have been buried in the interior of Arabia and that the dust deposit is less extensive at the margins and may currently be expanding...|$|R

Many multithreaded programs provide opportunities for constructive cache sharing, in which concurrently scheduled threads share a largely overlapping working set. In this paper, we compare the performance of two state-of-the-art schedulers proposed for fine-grained multithreaded programs: Parallel Depth First (PDF), which is specifically designed for constructive cache sharing, and Work Stealing (WS), which is a more traditional design. Our experimental results indicate that PDF scheduling yields a 1. 3 – 1. 6 X performance improvement relative to WS for several fine-grain parallel benchmarks on projected future CMP configurations; we also report several issues that may limit the advantage of PDF in certain applications. These results also indicate that PDF more effectively utilizes off-chip bandwidth, making it possible to trade-off on-chip cache for a larger number of cores. Moreover, we find that task granularity {{plays a key role in}} cache performance.

With PAGSs of 22. 3 μm and 37. 0 μm, BF laths with a parallel morphology could be seen, while as the PAGS is increased to 52. 4 μm or 62. 8 μm, more interlocking BF microstructures were observed. Detailed crystallographic analysis identified that intense BF variant selection occurs for the small-grained austenite, {{but due to}} the large austenite grain quantity, and thus the large total austenite grain boundary area per unit volume of the small-grained austenite, with the reduction of PAGS from 62. 8 μm to 22. 3 μm, the <b>effective</b> <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> of the transformed microstructure gradually decreases from 9. 5 μm to 5. 6 μm.

40|$|Although {{there has}} been much {{research}} regarding the effect of austenite deformation on accelerated cooled microstructures in microalloyed steels, there is still a lack of accurate data on boundary densities and effective grain sizes. Previous results observed from optical micrographs are not accurate enough, because, for displacive transformation products, a substantial part of the boundaries have disorientation angles below 15 deg. Therefore, in this research, a niobium microalloyed steel was used and electron backscattering diffraction mappings were performed on all of the transformed microstructures to obtain accurate results on boundary densities and grain refinement. It was found that with strain rising from 0 to 0. 5, a transition from bainitic ferrite to acicular ferrite occurs and the <b>effective</b> <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> reduces from 5. 7 to 3. 1 μm. When further increasing strain from 0. 5 to 0. 7, dynamic recrystallization was triggered and postdynamic softening occurred during the accelerated cooling, leading to an inhomogeneous and coarse transformed microstructure. In the entire strain range, the density changes of boundaries with different disorientation angles are distinct, due to different boundary formation mechanisms. Finally, the controversial influence of austenite deformation on <b>effective</b> <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> of low-temperature transformation products was argued {{to be related to the}} differences in transformation conditions and final microstructures...|$|E

For example, populations with dominantly superparamagnetic (SP) or multidomain (MD) grains both are characterized by low remanence and coercivity, and distinguishing these endmembers may provide valuable clues to the origin of magnetization in the intervening stable single domain (SD) size range. The natural <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> variations associated with variable cooling rates in submarine lavas provide a rare opportunity for examining progressive changes in average magnetic <b>grain</b> <b>size,</b> from SP–SD mixtures in submarine basaltic glass to SD–MD mixtures in flow interiors. Based on microanalysis and rock magnetic measurements on pillow basalt samples dredged from the flanks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (ages < 1 Ma to 70 Ma), a model of preferential dissolution with time of the finest-grained titanomagnetites has recently been suggested as the major process contributing to long-term temporal changes in remanent intensity of mid-ocean ridge basalts.

This paper aims to establish a new critical <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>effective</b> for Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM +) data. The influence of water content and topography on the spectral reflectance is also investigated. Tests were undertaken in the Gomso Bay tidal flats, Korea. Critical <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> tests were conducted for particles measuring 0. 0625 mm, 0. 125 mm, and 0. 25 mm, which revealed that a critical <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> of 0. 25 mm rather than 0. 0625 mm was a more effective standard. Surface water and interstitial water content were considered for their influence on optical reflectance, as Landsat ETM + imaging is more responsive of the former. The 5, 7, and 4 ETM + bands responded to surface water cover with a correlation coefficient of 0. 90, 0. 82, and 0. 63, respectively. The interstitial water content related well to <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> with correlation coefficients of - 0. 59 for 0. 0625 mm, - 0. 62 for 0. 125 mm, and - 0. 81 for 0. 25 mm.

In order to compare {{direct quenching}} with conventional quenching, two pre-quench austenite states were studied: a thermomechanically rolled, non-recrystallized, pancaked austenite grain structure and a recrystallized, equiaxed grain structure. Quenched and quenched-and-tempered microstructures were studied using FESEM and FESEM-EBSD. The as-quenched microstructures of the reheated and quenched and direct quenched specimens were fully martensitic and martensitic-bainitic, respectively. In both cases, tempering made the needle-shaped auto-tempered carbides of the as-quenched materials more spherical. In the case of the direct quenched (DQ) material, tempering led to a notable increase in the size of the grain boundary carbides.

Clear differences in distributions of boundary misorientations and <b>effective</b> <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> were noted between upper, lower and granular bainites. Based on these results a new classification scheme and definition of bainite is proposed...|$|E

In this work, 0. 0016 %B can improve hardenability distinctly. The B-steel was mainly composed of bainite at the cooling rate of 3 ℃s- 1, but the Cu-steel completely consisted of bainite when the cooling rate exceed 20 ℃s- 1. The steels manufactured by thermo-mechanical controlled process, test {{results indicated that}} the B-steel had the higher yield and tensile strength than the Cu-steel,because their volume fractions and morphologies of bainite. The Cu-steel had the higher impact energy than the B-steel because of their higher <b>effective</b> <b>grain</b> <b>size.</b> Majority of the precipitation particles which were compounded of Nb and Ti existed as（Nbx,Ti(1 -x)) (CyN(1 -y)) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effects of {{acicular}} ferrite and retained austenite on the mechanical properties of bainite-base steels were investigated. Various morphology and volume fraction of constituent phases {{have been obtained}} by control of hot rolling conditions and alloy compositions. It {{has been shown that}} the steels containing retained austenite have better combinations of strength and ductility than the ones with no retained austenite. However, there is no noticeable change in DBTT by the incorporation of retained austenite in the microstructure since retained austenite exists as fine particles. On the other hand, DBTT of the steels are largely affected by the presence of {{acicular ferrite}} in the microstructure. EBSD analyses of fractured Charpy specimens show that cracks are deflected within the morphological packet of acicular ferrite, indicating its role in reducing the <b>effective</b> <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> of the steels...|$|E
40|$|Potsherds from 7 Venezuelan islands {{have been}} studied using a {{two-fold}} magneto/dielectric technique {{in order to identify}} clay sources and characterize different stages of pottery craftsmanship. This is the first study of archeological material using this technique. Petrographic analyses appear to agree with the clusters of data identified in scatter plots of initial magnetic susceptibility versus saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM), and natural remanent magnetization (NRM). Thus, these magnetic parameters appear to be suitable for describing clay source characteristics. <b>Effective</b> magnetic <b>grain</b> <b>sizes,</b> investigated via stability analyses of SIRM and anystheretic remanent magnetization (ARM) upon alternating field (AF) demagnetization, and SIRM acquisition and AF demagnetization crossover plots, seem to be related to different steps of pottery craftsmanship, namely clay preparation, finishing and firing. Thermomagnetic curves might also provide valuable information about original firing conditions. A scatter plot of SIRMs intersections versus maximum current depolarization temperatures and average activation energies, shows a coarse correlation due perhaps to the fact that these rock magnetic and dielectric data are both associated to pore-related features.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of a ring of warm dust in the edge-on disk surrounding HD 32297 with the Gemini-N/MICHELLE mid-infrared imager. Our N'-band image shows elongated structure consistent with {{the orientation of the}} scattered-light disk. The Fnu(11. 2 um) = 49. 9 +/- 2. 1 mJy flux is significantly above the 28. 2 +/- 0. 6 mJy photosphere. Subtraction of the stellar point spread function reveals a bilobed structure with peaks 0. 5 "- 0. 6 " from the star. An analysis of the stellar component of the SED suggests a spectral type later than A 0, in contrast to commonly cited literature values. We fit three-dimensional, single-size grain models of an optically thin dust ring to our image and the SED using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a Bayesian framework. The best-fit <b>effective</b> <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> are submicron, suggesting the same dust population is responsible for the bulk of the scattered light. The inner boundary of the warm dust is located 0. 5 "- 0. 7 " (~ 65 AU) from the star, which is approximately cospatial with the outer boundary of the scattered-light asymmetry inward of 0. 5 ". The addition of a separate component of larger, cooler grains that provide a portion of the 60 um flux improves both the fidelity of the model fit and consistency with the slopes of the scattered-light brightness profiles. Previous indirect estimates of the stellar age (~ 30 Myr) indicate the dust is composed of debris. The peak vertical optical depths in our models (~ 0. 3 - 1 x 1 e- 2) imply that grain-grain collisions likely {{play a significant role in}} dust dynamics and evolution. Submicron grains can survive radiation pressure blow-out if they are icy and porous. Similarly, the inferred warm temperatures (130 - 200 K) suggest that ice sublimation may play a role in truncating the inner disk. Comment: ApJ accepted, 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
