For the food concept itself, he resorted mainly to Maximilian Bircher-Benner's publications. Kollath classified all foods into six value levels.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{influence of}} degree processing for {{parameters of the}} structure and properties of products after hot rolling of continuous ingots made of low carbon steels. Design/methodology/approach: Ingots with cross sections of 105 x 105 mm and 135 x 135 mm were rolled to wire rod and bars respectively, with applying the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> λ = 6. 5 - 115 and λ= 3 - 14. Tests of the microstructure parameters and their distributions were carried out on a SEM HITACHI S- 4200, using the Met-Ilo computer application. Findings: Parameters of the structure and properties of steel after hot rolling of a continuous ingot made of low-carbon steel and after air-cooling, significantly depend on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing.</b> After the hot rolling process of the continuous ingots of steel of S 355 J 2 grade {{within the range of}} the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> λ = 2. 97 - 14. 15, a structure of ferritic-pearlitic steel with heterogeneous distribution on the cross-section was revealed. Practical implications: A good quality of products after hot rolling is obtain for minimal <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> which will ensure obtaining an advantageous structure and properties. Originality/value: The finding of the quantitative relations between the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> the structure and properties allows for predicting the minimal value of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> which should guarantee obtaining the required structural features and consequently, product’s functional properties...|$|E

However the composition of these glycans, including that arising from different host cells, has not been determined. Here we determined the chemical composition of the glycans from the prototypic alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus, propagated in both arthropod and rodent cell lines, by using ion-mobility mass spectrometry and collision-induced dissociation analysis. We observe that both the membrane-proximal E 1 fusion glycoprotein and the protruding E 2 attachment glycoprotein display heterogeneous glycosylation that contains N-linked glycans exhibiting both limited and extensive processing. However, E 1 contained predominantly highly processed glycan...|$|R
40|$|Demolition waste materials, such as crushed {{concrete}} and bricks, have been utilised by the UK construction industry for {{applications such as}} the production of concrete, low level backfill and road subbase. There has been increased research on {{the properties of the}} recycled aggregates in the past decade but it mainly concentrates on the strength of these types of materials through shear box and triaxial tests. Little research has been undertaken on the physical properties of recycled materials, such as particle shape, water absorption and freeze-thaw resistance.

It presents the physical characteristics of three types of commercially crushed {{concrete and}} brick materials, two of them being similarly based crushed concrete materials with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> and one being crushed brick. Characteristics such as particle size distribution, particle shape, large scale compaction, resistance to freeze-thaw and aggregate impact and crushing values were established.

40|$|A {{political}} economy model of protection {{is used to}} determine endogenously the inter-sectoral patterns of protection. Three propositions are derived {{that are consistent with}} the stylized patterns of tariff protection in rich and poor countries: Nominal protection rates escalate with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> protection is higher on average in poor countries, and rich countries protect agriculture relatively more than they protect manufacturing, whereas poor countries do the reverse. Numerical simulations for archetypal rich and poor economies confirm that the endogenously determined struc-ture of protection is broadly consistent with observed patterns of protection. Tariff protection in rich and poor countries displays several stylized patterns. Three stand out as particularly robust. First, nominal rates of protection escalate with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> which contributes to the widely observed escalation of effective rates of protection with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing.</b> Second, protection is higher on average in poor countries. Third, rich countries protect agriculture more than they do manufactures, whereas poor countries do the reverse. Until recently, analysts explained these patterns of protection largely by calling on the theory of second best. They pointed out, for example, that in rich countries farming provides a groomed landscape that benefits the whole population. 1 In poor countries high trade taxes (including taxation of agriculture) are justified by the revenue constraint that because of weak fiscal administration cannot be met by less distortionary instruments. In turn, protection of manufacturing has been justified on infant-industry grounds. In each case, second-best considerations provided efficiency-based arguments justifying protection...|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that {{increasing}} the number of neutral stimuli in a display decreases distractor interference. This result has been interpreted within two different frameworks; a perceptual load account, based on a reduction in spare resources, and a dilution account, based on a degradation in distractor representation and/or an increase in crosstalk between the distractor and the neutral stimuli that contain visually similar features. In four experiments, we systematically manipulated the extent of attentional focus, stimulus category, and preknowledge of the target to examine how these factors would interact with the display set size to influence the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> distractor <b>processing.</b> Display set size did not affect the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> distractor <b>processing</b> in all situations. Increasing the number of neutral items decreased distractor processing only when a task induced a broad attentional focus that included the neutral stimuli, when the neutral stimuli were in the same category as the target and distractor, and when the preknowledge of the target was insufficient to guide attention to the target efficiently. These results suggest that the effect of neutral stimuli on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> distractor <b>processing</b> is more complex than previously assumed.
