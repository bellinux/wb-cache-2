25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of walking, including bushwalking, racewalking, beach walking, hillwalking, volksmarching, Nordic walking, trekking and hiking. Some people prefer to walk indoors on a treadmill, or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count their steps. Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or <b>just</b> <b>walking</b> in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. Snow shoeing is walking in snow; a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{resulted in}} {{pressure on the}} new Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone, who agreed to review the cases of twenty-four stateless people in immigration detention, and ultimately granted bridging visas to nine people including Al-Kateb, allowing them to be released into the community. However, {{the conditions of the}} bridging visas did not permit holders to work, study, obtain social security benefits or receive healthcare from Medicare, and Al-Kateb remained entirely dependent on donations from friends and supporters to survive. Al-Kateb said of his situation, [...] "We [...] <b>just</b> <b>walking</b> in a big detention. And we are all the time worried that they will send us back to detention again… It's like a death punishment." [...] He was granted a permanent visa in October 2007 by immigration minister Kevin Andrews.|$|E
500|$|For the adaptation, certain visual {{changes were}} made from the novel. Smith {{explained}} that one change involved {{the discovery of the}} crashed plane; his script had the character Lou Chambers [...] "throwing [...] snowball to uncover the plane... In the book, they're <b>just</b> <b>walking</b> and they find it." [...] Rudin wanted to change the focus of the story to Hank and Jacob, and ordered Smith to shorten the screenplay to 120 pages. Smith explained, [...] "I had to work to make Hank a more rational character, less evil." [...] The shortening of the script also resulted in the character of Sarah having a smaller role, and Jacob having a larger role than in the book. After the role of Jacob was secured by Billy Bob Thornton, Smith omitted the character's overweight appearance from the novel. Smith described the film adaptation as being less violent than the book, explaining that it was Raimi's decision [...] "to be more restrained [...] bring out the characters." ...|$|E

500|$|In late October 1960, The Beatles left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, as Eckhorn {{offered the}} group more money, a better PA (with reverb and echo) and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep (above the club itself) although by doing so the group broke their contract with Koschmider. Koschmider then reported Harrison for working under the legal age limit (even though he had been working at Koschmider's club) and Harrison was deported on 21 November 1960. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney and Best found a condom in their luggage, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set fire to it. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. McCartney: [...] "One evening we were <b>just</b> <b>walking</b> down the Reeperbahn, when we heard this 'ta-ti-ti-ta', and then 'Komm mit mir!' ('Come with me!')".|$|E
500|$|Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics.com {{repeated}} many of {{the same}} sentiments in his review of the film. He hated the characters within the first five minutes of the film and found himself wishing that the film had shown more of the bear <b>just</b> <b>walking</b> in the woods rather than the characters talking with one another between the attacks. Matt Gamble of UGO Entertainment was excited by the film's cover, but was also quickly disappointed by [...] "insipid dialog" [...] amongst the characters and their continuously calling each other [...] "dude." [...] The characters actually asking what a bear was doing in the Canadian wilderness, where bears are plentiful, amused him, though he notes that it was probably not the intended reaction for the scene. His final rating of the film was an [...] "F." [...] DVD Verdict's David Johnson also questioned why the bear and actors are never seen on screen together. He derided the scenes in which the bear would make a swiping motion, and the scene would cut to show a character flying through the air: [...] "I don't know how the bear mastered the art of jujitsu in the wild, but it comes in handy when four teenagers snuff your cub and they need a healthy dose of comeuppance." [...] He also wondered at the lack of fake blood or props being used during attacks rather than [...] "ridiculous blood splatter computer graphics tossed on the screen." [...] Multiple critics noted that the film introduced two potentially interesting subplots that ended up being pointless as the film never explored either, and they all agreed that the film had excellent picture quality.|$|E

In a March 2012 edition of the program, Today played a recording of Zimmerman saying, [...] "This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black." [...] However, several seconds of the call were cut from the 911 tape, removing Zimmerman's description of Martin, and a question asked to him about the teenager by the 911 operator.

2500|$|By 23 June, {{a larger}} battle {{south of the}} state capital, Wau town, broke out between SPLA and SPLM-IO, the latter {{claiming}} to fight {{in order to protect}} the local Fertit people from attacks by the Dinka-dominated SPLA. As result of the increasing violence, a state of emergency was declared in Wau town, and the SPLA's 5th Division moved in, officially to prevent further escalation of violence. These forces were under the command of Lt. Gen. Gabriel Jok Riak, who had been accused of human rights abuses by the United Nations during the South Sudanese Civil War. Governor Waya initially claimed to support the emergency declaration, stating [...] "All who are here are rebels, so the Division [...] SPLA is ready and even those who are <b>just</b> <b>walking</b> around are ready". However, opposition groups claimed that the army soon began to plunder the state capital, and to assault the civilian population, leading Governor Waya to criticise the soldiers. Soon thereafter, on 24 June 2016, President Kiir unexpectedly sacked Waya, and just a few hours later, had him arrested. A local SPLA commander declared that Waya had been arrested because he was responsible for the deteriorating situation in the state, claiming that he had no respect for the military and talked [...] "nonsense". A few days later, a document began to circulate on the internet that claimed that Lt. Gen. Mangar Buong Aluenge of the SPLA had plotted from the very beginning to remove and arrest Waya, while the Society for Threatened Peoples believed that Waya's criticism of the army had led to his arrest.|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversy}} over the tactics used by the MCPD ensued, with reports of officers walking down I-270 between stopped cars with weapons drawn, telling people {{to get back in}} their vehicles, and demanding commuters pop their trunks without any explanation why.

Chief Thomas Manger defended the MCPD's actions, stating that they were justified under exigent circumstances. Don Troop, a man who witnessed the incident, told the Washington Post that a group of officers made its way to his car and other cars around him. [...] "They were <b>just</b> <b>walking</b> along saying: 'Pop the trunk! Pop the trunk!'" [...] Troop said he overheard a man in a truck next to him call out to another motorist: [...] "The police are looking for bank robbers." [...] A short time later, about nine officers approached his car — including state troopers, county police officers, and at least one plainclothes officer. Among the commands given to motorists by officers were: [...] "stay in your car", [...] "pop the trunk", [...] "get your hands on the steering wheel", and [...] "get you hands up where we can see them", according to Troop. Corporal Aaron Smith, a pilot flying a Prince George's County police helicopter dispatched to assist stated that he [...] "saw that they were searching traffic and going vehicle to vehicle." [...] MCPD spokesman Captain Paul Starks described the incident as a [...] "systematic check of trunks and rear hitches" [...] of detained vehicles.|$|E
