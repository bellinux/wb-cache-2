40|$|It {{seems to}} me that there were hardly any central policy about the private forests during the Meiji Era, {{especially}} before the enactment of the forest law in 1897, except the policy "the Kanminyu-kubun" (the policy for the classification of the ownership). But this condition should be ascribed to the fact that the whole forest all over the country had not been as yet placed under the immediate control of the central government (the Forestry Bureau). Therefore, concerning with the forestry-policies of these days, we must inquire into the mutual relations between the central and the prefectural authorities, and survey policies of the prefectural authorities rather than those of the central government. The prefectural authorities had actively aided the local movements, which were beginning to take place among the private owners, by controlling the forests owned in common and formating the local forestry associations, on the pretext of the protection of the forests. These policies associated with the interests of the private owners as far as preventing the devastation of the forests by fire, reckless deforestation, or secret felling of the trees. That is a reason why a great quantity of the forests had decayed in these days. According to the opinion of the prefectural authorities, the cause of the devastation of the forests dependend on the lack of the governmental control since the earlier days of the Meiji Era. But properly speaking, it was not ascribed to the lack of the control, but the governmental policies concerning with administration of the state forests-the sale of the state forests or above all the actual exclusion of the customary usufruct of poor peasants, etc. Notwithstanding, the local authorities had seen the real cause of the <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> <b>forests</b> in the lack of the control and made use of the movements among the private owners in order to administrate of the state forests...|$|E

50|$|The Tana River red colobus {{is located}} {{only on a}} very small section of the world. Its current endangerment is caused by habitat loss and {{persecution}} by humans. Tropical forests are constantly being cut down, causing the destruction of habitat for the red colobus. Cultivation {{of the land and}} the creation of levees and dykes have had the most devastating impact. Both human creations involve partial or complete forest clearing resulting in further <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> patches.

A survey conducted in 1987 concluded that since 1975 there has been approximately an 80% decline in the numbers of Tana River Colobus monkeys. Habitat disturbances, changing farming practices, and the altering course of the river were found to be the main reasons for endangerment. Another developing threat to the Tana River Red Colobus is the introduction of parasitic diseases to their habitats.

This study was done by the interpretation of aerial-photographs of Haruno town taken in 1962 and 1998.

The few autochthonous cases of Chagas disease encountered in Espírito Santo have been attributed to adult specimens of Triatoma vitticeps that invade houses from forest remnants. In recent years, the entomology unit of the Espírito Santo State Health Secretariat has recorded nymphs infected with flagellates similar to Trypanosoma cruzi in rural localities. Entomological surveys were carried out in the residences and outbuildings in which the insects were found, and serological examinations for Chagas disease performed on the inhabitants.

40|$|High-resolution palynofloral {{signatures}} {{through the}} Cretaceous–Palaeogene boundary succession show several features {{in common with}} the Permian–Triassic transition but there are also important differences. Southern Hemisphere Cretaceous–Palaeogene successions, to date studied at high resolution only in New Zealand, reveal a diverse palynoflora abruptly replaced by fungi-dominated assemblages that are in turn succeeded by low diversity suites dominated by fern spores, then gymnosperm- and angiosperm-dominated palynofloras of equivalent diversity to those of the Late Cretaceous. This palynofloral signature is interpreted to represent instantaneous (days to months) destruction <b>of</b> diverse <b>forest</b> communities associated with the Chicxulub impact event. The pattern of palynofloral change suggests wholesale collapse of vascular plant communities and short-term proliferation of saprotrophs followed by relatively rapid successional recovery of pteridophyte and seed–plant communities. The Permian–Triassic transition records global <b>devastation</b> <b>of</b> gymnosperm-dominated <b>forests</b> in a short zone synchronous with one or more peaks of the fungal/algal palynomorph Reduviasporonites. This zone is typically succeeded by assemblages rich in lycophyte spores and/or acritarchs. Higher in the succession, these assemblages give way to diverse palynofloras dominated by new groups of gymnosperms. Although different plant families were involved in the mass-extinctions, the general pattern of extinction and recovery is consistent between both events. The major difference is the longer duration for each phase of the Triassic recovery vegetation compared to that of the Paleocene. The protracted extinction-recovery succession at the Permian–Triassic boundary is incompatible with an instantaneous causal mechanism such as an impact of a celestial body but is consistent with hypotheses invoking extended environmental perturbations through flood-basalt volcanism and release of methane from continental shelf sediments...|$|R
