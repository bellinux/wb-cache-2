40|$|Sulfur-rich nickel metalloenzymes {{are capable}} of {{stabilizing}} Ni I and Ni III oxidation states in catalytically relevant species. In an effort {{to better understand the}} structural and electronic features that allow the stabilization of such species, we have investigated the electrochemical properties of two mononuclear N 2 S 2 <b>Ni</b> <b>II</b> <b>complexes</b> that differ in their sulfur environment. Complex 1 features aliphatic dithiolate coordination ([NiL], 1), and complex 2 I is characterized by mixed thiolate/thioether coordination ([NiL Me]I, 2 I). The latter results from the methylation of a single sulfur of 1. The X-ray structure of 2 I reveals a distorted square planar geometry around the <b>Ni</b> <b>II</b> ion, similar to what was previously reported by us for 1. The electrochemical investigation of 1 and 2 + shows that the addition of a methyl group shifts the potentials of both redox <b>Ni</b> <b>II</b> /Ni I and <b>Ni</b> III /Ni <b>II</b> redox couples by about 0. 7 and 0. 6 V to more positive values. Through bulk electrolyses, only the mononuclear dithiolate [Ni I L] − (1 -) and the mixed thiolate/thioether [Ni III L Me] 2 + (2 2 +) complexes were generated, and their electronic properties were investigated by UV−vis and EPR spectroscopy. For 1 - (Ni I, d 9 configuration) the EPR data are consistent with a d x 2 -y 2 based singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs). However, DFT calculations suggest that there is also pronounced radical character. This is consistent with the small g- anisotropy observed in the EPR experiments. The spin population (Mulliken analysis) analysis of 1 - reveals that the main contribution to the SOMO (64 %) is due to the bipyridine unit. Time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations attribute the most prominent features observed in the electronic absorption spectrum of 1 - to metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions. Concerning 2 2 +, the EPR spectrum displays a rhombic signal with g x = 2. 236, g y = 2. 180, and g z = 2. 039 in CH 3 CN. The giso value is larger than 2. 0, which is consistent with metal based oxidation. The unpaired electron (Ni III, d 7 configuration) occupies a Ni-d z 2 based molecular orbital, consistent with DFT calculations. Nitrogen hyperfine structure is observed as a triplet in the gz component of the EPR spectrum with A N = 51 MHz. This result indicates the coordination of a CH 3 CN molecule in the axial position. DFT calculations confirm that the presence of a fifth ligand in the coordination sphere of the Ni ion is required for the metal-based oxidation process.

The structural analysis reveals that the dimeric complexes [Ni- 2 (L) (2) (OAc) (2) ] in cocrystal 3 and in compound 1 are almost identical-in both complexes, the Ni(II) ions possess a distorted octahedral geometry formed by the chelating tridentate ligand (L), a chelating acetate ion, and a bridging phenoxo group with very similar bond angles and distances. On the other hand, compound 2 and the trinuclear complex in the cocrystal 3 show a similar linear centrosymmetric structure with the tridentate ligand coordinated to the terminal Ni(II) and linked to the central Ni(II) by phenoxo and carboxylate bridges.

Sci. U. S. A. 2006, 103, 14901 - 14906). To further understand their biological efficacy, we report the characterization and activity of their Mn ii,Co iii,Ni ii,Cu ii, and Zn <b>ii</b> <b>complexes.</b> The X-ray crystal structures of four divalent (Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and one trivalent (Fe) complexes are reported. Electrochemistry shows the Fe iii/ii and Cu ii/i potentials of the complexes may be redox-active within cells. Stability constants were also determined for the Mn <b>ii,</b> <b>Ni</b> ii,Cu <b>ii,</b> and Zn <b>ii</b> <b>complexes.</b> All divalent complexes underwent transmetalation upon encountering Fe ii,to form low spin ferrous complexes. Importantly, the divalent Mn II,Ni II,Cu II, and Zn <b>II</b> <b>complexes</b> of the HDpT analogues are equally active in preventing proliferation as their ligands, suggesting the complexes act as lipophilic vehicles facilitating intracellular delivery of the free ligand upon metal dissociation. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to prepare {{potentially}} cheaper carbon for the adsorptive removal of Nickle [Ni (II) ] from aqueous solution. The adsorption capacity of the prepared carbon to remove <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> from aqueous solution was determined and adsorption mechanism was investigated. Rice husk carbon was prepared by incineration in a muffle furnace. The incinerated rice husk carbon (IRHC) was characterised in terms of surface area, micropore area, micropore volume, average pore diameter and surface morphology. Adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> by IRHC was examined. The influence of operating parameters, namely, pH, initial concentration and contact time on adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> by IRHC was evaluated. Batch adsorption tests showed that extent of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> adsorption depended on initial concentration, contact time and pH. Equilibrium adsorption was achieved in 120 min, while maximum <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> adsorption occurred at pH 4. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were studied and the equilibrium adsorption data was found to fit well with the Langmuir isotherm model. Langmuir constants Q ° and b were 14. 45 and 0. 10, and Freundlich constants Kf and 1 /n were 4. 0 and 0. 26, respectively. Adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> by IRHC followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Being a low-cost carbon, IRHC has potential to be used for the adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> from aqueous solution and wastewater in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe removal {{efficiency}} of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> ions from aqueous solution using regenerated cellulose was studied. The effects of solution pH, time, initial metal concentration and adsorbent dosage on metal adsorption efficiency were investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) {{was applied to}} predict {{the behavior of the}} system. Based on the developed model, pH was found to be the main factor which had the highest influence on <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> {{removal efficiency}}. It was observed that an increase in the pH from 3. 75 to 7. 25 resulted in a 51. 6 % increase in <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> removal efficiency. Additionally, the time and adsorbent dosage were found to have positive influence on metal removal efficiency while <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> removal efficiency reduced with initial metal concentration. The optimization of the integral main factors was performed. The suggested optimum values for pH, time, initial metal concentration, adsorbent dosage and <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> removal efficiency were 6. 4, 175. 27 min, 32. 5 ppm, 0. 4 g and 98 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In this work, old {{newspaper}} fibers (ONF) bleached with H 2 O 2, {{treated with}} KOH and treatedwith NaOCl were investigated as potential adsorbents. The {{characterization of the}} produced fibers using FTIR,SEM and particle size distribution {{have been carried out}} and tested for the removal of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> from aqueoussolutions. The results indicated that the fibers treated with KOH give the highest %removal of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> with 88 %. Two different reactor designs (batch and basket reactor) with different variables were studied. The results indicated that the equilibrium time was 30 min. and the removal of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> increased significantly as the pH increased from 2. 0 to 6. 0 and decreased at pH range of 6. 5 – 8. 0. The adsorption of <b>Ni</b> (<b>II)</b> onto ONF treatedwith KOH using batch and basket reactors follows the Langmuir isotherm.
