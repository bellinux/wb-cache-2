Correlated earthquakes are earthquakes that occur {{within a few}} kilometers of one another and have similar focal mechanisms, thus generating similar waveforms, allowing {{measurements to be made}} via cross-correlation analysis. The waveform database was obtained from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center and includes about 15 million seismograms from 225, 000 local earthquakes between 1984 and 2003. A total of 26 billion cross-correlation measurements were performed on a 32 -node (64 processor) Linux cluster, using improved analysis tools. All event pairs with separation distances of 5 km or less were processed at all stations that recorded the pair. We computed a total of about 1. 7 billion P-wave <b>differential</b> <b>times</b> from pairs of waveforms that had crosscorrelation coefficients (CC) of 0. 6 or larger. The P-wave <b>differential</b> <b>times</b> are often on the order of a factor of ten to a hundred times more accurate than those obtained from routinely picked phase onsets. 1. 2 billion S-wave <b>differential</b> <b>times</b> were measured with CC � 0. 6, a phase not routinely picked at the Northern California Seismic Network because of the noise level of remaining P coda. We found that approximately 95 % of the seismicity includes events that have cross-correlation coefficients of CC � 0. 7 with at least one other event recorded at four or more stations. At some stations more than 40 % of the recorded events are similar at the CC � 0. 9 level, indicating the potential existence of large numbers of repeating earthquakes. Large numbers of correlated events occur in different tectonic regions, including the San Andreas Fault, Long Valley caldera, Geysers geothermal field and Mendocino triple junction. Future research using these data may substantially improve earthquake locations and add insight into the velocity structure in the crust...|$|R

5000|$|One {{technique}} measures {{a distance}} {{by using the}} difference {{in the power of the}} received signal strength (RSSI) as compared to the originating signal strength. Another technique uses the time of arrival (TOA), when the time of transmission and speed of propagation are known. Combining TOA data from several receivers at different known locations (time difference of arrival, TDOA) can provide an estimate of position even in the absence of knowledge of the time of transmission. The angle of arrival (AOA) at a receiving station can be determined by the use of a directional antenna, or by <b>differential</b> <b>time</b> of arrival at an array of antennas with known location. AOA information may be combined with distance estimates from the techniques previously described to establish the location of a transmitter or backscatterer.

50|$|Many {{communication}} satellites share a given frequency band. As a signal is transmitted {{to a particular}} satellite there is some amount of side lobe or spillover energy that is transmitted to adjacent satellites. At a receive station that has two antennas, one pointed at the primary satellite (the satellite the signal is intended for) and a secondary satellite (a satellite that is receiving side lobe energy), both paths of the signal are received and measured. From a comparison of those paths, two measurements can be made: <b>Differential</b> <b>Time</b> Offset (DTO) and Differential Frequency Offset (DFO). These measurements are often implemented through correlation processing. DTO represents the difference in time that it takes the signal to travel through the two satellites, while DFO represents the difference in frequency the received signals present through the two satellites. The frequency differences observed are due to different Doppler shift resulting from relative satellite motion and differences in the translation frequencies of the two satellite channels. Channel translation frequencies and downlink Doppler shift and delay can be calibrated out of the measurements by observing transmitters of known location simultaneously on the channels. This leaves the uplink DTO and DFO as the observables. See 'Reference Signals' below.|$|E
