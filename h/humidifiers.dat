40|$|Introduction: <b>Humidifier</b> is {{a device}} for {{delivering}} oxygen to the patients. Before using it, the <b>humidifier</b> tube should fill with sterile water. There {{was a recent}} study that administering oxygen less than five liter per minutes, the tube was not load with the sterile water. This research aim was to describe the difference between bacterial growth in the <b>humidifier</b> and non <b>humidifier</b> at the patient who got oxygen therapy. Method: The design was the analytic survey with purposive sampling method. The samples were 24 patients. They {{were divided into two}} groups. Group one, consisted of 12 patients with <b>humidifier</b> and the others with non <b>humidifier.</b> The instrument was culture equipments diagnostic test and observation guidance. The hypothesis was there was no difference bacterial growth existence in <b>humidifier</b> and non <b>humidifier</b> at the patient who got oxygen therapy. Result: The results showed that there was no significance difference of bacterial growth at time of zero hour (p= 0. 131). Meanwhile, there was significance different of bacterial growth at time of 12 hour (p= 0. 046), and time of 24 hour (p= 0. 046). There was also significance different between bacterial growth in <b>humidifier</b> and non <b>humidifier</b> at the patient who got oxygen therapy (p= 0. 010). Discussion : The conclusion is a non <b>humidifier</b> device could prevent bacterial and reduce nosocomial infection. It was recommended that hospital should use non <b>humidifier</b> and the <b>humidifier</b> had to disinfect and change the water every 12 hours...|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} {{isolates}} of L. jordanis {{were from the}} waters of the Jordan River in Indiana. The strain was designated as BL-540. This area of the river was near an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, which is caused by L. pneumonphila. Another isolate was found in sewage located in DeKalb County, Georgia. This strain was designated as ABB-9. Legionella species are aquatic organisms and typically inhabit freshwater environments with humans being accidental hosts. Most isolates of Legionella have been from air-conditioning cooling towers and potable-water distribution systems, but they can also be found in other thermally polluted water sources such as air conditioners, spa equipment, fountains, <b>humidifiers,</b> or showers. They can also be collected on the surfaces of lakes, mud, and streams. They can grow in temperatures ranging from 5 to 63°C; optimal growth occurs between 25 and 40°C.|$|E

40|$|Background: Nontuberculous {{mycobacteria}} {{are well}} {{known to be a}} cause of hot tub lung, however, to our knowledge, there exists no case report of <b>humidifier</b> lung induced by mycobacteria.

40|$|In South Korea, {{a cluster}} of acute lung disease {{patients}} included lung injury disease suspected of being caused {{by the use of}} <b>humidifier</b> disinfectants. We examined the relationship between <b>humidifier</b> disinfectant exposure and clinically diagnosed <b>humidifier</b> disinfectant-associated lung injury (HDLI) in a family-based study. This case-control study included 169 clinically confirmed HDLI cases and 303 family controls who lived with the HDLI patients. A range of information on exposure to <b>humidifier</b> disinfectants was obtained using a structured questionnaire and field investigations. Odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models that were adjusted for age, sex, presence of a factory within 1 km of residence, and the number of household chemical products used. HDLI risk increased approximately two-fold or more among the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile in terms of the hours sleeping in a room with an operating <b>humidifier</b> treated with disinfectant (adjusted OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 3. 7), average hours of disinfectant-treated <b>humidifier</b> use per day (adjusted OR = 2. 1, 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 4. 5), airborne disinfectant intensity (adjusted OR = 2. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 2 - 5. 3), and cumulative disinfectant inhalation level (adjusted OR = 2. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 0 - 4. 1).
