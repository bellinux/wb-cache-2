5|$|Although {{it is rare}} on Earth, helium <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>most</b> {{abundant}} {{element in}} the known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is the 15th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, and the fourth {{most abundant}} element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element {{to serve as a}} common element of all known life. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>most</b> abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>most</b> {{palatable}} grain. It provides {{twice as}} much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, {{it is easy to}} over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E

5|$|English (American English) is the {{de facto}} {{national}} language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>most</b> common language and the most widely taught second language. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, {{as it is in}} 32 states.|$|E
5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>most</b> popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} lightest element and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>most</b> {{abundant}} in the observable universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created {{as a result of}} the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.|$|E

The block is surrounded by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Metro Rail light rail rapid transit to the west, which runs above-ground along Main Street in what is called the Free Fare Zone, Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (a one-way westbound continuation of Broadway) and Lafayette Square to the south (a one-way eastbound connection to Clinton Street).|$|E

It also holds the International Meeting of Póvoa de Varzim, in long course pool, part of the European winter calendar. The other complex is property of Clube Desportivo da Póvoa. The site also offers swimming lessons and some swimming pools, including a heated saltwater swimming pool filled with Póvoa de Varzim's seawater.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal energy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>most</b> used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia but represents less than 1% of the total energy production. The first geothermal power plant in Russia was built at Pauzhetka, Kamchatka, in 1966, with a capacity of 5MW. The total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79MW, with 50MW coming from a plant at Verkhne-Mutnovsky. Russia is currently developing a 100MW plant at Mutnovsky and a 50MW plant in Kaliningrad. Most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the North Caucasus and Kamchatka. Half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings, one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13% is used for industrial processes.|$|E

5|$|If the {{compressed}} {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The air may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>most</b> common cause of death while diving (drowning being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of cases diagnosed as AGE, with approximate estimates of frequency.|$|E
