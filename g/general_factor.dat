25|$|Spearman's {{argument}} {{proposing a}} <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> of human intelligence is still accepted in principle by many psychometricians. Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, {{where there are}} {{a large number of}} narrow factors {{at the bottom of the}} hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the g factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks. However, this view is not universally accepted; other factor analyses of the data, with different results, are possible. Some psychometricians regard g as a statistical artifact.|$|E

According to Gould, Jensen uses heritability to measure differences between populations.

Background: There is considerable debate about the underlying factor structure of the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL: SV). An established view is that it reflects a unitary construct underpinned by two correlated factors. More recent research has, however, undermined this conceptualisation. Aims: Our aim was to compare 10 competing models of the PCL: SV in a sample of civil psychiatric patients. Method: Ten distinct factor models were specified and tested using conventional confirmatory factor analytic techniques, along with confirmatory bifactor modelling. Results: A bifactor model, including two <b>general</b> <b>factors</b> (interpersonal-affective and antisocial-lifestyle), and four subordinate factors (interpersonal, affective, antisocial, and lifestyle) provided the best fit to the data. The reliability of the conceptualisation was supported through the use of composite reliability, and the differential relationships exhibited between the <b>general</b> <b>factors</b> and measures of personality, impulsivity, and mental health.

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{published}} {{studies have also}} argued against {{the existence of a}} <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> of personality. For example, Muncer critiqued the study by Rushton and Irwing [...] that claimed to find a <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> of personality based on a reanalysis of Digman's data. Muncer argued that Rushton and Irwing's meta-analysis was unreliable due to heterogeneous correlations between the Big Five factors analysed. Furthermore, the extent of such heterogeneity is strong evidence against the existence of such a <b>general</b> <b>factor.</b> More importantly, Muncer argued, evolutionary theory does not support the existence of a <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> of personality. Evolutionary theory proposes that organisms survive due to the goodness of fit between their characteristics and their environment. Humans have flourished in a diverse range of environments, yet Rushton et al.'s theory proposes that high levels of a single personality dimension have been adaptive throughout all of human evolution which would require a constant environment throughout this evolutionary period. In contrast, many other evolutionary theorists have proposed that environmental heterogeneity actually supports diversity in traits, because given traits may be adaptive in some environments and not in others. Furthermore, {{there is a lack of}} evidence that high levels of a <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> of personality would necessarily confer reproductive advantages. For example, people with antisocial personality traits (hence a low <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> of personality) may have a higher than average number of sexual partners. Furthermore, evolutionary theory suggests that sex differences in personality traits may enhance reproductive success for each sex. Cross-cultural studies have found that women tend to be higher than men on both neuroticism and agreeableness, even though selection for a unitary <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> would mean that high agreeableness would be associated with low neuroticism. Therefore, the existence of a unitary aggregate personality factor appears to be problematic from an evolutionary perspective.|$|E

50|$|Cronbach's alpha {{also has}} a {{theoretical}} relation with factor analysis. As shown by Zinbarg, Revelle, Yovel and Li, alpha may be expressed {{as a function of}} the parameters of the hierarchical factor analysis model which allows for a <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> that is common to all of the items of a measure in addition to group factors that are common to some but not all of the items of a measure. Alpha may be seen to be quite complexly determined from this perspective. That is, alpha is sensitive not only to <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> saturation in a scale but also to group factor saturation and even to variance in the scale scores arising from variability in the factor loadings. Coefficient Ωhierarchical has a much more straightforward interpretation as the proportion of observed variance in the scale scores that is due to the <b>general</b> <b>factor</b> common to all of the items comprising the scale.|$|E

Activation of transcription requires that RNA polymerase both receive regulatory signals from promoter-specific activators and initiate transcription at the correct locations in the genome, the promoters.

40|$|We {{have devised}} a genetic {{strategy}} {{to isolate the}} target of acidic activation domains of transcriptional activators based on toxicity in yeast cells of the chimeric activator, GAL 4 -VP 16. Toxicity required the integrity of both the VP 16 acidic activation domain and the GAL 4 DNA-binding domain, suggesting that inhibition resulted from trapping of <b>general</b> transcription <b>factors</b> at genomic sites. Mutations that break the interaction between GAL 4 -VP 16 and <b>general</b> <b>factors</b> would alleviate toxicity and identify transcriptional adaptors, if adaptors bridged the interaction between activators and <b>general</b> <b>factors.</b> We thus identified ADA 1, ADA 2, and ADA 3. Mutations in ADA 2 reduced the activity of GAL 4 -VP 16 and GCN 4 in vivo. ada 2 mutant extracts exhibited normal basal transcription, but were defective in responding to GAL 4 -VP 16, GCN 4, or the dA:dT activator. Strikingly, the mutant extract responded like wild type to GAL 4 -HAP 4. We conclude that ADA 2 potentiates the activity of one class of acidic activation domain but not a second class...|$|R
50|$|Factor {{analysis}} {{is a family}} of mathematical techniques {{that can be used}} to represent correlations between intelligence tests in terms of a smaller number of variables known as factors.
