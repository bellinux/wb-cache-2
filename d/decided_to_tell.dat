He died under mysterious circumstances on January 17, 1996, after a series of lectures given in late 1995 on topics including the Black Budget and underground alien bases.|$|E
25|$|Despite admitting {{throughout}} {{the work that}} he very regularly used EPO, testosterone pills and patches, and autologous blood transfusions (all banned practices), Hamilton staunchly opposed the sanction, since he had never used the blood of another person. It was speculated that Fuentes and his assistant had mixed the blood of another rider with his. His career in a shambles, he raced for lesser team after his suspension, tested positive for DHEA (in an OTC herbal anti-depressant) and retired. He later {{received a call from}} federal investigator Jeff Novitzky, who wanted to talk to him. He refused and was served a subpoena, whereupon he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> everything. Some former teammates of Lance Armstrong and other witnesses appeared, until the federal government dropped the charges. The USADA took over the investigation under civil law, and Armstrong was ultimately stripped of all his titles from August 1998 onward.

However, he wanted his illness to remain secret and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> few about it. Too weak to travel, Ashman requested that he be allowed {{to work on the}} film's songs from his home, causing Menken and the filmmakers to frequently travel from the film's studio in Burbank, California to his home in New York in order to collaborate with him. Ashman wrote the majority of the song's lyrics from his deathbed. It was later revealed that he viewed the Beast's curse as an allegory for AIDS, and that the mob song 'Kill The Beast' was inspired by public sentiment at the time against AIDS and the gay community.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{first came}} to Genoa City to {{distract}} Paul Williams {{as a favor to}} Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), who wanted to break up Paul and his wife, Christine. Isabella approached Paul at his office with a case against her husband, which he took. Paul gave Isabella shelter, and the two were drawn to each other. Upon the ending of the case, Isabella's past as a call girl came out, but Paul forgave Isabella for lying, and they became even closer. Isabella was keen on leaving the city after the case was over, but both Michael and Paul had their reasons for keeping her in town.

25|$|Elizabeth Graeme married Henry Fergusson on April 21, 1772 {{without her}} father's consent. This caused quite {{a problem for}} the newlyweds. Henry and Elizabeth had been {{introduced}} to each other by Dr. Benjamin Rush, a founding father of Pennsylvania, on December 7, 1771 at one of the salons hosted by Elizabeth and Dr. Graeme. Fergusson was a recent and penniless Scottish Immigrant and he was eleven years younger than Elizabeth. Both of these qualities made him a less than ideal suitor for Elizabeth's hand in marriage and Dr. Graeme forbade that they marry. Four months after they met, Henry and Elizabeth married secretly in Old Swede's Church. Only their close friends attended, including Benjamin Rush, Provost William Smith and his wife. Despite her father's disapproval, Elizabeth had vowed to let her marriage be known. Ironically, the day on which she <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him the news was the day that he suffered his fatal heart attack, with Elizabeth watching him approach Graeme Park through a window of the mansion. Elizabeth was never able to tell of her marriage. She was Dr. Graeme's only living heir, she inherited Graeme Park and by right of marriage Henry Fergusson gained title to the property. With his sudden new fortune Henry Fergusson was able to quickly ascend the Philadelphia society ladder. He traveled to England twice, became director of a prominent Philadelphia library and was awarded the title magistrate in Philadelphia. He was the last magistrate of Philadelphia under British colonial rule. He sailed once more for England in late 1775 just as the American Revolution was beginning to gather steam. He returned to Philadelphia by way of New York City as a loyalist with Sir William Howe commander of the British forces in American. With Howe, Fergusson witnessed the Battle of Brandywine and the occupation of Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign. Fergusson involved his wife in his activities by sending her as a messenger to General George Washington to ask for his surrender and to present a bribe to a major in the Continental Army. Both of these incidents caused the Patriots of Philadelphia to doubt her loyalty. There was no doubt about where Henry Fergusson's loyalties lay. He was found a traitor by the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania and Graeme Park was seized under the Confiscation Act of 1778.|$|E

500|$|... "The Stolen Eagle" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer and co-creator Bruno Heller and directed by Michael Apted, who also directed the following two episodes. Heller said {{the era of the}} Roman Empire was [...] "pivotal in Western history.

[...] He <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story of the series from the perspectives of two common soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo. According to Heller, [...] "They are the only two ordinary soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his book, so the idea was to do a sort of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern take. I essentially took the seed of that idea to try to tell a big historical epic, but from the street level, the everyman's point of view." ...|$|E

He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens."

[...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E

It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting.

500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. When she thought she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E
2500|$|The authors {{aimed to}} restore the power the myths had had for the Greeks, and for {{themselves}} as children.

They hoped while writing the book to present the myths as [...] "a total coherent account of the human situation, the human predicament, and human opportunities." [...] One of the main difficulties they encountered was selecting a sequence of myths from [...] "the enormous expanse" [...] of Greek mythology to form a single story that would increase the power of the work.|$|E

2500|$|After Kerouac {{dropped out}} of Columbia University, he served on several {{different}} sailing vessels before returning to New York to write. [...] He met and mixed with Beat Generation figures Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and Neal Cassady. Between 1947 and 1950, while writing what would become The Town and the City (1950), Kerouac engaged in the road adventures that would form On the Road. Kerouac carried small notebooks, in which much of the text was written as the eventful span of road trips unfurled. He started working {{on the first of}} several versions of the novel as early as 1948, based on experiences during his first long road trip in 1947. However, he remained dissatisfied with the novel. Inspired by a 10000-word rambling letter from his friend Neal Cassady, Kerouac in 1950 outlined the [...] "Essentials of Spontaneous Prose" [...] and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story of his years on the road with Cassady as if writing a letter to a friend in a form that reflected the improvisational fluidity of jazz. In a letter to a student in 1961, Kerouac wrote: [...] "Dean and I were embarked on a journey through post-Whitman America to [...] that America and to [...] the inherent goodness in American man. [...] It was really a story about 2 Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. [...] And we found him." ...|$|E
