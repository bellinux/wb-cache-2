After presenting a series of examples on how various scholars chose to graphically visualize musical performance, this paper shows how the contemplation of the strategies used to visualize performance in ethnomusicological studies can be a fruitful way of reflecting upon various topics, namely 1) the impassable limits of score transcription for understanding music as a performative phenomenon; 2) the analysis of the graphic solutions adopted by the ethnomusicologist as a way to better understand their idea of what the performance is; 3) the role played by technology in promoting new analytical approaches and methodologies; 4) analysis in ethnomusicology as an "artisanal process". </p...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{features}} {{a brief history}} of the transcription-transliteration system which was created {{at the end of the}} 19 th century by the academician Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr on the basis of the Roman al-phabet. Originally devised for the graphic representation of Georgian and Armenian languages, it was then further elaborated and extended in order to be applied to the <b>graphic</b> <b>rendition</b> of all Caucasian languages, which were considered to form a single language family, called Japhetic. Further, in 1926 a variant of it was adapted to the consonant-rich Abkhaz and introduced as its official al-phabet; because of its too complicated character, however, it was replaced two years later by a more sui-table Latin-based alphabet. Like the whole linguistic activity of its creator, this system, which was differently labeled and used in the course of the time (Japhetidological transcription, analytical alphabet, Abkhaz analytical alphabet), offers a quite interesting overview of the epistemological and theoretical issues that were on the agenda in the twenties and thirties. Strongly criticised by famous exponents of Soviet linguistics (among them E. D. Po-livanov and N. F. Yakovlev), the Abkhaz analytical alphabet can be only partially considered as Marr’s personal contribution to the Latinisation movement during the cultural revolution. Our analysis tries to highlight the correlation between the cultural climate change after the October revo-lution and the ideological interpretation and epistemological evolution of Marr’s analytical alphabet...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT ERNESTO BASILE 1857 - 1932 Ettore Sessa Educated in Palermo at the Regia Scuola di Applicazione per Ingegneri e Architetti, {{where he}} began his {{university}} career as an assistant of his father, Giovan Battista Filippo Basile (Palermo 1825 - 1891) holder of the chair of Technical Architecture, Ernesto Basile, after a short assistantship (which started in 1882) at the University chair held by Enrico Guj in Rome, became a professor and later (in 1891) an academic of Technical Architecture first at Rome University (until 1890) and then at Palermo University (basically until his death on August 26, 1932). He was born in Palermo on January 31, 1857 the first of six children - three boys, Alceste and Edoardo were born later, and three girls, Benedetta, Marcella and Maria, born after their father's second marriage, to Alessandra Vasari, the sister of his first wife who died prematurely in 1867. A genuine interpreter, {{in the last two}} decades of the 19 th century, of a problematic eclecticism, well anchored to a leading Sicilian tradition in search of "new architectural systems" (that he had inherited from his father), Ernesto Basile had been considerably motivated, since his debut, by innovative methodological aspirations and a will to meet the most advanced international cultures. An example is offered by the Roman projects of the 1880 s and, the following decade, by Sicilian production (worthy of note, the Ossario di Calatafimi, the fabric complex for the IV National Exposition in Palermo, Villa Bordonaro, Palazzo Francavilla, for its interiors deco¬rations and the furnishings above all, and the kiosks Ribaudo and Vicari in Piazza Verdi). His journalistic output during the years of his collaboration with the review Pensiero ed Arte within the column Letteratura, Arte e Critica was considerable. His articles ranged from theory and treatises to studies of art history and the history of architecture, and criticaI and technical essays. He used the pseudonym "Astragalo" for his serious writings and theoretical essays, which were already symptomatic of both his later scientific production and architectural modes and in which he delineated some of his explanatory variations on the arts. He used the pseudonym "Zambajon" for his social criticism articles, and used "Volando" for his essays. To this latter category belongs the article Arte Accademica e Arte Personale, an early manifesto of a program of the aesthetic reestablishment of a culture of architectural planning and artistic thinking. In 1882 he wrote, in the form of a treatise (not completed, and published in 1891), Architettura: dei suoi principi e del suo rinnovamento in which he rehandled made coherent his ideas on architectural planning and the history of "styles," providing it with numerous architectonic sketches, facade elements, and geometrical shapes that explain the optical relations between straight lines and systems of perspective constructions. Of interest, also, are his dissertations on coeval architectural planning, such as Il Concorso per il Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele in Torino (1879), Sulla costruzione dei teatri: Le dimensioni e l'ordinamento dei palchi in rispondenza al costume italiano (1883), Sui mezzi atti a garantire la sicurez¬za dei teatri in caso d'incendio (1889), and Il Palazzo del Parlamento di Berlino. Notizie storiche, artistiche e tecniche (1889). Among his several memoirs of the bids projects he worked on, he published an article entitled Per il mio progetto del palazzo di Giustizia e per l'Arte (1884) as an answer to the observations on the style he had adopted. Lastly, his essay on Giacomo Serpotta (1656 - 1732) (in R. Lentini, Le sculture e gli stucchi di Giacomo Serpotta, Torino 1911) is remarkable, and one of the first critical and historical revaluations of Sicilian Baroque art, in the style of writings by Gioacchino Di Marzo and Vincenzo Pitini. Defined by the contemporary critics as the pioneer of the national artistic and architectural "renewal" of the years of Belle Époque, Basile achieved his international popularity in the period been 1899 and 1918, principally for some buildings in Palermo, most of them with a definition of the interior spaces (entirely or affecting only the principal guest rooms), such as the Palazzina Paternò, the Villino Florio, the Grand Hòtel villa Igiea, the second Utveggio residence, the complex of pavilions for the First Agricultural Exposition, his house in Via Syracuse, the Villino Fassini, the Villa Deliella, the seat of Cassa di Risparmio, the Kursaal Biondo, the second kiosk Ribaudo, (and a remarkable number of aristocratic chapels) and with such Roman works as the Palazzina Vanoni, the villa of the marquis of Rudinì, the palace of the Chamber of Deputies in Montecitorio, and the Gran Caffè Faraglia (Roma). He successfully participated in the modern international arts and decorations expositions, taking place in Turin (1902) and in Venice (in 1903, 1905 and 1909), as well as the one in Milan (1906), which confirmed his commitment and inventiveness in both the application of the modernist principle of integral architectural planning (applied to several sectors of applied arts, though with a notable prevalence in the furnishing field, the latter leading, beginning in 1899, to the successful association, lasting for little more than a decade, with the renown Palermo furniture factory Golia-Ducrot), and in the aesthetic ideal of the equality of the arts, in whose name he organized an interdisciplinary circle. This involved some of Palermo's best artists in the realization of some of the most meaningful Italian expressions of the "total work of art" (his most assiduous co-workers were the sculptors Antonio Ugo and Gaetano Geraci and the painters Ettore De Maria Bergler, Giuseppe Enea, Rocco Lentini, Luigi Di Giovanni, Michele Cortegiani and Salvatore Gregorietti). The English, German, Austrian and, of course, Italian reviews of the epoch bear testimony to the attention given to his architectural production (and to his singular Sicilian conjugation of the principle of Gesamtkunstwerk) acknowledging, thus, his leading role (in Italy) in the modernity of language and his sensitivity to the new aesthetic taste that replaced 19 th century eclecticism. Concerning this, he was one of the most problematic Italian figures in the transition phase towards the new "artistic sensibility. " Though older than the other protagonists of the Liberty style, he acted with academic authoritativeness with a view to promoting the renewal movement in Italy, and supported the phenomenon in its premature expressions (among the fewest in Europe) by giving birth to a school of the "modern architectural project" (whose best disciples and assistants, besides some qualified protagonists of late Sicilian modernism (see, Ernesto Armò, Francesco Fichera, Saverio Fragapane, Salvatore Benfratel¬lo, Giovan Battista Santangelo, Enrico Calandra, Francesco La Grassa, Salvatore Caronia Roberti, and Giuseppe Samonà). Soon brought back to a mannered current, the school ended up, in the 1920 s, isolating most of its members from the new international orientations of the architectural culture. A process, this latter, parallel to the future of Sicil¬ian society, of whose magnificence (as an exemplar phe¬nomenon of economical and cultural rebirth in the period between the two centuries) Basile had been a subtle and impeccable interpreter.

40|$|Avatars, {{computer}} animation, {{and other}} forms of human-centric computing all potentially require the generation of novel but realistic facial appearance and motion. Such face modeling and animation is currently the province of computer artists. While manually animated computer faces can be quite expressive, they usually fall short of complete realism in their appearance and motion (the recent movie Final Fantasy is one demonstration of {{the current state of the}} art). The manual effort required to model and animate faces also prevents their use in avatars and other contexts where the required behavior is not known in advance. Data-Driven Face Modeling and Animation is a new project that explores the use of facial models made directly from captured data to address the goals of realism and automation. More specifically, a range of typical data (either face shapes or motions) is first captured and manually labeled. A high level model of this data is created. Once this model is available, its parameters can be explored to extrapolate or synthesize novel face shapes or motions. While this general data-driven approach is a recent theme across several research groups, IMSC already has some unique results, as shown below. 3. Project Role in Support of IMSC Strategic Plan Data-Driven Face Modeling and Animation is part of the general IMSC effort towards expressive human interaction in virtual and augmented reality environments. It is one of a trio of technologies being developed specifically for placing humans in virtual spaces. The complementary Facial Expression Processing project is directed towards capturing human expression (including non-speech gestures) and adapting the results to different computer facial models. The third project in the trio, Hair Modeling and Animation, addresses a major gap in current computer <b>graphics</b> <b>renditions</b> of humans. 4.

40|$|Pictures are {{essential}} in the communication of scientific knowledge. They {{are used to}} publish the results of experiments, to introduce students to a scientific topic or to explain scientific matters to the public. When discussing pictures, especially in teaching at the university, the contents are usually {{the focus of our}} attention. Despite the increasing use of pictures, their form, creation and development are rarely discussed. In the first theoretical part of the thesis, these aspects were studied on the basis of an extensive literature research, case studies and experiments with students. A theory about scientific pictures was developed in which the subject was examined in three chapters. In the first chapter, the influence of formal aspects on the visualization of invisible structures was studied. It was shown how scientific pictures of the invisible are created by means of metaphors, models and instruments. In the second chapter, the subsequent development of scientific pictures was explored. It was shown how standard pictures in science, so-called canonical icons, emerge by the process of copying. The transformations of scientific pictures occurring in the process of their popularization were identified. In the third chapter, the influence of the presentation on the contents of scientific pictures was studied. The differences between simple schematic and complex naturalistic pictures were disclosed. Thereby the differences of <b>graphic</b> <b>renditions</b> were shown. The theory elaborated means to an active reception of pictures. Furthermore, it was shown how the scientific, graphical and didactical quality of pictures can be enhanced and how their use in scientific communication can be improved. In the second practical part of the thesis, 11 methods for the preparation of learning materials were derived from the theory. These methods were applied in the revision of the elective course „Aktiver und passiver Transport durch Membranen“ (active and passive transport through membranes) in the studies of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Basel. A comprehensive review of the topic was prepared. The lecture was offered to students of pharmaceutical sciences during the winter semester 2006 / 07 and subsequently evaluated. The results of the application of the methods and the evaluation validated the derived methods with reservations. The consideration to use these methods for the preparation of other lectures is supported, if learning materials of high quality are not yet available...|$|R
