5000|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of modern linguistics, medieval philologists had sought to {{describe}} patterns of linguistic variation {{on the basis of}} literary language. This approach posed significant problems, as literary language was and {{is more likely to be}} imitative, archaizing, or syncretic than everyday <b>documentary</b> <b>language.</b> Texts composed in a literary tradition or copied from literary exemplars, then, are not ideal for use in reconstructing the distribution of dialect features for a given period. Nevertheless, to take the most famous Middle English instance, J.R.R. Tolkien was able to conjecture the AB literary dialect by comparing manuscripts of the Katherine Group ("B") and the Ancrene Wisse ("A"). Drawing on his personal knowledge of Old English and Old Norse, while counting and cataloging thousands of verbs by hand, Tolkien argued for a regional literary standard localized to north-west Herefordshire that preserved Old English elements into the 13th century. His culminating philological essay, Ancrene Wisse and Hali Meiðhad (1929), has been called [...] "one of the great triumphs of English philology" [...] but also [...] "philology's last gasp." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{object of}} this paper is to present a semiological {{approach}} to French documentation theory. The origins of the interdiscipline of information and communication sciences, in which it is situated, underscore both the influence of the American model and the cultural exception of information science in France. An overview of this theory's principal French-speaking historical figures illustrates the coherence of using the semiological framework for documentation studies. Indeed, mapping out the field of information and communication sciences shows that what Paul Otlet termed documentologie (Otlet, 1934) implies a semiological standpoint. This standpoint makes it possible to understand information as a signifying entity that is part of a situated process of communication. Taking into account the construction of meaning as a phenomenon inherent to the scientific objects of information science remains a subject of the ongoing debate surrounding the notions of information and document. Over and beyond differences in language or typology, the convergence of international research on this subject proves the relevance of the adopted framework. Finally, the matter of documentary representation opens the discussion based on a presentation of an analysis performed on <b>documentary</b> <b>language</b> understood as discourse...|$|E

We assumed that university students would not frequently use the operators in searching, and that even if they were explicitly invited to make use of them. Results obtained with the first study based on transaction logs analyses confirmed that French university students did not frequently use Boolean operators. The impact of information search expertise, analysed in the second study, compared three levels of expertise: Novice (university students), intermediate (future professional librarians), and expert (professional librarians). Results showed that, even if the three groups were invited to use Boolean operators, this use increased significantly with the level of information search expertise. University students, if they manage procedural functions of connectives in natural language, do not always manage the whole set of procedural functions carried by such connectives when used in the <b>documentary</b> <b>language.</b> So, the relevance of presenting explicit Boolean operators in the OPACs when users are ‘non-librarians' is questioned...|$|E
40|$|Due to many {{advantages}} of reactive distillation column (RD) comparing to traditional method (reactors follows by distillation columns) in chemical synthesis, RD has been drawing attentions of researchers {{around the world}} to explore its potentials in chemical industries. Modelling of RD can be made by many different modelling environments such as Matlab, Fortran and so on. However, it is a time consuming process and a lot of effort will be required {{in order to get the}} solutions of the model. Since the modelling is done by using their own programming languages, it has the poor readability. Thus, users prone to make the mistakes during coding and error identification will be difficult by using these modelling software. In this study of RD modelling, a new modelling environment called MOSAIC will become the focus. MOSAIC is a web based modelling software and it introduces the new modelling approach in order to overcome what it seems as insufficient places of other modelling software. The key features of MOSAIC include modelling in the documentation level, reuse of model elements, code generation for other modelling environments and centralized cooperation on internet. (Kuntsche, Barz, Kraus, Arellano-Garcia, & Wozny, 2011) Modelling of reactive distillation column is based on the steady state equilibrium model. It is assumed that the liquid and vapour phase behave ideally. Steady state equilibrium model can be described by MESH equations. MESH equations are material balance equation, phase equilibrium equation, summation equations and energy balance equation. From the results, it can be seen that almost 100 % conversion of reactants are achieved with 94 % of MTBE purity. The temperature profile shows that the temperature is maintaining at 354 Kfrom condenser to feed stage. This is due to high purity of n-butene in each stages. After feed stage, the temperature increases rapidly until it reaches highest temperature of 424 K at reboiler stage. This is caused by high mole fraction of MTBE from condenser to reboiler stage. MOSAIC makes the modelling possible even without the knowledge of programming language. Latex <b>documentary</b> <b>language</b> is used by MOSAIC in documentation of modelling equations.

40|$|<b>Documentary</b> <b>language</b> {{materials}} that {{serve the needs}} of local source communities differ from those designed for academic researchers. Local communities encompass users with diverse interests and abilities, everyone from pre-school learners to fluent speakers. This paper examines the language needs of community language workers, particularly language teachers and translators, who are an especially important local audience. Although the number of community language workers is typically small, they play a disproportionate role as language activists in developing teaching resources, instructing classes, and using the language in public settings. They are among the most literate members of the local community, and commonly work to enhance their spoken language fluency. They have often trained with academic language researchers and are among the most frequent users of documentary resources. This paper examines the needs of Kaska language workers in Ross River and Watson Lake, Yukon who, over the last six months, have contributed to a collaborative on-line Kaska dictionary project conducted in collaboration between two First Nations, the Yukon Department of Education, and university-based researchers. We consider the extent to which design options, including the use of contemporary digital and web-based technologies, have facilitated or failed to facilitate the usability of the dictionary for community language workers. Dene (Athabaskan) dictionaries pose problems for dictionary makers and users relating to the complex structure of verbs. Hargus (2012) has pointed out that what might be construed as verbal headword entries in Dene languages are discontinuous, unpronounceable, non-word entities. Similarly Poser (2003) says that because of the extensive prefixation and complex verb stem variation in these languages there is a basic dilemma between a root based analytical dictionary (requiring extensive knowledge of abstract language structure) and presenting an overwhelming number of fully inflected forms. We explore a compromise organizational structure that utilizes access through English translational equivalents, Kaska entries organized by Kaska roots, and paradigms of selected inflected forms. We consider the advantages of using linked sound files as well as written text and reference to sentences, conversations and narratives recorded with fluent speakers. Finally we consider what types of recorded materials are most useful for Kaska language workers in their roles as language instructors and advanced language learners.
