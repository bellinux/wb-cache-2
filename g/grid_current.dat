2500|$|The beam {{power tube}} {{is usually a}} tetrode with the {{addition}} of beam-forming electrodes, which take the place of the suppressor grid. These angled plates (not {{to be confused with the}} anode) focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons, while also providing pentode behavior. The positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called [...] "critical-distance geometry", which minimizes the [...] "tetrode kink", plate to control grid capacitance, screen <b>grid</b> <b>current,</b> and secondary emission from the anode, thus increasing power conversion efficiency. The control grid and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch, or number of wires per inch. The two grids are positioned so that the control grid creates [...] "sheets" [...] of electrons which pass between the screen-grid wires. They're aligned to be equidistant from, say, the bottom of the tube.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes a numeral {{is added}} for {{vacuum-tube}} stages. If <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> is {{not permitted to}} flow, the class is AB1. If <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> is allowed to flow (adding more distortion, but giving slightly higher output power) the class is AB2.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, three grid-side filter topologies for {{grid-connected}} three-phase Photovoltaic Current-Source Inverters are sized {{and assessed}} {{based on the}} Total Harmonic Distortion of the <b>grid</b> <b>currents,</b> on the power factor in the connection to the grid, and on the filter losses. A second-order LC filter with passive damping resistors in parallel with the filter inductors is first sized and evaluated. It is then improved by removing the resistors and using active damping, with the virtual resistor method and feedback of the inductor voltages requiring no additional measurements. The analysis is conducted {{taking into account the}} delays introduced in the control circuit and the relation between the synchronously rotating d and q components of the <b>grid</b> <b>currents.</b> A fourth-order LCLC filter is also sized and considered as an alternative grid-side filter topology to reduce the switching harmonics. Simulation and experimental results obtained with a direct control approach confirm the proper sizing and operation of the filters. Based on the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the <b>grid</b> <b>currents</b> and filter losses, the second-order filter with active damping presents the best results with a THD lower than 5 % and nearly negligible losses.

40|$|The theme {{here is to}} {{identify}} the sources of interharmonics that can affect back-to-back controllable drives and make non-characteristic interharmonic components in the <b>grid</b> side <b>currents</b> when the motor currents are unbalanced. A new control methodology then is formulated and proposed {{to compensate for the}} sources, leading to undistorted <b>grid</b> <b>currents,</b> which are growingly important as more drives are tied to the grid.

50|$|Grid dip {{oscillators}} {{were first}} {{developed in the}} 1920s, and were built with vacuum tubes. The devices measured {{the value of the}} tube's <b>grid</b> <b>current.</b> Modern grid dip oscillators are solid-state devices and are more versatile. Solid-state versions of the grid dip oscillator are sometimes called gate dip oscillators or emitter dip oscillators in reference to the parts of the semiconductor whose current is being measured instead of the <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> on a vacuum tube.|$|E
5000|$|The screen <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> {{was about}} 5-10% of the anode current {{compared}} with about 20% for the pentode, thus the beam tetrode was more power-efficient.|$|E
30|$|Finally, the shunt {{compensator}} has {{to tackle}} the harmonic currents consumed by the load to reduce the harmonic contents of the <b>grid</b> <b>currents.</b> The DC components of the load currents in the main SRF are subtracted from the original currents and used as the harmonic components of the set point i_Lf 2,dq^ref as shown in Fig.  10 a.|$|R

5000|$|Class AB2 {{is where}} the grid is often more {{negatively}} biased than in AB1, also {{the size of the}} input signal is often larger. When the drive is able to make the grid become positive the <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> will increase.|$|E

50|$|Class A2 {{amplifiers}} {{can overcome}} a high Rp by driving the grid positive {{with respect to}} the cathode. Because this makes the grid a secondary anode, it too will draw current from the cathode while accelerating the remaining electrons towards the plate. <b>Grid</b> <b>currents</b> can place extreme demands on the driving circuitry, sometimes requiring as much as 8 watts input for larger tubes such as the 211.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a typical}} voltage amplifier, {{including}} power stages of most audio power amplifiers, DC bias voltage is negative relative to cathode potential. Instant grid voltage (sum of DC bias and AC input signal) should never rise above cathode potential to prevent grid-to-cathode currents that overload preceding amplifier stages and may cause severe even-order distortion. High transconductance tubes develop significant <b>grid</b> <b>currents</b> even with small negative bias; in these cases, maximum instant voltage ceiling is lowered to -1.0..-0.5 Volt.|$|R
40|$|A {{fault-tolerant}} {{technique of}} a grid-side converter (GSC) {{is a very}} important task because the unbalanced grid power endangers the overall system. Since the GSC is very sensitive to grid disturbance, the complete system needs to be stopped suddenly once an open-switch fault occurs. To improve the reliability of system, the continuous operation should be guaranteed. In this paper, a redundant topology based fault-tolerant algorithm is proposed for a GSC in a wind power generation system. The proposed scheme consists of the fault detection and fault-tolerant algorithms. The fault detection algorithm employs the durations of positive and negaitive cycles of three-phase <b>grid</b> <b>currents</b> as well as normalized root mean square (RMS) currents. Once a fault is detected, the corresponding faulty phase is identified and isolated to enable the fault-tolerant operation. The faulty phase is replaced by redundant one rapidly to recover the original shape of the <b>grid</b> <b>currents,</b> which ensures the continuity in operation. In contrast with the conventional methods, the proposed fault detection and fault-tolerant algorithms work effectively even {{in the presence of the}} open faults in multiple switches in the GSC. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control algorithms...|$|R
50|$|One {{potential}} {{disadvantage of}} the grid leak detector is that the input impedance of the detector may {{be affected by the}} need to self bias the detector tube with <b>grid</b> <b>current.</b> Having the grid leak resistor, even in the Megohm range, shunting signal to ground loads the received signal. Although this may be mitigated to some degree by taking the resistor {{to the top of the}} tuned circuit (i.e. in parallel with the capacitor) and through the coil to earth, or by circuit design and component optimization, forward <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> will still load the input signal (and reduce the Q of the tuned circuit). Plate detectors have the advantage in that they isolate the detector load from the input circuit more effectively and may be employed where sensitivity is thought to be otherwise compromised by a grid leak or diode detector circuit.|$|E
5000|$|A pentode has an {{additional}} suppressor grid (g3) {{to eliminate the}} tetrode kink. This is used for improved performance rather than extra gain and is usually not accessible externally. Some of these valves use aligned grids to minimise <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> and beam plates instead of a third grid, these are known as [...] "beam tetrodes".|$|E
50|$|This design uses a triode, the <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> {{drawn in}} this system is larger than that {{required}} for the other two basic designs. Because of this, valves such as the 4CX250B are not suitable for this circuit. This circuit design has been used at 1296 MHz using disk seal triode valves such as the 2C39A.|$|E
30|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of electronic}} loads has produced several power quality issues to the utility grid [1]. This kind of loads, also referred as nonlinear loads (NLLs), have negative effects on the power system, for instance, distorted <b>grid</b> <b>currents,</b> low power factor, distorted grid voltage, overheating of electrical machines as well as distribution transformers, among others [2]. Since the power quality {{is a measure of}} the efficient use of the electrical energy, this concept has become a critical concern in electrical distribution systems. Thus, several standards like IEC 555 - 2, IEC 1000 - 3 - 2 and IEC 519 [3, 4, 5] have been developed to maintain safe limits on the harmonic distortion produced and injected by the NLL to the grid. The power electronics equipment involved in a rectification process is commonly related with current harmonic distortion. Examples of these equipments are uncontrolled rectifiers, phase angle controller rectifiers among others, which produce highly distorted <b>grid</b> <b>currents.</b> As a solution, power converters with capacity of power factor corrector (PFC) have been developed [6, 7]. This kind of power converters are able to mitigate the harmonic pollution and thus, achieve a power factor close to unity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Grid {{technologies}} have matured {{over the last}} few years. This level of maturity is especially true in the field of scientific computing in which grids have become the main infrastructure for scientific problem solving. Due to its success, the use of grid technology rapidly finds its introduction into other fields. One of such fields is enterprise computing in which grids are seen as a new architecture for data centers.

50|$|The {{suppressor}} grid is usually {{connected to the}} cathode {{and more often than}} not, this connection is made within the glass envelope. Because the grid is negatively charged relative to both the anode and the screen grid, it repels any secondary electrons back to the anode preventing them from contributing to the screen <b>grid</b> <b>current,</b> and to any negative resistance characteristic.|$|E
5000|$|Amplifying devices {{may also}} have limits on their inputs, for example the maximum base current a bipolar {{transistor}} can take, and a vacuum tube may have problems with <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> if the input signal becomes too positive. These factors can distort (clip) the input signal, if {{it comes from a}} high enough impedance source, or destroy the device (and so the designer will probably employ other limiting circuits; see below).|$|E
50|$|When using a {{tuned circuit}} in the input, the network must match the driving source to the input {{impedance}} of the grid. This impedance {{will be determined}} by the <b>grid</b> <b>current</b> in Class C or AB2 operation. In AB1 operation, the grid circuit should be designed to avoid excessive step up voltage, which although it might provide more stage gain, as in audio designs, it will increase instability and make neutralization more critical.|$|E
