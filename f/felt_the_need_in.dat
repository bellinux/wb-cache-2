40|$|I argue that, paradoxically, Augustine embraced much of Origen’s system, {{especially}} in his anti-Manichaean polemic, exactly {{when he was}} convinced {{that he did not know}} his thought.

With this I shall hopefully add an important piece to the study of Origen’s influence on Western Patristics.

By the middle of the 19th century, however, this dominance started waning. British individuals bought large stretches of land in Coorg and founded plantations. Institutions like the joint family system began to disappear. A number of socio-religious reform movements in India took shape from the 1800s. <b>The</b> Kodavas also <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for reform <b>in</b> response to such changes. The sense of decline gave an impetus to the spirit of reform that expressed itself in the work of religious men like Sadguru Appayya Swami. Trouble arose for the community during the post-colonial years, after the Land Reform Act enacted in 1974. Many large land owners lost their lands to the tenants (land to the tiller) and the socio-economic structure of the prominent community of Kodavas changed irreversibly. These Land reforms led to massive loss of land-ownership by the Kodava gentry who were relegated to poverty overnight. The decline of Kodava dominance was however tempered by their conversion through the 20th century to the academic and professional classes and their dominance in Kodagu politics.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{experiences}} of people who stutter who digitally connect and share with other people who stutter on a social networking site, specifically Facebook. This study used a qualitative, ethnographic approach to gain insight from members of a private Facebook group for people who stutter and to collect their opinions as to whether an online community was a beneficial means of obtaining psychosocial support from other people who stutter. The primary investigator collected textual data and artifacts from 3 months of Facebook group postings, semi-structured interviews with 7 of the Facebook group members, and anonymous responses from a written questionnaire. The primary investigator analyzed all of the data for major and minor themes. To establish credibility, all research findings were consistently shared with participants to validate, clarify, and question the results. Also, they were encouraged expand upon or delete any of their specifically contributed words if they <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to. <b>In</b> addition, 3 independent investigators (2 with a background in stuttering and 1 with expertise in social networking sites) performed separate thematic analyses. Their findings were compared with those of the primary investigator to gauge the consistency of themes. Data analysis revealed 8 major themes, which included the benefits and challenges of participating in an online community for stuttering; the types of support that existed within an online community for stuttering, which included providing information, posting questions, giving encouragement, and engaging in humor; and the healthy debate and honest and varied opinions that members had within the online community.

His book, popularly known as Sefer Abudirham, has no specific title beyond the name Ḥibbur Perush ha-Berakot we-ha-Tefillot, ("Commentary on the Blessings and Prayers"), probably because it was intended to serve as a running commentary to the liturgy. In the preface he states that he desired to afford the people, whom he found lacking in knowledge, the means of using the liturgy intelligently, and for this purpose he collected, from both the Babylonian and the Jerusalem Talmuds, from the Geonim and all the commentators down to his own time, the material for the explanation of each portion of the prayer-book. In order to elucidate the meaning and origin of each observance connected with divine worship throughout the year, he made use of all the works concerning the rites he could obtain, some of which were very rare. In addition he gave a systematic exposition of the Hebrew calendar, but at the same time, he lays no claim to any originality. He certainly succeeded, as no one did before him, in writing a commentary which is very valuable, if not altogether indispensable, to the student of Jewish ritual.|$|R

Mainly during June, July, August and September, Grey Nomads frequent the northern half of Australia, to escape the colder climate of southern Australia. The term Grey Nomad is applied to the section of the older Australian population who use their retirement years as a time to experience travel once freed from the constraints of work and family commitments. This paper draws on research conducted about the health and social needs of Grey Nomads holidaying in a Central Queensland, Australia, coastal location. Open-ended, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 20 participants. Contingency plans concerning wellness, wellbeing and medical conditions all formed a part of the Grey Nomads’ daily existence while travelling. Many important and lasting friendships and social support networks were formed during the journeying and sojourning phases of the travel. Many of the Grey Nomads interviewed <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to keep <b>in</b> contact with home, even though they willingly chose to leave it, and to be ‘away’.

The principal figures here, in rough chronological order, were Eudorus, Thrasyllus, anon. Commentary on the Theaetetus, Plutarch of Chaeronea, Theon, Taurus, Albinus, Nicostratus, Atticus, Severus, Harpocration, and Alcinous. All are normally treated as Platonists today; antiquity treated most of them as ‘Platonics’. By the end of the first century ce we hear of philosophers who could be described as ‘Platonics’ (Platonici), whether as a title connected with a recognized profession or as a general description of their concerns. There were a number of centres around the Mediterranean at which a ‘Platonic’ might reside and operate. During the Hellenistic period there had been no need for such a term at all, since one's philosophical background had usually been indicated with reference to the philosophical group or school with which one had studied (usually at Athens), and to which one continued to feel some allegiance. Up to Cicero's generation it was normal for those with serious educational ambitions to study in Athens, and not unusual to seek tuition from more than one school. Those men of letters who <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to communicate <b>in</b> a philosophical vein did not normally have to adopt any title that indicated their favourite philosophy, while those who claimed to officially represent a school, and to teach its doctrines or methods, adopted such titles to legitimize their role...|$|R

After learning about Smallville from the show's casting director, Dee Dee Bradley, Allison Mack {{toyed with the idea of}} auditioning for the role of Lana Lang, but chose instead to audition for the role of Chloe Sullivan. Gough and Millar felt she had a [...] "rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary [...] dialogue conversationally", and decided to cast her against their initial intention to give the character an ethnic origin. According to Mack, the reason she got the role was because she went into her second audition with a [...] "very flippant attitude". Kristen Bell also auditioned for the role of Chloe Sullivan; she would eventually go on to star in the television series Veronica Mars. Aside from Allison Mack, Roan Curtis portrayed Chloe as a child in the season six episode [...] "Progeny", with Victoria Duffield taking on the role in the eighth season episode [...] "Abyss". Mack enjoys the fact that her character was created specifically for the show, because she feels like she does not have to worry about being compared to someone else in the same role, which she likens to people comparing Michael Rosenbaum's performance as Lex Luthor to Gene Hackman's portrayal in the Superman film series of the 1970s – 1980s.
