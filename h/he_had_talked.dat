5|$|Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal {{searched for}} Wallenberg and {{collected}} several testimonies. For example, British businessman Greville Wynne, who was imprisoned in the Lubyanka prison in 1962 for his connection to KGB defector Oleg Penkovsky, stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to, {{but could not}} see the face of, a man who claimed to be a Swedish diplomat. Efim (or Yefim) Moshinsky claims to have seen Wallenberg on Wrangel Island in 1962. An eyewitness asserted that she had seen Wallenberg in the 1960s in a Soviet prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the Reverend Francis Dixon of Lansdowne Baptist Church in Bournemouth, England, began hearing several testimonies {{from people}} who became Christians after Jenner accosted them on George Street, Sydney. The {{following}} year, Dixon met with Jenner in Australia and {{told him about the}} people he had met who had become Christians as a result of Jenner's evangelism, and Jenner, then fifty years old, cried because he had not previously known that even one of the people <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of Richard's reign, the {{pressures}} mounted on Walter. Conflicts between his ecclesiastical duties {{and his government}} duties made him the target of criticism from both sides. A dispute in December 1197, over Richard's demand that the magnates of England provide 300knights to serve in France, led to renewed grumbling among the clergy and barons. Richard was also dissatisfied {{with the results of}} the carucage in 1198, so Walter resigned his position of chief justiciar on 11 July of that year. Walter may have resigned willingly, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> of resigning his secular duties since 1194. Some medieval sources, however, stated that he was forced out of office by the king.|$|E

25|$|On 13 January 1587, Perkins preached {{a sermon}} denouncing the {{practice}} of kneeling to receive Communion, and was ultimately called before the Vice-Chancellor as a result. During the final set of trials against Puritan ministers in 1590–91, Perkins confirmed that he had discussed the Book of Discipline with Puritan ministers, but claimed {{that he could not}} remember whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to. Perkins married Timothye Cradocke of Grantchester on 2 July 1595. (He had previously resigned his fellowship at Christ's College, since only unmarried men could be fellows.) Eventually, the couple would have seven children, three of whom would die from various causes, and one being born after Perkins's death.|$|E
25|$|On November 30, 2012, Game {{announced}} that he and fellow rapper Stat Quo were starting a new record label titled Rolex Records. Both artists would use the label to release new music and sign other artists. On October 1, 2013, Game announced he was officially leaving Interscope Records, {{and that he was}} now a free agent. The following day he told Artistdirect that him signing to Cash Money Records was likely, and that a final announcement of a signing would probably come in January 2014. He also stated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to Kendrick Lamar, Nipsey Hussle, and Snoop Dogg about possibly doing collaboration albums in the future.|$|E
25|$|He {{spent the}} next {{two and a half years}} mainly at that place, it being a time of {{adjusting}} to new conditions. At first Lienhard worked as a farm hand and later left the Swiss settlement on occasion to travel up the Mississippi, taking on several jobs along the way in the hope of finding better-paid work. In the spring of 1846, while working in a shop in St. Louis, he met some old friends from Galena with whom only a year before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about emigrating to California. They were just then preparing for that venture, and little effort was needed on their part to persuade him to join them in their undertaking.|$|E
5|$|Ever since Reubens {{started giving}} {{interviews}} again after his 2002 arrest, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> {{about the two}} scripts <b>he</b> <b>has</b> written for future Pee-wee Herman films.|$|R

25|$|Both {{defendants}} offered alibis {{that were}} backed by several witnesses. Vanzetti {{testified that he}} had been selling fish {{at the time of the}} Braintree robbery. Sacco testified {{that he had been}} in Boston applying for a passport at the Italian consulate. He stated he had lunched in Boston's North End with several friends, each of whom testified on his behalf. Prior to the trial, Sacco's lawyer, Fred Moore, went to great lengths to contact the consulate employee whom Sacco said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> with on the afternoon of the crime. Once contacted in Italy, the clerk said he remembered Sacco because of the unusually large passport photo he presented. The clerk also remembered the date, April 15, 1920, but he refused to return to the United States to testify (a trip requiring two ship voyages), citing his ill health. Instead he executed a sworn deposition that was read aloud in court and quickly dismissed.|$|E
500|$|Politicians {{generally}} reacted along party lines, with Senator Mundt stating, [...] "Nixon's {{speech is}} complete vindication {{against one of}} the most vicious smears in American history." [...] Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico stated, [...] "I wish <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about the 18,000 bucks—not the puppy dog... Suppose someone sets up a fund to buy my meals. I could say I didn't get one red cent of the money." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{election}} results were announced, Jones was quoted in a newspaper as saying that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> with Wilkinson about opening channels with the media, whom Wilkinson often refused to speak with. Jones {{also said that he}} did not agree with all of Wilkinson's political positions and would not be his [...] "yes man". These comments angered Wilkinson, who backtracked on his promise to give Jones {{an active role in the}} administration. Relations between Jones and Wilkinson further deteriorated as both men tried to recoup the money spent during their campaigns.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose {{it should}} be Mr. Gimble, come to deal at last for that picture of mine that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> of buying so long," [...] exclaimed Valentine.|$|R

50|$|A staunch Old Believer, he {{supported}} the Moscow Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy and financed its leader Bishop Pafnuty (Ovchinnikov)'s visit to London where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talks</b> with Alexander Hertsen, Nikolai Ogaryov and Vasily Kelsiyev.|$|R
500|$|Tensions also {{developed}} between Wilkinson and Lieutenant Governor-Elect Jones {{soon after the}} election. During the campaign, Jones {{was quoted as saying}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> with Wilkinson about being more open with the press and said that, if elected, he would not be a [...] "yes man" [...] for Wilkinson. At a press conference shortly after the election, Wilkinson {{said he did not know}} what role Jones would play in his administration and that much of it would depend on what Jones had meant when he said he did not agree with all of Wilkinson's positions. In late November 1987, Wilkinson announced that Jones would spearhead the promotion of the administration's agricultural agenda. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that this would not be Jones' primary role in the administration but that no other specifics had been provided.|$|E
500|$|His detractors {{include his}} {{extended}} {{family and his}} father's former secretary, Barbara Wilson. She told reporters that Bamber used to provoke his parents, riding in circles around his mother on a bicycle, wearing make-up to upset his father, and once hiding a bag of live rats in the secretary's car. Whenever Bamber visited the farm, there were arguments, she said. Tension had apparently increased {{in the weeks before}} the murders; she said Nevill had remarked to her about foreseeing a [...] "shooting accident". Bamber's girlfriend, Julie Mugford, alleged that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about killing his family. A farm worker testified that Bamber had once said of Sheila: [...] "I'm not going to share my money with my sister." [...] In March 1985 he reportedly told a cousin: [...] "I could kill anybody...I could easily kill my parents". Bamber denied having said any of these things.|$|E
500|$|While Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard, {{he did not have a}} {{definite}} study plan, and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974. [...] The MITS Altair 8800 was released the following year. [...] The new computer was based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company. [...] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company. [...] Gates explained his decision to leave Harvard, saying [...] "...if things [...] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. [...] I was officially on [...] leave [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Just {{as the war}} was in {{the balance}} on the Western Front, so the fate of Luxembourg was see-sawing back and forth. [...] It was clear to all that the good conduct of the Luxembourgish government, if fully {{receptive}} {{to the needs of}} the German military administrators, could guarantee Luxembourg's continued self-government, at least in the short-term. [...] Eyschen was a familiar and overwhelmingly popular leader, and all factions put their utmost faith in his ability to steer Luxembourg through the diplomatic minefield that was occupation. [...] On 4 August 1914, he expelled the French minister in Luxembourg at the request of the German minister, followed by the Belgian minister four days later and the Italian minister when his country entered the war. [...] To the same end, Eyschen refused to speak ill of the German Zollverein, even though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> openly of exiting the customs union before the war began.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} {{statement}} she alleged that, between July and October 1984, Bamber said {{he wished he}} could [...] "get rid of them all". <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> disparagingly about his [...] "old" [...] father and [...] "mad" [...] mother, she said, who were trying to [...] "run his life". He said his sister had nothing to live for, and that the twins were disturbed. That his parents were paying for Sheila's expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said. In discussions she said she had dismissed as [...] "idle talk", Bamber had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the back roads to the house, entering the house through the kitchen window because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger [...] "because the last phone call made would be recorded". He claimed to have killed rats with his bare hands to test whether he was able to kill, but he said it had taught him {{that he would not be}} able to kill his family, although he allegedly continued to talk about doing so.|$|E
2500|$|Page's former step-mother {{apologized to}} the Sikh victims and said {{she had not been}} in touch with her stepson for the past twelve years, after divorcing his father. A former friend {{described}} him as a [...] "loner" [...] and said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about an [...] "impending racial holy war." [...] According to his neighbors, Page lived alone, rarely left his apartment, and avoided eye contact with them.|$|E

2500|$|Souter, {{writing for}} the plurality, focused on the actual {{effectiveness}} of Miranda warnings given after an earlier unwarned confession. [...] Just giving the warnings is not necessarily good enough. [...] Instead, a court must ask, [...] "Could the warnings effectively advise the suspect {{that he had a}} real choice about giving an admissible statement at that juncture? [...] Could they reasonably convey that he could choose to stop talking even if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> earlier?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As the {{political}} fight ensued, Kelly knew <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to the journalist involved but {{felt that he}} had not said exactly what was reported. He also told his friend and colleague Olivia Bosch that his meeting with Andrew Gilligan had been [...] "unauthorised" [...] and therefore outside his terms of employment. On 30 June 2003, he wrote to his line manager at the Ministry of Defence to report his contact with Gilligan though he added [...] "I am convinced that I am not his primary source of information." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{they were}} at a smaller vehicle {{checkpoint}} [...] north of Checkpoint Salaang on the 3 July 2011, a colleague of McLaren's had left behind some night-vision goggles.

Later that night, at 2:19am (local time) on the 4 July, McLaren left the base on his own ostensibly to search for the missing kit. It was noted that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about going back for the goggles.|$|E
