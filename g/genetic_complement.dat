50|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that both ancestors {{would have had}} established mechanisms for carbon storage. Based on review of the <b>genetic</b> <b>complement</b> of modern plastid genomes, the last common ancestor of the Archaeplastida is hypothesized to have possessed a cytosolic storage mechanism and to have lost most of the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium's corresponding genes. According to this hypothesis, the rhodophytes and glaucophytes retained the ancestral eukaryote's cytosolic starch deposition. Starch synthesis and degradation in green algae and plants is much more complex - but significantly, many of the enzymes that perform these metabolic functions {{in the interior of}} modern plastids are identifiably of eukaryotic rather than bacterial origin.|$|E
50|$|The {{genetics}} {{of social}} behavior {{is an area}} of research that attempts to address the question of the role that genes play in modulating the neural circuits in the brain which influence social behavior. Model genetic species, such as D.melanogaster (common fruit fly) and Apis mellifera (honey bee), have been rigorously studied and proven to be instrumental in developing the science of genetics. Many examples of genetic factors of social behavior have been derived from a bottom-up method of altering a gene and observing the change it produces in an organism. Sociogenomics is an integrated field that accounts for the complete cellular <b>genetic</b> <b>complement</b> of an organism from a top-down approach, accounting for all biotic influences that effect behavior on a cellular level.|$|E
50|$|Supposedly, most sheep-goat hybrids die as embryos. Hybrid male mammals {{are often}} sterile, demonstrating a {{phenomenon}} known as Haldane's rule. The Haldane phenomenon may apply even when the parent species have {{the same number of}} chromosomes, as in most cat-species hybrids. It sometimes does not apply when the species chromosome number is different, as in wild horse (chromosome number = 66) with domestic horse (chromosome number = 64) hybrids. Hybrid female fertility tends to decrease with increasing divergence in chromosome similarity between parent species. Presumably, this is due to mismatch problems during meiosis and the resulting production of eggs with unbalanced <b>genetic</b> <b>complements.</b>|$|R

50|$|Writing on {{the virgin}} birth, The Seed of the Woman, Custance {{explains}} {{the necessity of}} the virgin birth for the Messiah to be sinless. Custance asserts that the sin nature or the propensity to sin (in Hebraic writings the yetzer hara) is passed through the male line genetically, starting from the first Adam, thus allowing a full human <b>genetic</b> <b>complement</b> through Mary. This understanding of male transmission of the sin nature is one alternative to two other theories that consider the virgin birth as intrinsically connected to the sinless nature of the Messiah, necessary for the atoning sacrifice. One is the Roman Catholic conception of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Another has the virgin birth as a divine implantation in which Mary did not contribute genetically.|$|E
50|$|The <b>genetic</b> <b>complement</b> of Trichoplax adhaerens has not {{yet been}} very well researched; it has, however, already been {{possible}} to identify several genes, such as Brachyury and TBX2/TBX3, which are homologous to corresponding base-pair sequences in eumetazoans. Of particular significance is Trox-2, a placozoan gene known under the name Cnox-2 in cnidarians and as Gsx in the bilaterally symmetrical Bilateria. As a homeobox or Hox gene it plays a role in organization and differentiation along the axis of symmetry in the embryonic development of eumetazoans; in cnidarians, it appears to determine the position of mouth-facing (oral) and opposite-facing (aboral) sides of the organism. Since placozoans possess no axes of symmetry, exactly where the gene is transcribed in the body of Trichoplax is of special interest. Antibody studies have been able to show that the gene's product occurs only in the transition zones of the dorsal and ventral sides, perhaps in a fifth cell type that {{has not yet}} been characterized. It is not yet clear whether these cells, contrary to traditional views, are stem cells, which play a role in cell differentiation. In any case, Trox-2 can be considered a possible candidate for a proto-Hox gene, from which the other genes in this important family could have arisen through gene duplication and variation.|$|E

Epigenetics {{has been defined}} as ‘‘the study of changes in gene function that are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not entail a change in DNA sequence’’ (Wu et al. 2001). Epigenetic examines proteins' interactions with DNA and its associated components, including histones and various modifications such as methylation, which alter the rate or target of transcription. Epigenetic mechanisms are required for proper regulation while epi-alleles and epi-mutants, much like their <b>genetic</b> <b>complements,</b> describe changes in phenotype associated with distinct epigenetic circumstance. There has been scientific enthusiasm for the study of epigenetics in plants because of their long-standing importance in agriculture.|$|R

Molecular examinations of European corn borer larvae using the study of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) revealed that by single strand conformation polimorphism (SSCP) the populations found in Hungary represented the same haplotype. Even the Egyptian sample showed no genetic divergence.

40|$|Plasmid pUB 110 was {{previously}} {{used as a}} vector to clone fragments of deoxyribonucleic acid that complement the trpC 2 mutation in Bacillus subtilis from endonuclease EcoRI digested B. licheniformis, B. pumilus, and B. subtilis cellular deoxyribonucleic acid. Each of several such trp plasmids was subsequently shown to contain {{a segment of the}} trp gene cluster on the basis of <b>genetic</b> <b>complementing</b> activity. In the present study, analysis of the Trp enzyme levels in B. subtilis harboring the constructed trp plasmids confirms the genetic constitution of the plasmids. Thus, plasmids that complement mutations in specific trp genes specify the corresponding enzyme activities. The levels of the plasmid-specified Trp enzymes in B. subtilis were generally above the repressed level of the chromosomally specified Trp enzymes and equal to or below the derepressed levels of the chromosomally specified Trp enzymes. Certain cloned trp segments contain a single HindIII-sensitive site. Insertion of HindIII-generated deoxyribonucleic acid fragments into these trp plasmids resulted in inactivation of trpC complementing activity, loss of the trpC-specified enzyme activity, and a 10 -fold reduction in the specific activity of the plasmid-specified trpF product. The HindIII insertions had no detectable effect on the level of the trpD product, nor did the insertions detectably alter plasmid-specified complementing activity other than to abolish trpC complementation. Removal of the HindIII insertions was accompanied by recovery of trpC complementing activity and restoration of the trpC-and trpF-determined enzymes to the levels specified by the parent plasmids...|$|R

40|$|David Barker {{is the man}} who “anticipated" the {{existence}} of babies by focusing attention on the importance of the fetus and what takes place during intrauterine life. Barker was one of the physicians who in the last decades brought about the greatest changes in medicine, changes so important as to represent a veritable revolution in medical thought. According to Barker's studies, the embryo obviously has a <b>genetic</b> <b>complement</b> coming from the mother and father, but from the very first stages of development it begins to undergo the influence of the outside environment, just as occurs for adults whose biological, psychological and pathological aspects are influenced by the environment to a not well-established percentage between <b>genetic</b> <b>complement</b> and epigenetics. Much of our future lives as adults is decided in our mothers' wombs. If Barker's discovery was revolutionary from the cultural standpoint, it was even more so from the strictly medical one. Barker's research method was rigid from the methodological standpoint, but innovative and speculative in its working hypotheses, with a humanistic slant. Barker's idea has another practical corollary: it is evident that the role of obstetricians, perinatologists and neonatologists is more and more relevant in medicine and future prevention. Unquestionably, besides the enormous merits of his clinical research, among the benefits that Barker has contributed there is that of having helped us to see things from new points of view. Not only is the neonate (and even more so the fetus) not an adult of reduced proportions, but perhaps the neonate is the "father" of the adult person. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Proteolytic Clostridium botulinum is the causative {{agent of}} botulism, a severe neuroparalytic illness. Given the {{severity}} of botulism, surprisingly little is known of the population structure, biology, phylogeny or evolution of C. botulinum. The recent determination of the genome sequence of C. botulinum has allowed comparative genomic indexing using a DNA microarray. Results Whole genome microarray analysis revealed that 63 % of the coding sequences (CDSs) present in reference strain ATCC 3502 were common to all 61 widely-representative strains of proteolytic C. botulinum and the closely related C. sporogenes tested. This indicates a relatively stable genome. There was, however, evidence for recombination and genetic exchange, in particular within the neurotoxin gene and cluster (including transfer of neurotoxin genes to C. sporogenes), and the flagellar glycosylation island (FGI). These two loci appear to have evolved independently from each other, and from {{the remainder of the}} <b>genetic</b> <b>complement.</b> A number of strains were atypical; for example, while 10 out of 14 strains that formed type A 1 toxin gave almost identical profiles in whole genome, neurotoxin cluster and FGI analyses, the other four strains showed divergent properties. Furthermore, a new neurotoxin sub-type (A 5) has been discovered in strains from heroin-associated wound botulism cases. For the first time, differences in glycosylation profiles of the flagella could be linked to differences in the gene content of the FGI. Conclusion Proteolytic C. botulinum has a stable genome backbone containing specific regions of genetic heterogeneity. These include the neurotoxin gene cluster and the FGI, each having evolved independently of each other and the remainder of the <b>genetic</b> <b>complement.</b> Analysis of these genetic components provides a high degree of discrimination of strains of proteolytic C. botulinum, and is suitable for clinical and forensic investigations of botulism outbreaks. </p...|$|E

40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a gram-negative facultative {{rod-shaped}} bacterium causing salmonellosis and foodborne disease, {{is one of}} {{the most}} common isolated Salmonella serovars in both developed and developing nations. Several S. Typhimurium genomes have been completed and many more genome-sequencing projects are underway. Comparative genome analysis of the multiple strains leads to a better understanding of the evolution of S. Typhimurium and its pathogenesis. S. Typhimurium strain UK- 1 (belongs to phage type 1) is highly virulent when orally administered to mice and chickens and efficiently colonizes lymphoid tissues of these species. These characteristics make this strain a good choice for use in vaccine development. In fact, UK- 1 has been used as the parent strain for a number of nonrecombinant and recombinant vaccine strains, including several commercial vaccines for poultry. In this study, we conducted a thorough comparative genome analysis of the UK- 1 strain with other S. Typhimurium strains and examined the phenotypic impact of several genomic differences. Whole genomic comparison highlights an extremely close relationship between the UK- 1 strain and other S. Typhimurium strains; however, many interesting genetic and genomic variations specific to UK- 1 were explored. In particular, the deletion of a UK- 1 -specific gene that is highly similar to the gene encoding the T 3 SS effector protein NleC exhibited a significant decrease in oral virulence in BALB/c mice. The complete <b>genetic</b> <b>complements</b> in UK- 1, especially those elements that contribute to virulence or aid in determining the diversity within bacterial species, provide key information in evaluating the functional characterization of important genetic determinants and for development of vaccines...|$|R

Dengue severity can be classified into mild Dengue fever (DF) and severe Dengue or Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Genetic polymorphisms and variations in the host immune response are believed to contribute to different degrees to the disease progression. In this study, factors that have an influence on Dengue infection were identified. Genetic variants in the complement system, of which the degree of activation increases with Dengue severity, were identified. There was no association between the disease and <b>complement</b> <b>genetic</b> variants (<b>complement</b> factor H [CFH] rs 3753394, CFH rs 1061170, CFH rs 800292, complement factor B (FB) rs 12614 /rs 641153 and complement C 3 rs 2230199) in Thai cohorts.

Elegant mosaic analysis studies show us that many developmental genes act nonautonomously, indicating that they feed into pathways for intercellular signaling.
