Researchers have noted when they approach <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>view,</b> sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases that}} were known in West Berlin {{provoked}} demonstrations among the population. Members of the Senate inspected the crime scenes {{and spoke to}} the press as well as public audiences. Various groups, and also individuals, launched protest campaigns against the Wall and the shootings. The fact that Peter Fechter bled to death <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>view</b> of the public without anybody being able to help him lead to spontaneous mass demonstrations, which in turn resulted in riots in the following night. West Berlin policemen and US soldiers prevented a storming of the Wall. Buses bringing Soviet soldiers to the Tiergarten where they were to guard the Soviet War Memorial were pelted with stones by protesters. The incident also lead to anti-American protests, which were condemned by Willy Brandt. In the ensuing time, loudspeaker cars were sporadically set up at the Wall, urging the GDR border guards not to shoot at refugees and warning them of possible consequences. As a result of the shootings, West German groups lodged complaints with the UN Commission on Human Rights. The non-partisan Kuratorium Unteilbares Deutschland (Committee for an Indivisible Germany) sold protest placards and lapel pins in all of West Germany against the border regime and its consequences. Initially, West Berlin's regulatory authorities gave fugitives covering fire if they were being fired at by GDR border guards. This resulted in at least one lethal incident on 23 May 1962, when the border guard Peter Göring was shot dead by a West Berlin policeman while firing 44 times at a fleeing boy.|$|E

Recent Hollywood {{films have}} begun to show their {{component}} parts and workings <b>in</b> <b>plainer</b> <b>view</b> as budgets and blockbusting ambitions escalate. Think of Coppolla’s Dracuh, and Scorsese’s Cape Fear, for instance.

After three days of {{negotiations}} without progress, Stairs gave Msiri an ultimatum to sign the treaty the next day, 20 December 1891. When Msiri did not appear, he sent his second-in-command, Captain Bodson to arrest Msiri, who stood his ground. Bodson shot him dead, and a fight broke out. The expedition took their wounded and Msiri's body back to their camp where Stairs was waiting, and there they cut off Msiri's head and hoisted it on a pole <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>view</b> as a 'barbaric lesson' to his people. Some of the Garanganze were massacred by the expedition's askaris, {{and most of the}} rest fled into the bush.|$|E
25|$|From August 2003 until November 2005, the Cathedral {{closed for}} {{extensive}} remodeling {{to unify the}} church’s décor from the numerous renovations throughout the years. In this renovation were significant additions, including a Eucharistic chapel, two side chapels, and a large crucifix below the domed crossing. But the largest change was the re-opening of the dome, which was closed in the 1930s for acoustic reasons. The Eucharistic chapel (or Blessed Sacrament Chapel) pays an architectural homage to the chancel screens of medieval churches. It allows for the tabernacle to remain <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>view</b> of the congregation and be {{in line with the}} High Altar while also allowing for a private devotional space outside of the celebration of the Mass.

500|$|The Supreme Court {{has held}} that {{individuals}} in automobiles have a reduced expectation of privacy, because (1) vehicles {{generally do not}} serve as residences or repositories of personal effects, and (2) vehicles [...] "can be quickly {{moved out of the}} locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought." [...] Vehicles may not be randomly stopped and searched; there must be probable cause or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.

500|$|Under the Fourth Amendment, {{search and}} seizure (including arrest) should be limited in scope {{according}} to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central questions: what government activities constitute [...] "search" [...] and [...] "seizure"; what constitutes probable cause for these actions; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed. Early court decisions limited the amendment's scope to a law enforcement officer's physical intrusion onto private property, but with Katz v. United States (1967), the Supreme Court held that its protections, such as the warrant requirement, extend to the privacy of individuals {{as well as physical}} locations. Law enforcement officers need a warrant for most {{search and seizure}} activities, but the Court has defined a series of exceptions for consent searches, motor vehicle searches, evidence <b>in</b> <b>plain</b> <b>view,</b> exigent circumstances, border searches, and other situations.|$|E
2500|$|Historical {{archaeologists have}} {{incorporated}} Foucauldian theories into {{the understanding of}} plantation landscapes. On plantation sites throughout the Americas, plantation owners utilized surveillance methods to restrict the behaviors of the enslaved populations. James A.

[...] This was largely done through architectural techniques such as incorporating positions where panoptic views can be achieved into the construction of planters and/or overseers homes or by constructing slave villages that were <b>in</b> the <b>plain</b> <b>view</b> or line {{of sight of the}} homes of the overseer and/or plantation owner.|$|R

Such a system has mostly been replaced either by a central wort-collection vessel or the arrangement of outlet ports into concentric zones, with each zone having a ring-shaped collection pipe.
