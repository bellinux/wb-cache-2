This review evaluates the incidence and impact of constipation {{on the lives of}} patients with OAB being treated with darifenacin. Methods: Constipation data from published Phase III and Phase IIIb/IV darifenacin studies were reviewed and analyzed. Over 4000 patients with OAB (aged 18 &ndash; 89 years; &ge; 80 % female) enrolled in nine studies (three Phase III [data from these fixed-dose studies were pooled and provide the primary focus for this review], three Phase IIIb, and three Phase IV). The impact of constipation was assessed by discontinuations, use of concomitant laxatives, patient-reported perception of treatment, and a bowel habit questionnaire. Results: In the pooled Phase III trials, 14. 8 % (50 / 337) of patients on darifenacin 7. 5 mg/day and 21. 3 % (71 / 334) on 15 mg/day experienced constipation compared with 12. 6 % (28 / 223) and 6. 2 % (24 / 388) with tolterodine and placebo, respectively. In addition, a few patients discontinued treatment due to constipation (0. 6 % [2 / 337], 1. 2 % [4 / 334], 1. 8 % [4 / 223], and 0. 3 % [1 / 388] in the darifenacin 7. 5 mg/day or 15 mg/day, tolterodine, and placebo groups, respectively), or required concomitant laxatives (3. 3 % [11 / 337], 6. 6 % [22 / 334], 7. 2 % [16 / 223], and 1. 5 % [6 / 388] in the darifenacin 7. 5 mg/day or 15 mg/day, tolterodine, and placebo groups, respectively). Patient-reported perception of treatment quality was observed to be similar between patients who experienced constipation and those who did not. During the long-term extension study, a bowel habit questionnaire showed only small numerical changes over time in frequency of bowel movements, straining to <b>empty</b> <b>bowels,</b> or number of days with hard stools. Conclusion: While constipation associated with darifenacin was reported in &le; 21 % of the patient population, it only led to concomitant laxative use in approximately one-third of these patients and a low incidence of treatment discontinuation. These data suggest that constipation did not impact patient perception of treatment quality. Keywords: antimuscarinics, tolerability, overactive bladde...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Surgery for pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, and {{hysterectomy}} are {{the most}} common gynaecological surgeries that can affect the function of the bladder and bowel as well as one's sexual life. There is evidence that adequate patient information given preoperatively regarding expected outcomes of surgery is important because well-informed patients are more satisfied with the results of surgery and recover faster. However, there is little known about the amount and quality of information given to women before surgery. This study investigates whether women received information before gynaecological surgery on the effect of surgery with respect to the functioning of the bladder (micturition, ability to stay continent) and the <b>bowel</b> (<b>empty</b> <b>bowel)</b> as well as the surgery's effect on sexual functioning. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted. Women undergoing hysterectomy, surgery for vaginal prolapse, or surgery for urinary incontinence (n =  972) and included in the Swedish National Register for Gynaecological Surgery participated in the study. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to the women along with the preoperative questionnaire from the register. RESULTS: About 50 % of the women undergoing prolapse surgery were supplied with information regarding the effect of the surgery with respect to remaining continent, to <b>emptying</b> <b>bowels,</b> micturitaion, and sexual life. One out of four women undergoing hysterectomy received information about the effect of the surgery on the sexual life and bladder function. In the incontinence group, the given information about the surgery's effect on bladder function and sexual function was 80 and 30 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surgery in the vagina and the genital organs may affect function of the organs close to the surgical area (i. e., bladder and bowel) and may affect sexual function. According to this study, women are inadequately informed before surgery. Access to information via oral and written counselling needs to be improved...|$|R

In addition, more information is needed on interindividual variability of these measurements. AIM: To examine the relations between stool form and gastric <b>emptying,</b> small <b>bowel</b> and colonic transit. METHODS: Regional gut transit was assessed scintigraphically and segmental colonic transit was also quantified by radio-opaque markers. On two occasions, 32 healthy volunteers (12 men, 20 women) were studied, women during the follicular and luteal phases of menstruation, men twice within a similar four week period. Diets were standardised and stool form was recorded on a seven point scale. RESULTS: Women had significant harder stools; hard stools were correlated significantly with slow transit and loose stools with fast transit through the colon.

40|$|The {{wireless}} motility/pH capsule (WMC) is an orally ingested, nondigestible, {{data recording}} device {{that enables the}} simultaneous assessment of regional and whole gut transit. Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration {{for the evaluation of}} patients with suspected delayed gastric emptying and the evaluation of colonic transit time in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation, this capsule continuously measures the temperature, pH, and pressure of its surrounding environment while traveling through the gastrointestinal tract (via gut peristalsis) until exiting the body through the anus. Validated patterns in pH and temperature recordings allow for accurate measurement of gastric <b>emptying,</b> small <b>bowel</b> transit, colonic transit, and whole gut transit times. The WMC is a nonradioactive, office-based, gastrointestinal transit testing modality shown in several clinical trials to be a suitable alternative to scintigraphy and radiopaque marker studies in measuring gastric <b>emptying,</b> small <b>bowel,</b> colonic, and whole gut transit times. Unlike widely available transit tests, which provide only region-specific transit data, the WMC offers the benefit of measuring gastric, small bowel, and colonic transit times in a single examination. The WMC also provides intraluminal pressure readings throughout the digestive tract, offering a noninvasive means by which to assess gastrointestinal motility. The WMC should be considered the transit study of choice for individuals suspected of having altered transit in more than one region of the gastrointestinal tract. This review summarizes the features and performance characteristics of the WMC as well as provides a summary on how this diagnostic modality is most effectively used in the assessment of gastrointestinal symptom complexes due to suspected abnormalities in transit...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{organized}} {{to assess the}} relationship of enuresis nocturna (EN) and upper airway obstruction (UAO) in children. Material and Methods: This study was multi-centrically and prospectively designed including 79 children who presented to a urology clinic with symptoms of EN between January 2013 and February 2014. Sixty-four age-matched children with no history of urological complaints were randomly recruited from children admitted to a pediatric clinic as a control group. All children and parents were asked {{to fill out a}} dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES) questionnaire and children were examined by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist to evaluate the UAO. Descriptive statistics, chisquare and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to compare variables. Results: The mean ages of the 79 children (48 male, 31 female) in the study group and the 64 children (41 male, 23 female) in the control group were 10. 14 +/- 3. 38 and 9. 17 +/- 2. 85, respectively. Family history of the study showed that 19 % of the children’s mothers, 10 % of the children’s fathers and 37 % of the children’s siblings had experienced EN. There was {{a significant difference between the}} study and the control groups in terms of urge to urinate, bladder <b>emptying,</b> <b>bowel</b> symptoms and psychological stress. There was also a significant difference between rates of tonsillar hypertrophy and nasopharynx obstruction in the EN group (p = 0. 009). Conclusion: In this study we found that half of the children with EN had tonsillar hypertrophy, which was significantly higher than in the control group.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and coping strategies for individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s disease (CD), and to study {{the effect of a}} group-based patient information on anxiety/depression and HRQoL. HRQoL and anxiety/depression were investigated (n= 492) (Study I). In Study II, anxiety/depression, HRQoL, satisfaction with information and evaluation of the patient information were studied (n= 49). Coping with disease activity was investigated in 166 patients reporting current exacerbation (Study III). Fifteen patients were interviewed about disease-related stress, how this is managed and the need of support from the health care (Study IV). Patients with UC reported better HRQoL and less anxiety/depression than did patients with CD during both remission and exacerbation. Satisfaction with information had increased at follow-up 6 months after patient information. The information and the possibility to discuss with lecturers and group members were valued as most important. No change was found in anxiety/depression or HRQoL at follow-up. Both problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies were employed to cope with disease activity, with no difference between patients with UC or CD. The urgent need of toilet availability and stress associated to social situations were the major disease-related stressors. This stress was managed by finding out the location of toilets, bringing toilet paper and extra underwear and <b>emptying</b> <b>bowel</b> before an activity. The patients wanted information and possibilities to talk to experienced staff and to other patients about how to live with the disease. This thesis shows that HRQoL for some patients with UC, and primarily for patients with CD, is impaired. Thus medical staff should be observant of the psychosocial well-being of patients with CD and also of patients with relapse. Methods to identify and support patients with anxiety/depression and poor HRQoL need to be developed. Interventions should target the patient’s specific problems and at appropriate times...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{examine the}} {{association}} between self-reported lower urinary tract symptoms and bowel habits in men in a large, cross-sectional, population based cohort study. Materials and Methods: The study included 3, 077 men participating in the 2005 - 2006 or 2007 - 2008 cycles of the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) who were 40 years old or older and without a history of prostate cancer. Men were considered to have lower urinary tract symptoms if they reported nocturia, urinary hesitancy and/or incomplete bladder <b>emptying.</b> <b>Bowel</b> habits were characterized by frequency of bowel movements per week and stool consistency based on the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Weighted associations between bowel habits and lower urinary tract symptoms were determined using univariate and multivariate techniques, adjusting for age, race, body mass index, diabetes, alcohol intake, activity level and smoking. Results: The prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms was 37 %, with 4 % reporting all 3 symptoms. Reporting 3 or fewer bowel movements per week was associated with nocturia (OR 1. 67, 95 % CI 1. 21 - 2. 30), incomplete bladder emptying (OR 2. 14, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 4. 31) and urinary hesitancy (OR 2. 06, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 4. 02). Reporting more than 10 bowel movements per week was associated with nocturia only (OR 1. 42, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 55). Hard (OR 1. 76, 95 % CI 1. 31 - 2. 37) and loose (OR 1. 25, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 55) stool consistency increased the odds of reporting nocturia. Conclusions: Lower urinary tract symptoms in the adult male were independently associated with low stool frequency, hard stool type and loose stool type. These data suggest causality or a common pathophysiology of lower urinary tract symptoms and abnormalities of bowel habits. © 2013 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc...|$|R

During the intervals of enema administration the colon is empty and thus the child kept from being constipated or having episodes of fecal soiling/incontinence. Since its introduction in 1980 (Malone et al. 1980) this procedure- the Malone or MACE (Malone antegrade continence enema) has undergone many modifications and is now widely used in the management of refractory constipation and fecal incontinence in children with myelomeningoceles, neuropathic conditions for example spina bifida, anorectal malformations, Hirschsprung’s disease and chronic intractable constipation (Imai et al. 2014; Hoekstra et al. 2011; VanderBrink et al. 2013).|$|R
