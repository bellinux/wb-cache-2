25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E
25|$|The old fleurs-de-lis, {{especially}} the ones found <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> kings' sceptres, {{have a lot}} less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas , or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, {{is the fact that}} the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.|$|E

Sinden sat out several players from the first game, {{including}} Don Awrey, Red Berenson, Ken Dryden, Rod Gilbert, Vic Hadfield, Jean Ratelle, Mickey Redmond and Rod Seiling. Hadfield took the benching hard, as he was from the Toronto area and felt he was being embarrassed {{in front of his}} home town. On defence, Serge Savard, Pat Stapleton and Bill White were added. On offence, Stan Mikita, Wayne Cashman and J. P. Parise were added. Tony Esposito took over goaltending duties. Sinden's changes were to get [...] "the diggers into the game and try to grind the Russians down.

500|$|In early 1844, Halkett {{successfully}} {{tested a}} prototype boat-cloak on the River Thames, paddling it [...] without taking on any water, despite, in his words, being [...] "met by—passed by—and almost run down by—various Metropolitan Steamers plying {{to and fro}} in their several vocations, and causing no little commotion in the troubled waters of the River". Buoyed by this success, he took the prototype boat-cloak with him while on naval service, using it whenever the opportunity arose to test it under various sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett hoped to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions, in the rough seas of the Bay of Biscay, but the weather was unusually calm. He was forced to take down his umbrella, and paddle, recalling later that [...] "the winds that day were too civil by half, and the sleepless bay almost quite dormant". The boat-cloak was positively received by explorers; John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819–1822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that [...] "Had we been possessed of such a contrivance <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely".|$|E
2500|$|If {{there are}} only two CMGs in the cluster, as <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> example, then anti-parallel {{alignment}} will inevitably occur if the total stored angular momentum reaches zero.

[...] However it sometimes happens that after malfunctions a cluster is left with only two working CMGs, and the control program must {{be able to deal with}} this situation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} {{situation in}} which we can determine convergence is when the spectral sequences degenerates. [...] We say that the spectral sequences degenerates at sheet r if, for any s ≥ r, the differential ds is zero. [...] This implies that Er ≅ [...] E'r+1 ≅ E'r+2 ≅ ... In particular, it implies that Er is isomorphic to E∞. [...] This is what happened <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>first,</b> trivial example of an unfiltered chain complex: The spectral sequence degenerated at the first sheet. [...] In general, if a doubly graded spectral sequence is zero outside of a horizontal or vertical strip, the spectral sequence will degenerate, because later differentials will always go to or from an object not in the strip.|$|E

2500|$|... "Iqbal Qasim came in, {{a little}} left-hander. I {{chose to go}} round the wicket and {{obviously}} we put men round the bat, 'Brears' (Mike Brearley the captain) at first slip, Graham Roope, Bob Willis, 'Both' all round the bat. I just bowled it right and it was magic really; it just turned a fraction and bounced, and 'Iqqie' nicked it. Brears just dived to his left and caught the ball about a foot off the ground, landed in front of Roopey and Willis, Iqqie just looked up the wicket at me, nodded, said, 'Well bowled'; the umpire went bananas, shaking hands and saying, 'I've never seen a hat-trick before, well bowled.' And ironically this was on my debut. 12 months previously, on the same ground, Peter Petherick of New Zealand had just done the first hat-trick ever on debut, so {{it would have been}} 12 months to the day {{and it would have been}} a unique place in history." [...] "But Mike in landing got a lot of gravel on the back of his hand. Iqqie left the field and all the lads were up there when suddenly Brears started saying, ‘I’m going to bring him back because I don't think I caught it cleanly.' All the lads around him were adamant he had caught it a foot off the ground, but he said, 'No, for the best interests of this series I'm going to bring him back.' So he brought him back – and for the best interests of the series, six of us were lbw <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> innings.
