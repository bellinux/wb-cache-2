5|$|In December 2005, Michael Schiavo {{created a}} {{political}} action committee, TerriPAC. It {{was formed to}} raise money to support right-to-die candidates and oppose candidates who had voted for <b>government</b> <b>involvement</b> in the Schiavo case. In 2007, TerriPAC paid a $1,350 fine to the Federal Election Commission for failing to file complete and timely records. Schiavo shut down the PAC later that year.|$|E
5|$|Cyber Rights {{analyzes}} {{the legal issues}} involved with communicating on the Internet, including those relating to Internet privacy and <b>government</b> <b>involvement.</b> The book is written with a first-person perspective: the reader learns of the author's morning ritual, {{the fact that his}} cat is named Francie and that he married a woman he met through a Bulletin Board System. Godwin's motivation was to keep the Internet safe from government actions that restrict freedom of speech. He asserts that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution should apply equally to the Internet as it does to other media.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1943, Madgwick {{participated in}} {{government}} educational {{planning for the}} post-war years. He {{played a major role}} in the establishment of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme to provide government assistance to ex-servicemembers to complete or undertake university education. In 1944 Madgwick and colleagues began drafting their vision for post-war adult education and articulated their vision at the Workers Education Association of New South Wales Conference, held 10–11 March 1944 in Sydney. They followed-up the conference with a formal, published paper, which called for heavy Commonwealth <b>government</b> <b>involvement</b> and expenditures on adult education. Their proposed plan, however, was rejected by the Prime Minister's office, which, to Madgwick's disappointment selected a more modest program. Madgwick's active duty service ended in March 1946 and he was transferred to reserve officer status on 19 April 1946.|$|E

5|$|Shiloh's {{importance}} as a Civil War battle, {{coupled with the}} lack of widespread agricultural or industrial development in the battle area after the war, led to its development {{as one of the first}} five battlefields restored by the federal government in the 1890s. <b>Government</b> <b>involvement</b> eventually proved insufficient to preserve the land on which the battle took place. (The federal government had saved just over 2,000 acres at Shiloh by 1897, and consolidated those gains by adding another 1,700 acres by 1954.) Preservation eventually slowed. Since 1954, only 300 additional acres of the saved land had been preserved. Private preservation organizations stepped in to fill the void. The Civil War Trust became the primary agent of these efforts, preserving 1,158 acres at Shiloh since its inception. The land preserved by the Trust at Shiloh included tracts over which Confederate divisions passed as they fought Grant's men on the battle's first day and their retreat during the Union counteroffensive on day two. A 2012 campaign focused in particular on a section of land which was part of the Confederate right flank on day one and on several tracts which were part of the Battle of Fallen Timbers.|$|E

25|$|In USA {{domestic}} politics, Schneerson supported <b>government</b> <b>involvement</b> {{in education}} and welcomed {{the establishment of the}} United States Department of Education in 1980, yet insisted that part of a school's educational mission was to incorporate the values espoused in the Seven Laws of Noah.

25|$|Some who {{advocate}} against greater <b>government</b> <b>involvement</b> in healthcare have {{asserted that the}} difference in costs {{between the two nations}} is partially explained by the differences in their demographics. Illegal immigrants, more prevalent in the U.S. than in Canada, also add a burden to the system, as many of them do not carry health insurance and rely on emergency rooms— which are legally required to treat them under EMTALA— as a principal source of care. In Colorado, for example, an estimated 80% of undocumented immigrants do not have health insurance.|$|E
