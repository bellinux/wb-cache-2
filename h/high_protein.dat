5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost. Their <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> and fat content also makes them a good alternative to live enriched Artemia when feeding juveniles (especially those {{that are difficult to}} maintain such as young seahorses) and other small fauna.|$|E
5|$|In some cultures, insects, {{especially}} deep-fried cicadas, {{are considered}} to be delicacies, whereas in other places they form part of the normal diet. Insects have a <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> content for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as a major source of protein in human nutrition. In most first-world countries, however, entomophagy (the eating of insects), is taboo.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fruit and insects, although small reptiles and frogs have been recorded. The fruits consumed are often from the plant families Lauraceae, Annonaceae, and Rubiaceae, although a few other plant families have also been reported in their diet. They are one of many species recorded following army ants. They occasionally will eat <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> fruits, but they prefer to eat the other fruits on their menu.|$|E

5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabadi haleem {{is a high}} calorie dish {{which gives}} instant energy as it {{contains}} slow-digesting and fast-burning ingredients. It also contains dry fruits rich in anti-oxidants. The meat and dry fruits make it a <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> food. A new low-cholesterol variety by using emu meat, rich in minerals, phosphorus and vitamins, was introduced in 2013. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), a local civic body that monitors health and safety regulations in the city, has set up hygiene and quality standards {{to be followed by}} the eateries selling it.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. A study of the bohor reedbuck's diet in Rwenzori Mountains National Park (Uganda) revealed that, throughout the year, the most preferred species was Sporobolus consimilis. Other grasses the animals fed on included Hyparrhenia filipendula, Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, {{all of which are}} species commonly found in heavily grazed grasslands. Bohor reedbuck preferred Cynodon dactylon and Cenchrus ciliaris in the wet season, and switched to Sporobolus pyramidalis and Panicum repens in the dry season. Though they rarely feed on dicots, these can include Capparis and Sida species. On regularly burnt pastures, the bohor reedbuck feeds on Imperata species, while in places close by water sources, it eats Leersia and newly sprouted Vossia species (like topi and puku).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Soy {{protein and}} {{carbohydrate}} at different ratios were blended with latex to form composites. The variation of protein-to-carbohydrate ratio {{has a significant}} effect on the composite properties, and the results from dynamic mechanical method showed a substantial reinforcement effect. The composites reinforced by the filler with <b>higher</b> <b>protein</b> content had <b>higher</b> moduli than the composites with higher carbohydrate content. Soy carbohydrate also appeared to have ability to immobilize polymer chains compared to soy protein. The fatigue experiments showed that the composites with <b>higher</b> <b>protein</b> content were more elastic than the composites with higher carbohydrate content after repeatedly stressed with dynamic strain cycles. The recovery experiments showed that the moduli of the composites with <b>higher</b> <b>protein</b> content had better long-time recovery after deformation. The analysis of equilibrated residual structure after the stress-softening cycles showed that the composites with <b>higher</b> <b>protein</b> content were resilient without yielding until a larger strain was applied, while the composites with higher carbohydrate content had a continuous yielding in their structures as the magnitude of the strain was increased. Overall, the study shows that soy fillers with higher protein/carbohydrate ratio have potential to be used as rubber reinforcement...|$|R

5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is highly flexible. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become sexually mature {{at the age of}} three to four years, while females can conceive at just one year of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. Though there is no fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. The calves are weaned at eight to nine months of age.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E

25|$|Urine {{contains}} {{large quantities}} of nitrogen (mostly as urea), as well as reasonable quantities of dissolved potassium. The exact composition of nutrients in urine varies with diet, in particular nitrogen content in urine is related to quantity of protein in the diet.

25|$|<b>High</b> dietary <b>protein</b> {{from animal}} sources: Research has found an {{association}} between diets <b>high</b> in animal <b>protein</b> and increased urinary calcium, and {{have been linked to}} an increase in fractures. However, the relevance of this observation to bone density is unclear, since <b>higher</b> <b>protein</b> diets tend to increase absorption of calcium from the diet and are associated with higher bone density. Indeed, it has recently been argued that low protein diets cause poor bone health. No interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{large volume}} of human {{clinical}} data supports increased dietary protein for favorable changes to body composition, but not all data are conclusive. The aim of this review is to propose two theories, “protein spread theory” and “protein change theory” {{in an effort to}} explain discrepancies in the literature. Protein spread theory proposed that {{there must have been a}} sufficient spread or % difference in g/kg/day protein intake between groups during a protein intervention to see body composition and anthropometric differences. Protein change theory postulated that for the <b>higher</b> <b>protein</b> group, there must be a sufficient change from baseline g/kg/day protein intake to during study g/kg/day protein intake to see body composition and anthropometric benefits. Fifty-one studies met inclusion criteria. In studies where a <b>higher</b> <b>protein</b> intervention was deemed successful there was, on average, a 58. 4 % g/kg/day between group protein intake spread versus a 38. 8 % g/kg/day spread in studies where a <b>higher</b> <b>protein</b> diet was no more effective than control. The average change in habitual protein intake in studies showing <b>higher</b> <b>protein</b> to be more effective than control was + 28. 6 % compared to + 4. 9 % when additional protein was no more effective than control. Providing a sufficient deviation from habitual intake appears to be an important factor in determining the success of additional protein in weight management interventions. A modest increase in dietary protein favorably effects body composition during weight management interventions. </p...|$|R

25|$|Farming of {{chickens}} on an industrial scale relies largely on <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> feeds derived from soyabeans; in the European Union the soybean dominates the protein supply for animal feed, and the poultry industry {{is the largest}} consumer of such feed. Two kilograms of grain must be fed to poultry to produce 1kg of weight gain, much less than that required for pork or beef. However, for every gram of protein consumed, chickens yield only 0.33 g of edible protein.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another problem}} is {{bringing}} the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled out of the water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill's liquids. Experiments {{have been carried out}} to pump krill, while still in water, through a large tube on board. Special krill nets also are currently under development. The processing of the krill must be very rapid since the catch deteriorates within several hours. Its <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> and vitamin content makes krill quite suitable for both direct human consumption and the animal-feed industry.|$|E
25|$|However, in 2000, {{the warning}} labels were removed because {{scientists}} learned that rodents, unlike humans, {{have a unique}} combination of high pH, high calcium phosphate, and <b>high</b> <b>protein</b> levels in their urine. One {{or more of the}} proteins that are more prevalent in male rats combine with calcium phosphate and saccharin to produce microcrystals that damage the lining of the bladder. Over time, the rat's bladder responds to this damage by overproducing cells to repair the damage, which leads to tumor formation. Since this does not occur in humans, there is no elevated risk of bladder cancer.|$|E
