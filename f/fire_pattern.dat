50|$|Soukyugurentai is a vertical-scrolling shooter. The player picks one {{of three}} {{different}} ships - red, green or blue - each with their own pilot, <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> and laser web. Each ship has a standard gun and a bomb, but the most distinctive of these aspects is the laser-web: holding down the button for the standard gun will release a lock-on laser-web traditionally shaped as a cone or semicircle, which will destroy the enemies it locks onto after releasing the buttons. Each ship has two different lock-on weapons that function as web-designed laser targets. Once an enemy enters the web's range, the player can destroy the enemy or multiple enemies can be destroyed via homing lasers or multiple fire-balls. The game is unusual in that, rather than using a 3:4 aspect ratio to better suit the vertically-oriented gameplay, it uses a horizontal monitor (4:3) {{in the style of}} Neo Geo vertical shooters as well as the later Radiant Silvergun and Giga Wing.|$|E
40|$|An unnoticed chaotic <b>firing</b> <b>pattern,</b> lying between period- 1 and period- 2 <b>firing</b> <b>patterns,</b> has {{received}} little attention {{over the past}} 20 years since it was first simulated in the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) model. In the present study, the rat sciatic nerve model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) {{was used as an}} experimental neural pacemaker to investigate the transition regularities of spontaneous <b>firing</b> <b>patterns.</b> Chaotic <b>firing</b> lying between period- 1 and period- 2 firings was observed located in four bifurcation scenarios in different, isolated neural pacemakers. These bifurcation scenarios were induced by decreasing extracellular calcium concentrations. The behaviors after period- 2 <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> in the four scenarios were period-doubling bifurcation not to chaos, period-doubling bifurcation to chaos, period-adding sequences with chaotic firings, and period-adding sequences with stochastic firings. The deterministic structure of the chaotic <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> was identified by the first return map of interspike intervals and a short-term prediction using nonlinear prediction. The experimental observations closely match those simulated in a two-dimensional parameter space using the HR model, providing strong evidences of the existence of chaotic firing lying between period- 1 and period- 2 <b>firing</b> <b>patterns</b> in the actual nervous system. The results also present relationships in the parameter space between this chaotic firing and other <b>firing</b> <b>patterns,</b> such as the chaotic firings that appear after period- 2 <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> located within the well-known comb-shaped region, periodic <b>firing</b> <b>patterns</b> and stochastic <b>firing</b> <b>patterns,</b> as predicted by the HR model.

40|$|On-off <b>firing</b> <b>patterns,</b> {{in which}} {{repetition}} of clusters of spikes are interspersed with epochs of subthreshold oscillations or quiescent states, {{have been observed}} in various nervous systems, but the dynamics of this event remain unclear. Here, we report that on-off <b>firing</b> <b>patterns</b> observed in three experimental models (rat sciatic nerve subject to chronic constrictive injury, rat CA 1 pyramidal neuron, and rabbit blood pressure baroreceptor) appeared as an alternation between quiescent state and burst containing multiple period- 1 spikes over time. Burst and quiescent state had various durations. The interspike interval (ISI) series of on-off <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> was suggested as stochastic using nonlinear prediction and autocorrelation function. The resting state was changed to a period- 1 <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> via on-off <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> as the potassium concentration, static pressure, or depolarization current was changed. During the changing process, the burst duration of on-off <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> increased and {{the duration of the}} quiescent state decreased. Bistability of a limit cycle corresponding to period- 1 firing and a focus corresponding to resting state was simulated near a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation point in the deterministic Morris-Lecar (ML) model. In the stochastic ML model, noise-induced transitions between the coexisting regimes formed an on-off <b>firing</b> <b>pattern,</b> which closely matched that observed in the experiment. In addition, noise-induced exponential change in the escape rate from the focus, and noise-induced coherence resonance were identified. The distinctions between the on-off <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> and stochastic <b>firing</b> <b>patterns</b> generated near three other types of bifurcations of equilibrium points, as well as other viewpoints on the dynamics of on-off <b>firing</b> <b>pattern,</b> are discussed. The results not only identify the on-off <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> as noise-induced stochastic <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> near a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation point, but also offer practical indicators to discriminate bifurcation types and neural excitability types...|$|R

The quality of seismic data judged from a comparison {{between the amount of}} reflection signals received by signal interference received. Three-dimensional seismic survey (3 D) provides an overview of the subsurface geology accuracy better than seismic two- dimensional (2 D). Seismic three-dimensional (3 D) generally require a higher cost than the two-dimensional (2 D) because the density of the firing point and the receivers more.

30|$|Given {{the history}} of using <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> within the <b>fire</b> {{investigation}} profession, it was reasonable that they would also {{be included in the}} first edition (1992), and all subsequent editions of NFPA 921 Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigations. NFPA 921 is recognized as establishing the standard of care for the fire investigation profession and is the only consensus document that exists for fire investigators. The importance of <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> is clearly reiterated in Section 6.1. 1 by stating “the major objective of any fire scene examination is to collect data as required by the scientific method. Such data include the patterns produced by the fire” (NFPA 2014). The chapter on <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> underwent reorganization between the 2004 – 2008 editions to divide fire effects and <b>fire</b> <b>patterns.</b> This {{was the first time that}} a distinction was drawn between damage caused by the fire (fire effects) and clusters of fire effects that may have characteristics that assist the <b>fire</b> investigator (<b>fire</b> <b>patterns).</b> <b>Fire</b> effects are the physical or chemical changes that occur to different materials when exposed to the byproducts of combustion (e.g. melting of plastics, oxidation of metals). <b>Fire</b> <b>patterns</b> are identified as the collection of these effects and geometric shapes that these effects produced.|$|R
30|$|As the {{definition}} from the term <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> has evolved {{and will continue}} to evolve, it is important to define what a pattern is first.

The present study provides novel biological experimental findings regarding complex bifurcation scenarios from period- 1 bursting to period- 1 spiking with chaotic <b>firing</b> <b>patterns.</b> These bifurcations were found to be similar to those simulated using the Hindmarsh-Rose model across two separated chaotic regions. One chaotic region lay between period- 1 and period- 2 burstings. This region has not attracted much attention.

40|$|The {{activity}} of single nucleus accumbens (NAcc) neurons of rats was extracellularly recorded during intravenous cocaine self-administration sessions (0. 7 mg/kg per infusion, fixed ratio 1). We reported previously that NAcc neurons showed a change, usually a decrease, in firing rate {{during the first}} 1 min after the cocaine-reinforced lever press. This postpress change {{was followed by a}} progressive reversal of that change, which began within the first 2 min after the press and was not complete until the last 1 min before the next lever press (termed the change � progressive reversal <b>firing</b> <b>pattern).</b> In the present study we documented a regular pattern of locomotion that occurred in parallel with the change � progressive reversal <b>firing</b> <b>pattern.</b> This observation suggested that discharges time locked to locomotion may determine the change � progressive reversal <b>firing</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, 55 % of the neurons failed to show firing time locked to locomotion that could have contributed to the change � progressive reversal <b>firing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Moreover, for all neurons, the change � progressive reversal <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> was apparent even if the calculation of firing rate excluded all periods of locomotion. The present data showed that the change � progressive reversal <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> is not solely attributable to phasic changes in firing time locked to the execution of locomotion. The change � progressive reversal <b>firing</b> <b>pattern</b> closely mirrors changes in drug level and dopamine overflow observed by previous researchers and may thus be a component of the neurophysiological mechanism by which drug level regulates drug-taking behavior during an ongoing self-administration session.

30|$|Beginning in March of 2005, {{a series}} of 20 {{full-scale}} <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> tests were conducted at Eastern Kentucky University (Gorbett et al. 2006; Hopkins et al. 2007; Hopkins et al. 2008; Hopkins et al. 2009; Gorbett 2010; Gorbett et al. 2013). The test fires were conducted in identically constructed, finished and furnished living room and bedroom compartments within a burn building. These studies focused on <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> reproducibility, pattern persistence through flashover, the use of fire patterns in origin determination {{and the influence of}} initial, low HRR fuel on <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> production. The researchers discuss that similar truncated cone patterns were identified in the first eight tests (Gorbett et al. 2006). The most important finding from these tests is that “the interpretation of all fire effects provides substantial evidence for the investigator to identify the correct area of origin” (Gorbett et al. 2010). These studies contended that the use of the heat and flame vector analysis enabled the investigator to determine the true area of origin. Fire effects were listed for each test, fire patterns identified and formal heat and flame vector analysis legends and diagrams were provided for each test. However, no procedural details were provided on how to implement the analysis.|$|E
30|$|Currently, no {{systematic}} method {{exists for}} fire investigators {{to identify a}} <b>fire</b> <b>pattern.</b> Developing a process for the objective identification of areas requiring further attention during fire investigation that is universally accepted by the community is recommended to increase the reliability and accuracy of fire origin determinations.|$|E
30|$|The {{investigator}} typically assigns {{an interpretation}} to each <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> {{as to how}} {{it may have been}} created, which in turn assists the investigator in determining how the fire spread.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review the work that has been done to observe or measure varying damage along compartment and content surfaces, identify <b>fire</b> <b>patterns,</b> identify causal factors for the <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> and apply this information within a process to identify an area of origin, as well as identify gaps and propose new approaches. A literature review was performed in order to achieve the objectives of this study. The literature was received from different databases, primarily ScienceDirect (2012), International Symposium on Fire Investigations conference proceedings, Fire and Arson Investigator-Journal for the International Association of Arson Investigators and fire investigation textbooks. The following keywords were used for the literature review, including: <b>fire</b> <b>patterns,</b> <b>fire</b> effects, fire investigation, arson investigation, burn patterns and burn indicators.|$|R
30|$|The first {{insistence that}} {{decision}} analysis {{should be considered}} for <b>fire</b> <b>patterns</b> analysis was in 2010 (Gorbett et al. 2010).

30|$|In 1997 The United States Fire Administration (USFA), in {{conjunction}} with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Building and Fire Research Laboratory (NIST-BFRL) launched the <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> research committee and produced the USFA <b>Fire</b> <b>Pattern</b> Test report (Shanley et al. 1997). This project consisted of 10 separate full-scale tests to produce the first scientifically controlled and recorded research into the formation, growth and investigation of patterns produced in fires. These tests produced the first published data that supported fire patterns as being useful in fire investigation. However, this report also demonstrated that in two tests, “distinctive patterns were produced which without careful study and a full understanding of all factors which influenced the progress and growth of the fire, could easily be interpreted to indicate incorrect or multiple origins” (Shanley et al. 1997).|$|E
30|$|A conical {{pattern has}} been {{characterized}} as one that is produced when the interacting buoyant fire plume is restricted by an intersecting horizontal surface, spreading the heat {{across the bottom of}} the obstructing surface. The surface then redirects the buoyant flow and its momentum across the bottom of the ceiling creating a ceiling jet, which begins to descend from the ceiling as an upper layer (Hicks et al. 2008). This causes the plume to widen horizontally in the upper layer causing damage to the intersecting surfaces. A two-dimensional <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> is expected to form on the vertical surface interface (i.e. walls) {{in the form of a}} funnel or cone with the vertex at the bottom. This <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> has been proposed to indicate a fuel package that has reached a HRR sufficient to create a flame plume that reaches the horizontal surface (i.e. ceiling).|$|E
30|$|Floor {{patterns}} were found lacking {{in many of}} the <b>fire</b> <b>pattern</b> tests where the compartment transitioned to a fully involved state (Shanley et al. 1997; Wood et al. 2012; Mealy et al. 2013).

The magnocellular vasopressin neurons of the hypothalamus do have an output that is both well understood and quantifiable: they secrete a hormone into the bloodstream in proportion to blood osmolarity and volume, regulating these properties within a narrow physiologically acceptable range. This response of vasopressin secretion to osmotic pressure must be maintained to defend blood pressure.
