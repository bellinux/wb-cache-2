50|$|Although {{designed}} to observe in three frequency bands: 1.6 GHz, 5.0 GHz, and 22 GHz, {{it was found}} that the sensitivity of the 22 GHz band had severely degraded after orbital deployment, probably caused by vibrational deformation of the <b>dish</b> <b>shape</b> at launch, thus limiting observations to the 1.6 GHz and 5.0 GHz bands.|$|E

The vest absorbs the energy from the deforming bullet, bringing it to a stop before it can completely penetrate the textile matrix. Some layers may be penetrated but as the bullet deforms, the energy is absorbed by a larger and larger fiber area.|$|E

5000|$|The PM-79 is a small, {{circular}} Bulgarian blast-resistant anti-personnel mine, superficially {{similar to}} the Russian PMN. The mine uses a unique trigger design; {{on the top of}} the mine, beneath a thin rubber cover is a <b>dish</b> <b>shaped</b> pressure plate. Pressure on the outer rim of the <b>dish</b> <b>shaped</b> plate levers up a central post, which triggers the mine. The mine also incorporates a mechanical arming delay using a pin cutting through a thin lead strip. The mine arms in between two minutes and four hours depending on the temperature.|$|R

50|$|The spit of land at Spurn Head was militarised in 1805 during Napoleonic times. In 1914 when Britain went to {{war against}} Germany, Spurn was {{upgraded}} with a railway being built to bring in supplies and ammunition. The headland was used for military purposes during the Second World War and was finally de-militarised in 1959. Sound Mirrors were built at Kilnsea, Boulby and Redcar in 1916. The concrete blocks had a hollowed out <b>dish</b> <b>shape</b> that pointed out towards the sea. They were early form of RADAR being able to detect ships and aircraft up to 25 miles away.|$|E
50|$|The Titicaca orestias was {{characterized}} by a unique pattern of pores on the head. Large thick scales lined the median dorsal ridge and thinner smaller scales surrounded the ridge. Between these two areas of skin were patches with no scales. Unlike most other species of Orestias, the scales of the adult O. cuvieri were granulated. The concave <b>dish</b> <b>shape</b> of its body and jaw further helped distinguish O. cuvieri from other species of Orestias. The anatomy of O. cuvieri closely resembled a species of trout which is now found in Lake Titicaca, a similarity which has led many researchers to hypothesize that competition {{between the two groups}} was the reason for the extinction of O. cuvieri.|$|E
50|$|Lukasa are {{approximately}} the same size (20-25 centimeters long and about 13 centimeters wide) and have the same rectangular <b>dish</b> <b>shape.</b> A row of carved mounds called lukala runs across their concave surface, dividing it in half. Beads and shells {{are attached to the}} board by small slivers of wood or hand-made iron wedges driven through their centers, and cowrie shells are frequently attached at the top and bottom. Beads are arranged in three ways: a large bead surrounded by smaller beads, a line of beads, and one isolated bead. Each configuration lends itself to the transmission of certain kinds of information. Board surfaces also have holes and lines cut into them.|$|E

50|$|The Cyrtogomphoceratidae are {{a family}} in the {{cephalopod}} order Discosorida that comprises genera commonly with compressed, endogastrically curved shells. Siphuncles lie close to the ventral side, segments are broadly inflated, connecting rings thick and apically expanded thick bullettes. Chambers are short, separated by shallow, <b>dish</b> <b>shaped</b> septa. Apertures are generally simple.|$|R
5000|$|Van Leeuwen creates strikingly baroque objects, {{made up of}} {{many small}} prints of shells and fruit, which remind of the curio {{cabinets}} that were in fashion in the 17th century and admired by her. It was in vogue among the wealthy merchants of that era to collect new types of fruit and shells that were brought back by the VOC ships, in such cabinets. Van Leeuwen uses shells and fruit to make plaster press moulds, which are then used for producing large quantities of prints. From these prints she creates her objects, always using the pot or <b>dish</b> <b>shape</b> as a basis. Her objects are flawless both {{on the inside and}} outside, a ceramic tour de force. She uses dishes and pots with lids as her base shapes. In addition, she creates combinations of ceramic [...] "garnitures", which were also common during the 17th century." ...|$|E

With the large capital investment needed in such a plant it becomes critical to optimize the system at the field level, {{as well as at}} the individual unit level. In this new software model, we provide a tool that predicts the annual and monthly energy performance of a field of dishes, in particular taking into account the impact of dish-to-dish shading on the energy and revenue streams.

40|$|Application of {{a thermal}} source in {{non-contact}} forming of sheet metal {{is known for}} some time. Replacement of this thermal source with a laser beam promises the much greater controllability of the process. To date, research focuses on dealing with rectangular plates, {{and only a few}} studies are presented for axis-symmetric geometries like circular plates. This study presents the work to get the dish or bowl shape by an initially flat circular plate. Two different scanning strategies circular and radial are attempted to get the desired <b>dish</b> <b>shape.</b> Following the unexpected distortion throughout the plate, a second series of experiments are conducted {{on a wide range of}} specimen geometries. An interesting phenomenon is observed. It is suggested that homogeneous dissemination of heat along with combined form of both of the scanning strategies, could have more potential to form dome shape.

40|$|Thermotogales are rod-shaped, Gram-negative, anaerobic, (hyper) thermophiles {{distinguished}} by an outer sheath-like toga, which comprises an outer membrane (OM) and an amorphous layer (AL). Thermosipho globiformans bacteria can transform into spheroids with multiple cells concurrently with AL disintegration during early growth; the cell {{is defined as}} the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) plus the entity surrounded by the CM. Spheroids eventually produce rapidly moving periplasmic 2 ̆ 7 progenies 2 ̆ 7 through an unknown mechanism. Here, we used high-temperature microscopy (HTM) to directly observe spheroid generation and growth. Rod OMs abruptly inflated to form 2 μm-diameter balloons. Concurrently, multiple globular cells emerged in the balloons, suggesting their translocation and transformation from the rod state. During spheroid growth, the cells elongated and acquired a large <b>dish</b> <b>shape</b> by possible fusion. Spheroids with dish-shaped cells further enlarged to 12 μm in diameter. HTM and epifluorescence-microscopy results collectively indicated that the nucleoids of dish-shaped cells transformed to form a ring shape, which then distorted to form a lip shape as the spheroid enlarged. HTM showed that 2 ̆ 7 progenies 2 ̆ 7 were produced in the spheroid periplasm. Transmission electron microscopy results suggested that the 2 ̆ 7 progenies 2 ̆ 7 represented immature progenies lacking togas, which were acquired subsequently...|$|E

(1) The formations of both of the reefs were ascertained to be two hillock shaped, with the similar side figures shown; as to the figures of the central parts it may be said that in case of {{the concrete}} blocks it was of a saddle shape, and in case of the tire blocks, of a concaved <b>dish</b> <b>shape.</b> (2) On and along the concaved parts of the both reefs, dense gatherings of the big shaped migrating as well as stationary fishes were noted; especially, Trachrus japonicus, Parapristipoma trilineatum, Apogon semilineatus and Plectorhynchus pictus were numerous. (3) Almost all the fish schools allured towards the concrete blocks were bigsized ones; while in case of the tire reefs, small sized immature fishes were numerous, {{the reason why the}} sizes of the gathering fishes were full of variety was assumed to be due to the difference in the structural features of the respective reefs; in other words, in the former cases the open spaces are big enough to let the big sized fishes be through and in the latter cases those are too small to let them be through, only letting the small ones be in. 枕崎市沖合に設置されているコンクリートブロック魚礁とタイヤ魚礁について潜水観察を実施した結果,次のような知見を得た。 (1) 両魚礁の形態は,側面形状の酷以した 2 山型であるが,中央部分の形状が,コンクリートブロック魚礁では鞍型,タイヤ魚礁では皿型の凹みをなしている。 (2) 両魚礁のこの凹みの部分には,回遊性,定座性の大型魚および小型魚が密群をつくる。特にイサキ,ネンブツダイ,アジ,コショウダイが多い。 (3) コンクリートブロック魚礁に蝟集している魚群はほとんど成魚が多い。特にイサキ・マダイは顕著である。このように蝟集魚の体型に差があるのは,魚礁の個体の構造が異なるためであろう...|$|E

The land is pierced, the nail knocked through from the outside, the rove punched on while the head is held up by a dolly (a small portable anvil, usually of cylindrical shape). The nail is cut off just proud of the rove and the cut end clenched over the rove while the dolly is used to hold the nail in place. In planking up clinker work, one man can hold both dolly and clenching hammer. Although this is common where sawn frames are to be used, boats intended for steamed timbers are usually nailed but not clenched until the timbering out is complete. As timbering is a two handed job it is more efficient to leave the clenching until help is at hand then the helper dollies up, whilst the builder sits inside the hull and clenches up.|$|R
