40|$|A {{method and}} an {{associated}} digital computer program {{for evaluating the}} vibrational characteristics of large liquid-filled rigid wall tanks of general shape are presented. A solution procedure was developed in which slosh modes and frequencies are computed for systems mathematically modeled as assemblages of liquid finite elements. To retain sparsity in the assembled system mass and stiffness matrices, a compressible liquid element formulation was incorporated in the program. The approach taken in the liquid finite element formulation is compatible with triangular and quadrilateral structural finite elements so that the analysis of liquid motion can be coupled with <b>flexible</b> <b>tank</b> wall motion at some future time.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} numerical method for the computation of the modal parametes of fluid-filled cylindrical tanks with diaphragm covers of flexible built-in sloshing plates. For {{the handling of}} the threedimensional problem, two known discreting methods are coupled. The finite element method is used for the approximation of the mechanical behaviour of the <b>flexible</b> <b>tank,</b> while a description of the incompressible, irrotational fluid is made applying the boundary element method. Coupling of the discreted continua via the dynamic and kinematic interim conditions leads to the algebraic eigenvalue problem to be solved, which represents the interaction between free or bounded fluid surface and flexible structure. By way of examples with tanks of different construction the natural oscillation of the fluid-structure interaction is analysed. The threedimensional FEM-BEM Method presented in this paper allows the modeling also of complex, completely asymmetrical systems with more or less prominent imperfections. By that, the former compulsion to map to simpler subsystems, for example by semi-analytical modes of proceeding as they are dealt with in the literature, is eliminated. (orig.)

40|$|M&D Professional Services, Inc. (M&D) {{is under}} {{subcontract}} to Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL) to perform seismic {{analysis of the}} Hanford Site Double-Shell Tanks (DSTs) {{in support of a}} project entitled ''Double-Shell Tank (DSV Integrity Project-DST Thermal and Seismic Analyses) ''. The overall scope of the project is to complete an up-to-date comprehensive analysis of record of the DST System at Hanford in support of Tri-Party Agreement Milestone M- 48 - 14. The work described herein was performed in support of the seismic analysis of the DSTs. The thermal and operating loads analysis of the DSTs is documented in Rinker et al. (2004). The overall seismic analysis of the DSTs is being performed with the general-purpose finite element code ANSYS'. The global model used for the seismic analysis of the DSTs includes the DST structure, the contained waste, and the surrounding soil. The seismic analysis of the DSTs must address the fluid-structure interaction behavior and sloshing response of the primary tank and contained liquid. ANSYS has demonstrated capabilities for structural analysis, but has more limited capabilities for fluid-structure interaction analysis. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate the capabilities and investigate the limitations of the finite element code MSC. Dytranz for performing a dynamic fluid-structure interaction analysis of the primary tank and contained waste. To this end, the Dytran solutions are benchmarked against theoretical solutions appearing in BNL 1995, when such theoretical solutions exist. When theoretical solutions were not available, comparisons were made to theoretical solutions to similar problems, and to the results from ANSYS simulations. Both rigid tank and <b>flexible</b> <b>tank</b> configurations were analyzed with Dytran. The response parameters of interest that are evaluated in this study are the total hydrodynamic reaction forces, the impulsive and convective mode frequencies, the waste pressures, and slosh heights. To a limited extent, primary tank stresses are also reported. The capabilities and limitations of ANSYS for performing a fluid-structure interaction analysis of the primary tank and contained waste were explored in a parallel investigation and documented in a companion report (Carpenter and Abatt [2006]). The results of this study were used in conjunction with the results of the global ANSYS analysis reported in Carpenter et al. (2006) and the parallel ANSYS fluid-structure interaction analysis to help determine if a more refined sub-model of the primary tank is necessary to capture the important fluid-structure interaction effects in the tank and if so, how to best utilize a refined sub-model of the primary tank. The results of this study demonstrate that Dytran has the capability to perform fluid-structure interaction analysis of a primary tank subjected to seismic loading. With the exception of some isolated peak pressures and to a lesser extent peak stresses, the results agreed very well with theoretical solutions. The benchmarking study documented in Carpenter and Abatt (2006) showed that the ANSYS model used in that study captured much of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) behavior, but did have limitations for predicting the convective response of the waste. While Dytran appears to have stronger capabilities for the analysis of the FSI behavior in the primary tank, it is more practical to use ANSYS for the global evaluation of the tank. Thus, Dytran served the purpose of helping to identify limitations in the ANSYS FSI analysis so that those limitations can be addressed in the structural evaluation of the primary tank...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} {{comprehensive study of}} the dynamic response of storage tanks containing high-level radioactive wastes in nuclear facilities. Of the many issues that are peculiar to these systems, four important ones have been studied. Accordingly, the study is presented in four parts. The first part deals with the dynamic response of <b>flexible</b> <b>tanks</b> that are placed inside concrete vaults and {{are attached to the}} vaults both at the top and the bottom. The tanks are presumed to be fixed at the base and supported by either a roller or a hinge at the top. The response quantities examined include the natural frequencies of vibration, the hydrodynamic pressures and the induced tank forces. The general trends are established by comparing the response quantities for the top-constrained systems with those for base-excited cantilever systems. The second part deals with the response of rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>tanks</b> containing stratified liquids. The liquid is considered to be arranged in layers with varying layer thicknesses and mass densities, or to be inhomogeneous with a continuously varying mass density. In addition to the free vibrational sloshing characteristics of the liquid, the responses examined include the vertical displacements at the free surface, and the impulsive and convective components of the hydrodynamic wall pressures and associated tank forces. A simplified analytical procedure that estimates the response quantities for the layered systems from corresponding solutions for homogeneous systems is also presented. The third part presents an exploratory study for assessing the effects of tank-base flexibility on the response of vertically excited liquid storage tanks. A suitable model of the tank-liquid-foundation-soil system is considered, and the natural frequencies, the associated damping ratios and the induced pressures are studied {{for a wide range of}} base-flexibility values. The final part estimates the effects induced by the impact of the sloshing liquid on the tank roof. Consideration is given not only to the effects that are induced on the roof but also to the effects that are transferred to the side-wall. Both rectangular and cylindrical systems are considered and the effect of changing the slope of the roof on the induced impact effects is also studied...|$|R

Spurred on by its new CEO, Jean-Louis Gerondeau, and with the support of shareholders and the IDI (Institut pour le Développement Industriel - French Institute for Industrial Development), the Group recovered by 1977. In 1983, Zodiac was the first company to be listed on the ‘Second Market’ of the Paris Stock Exchange. The firm conducted an international development policy and increases its acquisitions, thereby enabling it to position itself in niche markets on a global scale. In 1978, it acquired Aérazur Constructions Aéronautiques and thus re-entered the aerospace market. In 1979, it acquired EFA (Parachutes), which {{led to the creation of}} the aerospace segment, and continued its development in marine and aerospace with the acquisitions of Bombard-L’Angevinière (ranked second in inflatable boats), Sevylor (leading French producer of light PVC inflatable structures) in 1981 and Superflexit (<b>flexible</b> <b>tanks)</b> in 1983, as well as the takeover of Parachutes de France (sport parachutes). In 1987, Zodiac acquired Air Cruisers (leader in evacuation slides), Metzeler (inflatable boats), B.

40|$|A {{previous}} investigation of sloshing in liquid-container interaction systems {{has shown that}} sloshing frequencies of the liquid are almost not affected by structures having a first natural frequency much {{higher than that of}} the liquid sloshing frequencies. However, for large and more <b>flexible</b> <b>tanks</b> as occur in LNG ships, the floating frequencies of the ship are normally of a similar low value to the sloshing frequencies of the liquid in a tank. Therefore, the coupling between the sloshing liquid, the floating structure and seaway is of importance in characterising the dynamic behaviour of the complete system. In this paper, an integrated liquid – LNG tank – water interaction system is numerically investigated. It is shown that complex coupling mechanisms exist within the overall integrated system. To illustrate the findings six cases are studied. Namely, 1) liquid sloshing in a fixed rigid tank, 2) sloshing of external water, 3) elastic tank only, 4) internal liquid-tank interaction, 5) elastic tank- external water interaction and 6) internal liquid-elastic tank-external water interaction. The natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modes of this complex coupled system are obtained and these numerical results provide an insight into the complex dynamic behaviour of the integrated interaction system. The guidelines proposed may be of use for the dynamic design of LNG carriers to ensure safety whilst operating in a rough seaway...|$|R
