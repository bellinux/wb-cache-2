50|$|There are {{two aspects}} to surface integrity: {{topography}} characteristics and surface layer characteristics. The topography {{is made up}} of surface roughness, waviness, errors of form, and flaws. The surface layer characteristics that can change through processing are: plastic deformation, residual stresses, cracks, hardness, overaging, phase changes, recrystallization, <b>intergranular</b> <b>attack,</b> and hydrogen embrittlement. When a traditional manufacturing process is used, such as machining, the surface layer sustains local plastic deformation.|$|E
5000|$|If under-deposit or crevice {{corrosion}} is of primary concern, {{it is important}} to note non-uniformity of deposit thickness (e.g., deposit waviness), localized fouling, packing of confined regions with deposits, creation of occlusions, [...] "crevices", [...] "deposit tubercles", or sludge piles. Such deposit structures can create environment for underdeposit corrosion of the substrate material, e.g., <b>intergranular</b> <b>attack,</b> pitting, stress corrosion cracking, or localized wastage. Porosity and permeability of the deposits will likely influence the probability of underdeposit corrosion. Deposit composition can also be important - even minor components of the deposits can sometimes cause severe corrosion of the underlying metal (e.g., vanadium in deposits of fired boilers causing hot corrosion).|$|E

Using high-resolution imaging and fine-probe chemical analysis methods, ultrafine size oxides present inside cracks and <b>intergranular</b> <b>attacks</b> were nanoscale characterized. Results revealed predominance of Cr 2 O 3 oxide and Ni-rich metal zones at the majority of encountered crack tip areas and at leading edge of <b>intergranular</b> <b>attacks.</b> However, NiO-structure oxide was predominant far from crack tip zones and within cracks propagating along twin boundaries and inside grains. These observations permit to suggest a mechanism for intergranular stress corrosion cracking of Alloy 600 in PWR primary water. Indeed, {{the results suggest that}} stress corrosion cracking is depending on chromium oxide growth in the grain boundary. Oxide growth seems to be dependent on oxygen diffusion in porous oxide and chromium diffusion in strained alloy and in grain boundary beyond crack tip. Strain could promote transport kinetic and oxide formation by increasing defaults rate like dislocations...|$|R

Emphasis {{has been given}} to the effect of microstructure on stress corrosion crack initiation and propagation in Al-Li-Cu-Mg-Zr alloys (e. g. 8090 and 8091). In particular, the use of both isothermal and duplex ageing routes to develop overaged microstructures with increased resistance to stress corrosion crack initiation has been assessed and significantly, crack propagation plateau velocities of both under and peak aged 8090 were found to compare favourably with both 2024 -T 3 and 7075 -T 651. The applicability of accepted test methods developed for conventional medium and high strength aluminium alloys for determining exfoliation resistance of Al-Li-Cu-Mg-Zr alloys has been evaluated and results have been obtained which illustrate the hazards of relying on visual ratings to compare exfoliation performance.

40|$|The {{effect of}} welding speed on {{strength}} and corrosion behavior of FSW 2024 -T 3 joints {{was investigated in}} the present study. For both strength and corrosion, {{the transition from the}} thermo-mechanically affected to the heat affected zone (TMAZ/HAZ) {{turned out to be the}} most critical site. Higher welding speeds produced both a smaller hardness drop in the TMAZ/HAZ and a smaller width of the softened zone. Thereby, tensile strength could be improved and the <b>intergranular</b> corrosion <b>attack</b> localized to the overaged TMAZ/HAZ could be reduced. Paradoxically, at lower heat input (i. e. at higher welding speed), the weld nugget region also suffered enhanced intergranular corrosion. SEM examinations of the top surface of FSW 2024 -T 3 joints revealed the presence of constitutionally melted Al 2 MgCu (S-phase) particles in that region. The S-phases were mainly localized to the advancing side of the joint, and their volume fraction increased with growing welding speed. Hence it is suggested that a focalization of the thermal source resulted in incipient melting. Eutectic S-phases were formed and served as preferential corrosion sites lowering corrosion resistance of the weld nugget...|$|R

Laboratory tests were carried out in a furnace up to 200 h. Metal and gas temperature were kept constant at 500 degreesC. Pilot scale tests were carried out by using a 0. 3 X 0. 3 m cross-sectional combustor, with flue gas velocity of 5 m/s.

40|$|Degradation {{mechanisms}} in conventional refratories, structural ceramics, and metallic alloys were revealed by examination of materials exposed to industrial and synthetic flue gases. Deterioration of refractory oxides and oxide structural ceramics involved formation of new liquid, glass, and solid phases, {{which resulted in}} loss of structural integrity. Destructive stresses associated with volume changes {{in the case of}} new solid phases were sometimes increased by thermal cycling. In the case of silicon carbide ceramics the viscosity of the normally protective oxide film was lowered by reaction with alkali oxides, which resulted in enhanced oxygen diffusion and active oxidation. Silicon carbide was also attacked by halide-containing atmospheres. Degradation was also caused by excessive temperatures, thermal cycling, and stresses caused by adhering slags.

40|$|A dense HfB 2 ceramic {{material}} was prepared by hot pressing {{in the presence}} of 2. 5 wt. % Si 3 N 4, as a sintering aid. The microstructure consisted of a fine HfB 2 matrix with refractory secondary phases (BN, HfO 2, Hf(C,N,O)) and Si, mainly located at the triple points. The material corrosion behavior in acid and alkaline solutions of chlorides and sulphates was investigated by means of several experimental techniques, that is potentiodynamic polarization curve recording and potentiostatic tests coupled to solution chemical analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) surface chemical characterization. Sintered HfB 2 undergoes an electrochemical corrosion attack of the HfB 2 phase and a chemical corrosion attack, mainly localized on the secondary phases. In acid sulphate solution a strong corrosion attack on the diboride phase occurs which leaves a secondary phase skeleton. In acid chloride solution and in alkaline chloride and sulphate solutions, the rate of secondary phase dissolution is quicker than the dissolution rate of the primary diboride phase and an <b>intergranular</b> corrosion <b>attack</b> morphology occurs. The Si phase dissolves relatively fast only in alkaline solutions. In analogy with the corrosion behaviour of ZrB 2, corrosion of HfB 2 phase is thought to produce both soluble and insoluble (hafnium and boron oxides) corrosion products. In acid sulphate solution the soluble corrosion products are mainly boric acid and a sulphate complex of Hf(IV). In the other solutions they are mainly constituted by boric acid (or borates, depending on the solution pH).

40|$|Even though highly {{corrosion}} resistant in general, AlMgSi (6000 -series) alloys may sometimes develop susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC). In this work {{the effect of}} Cu content and various thermomechanical treatments on IGC of AlMgSi model alloy extrusions of nominal composition 0. 55 wt% Mg and 0. 60 wt%Si was investigated. The corrosion susceptibility was tested according to the standard BS 11846 method B, which essentially involved degreasing, alkaline etching, desmutting in concentrated HNO 3 and 24 h immersion in an acidified NaCl solution. The validity of this test as a reliable laboratory tool for qualitative ranking of samples for IGC susceptibility was verified by comparing it to results obtained by outdoor exposure in an industrial-marine environment at Karmøy, located {{on the coast of}} Norway The most important factor causing IGC susceptibility of the model alloys was the Cu content. The high Cu models were susceptible to IGC, although the Cu content was as low as 0. 12 – 0. 17 wt. % Cu. Model alloys with low Cu content (0. 005 – 0. 02 wt. %) were resistant. However, the corrosion mode of the high Cu alloys was strongly related to the thermomechanical history. Therefore, by applying the correct heat treatment, it was possible to reduce or eliminate IGC susceptibility also on the high Cu samples. Samples which were slow-cooled (air cooling) after extrusion and samples which were subsequently solution heat treated gave the most susceptible variants where nearly all grain boundaries exposed to the corrosive test solution were attacked (uniform IGC). Artificial aging reduced the IGC susceptibility by confining the <b>intergranular</b> <b>attacks</b> to localised sites (localised IGC), and near fully resistance to localised corrosion developed in the peak aged temper. Rapid quenching (water quenching) after extrusion prevented IGC, but high susceptibility (uniform IGC) was introduced as a result of short time aging. Further aging to peak hardness reduced IGC susceptibility (local IGC), but did not remove it completely. Overaging introduced slight pitting susceptibility to the air cooled extrusion. In contrast overaging reintroduced localised IGC to the solution heat treated air cooled samples. The solution heat treated and water quenched samples were susceptible to localised IGC both in the the T 6 temper (peak aged) and in the overaged temper. The grain boundary microstructure was also strongly dependent on the thermal history. Samples which were slow-cooled (air cooling) after extrusion and samples which were subsequently solution heat treated exhibited extensive precipitation of large (_ 5 μm) elongated grain boundary precipitates of the equilibrium phases _ (Mg 2 Si) and Q (Al 4 Mg 8 Si 7 Cu 2). The Q-phase was however not present on the low Cu alloys. The shape and size of these precipitates were not affected by artificial aging. On the high Cu alloy, a Cu enriched grain boundary film was additionally present. This film coarsened as a result of artificial aging. Water quenching after extrusion effectively prevented grain boundary precipitation, and this could thus explain the observed resistance of the water quenched high Cu alloys to IGC. Small grain boundary Q-phase precipitates evolved as a result of artificial aging of water quenched samples, which explained slight deterioration of IGC resistance of such samples. The susceptibility to IGC was related to enriched Cu along the grain boundaries, in the form of discrete Q-phase precipitates and the continuous Cu enriched film. IGC was caused by a microgalvanic coupling between the Cu enriched grain boundary (noble) and the adjacent solute depleted zone (active). The Cu containing film formed a continuous cathodic path on the grain boundaries, which resulted in significant (uniform) IGC, characterised by knife-edge attacks along the grain boundaries. Increased IGC resistance was obtained by artificial aging which coarsened the film and broke the continuous microgalvanic path, resulting in coarse localised IGC or a surface virtually resistant to all forms of localised corrosion. The present work showed that IGC can be avoided or eliminated either by reducing the Cu content or applying the correct thermomechanical treatment. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

Understanding the mechanisms and methods for dealing with these processes and with corrosion in general has been and {{is critical to the}} safety of critical components of aircraft. Discussion of cases where IG attack and exfoliation caused issues in structural integrity in aircraft in operational fleets is presented herein along with a much more detailed presentation of the issues involved in dealing with corrosion of aircraft. Issues of corrosion and fatigue related to the structural integrity of aging aircraft are introduced herein. Mechanisms of pitting nucleation are discussed which include adsorption-induced, ion migration-penetration, and chemicomechanical film breakdown theories. In addition, pitting corrosion (PC) fatigue models are presented as well as a critical assessment of their application to aircraft structures and materials. Finally environmental effects on short crack behavior of materials are discussed, and a compilation of definitions related to corrosion and fatigue are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Steam {{generator}} began having severe problems 20 years ago. The main causes were wastage, wear, loose parts, denting. These {{problems were}} solved {{by changing the}} water chemistry treatment method. Therefore these damage types were replaced by stress corrosion cracking on the inner surface of the tubes and most recently by <b>intergranular</b> <b>attack</b> and stress corrosion cracking on the external surface of the tube. Steam generator has experienced various forms of damage, most involving some kind of corrosion. Some of these problems have been virtually eliminated, others are successfully managed, but a few {{have not yet been}} brought under control. This study is to evaluate the environmental effects on the susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in Cr-Mo alloy under simulated crevice condition. The test is simulated by producing drop, wet and evaporation process. The XRF measurement is performed to investigate the amount and distribution of chromium carbide of grain boundaries. The tests are performed in the alkalic and acidic solution under various strain rates...|$|E
