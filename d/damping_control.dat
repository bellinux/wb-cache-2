40|$|In recent years, many {{advanced}} control {{strategies have}} been proposed for wave energy converters (WECs), which significantly increase the energy conversion rate of the devices. So far, most of these control schemes have only been investigated theoretically using simulations, which, to a great extent, are based on idealized assumptions. On the contrast, far less information regarding the testing of these control schemes in experimental setups can be found. Under such circumstances, the control performance might be compromised by many factors such as model uncertainties, measurement noise, or delay. This paper compares {{the performance of a}} spring <b>damper</b> <b>control</b> and an advanced control strategy for a point absorber WEC in wave tank experiments. For two different irregular sea states, the energy conversion of the advanced control, which uses an observer to estimate the wave excitation force, is compared to the performance of a spring <b>damper</b> <b>control.</b> The results show that, with the advanced controller around 13 %- 14 %, more energy could be converted when compared to the spring <b>damper</b> <b>control.</b> Additionally, the observing process was found to be critical in the advanced control.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} the first ever racing vehicle yaw control system that utilises active dampers to provide a corrective yaw moment through the manipulation of tyre contact patch loads during transient vehicle handling manoeuvres. The study has focused on the following three key areas, 1) The design of a magneto-rheological (MR) damper The damping requirements of a racing vehicle are investigated. A prototype magneto- rheological damper is proposed and evaluated using magnetic finite element techniques. The manufactured prototype is subsequently tested and benchmarked against a passive racing damper and a commercially available MR damper. Consideration is given to the current driver circuit required, the damper response time to increasing and decreasing demand signals and sealing and bearing requirements. 2) A novel yaw damping strategy utilising active MR dampers This work proposes a novel active damping strategy for vehicle yaw control. The dampers are used to control both the pitch and roll damping distribution during transient vehicle handling manoeuvres. It is shown that this approach improves the functionality of previous <b>damper</b> based yaw <b>control</b> that only considered roll damping distribution. 3) In-Vehicle implementation and track testing An in-vehicle <b>damper</b> <b>control</b> system is developed using hardware that has not previously been employed in this application. This study is the first to apply a <b>damper</b> based yaw <b>control</b> system to a racing vehicle. Track testing of the racing vehicle fitted with the <b>damper</b> <b>control</b> system is used to demonstrate the potential improvements achievable in the context of lap time, subjective driver feel and measured yaw error.

Since the field-dependent damping force shows the hysteretic behavior which significantly affects to control characteristics of the system, Preisach hysteresis model for the MR damper is established and its first order descending (FOD) curves are experimentally identified.

40|$|One key design {{variable}} that {{has largely been}} neglected in control-structure design is passive structural damping. Passive damping improves nominal performance by elim-inating degrading structural vibrations resulting in improved control characteristics and lowered required effort. A great advantage of added passive damping in SISO con-trolled structures is the improved stability and performance robustness characteristics given plant uncertainties. Theoretical formulations verifying the improved stability robustness characteristics on simple controlled structures are derived based on phase margin, gain margin and root locus properties of the structures. Numerical studies performed on more complicated systems verify the improved design characteristics for passively <b>damped</b> <b>controlled</b> structures. The theory is expanded to include MIMO controlled structures where the robustness properties of these systems are greatly affected by uncertainties in plant directions.

40|$|The {{non-linear}} behaviour of electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR) dampers {{makes it}} difficult to design effective control strategies, and as a consequence a wide range of control systems have been proposed in the literature. These previous studies have not always compared the performance to equivalent passive systems, alternative control designs, or idealised active systems. As a result it is often impossible to compare the performance of different smart <b>damper</b> <b>control</b> strategies. This article provides some insight into the relative performance of two MR <b>damper</b> <b>control</b> strategies: on/off control and feedback linearisation. The performance of both strategies is benchmarked against ideal passive, semi-active and fully active damping. The study relies upon a previously developed model of an MR damper, which in this work is validated experimentally under closed-loop conditions with a broadband mechanical excitation. Two vibration isolation case studies are investigated: a single-degree-of-freedom mass-isolator, and a two-degree-of-freedom system that represents a vehicle suspension system. In both cases, a variety of broadband mechanical excitations are used and the results analysed in the frequency domain. It is shown that although on/off control is more straightforward to implement, its performance is worse than the feedback linearisation strategy, and can be extremely sensitive to the excitation conditions...|$|R
