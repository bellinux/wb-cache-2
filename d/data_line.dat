5|$|Some tablet computers, {{such as the}} Microsoft Surface, Motorola Xoom, BlackBerry PlayBook, Vizio Vtab 1008 and Acer Iconia Tab A500, {{implement}} HDMI using Micro-HDMI (Type D) ports. Others, such as the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer {{implement the}} standard using mini-HDMI (type C) ports. All iPad models have a special A/V adapter that converts Apple's <b>data</b> <b>line</b> to a standard HDMI (Type A) port. Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty-pin port for their Galaxy Tab 10.1 that can adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives. The Dell Streak 5 smartphone/tablet hybrid is capable of outputting over HDMI. While the Streak uses a PDMI port, a separate cradle is available which adds HDMI compatibility. Most of the Chinese-made tablets running Android OS provide HDMI output using a mini-HDMI (type C) port. Most new laptops and desktops now have built in HDMI as well.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} hardware-level differences. Some chips combine MOSI and MISO {{into a single}} <b>data</b> <b>line</b> (SI/SO); this is {{sometimes}} called 'three-wire' signaling (in contrast to normal 'four-wire' SPI). Another variation of SPI removes the chip select line, managing protocol state machine entry/exit using other methods. Anyone needing an external connector for SPI defines their own: UEXT, JTAG connector, Secure Digital card socket, etc. Signal levels depend entirely on the chips involved.|$|E

25|$|As mentioned, one {{variant of}} SPI uses single {{bidirectional}} <b>data</b> <b>line</b> (slave out/slave in, called SISO) {{instead of two}} unidirectional ones (MOSI and MISO). This variant is restricted to a half duplex mode. It tends {{to be used for}} lower performance parts, such as small EEPROMs used only during system startup and certain sensors, and Microwire. Few SPI master controllers support this mode; although it can often be easily bit-banged in software.|$|E

50|$|Data {{is eight}} bits {{starting}} with the least significant bit. The <b>Data</b> <b>line</b> is set according to the bit to send (1=true=ground). Once the <b>Data</b> <b>line</b> is set, the Clock line is released to false. The Clock and Data lines will be held steady for at least 20 µs (except for Commodore 64 that needs 60 µs). After 8 bits has been sent, the talker releases the <b>Data</b> <b>line</b> to false and the listener then acknowledge the talker by pulling the <b>Data</b> <b>line</b> true within 1000 µs. After this the talker sets the Clock line true and listener sets the <b>Data</b> <b>line</b> true thus back where the transmission begun.

The proposed bus encoding scheme consist in silencing the middle two <b>data</b> <b>lines</b> of each subset which consists of 4 -bit. We present a technique to eliminate correlated switching in the 4 -bit <b>data</b> <b>lines</b> and also minimize self-transitions in these <b>data</b> <b>lines.</b> Experimental {{results indicate that the}} presented bus encoding scheme reduces the number of self-transitions by 20 % and it also increases the number of silent lines by 9 %. In addition, it reduces the power dissipation by 46 % compared Bus-Invert method. Index Terms—bus encoding, crosstalk delay, coupling effect, low power design I...|$|R

The host sets the <b>Data</b> <b>line</b> true and releases the Clock line to false. The device waits for the Clock line to go false and then pulls it to true and release the <b>Data</b> <b>line</b> to false. After this sequence the standard talk-listener interaction may follow.|$|E

[...] When the listener detects the 200 µs timeout, it must acknowledge this by pulling the <b>Data</b> <b>line</b> true for at least 60 µs, and then release it. The talker can revert to transmitting again within 60 µs by pulling the Clock line true.|$|E
