40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} on the zircon chlorination process. The chlorination was conducted (i) with static zircon-coke powder mixtures in {{horizontal and vertical}} reactors, (ii) with zircon-coke mixed powder compacts in the two reactors, and (iii) <b>with</b> a <b>sintered</b> zircon <b>disc</b> and a grooved carbon disc. Experiments with the zircon and carbon discs clearly revealed that physical contact between zircon and coke was mandatory for the chlorination to occur. It was also observed that a faster chlorination rate and a higher extent of chlorination with static charge were achieved if the charge was compacted prior to chlorination. This was explained as being due {{to the formation of}} fine zircon and coke particles in intimate contact with each other. Due to the complexity of zircon carbo-chlorination, system specific rate expressions have been proposed. For a loose charge in a horizontal static bed reactor, the rate expression was linear, while for a compacted (and crumbled) zircon-coke mixture held in a vertical pipe reactor the reduced time plots technique was used to arrive at the rate expression, {{which turned out to be}} the Ginstling-Brounshtein expression...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in processing technologies {{which can lead}} to more energy efficient sintering of metal powders. Microwave sintering has recently been shown to reduce energy usage as the volumetric heating process is considerably more efficient than resistance heating. RF plasma sintering meanwhile has been shown to deliver heat via uniform excitation of the processing gas resulting in ion bombardment of the workpiece. In this study the use of a rapid, novel microwave-assisted plasma sintering (MaPS) technology for processing of nickel-diamond metal matrix composites is evaluated. Nickel powder and polycrystalline diamond were mixed to prepare 20 mm discs under uniaxial compaction pressures of 100, 200 and 300 MPa. The discs were fired in a low pressure microwave plasma under a hydrogen atmosphere. For comparison, <b>discs</b> were also <b>sintered</b> using conventional tube furnace firing. The MaPS sintering is very rapid with full disc strength of > 1000 N, based on 3 -point bend tests, being achieved within 10 minutes compared with 8 hours for furnace treatment.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{technique}} for assessing the propensity of activated sludge to suffer from biological foaming is to measure foam potential. This involves measuring the amount of foam produced from sludge under conditions of controlled aeration. Two approaches have been adopted: (1) Air is passed through specially designed columns from fine porous diffusers at a fixed rate to form uniform sized bubbles or (2) employing Alka-Seltzer? tablets which effervesce when added to the sludge. Both tests generate foam formation which can then be quantified. Foam assessment in activated sludge is reviewed. A <b>sintered</b> <b>disc</b> aeration column was compared with the Alka-Seltzer? test method and both methods examined under a range of different environmental conditions. Foam potential measured by the <b>sintered</b> <b>disc</b> method displayed better repeatability compared to the Alka-Seltzer test. The use of a wire cage placed over the tablets greatly improved the precision of the Alka-Seltzer test. A positive linear correlation was also found between foam potential and temperature (4 ? 20 ?C).

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} on the pressure-less sintering of the ZrC> 2 - Y 2 O 3 system that contains 3 mol% Y 2 O 3, and {{the effect that the}} temperature / time relationship has on the properties of the final product. Experiments were performed on two types of commercially available, nano-sized, ZrC> 2 - 3 mol% Y 2 O 3 (3 Y-TZP) powders. An unstabilised zirconia powder was also investigated for comparison purposes. Particle size analysis of these powder yield particle sizes ranging from 1. 29 |xm to 1. 78 pm, suggesting that the particles are heavily prone to agglomeration in water. BET specific surface area analysis showed the powders to be nano-sized as determined using equivalent spherical diameter theory. The density of the powders was measured using helium gas pycnometry. DTA/TGA analysis indicates that binder burnout occurs on heating in the range 300 - 440 °C. Shrinkage and densification rate characteristics of the powders during sintering was investigated using dilatometry. One of the powders demonstrated full shrinkage during isothermal sintering; the other did not. The point of maximum densification rate differed by approximately 100 °C for these powders. A dramatic expansion associated with the tetragonal to monoclinic transformation on cooling from 1400 °C is observed by dilatometry for unstabilised zirconia powder sample but not for stabilised powder samples. This indicates that the sintered samples retain in tetragonal phase on cooling to room temperature. Pressureless conventional sintering and two-step sintering were used to <b>sinter</b> pressed <b>discs.</b> The density of <b>discs</b> which were <b>sintered</b> across a temperature range of 1350 °C to 1550 °C varies between 5. 72 g/cm 3 and 6. 03 g/cm 3, corresponding to 97. 40 % and 99. 10 % of theoretical density respectively.

40|$|Flat {{premixed}} laminar flames {{offer the}} advantage of well-defined conditions with respect to flow field, gas concentrations, temperature profiles, and spatial uniformity. They are, thus, ideally suited for fundamental investigations or reference cases in various areas of combustion research. In our studies, they are used as calibration sources for a laser Raman scattering system. The gas composition in the post-flame region can be accurately calculated by flame simulation codes, e. g., the CHEMKIN/PREMIX computer code from the Sandia National Laboratories [1], and the major species concentrations {{are very close to}} chemical equilibrium. A more complicated task is the determination of the temperatures of the gases because the flames are typically not adiabatic due to heat loss to the burner plate. In the investigations described here, Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) was used to measure the temperatures of 22 “standard ” CH 4 /air flames at atmospheric pressure. This study is an extension of the work published earlier for H 2 /air flames [2]. Burner and Flames The burner is a commercially available flat flame burner <b>with</b> a <b>sintered</b> bronze <b>disc</b> (Holthuis & Associates, formerly McKenna Products) [3]. The diameter of the matrix is 60 mm, the annular shroud flow was not used in these investigations. The matrix was cooled by water with an inlet temperature of 16 °C at a flow rate of 1 liter/s. Methan (purity 99. 5 %) and dry air were premixed and supplied to the burner at room temperature. The flow rates were adjusted by calibrated mass flow meters (Brooks 5850 and 5851) and are accurate within ± 1 %. The reference point within the exhaust gas of the burner and, thus, the measuring location for the temperature was on the axis of the burner 15 mm above the burner plate. This location was chosen because it allows good optical access and because temperature gradients are negligible around this point...|$|R

The use of microwave sintering in particular leads to reduced energy usage during sintering as the volumetric heating process is considerably more efficient compared with resistance heating. In this study the use of a novel plasma microwave processing technology for the sintering of nickel powder discs is evaluated. The sintering study was carried out on 20 mm diameter by 2 mm thick pressed discs of nickel powder, with mean particle size of 1 μm. The discs were fired in a 5 cm diameter microwave (2. 45 GHz) plasma ball under a hydrogen atmosphere at a pressure of 2 kPa. The same <b>discs</b> were also <b>sintered</b> using both non plasma microwave and tube furnace firing. The microwave plasma sintering is very rapid with full disc strength of approx. 1000 N based on 3 [...] point bend tests being achieved within 10 minutes. In contrast the sintering time in the tube furnace involved treatments of up to 6 hours. The non plasma microwave system involved intermediate treatment periods of 1 to 2 hours. Another advantage of the microwave plasma treatment is that the degree of sintering between the individual nickel powder particles can be precisely controlled by the duration of the treatment time in the plasma. There was a broadly linear increase in fired pellet breaking strength with plasma treatment duration. In addition to breaking load, the mechanical properties of the <b>sintered</b> nickel <b>discs</b> were compared based on Rockwell hardness tests and density measurements. The morphology of the <b>sintered</b> <b>discs</b> was compared using microscopy and SEM. This study demonstrated that the plasma microwave <b>sintered</b> <b>discs</b> produced similar or superior performance (depending on processing conditions) to discs fired using the non-plasma microwave and furnace firing conditions.
