40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the case of Bulgaria as a destination for attracting Foreign Direct <b>Investments</b> (FDI). An <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> analysis provides the overall picture as far as the economic level and the development policies that the country followed after 1989, as well as the FDI and the level of the country’s competitiveness level highlighting/pointing out advantages and disadvantages. A formulated model of Bulgaria as an attractive destination for FDI is developed through this analysis. The paper concludes that Bulgaria may offer a friendly environment for establishing FDI but there are important issues/problems that concern the ability of the political power and capacity to design and implement development policies and the lack of urban infrastructures and technology which are major factors for attracting FDI. Yet, the overall effort to promote the image of the country as an investment destination for the period of 2007 - 2012 includes actions that could solve the above issues/problems or could be part of the solution for these problemsterritorial competition, country image, Southeast Europe, FDI, Bulgaria...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{economic cooperation}} between Slovenia and {{the countries of}} the former Yugoslavia. We find the region still highly unstable and bearing a high trade deficit that may prompt the governments in the region to put restrictions on trade. In order to secure exports markets, a number of Slovenian firms are actively drawing foreign direct investment (FDI) into the region. We analyze this increased <b>investment</b> activity <b>in</b> some <b>depth,</b> combining survey and accounting data of Slovenian major investors into the Southeastern European (SEE) region in order to reveal their motivation for FDI. We find that, so far, trade-promoting rather than efficiency-seeking or resource-seeking motives are the driving force behind this increased investment activity. Slovenian firms are predominantly oriented toward increasing sales to the region from their Slovenian headquarters rather than toward setting up SEE production facilities in order to exploit local comparative advantages. The rationale for this is the still too-unstable political and economic environment of the SEE region, the low financial discipline of local customers, and the still underutilized resources of Slovenian-headquartered firms. Trade promotion might be a short-term strategy of Slovenian firms; in the longer run, however, we find some evidence in support of efficiency-seeking and resource-seeking motives. ...|$|R

Root-system architecture (dry matter and projected surface area) and shoot parameters of NIL- 7 A-B- 2 and ‘BarNir’ were evaluated at 40, 62, and 82 days after planting (DAP) in a sand-tube experiment, and root tip number was assessed in a ‘cigar-roll’ seedling experiment, both under well-watered and water-limited (WL) treatments. At 82 DAP, under WL treatment, NIL- 7 A-B- 2 presented greater <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> deep roots (<b>depth</b> 40 – 100 cm) than ‘BarNir,’ with the most pronounced effect recorded in the 60 – 80 cm soil depth (60 and 40 % increase for root dry matter and surface area, respectively). NIL- 7 A-B- 2 had significantly higher root-tip numbers (∼ 48 %) per plant than ‘BarNir’ under both treatments. These results suggest that the introgression of 7 AS QTL from wild emmer wheat induced a deeper root system under progressive water stress, which may enhance abiotic stress resistance and productivity of domesticated wheat...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere are two {{possible}} binocular mechanisms {{for the detection}} of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> One is based on disparity changes over time and the other is based on interocular velocity differences. It has previously been shown that disparity changes over time can produce the perception of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> However, existing psychophysical and physiological data are inconclusive as to whether interocular velocity differences play a role <b>in</b> motion <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> perception. We studied this issue using the motion aftereffect, the illusory motion of static patterns that follows adaptation to real motion. We induced a differential motion aftereffect to the two eyes and then tested for motion <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> <b>in</b> a stationary random-dot pattern seen with both eyes. It has been shown previously that a differential translational motion aftereffect produces a strong perception of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> We show here that a rotational motion aftereffect inhibits this perception of motion <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> even though a real rotation induces motion <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> A non-horizontal translational motion aftereffect did not inhibit motion <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> Together, our results strongly suggest that (1) pure interocular velocity differences can produce motion <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> and (2) the illusory changes in position from the motion aftereffect are generated relatively late in the visual hierarchy, after binocular combination...|$|R
