However, {{the effect of}} a single bout of <b>exercise</b> on central arterial distensibility in older humans is unknown. Furthermore, the effect of <b>exercise</b> training on central arterial distensibility during <b>exercise</b> is unclear. We investigated whether systemic arterial compliance (SAC) changes after acute <b>exercise</b> in older humans, and, if so, whether this change in SAC is enhanced by aerobic <b>exercise</b> training. Seven untrained older women (61 − 69 years old) participated in a 6 -month <b>exercise</b> intervention study. We measured SAC after acute <b>exercise</b> (cycling <b>exercise</b> at 80 % of their individual ventilatory threshold for 30 min) before and after 6 months of aerobic <b>exercise</b> training. After <b>exercise</b> training, the individual ventilatory threshold was significantly increased. In addition, both the SAC at rest and that 30 min after acute <b>exercise</b> were significantly increased after the <b>exercise</b> training program. Before <b>exercise</b> training, there was no significant increase in SAC after acute <b>exercise,</b> whereas, after <b>exercise</b> training, the SAC was significantly increased 30 min after acute <b>exercise.</b> The present study suggests that, after aerobic <b>exercise</b> training, SAC increases after acute <b>exercise</b> in older humans, and that the SAC at rest and after acute <b>exercise</b> is enhanced by aerobic <b>exercise</b> training, thereby causing an effective adaptation in increase in cardiac output during <b>exercise...</b>|$|R

Methods/Design: A total of 195 first-year undergraduate nursing students completed a cross-sectional quantitative survey questionnaire, which included measures of their <b>exercise</b> behavior, the Physical <b>Exercise</b> Self-efficacy Scale, and the <b>Exercise</b> Barriers/Benefits Scale. Results/Findings: The results showed that male students spent more time <b>exercising</b> and had higher <b>exercise</b> self-efficacy compared with female students, but there were no gender differences in the perceived barriers to or benefits of <b>exercise.</b> Fatigue brought on by <b>exercising</b> was the greatest perceived barrier to <b>exercise,</b> whereas increasing physical fitness and mental health were the greatest perceived benefits of <b>exercise.</b> Multiple linear regression showed that gender, <b>exercise</b> self-efficacy, perceived barriers to <b>exercise,</b> and perceived benefits of <b>exercise</b> were independent predictors of <b>exercise</b> behavior.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Exercise</b> {{professionals}} {{can follow}} readily available published guidelines, provided from major health organisations, when designing comprehensive <b>exercise</b> programs consisting of cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor <b>exercise.</b> Paradoxically, when combining {{these types of}} <b>exercise</b> into the same <b>exercise</b> session, there are no current recommendations for the most appropriate <b>exercise</b> order. The {{purpose of this study}} was to provide preliminary evidence for establishing an optimal <b>exercise</b> order of cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor <b>exercise.</b> Methods: A total of 20 participants performed an <b>exercise</b> prescription (ExRx) consisting of all possible sequences (24 combinations) of cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor <b>exercise.</b> Physiological and psychological responses to <b>exercise</b> were measured throughout each <b>exercise</b> session. Repeated-measures ANOVA and polynomial trend analysis were performed to determine if physiological and psychological responses to <b>exercise</b> differed according to <b>exercise</b> order. Results: The mean heart rate (HR) response to cardiorespiratory <b>exercise</b> was significantly different (p 0. 05) when resistance <b>exercise</b> was positioned either first or second in the ExRx; however, post hoc tests showed mean resistance <b>exercise</b> RPE was significantly higher (p 0. 05) were found in the physiological responses to either neuromotor or flexibility <b>exercise</b> across all <b>exercise</b> sequence positions. Conclusion: Results of this novel study provide important preliminary evidence towards formulating recommendations for an optimal sequence of cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility and neuromotor <b>exercise</b> for the ExRx.

In spite of the importance of <b>exercise,</b> few adults <b>exercise</b> regularly, and thus it is important for researchers to determine psychological factors that contribute to <b>exercise</b> adherence. The present paper proposes a model of <b>exercise</b> adherence based on theories of behavior change and motivation, such as Self-Efficacy Theory (Bandura, 1982), and Personal Investment Theory (Maehr 2 ̆ 6 Braskamp, 1986). Briefly, the model suggests that a complex behavior, such as <b>exercise,</b> is mainly a function of cognitive factors, such as goals, self-efficacy, and <b>exercise</b> expectancies. Amount of <b>exercise</b> should then influence these factors in subsequent time periods, and these factors in turn should influence future levels of <b>exercise.</b> ^ To test this model a longitudinal, correlational study was conducted. Thirty-six female and 13 male undergraduate students at a large Midwest university who were interested in beginning an <b>exercise</b> program enrolled in a semester-long independent research course. ^ For ten weeks during the semester subjects completed a daily <b>exercise</b> report and biweekly measures of the importance of their <b>exercise</b> relevant goals, beliefs about their own efficacy regarding <b>exercise,</b> beliefs about <b>exercise</b> outcomes, perceived outcomes of previous <b>exercise,</b> {{and the degree to which}} the <b>exercise</b> they engaged in was the right type of <b>exercise</b> to help them achieve their goals (Right <b>Exercise).</b> ^ Path analysis was the main statistical tool used to analyze the relationships between the variables over time.
