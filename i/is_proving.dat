5|$|Riefenstahl {{was portrayed}} by Dutch actress Carice van Houten in Race, a sports drama film {{directed}} by Stephen Hopkins about Jesse Owens. It {{was released in}} North America on February 19, 2016. To make her sympathetic portrayal acceptable to an American audience, the film dramatizes her quarrels with Goebbels over her direction of the film, Olympia, especially about filming the African American star who <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> to be a politically embarrassing refutation of Nazi Germany's claims of Aryan athletic supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Serbia's strongest {{exports to}} the United States include Fiat {{automobiles}} manufactured in Kragujevac. Fiat purchased Zastava Automobili in 2008 and subsequently managed the factory in Kragujevac {{so that it would}} produce new Fiat automobiles as opposed to Zastava models (the last Zastavas were produced in 2008); in May 2013 alone, 3,000 Fiat 500L units were shipped from Serbia to Baltimore for sale in the United States. The Fiat 500L is the first automobile to have been exported from Serbia to the United States since the Zastava Koral before 1992, and <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> to be a popular model with a large amount of advertising in the United States. Serbia is also the largest exporter of raspberries in the world (as of 2009), and much of the raspberries consumed in the United States are grown in Šumadija. In 2015, the two states discussed to find ways to increase investments in Serbia.|$|E

25|$|Domestic {{housing in}} the United Kingdom {{presents}} a possible opportunity for achieving the 20% overall cut in UK carbon dioxide emissions targeted by the Government for 2010. However, the process of achieving that drop <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> problematic given the very wide range of age and condition of the UK housing stock.|$|E
25|$|The Government's {{low carbon}} {{buildings}} programme {{was launched in}} 2006 to replace the earlier Clear Skies and Solar PV programmes. It offers grants towards the costs of solar thermal heating, small wind turbine, micro hydro, ground source heat pump, and biomass installations. As of January 2007 funding for grants <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> insufficient to meet demand.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Top League {{was created}} to improve the overall {{standards}} of Japanese rugby union. It is Japan's first nationwide league and {{is a first step}} towards professionalism. So far the league <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> to be successful with many closely fought and exciting games, though attendances at games are generally not high and tend to be limited to diehard fans and company employees.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{approach used}} in business {{school is the}} use of business games that are used in different disciplines such as business, economics, management, etc. Some colleges are blending many of these approaches throughout their degree programs, and even blending the method of delivery for each of these approaches. A study from by Inside Higher Ed and the Babson Survey Research Group shows that there is still disagreement as to the effectiveness of the approaches but the reach and accessibility <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> to be more and more appealing. Liberal arts colleges in the United States like New England College, Wesleyan University, and Bryn Mawr College are now offering complete online degrees in many business curriculae despite the controversy that surrounds the learning method.|$|E
25|$|The main female {{protagonist of}} the story, Sunao, {{is a second}} year {{transfer}} student from class 2-A in high school who tends {{to have a strong}} personality, never being one to willingly back down. In the beginning of the story, her family moves to a new town because of her mother's work as an actress. Ever since seeing her mother acting once when she was younger, Sunao dreams of someday becoming an actress too, and likewise is very passionate about drama in general. On her first day at her new school, she adamantly wants to {{become a member of the}} drama club, though is soon informed that their school has no such club yet established. This in turn makes her very determined to start one as soon as possible, though it <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> harder than she thought.|$|E

25|$|Hawkeye remains {{with the}} Avengers for {{numerous}} adventures. He aids Avenger trainees Justice and Firestar {{to defeat the}} Taskmaster and Albino. Hawkeye later resigns the Avengers to assume leadership {{of the first generation}} of the Thunderbolts, who had broken away from the influence of Baron Helmut Zemo. Hawkeye trains the team in the fashion of former teammate Captain America, and shapes the team into a cohesive fighting unit. The Thunderbolts take on threats like the Masters of Evil, Graviton, and the Scourge of the Underworld. Hawkeye begins a romantic relationship with fellow Thunderbolts member Moonstone, who Hawkeye <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> to be a good influence on. Later, Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts travel to Hell to save the soul of Mockingbird. They defeat the demonic Mephisto, but Hawkeye is unable to find his wife. To ensure that his Thunderbolts are given full pardons, Hawkeye allows himself to be arrested in their place. The Thunderbolts' past crimes are erased on the condition that they retire from costumed heroics. The team reluctantly agrees. Later, when Hawkeye had gotten out of prison, the team comes back together to defeat Graviton once again. Convinced that they are ready to be heroes in their own right, Hawkeye hands leadership of the Thunderbolts to Citizen V (whose mind was actually under the control of Baron Helmut Zemo) and leaves the team.|$|E
500|$|The Financial Times {{special report}} {{on the future of}} the European Union argues that the {{liberalization}} of labour markets has allowed Greece to narrow the cost-competitiveness gap with other southern eurozone countries by approximately 50% over the past two years. This has been achieved primary through wage reductions, though businesses have reacted positively. The opening of product and service markets <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> tough because interest groups are slowing reforms. The biggest challenge for Greece is to overhaul the tax administration with a significant part of annually assessed taxes not paid. Poul Thomsen, the IMF official who heads the bailout mission in Greece, stated that [...] "in structural terms, Greece is more than halfway there".|$|E
500|$|Evidential issues also exist. Because secret trusts are by {{definition}} secret, they {{are difficult to}} prove in court. The parol evidence rule states that where there is written evidence, oral testimony cannot be introduced to the court if it contradicts that evidence. Since secret trusts are oral and normally exist outside of the will (a written document) this causes problems. In Re Keen, the issue came up, and the Court of Appeal decided that the parol evidence rule extended to secret trusts, and such trusts could not be enforced if they contradicted written documents. More generally, the problem <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> that the testator intended to create a trust. As in McCormic v Grogan, the standard is high; the person trying to enforce the trust must show [...] "most clearly and distinctly" [...] that it exists.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Billen of the New Statesman {{also found}} Irving as Meyer the series' [...] "most {{compelling}} character", though deemed Holby City mediocre and its storylines [...] "safely unoriginal". Billen compared Holby City negatively to the American medical drama ER, opining {{that the former}} show has a meandering pace {{in comparison to the}} latter's briskness, and that ER has a higher calibre of actors. The Sunday Herald also compared the series unfavourably to ER, writing that Holby City served to highlight ER [...] "true sophistication". Morgan refuted these negative comparisons, however, writing that: [...] "The sign of great drama is when a scriptwriter and director can make a symphony out of a few notes and Holby City creators have done that. It doesn't have the budget of ER, but it <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> just as compelling." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{suggested}} that the song {{would become one of}} the biggest-selling releases of the decade, with HMV spokesman Gennaro Castaldo saying: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> {{to be one of the}} biggest single releases for years if not the decade. Only Leona Lewis's debut hit [...] "A Moment Like This", which sold over 500,000 copies in its first week, can compare. It's selling more than most Christmas No 1s would, and HMV has placed an urgent order for more copies." [...] On December 28, 2008, the UK Singles Chart listed it as the second biggest selling single for the year end countdown and the nineteenth best-selling single of the decade. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified the song double-platinum, denoting shipments of over 1.2 million copies within the country.|$|E
500|$|Local {{paper the}} Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph {{reported}} that Wonderland was selling well; on Amazon.co.uk's charts, it appeared at {{number one on}} the symphonies chart, 13 on easy listening and 95 overall. A spokesman for the local HMV store was quoted as saying [...] "Sales of the new Faryl album have got off to a storming start – she <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> hugely popular at HMV. ... We're actually selling as many copies of Faryl's new album as we are Susan Boyle right now." [...] However, the album entered the top 75 of the UK Albums Chart for only one week, peaking at 54. It appeared on the Arts & Book Review (Independent Print) classical albums chart for two weeks, peaking at number 6. The album proved less successful than Smith's debut, and, subsequent to its release, Smith's contract with Universal ended.|$|E

Manager Sir Bobby Robson stated at the time: [...] "A lot of clubs have a very good goalkeeper and one who stands by. I think we have two keepers — and Harper <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> that — who can play in the Premiership". The club rejected Given's request, which was then withdrawn by the goalkeeper, who later stated that his [...] "intention was simply to express [...] frustration at being left out of the team," [...] and that he [...] "never had any intention of actually leaving the club." [...] An injury to Harper led to Given being recalled to the first team, and he kept his place {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|... "Why", asked Coward, [...] "am I always {{expected}} {{to wear a}} dressing-gown, smoke cigarettes in a long holder and say 'Darling, how wonderful'?" [...] The answer lay in Coward's assiduous cultivation of a carefully crafted image. As a suburban boy who had been {{taken up by the}} upper classes he rapidly acquired the taste for high life: [...] "I am determined to travel through life first class." [...] He first wore a dressing gown onstage in The Vortex and used the fashion in several of his other famous plays, including Private Lives and Present Laughter. George Walden identifies him as a modern dandy. In connection with the National Theatre's 2008 exhibition, The Independent commented, [...] "His famous silk, polka-dot dressing gown and elegant cigarette holder both seem to belong to another era. But 2008 <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> to be the year that Britain falls in love with Noël Coward all over again." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} film in Atlanta {{because of its}} proximity to Cynthiana, Kentucky, Kirkman's hometown and the setting of his comic's first issue. [...] "At the beginning they talk about how {{some of the people}} in neighboring states would have gone to larger cities so they could fortify them and protect the population." [...] Kirkman had considered other cities, particularly New York City, Miami, and Chicago. Hurd had previously filmed in the city for Lifetime. Darabont felt that Atlanta offered the essentials; [...] "Atlanta and Georgia all-told <b>is</b> <b>proving</b> to be brilliant for us in terms of what it has to offer, in terms of what the story needed, in terms of the variety of locations—it really is a fantastic place to shoot." [...] Prior to filming, Kirkman toured with Darabont around the central business district. He stated, [...] "I tagged along on a location-scouting expedition, and that was pretty fun—watching Frank Darabont walking through the streets of Atlanta as if he owned the entire city, daring cars to hit him. That was a lot of fun." [...] Darabont ventured onto the middle of a street to grasp a perfect shot, oblivious to oncoming traffic.|$|E
