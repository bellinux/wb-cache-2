5000|$|The {{history of}} {{corporate}} insolvency {{law in the}} UK only began with the first modern companies legislation in 1844. However, many principles of insolvency are rooted in bankruptcy laws that trace back to ancient times. Regulation of bankruptcy was {{a necessary part of}} every legal system, and is found in the Hammurabi Code (2250 BC), the Twelve Tables of the Roman Republic (450 BC), the Talmud (200 AD), and the Corpus Juris Civilis (534 AD). Ancient laws used a variety of methods for distributing losses among creditors, and satisfaction of debts usually came from a debtor's own body. A debtor might be imprisoned, enslaved or killed or all three. In England, the Bankruptcy Act 1542 introduced the modern principle of pari passu (i.e. proportional) distribution of losses among creditors. However, the 1542 Act still reflected the ancient notion that people who could not pay their debts were criminals, and required debtors to be imprisoned. The Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 ensured that any transactions by the debtor with [...] "intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors and others of their just and lawful actions" [...] would be [...] "clearly and utterly void". The view of bankrupts as subject to the total will of creditors, well represented by Shylock demanding his [...] "pound of flesh" [...] in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, began to wane around the 17th century. In the Bankruptcy Act 1705, the Lord Chancellor was given power to <b>discharge</b> <b>bankrupts</b> from having to repay all debts, once disclosure of all assets and various procedures had been fulfilled.

40|$|Is it {{possible}} to admit a business under a leasing contract? If no problems arise in the leasing contract {{because it is an}} unregulated contract, questions are raised by the business. In fact, leasing is a flexible contract that may concern any type of good and that can be adapted to any kind of concern between the contract parties. On the contrary, business is a complex and mutable reality. It’s composed not only of tangible assets, but even of intangible assets, as well as of a whole string of juridical situations. Moreover, business is in continous development: business value estimation and goodwill can increase or go down, goods can become obsolete, even within a brief period of usage. Furthermore, business transfer produces results not only between the lessee and the lessor but also between others involved in the legal transaction. Finally, the Italian civil code disciplines only company (business) sales, usufruct and renting, meaning that it’s very difficult to ascertain if our law allows different modalities of business transfer apart from those specified. So how can contract leasing and business discipline be combine? Firstly, it’s necessary to solve the business leasing configuration problem. It’s important to establish (1) if it is possible, both in theory and in practice, to make such an agreement, especially concerning intangible assets and all juridical situations connected with business, and (2) if it is possible to conceive of a leasing in which a business, considered as one entity, is admitted or if it is necessary to sign a leasing contract for every single business component. This is not such a simple problem to solve. In fact, the main practical obstacle is the so-called investment risk. Who takes it? If the business isn’t bought by the lessee {{at the end of the}} contract, it returns to the lessor and even if it isn’t used and exploited, it produces results and needs to be managed. So who’s responsibility is it to manage it? The lessor, another new lessee, another new contract party, perhaps a guarantor? Furthermore what about its status after the return to the lessor and before a next potential transfer? What about contracts, credits, debts, intangible assets, management risk, warranties and of a ban on competition? Moreover, to whom will business management advantages and disadvantages be related? How can they be connected to the lessor or to the lessee or to a third contractual leasing party, perhaps a guarantor? Also, if there is a succession of lessees and business managements, how should they be considered? Should they be considered separately or as one complex management? What about customers, suppliers, workers and others related to the business in general? How is {{it possible}} to safeguard their interests? Perhaps is {{it possible to}} create a uniform manage trend? Only after having solved these problems, is it possible to analyze, in every single detail, leasing contractual structure (both objective and subjective), due diligence, business value estimation, contract performance and business credit, debt and contract succession, hypothesis and remedies of breach of contract and <b>discharge,</b> <b>bankrupted</b> results, business return regime (structure and results), accounting and fiscal aspects. An analytic analysis is reserved for the role of the guarantor and for the business management trend as the main and essential features of business leasing contract. The whole treatise is completed with a general part concerning the leasing contract and the business (especially intangible assets and business transfer rules) with specific references to legal doctrine and jurisprudence, both Italian and foreign (French, Spanish and English) and to practical commercial cases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the market for unsecured credit with market incompleteness closely resembling the key features of the credit card market in the US. A friction of targeting credit card offers to specific customers is introduced and the implications of lowering the strength of this fricion are studied. The results indicate that such change — motivated by the rapid progress in information technol-ogy during the 90 s — is promising to quantitatively account for several observations occurring during this period: (i) growing availability and use of revolving lines of credit, (ii) growing indebtedness of households, (iii) rising filing rate for bankruptcy protection, (iv) rising debt <b>discharged</b> per statistical <b>bankrupt,</b> (v) falling cost of revolving credit measured by the interest rate premium over cost of funds, (vi) massive increase in the credit card solicitations. ∗We thank V.

5000|$|On 25 October 2004, Jeyaretnam {{appealed for}} an early {{discharge}} from bankruptcy {{so that he could}} contest in the next general election. He appeared before three judges in the Court of Appeal, Singapore's highest court, asking to be discharged. Representing himself during the two-hour hearing, Jeyaretnam appealed on the grounds that he wanted another chance to contribute to society. He offered to pay one-third of the more than S$600,000 he still owed his claimants. Thus far, he had paid less than S$30,000. The official assignee, Sarjit Singh, opposed Jeyaretnam's appeal, claiming that Jeyaretnam had lied about his assets and calling him [...] "the most dishonest bankrupt I have ever come across". He said this because Jeyaretnam had not declared a property he had bought in Johor Bahru in Malaysia, worth more than S$350,000. At the same time, Davinder Singh, the legal counsel acting on behalf of eight of the claimants, argued that this case threw up issues far wider than Jeyaretnam's appeal. He said that if Jeyaretnam was <b>discharged</b> as a <b>bankrupt,</b> it could set a dangerous precedent and the courts could be flooded with similar appeals from <b>bankrupts</b> seeking early <b>discharge.</b>|$|R
