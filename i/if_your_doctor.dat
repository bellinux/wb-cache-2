40|$|The {{following}} summary {{is written}} {{in response to the}} reports of patients whose physicians have made uninformed or erroneous comments to them regarding the efficacy of extraocular muscle (EOM) surgery for the improvement of visual function in patients with infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS). Also included are the results of studies demonstrating that the four-muscle tenotomy and reattachment (T&R) procedure is therapeutically effective for both pendular and jerk types of acquired nystagmus. Because the primary purpose of this report is to better inform INS patients (and their parents) and, when necessary, to help them educate their physicians, it is written with both layman and professional in mind. Patients have reported on the American Nystagmus Network (ANN) and elsewhere that their doctor told them that EOM surgery for INS: 1) does not help the patient to see better; 2) does not damp (reduce the amplitude of) INS; 3) should not be done unless there is a large (i. e., 30 ° or greater) head turn; 4) should not be done early (e. g., before the age of 4 or 5); or 5) is “controversial. ” <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>doctor</b> makes any of the above (or similar) statements, show him/her the relevant section below.
