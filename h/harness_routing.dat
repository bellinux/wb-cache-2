In this paper a conceptual design of an automatic wire <b>harness</b> <b>routing</b> application is proposed, based on KBE. As the core of this application, the wire <b>harness</b> <b>routing</b> algorithm is discussed in detail. Through comparison with related methods and existing algorithms, a suitable algorithm, named A* is selected. In order to comply with the complex aircraft specific routing environments, the selected algorithm is enhanced with so-called wall-attraction capabilities. The resulting algorithm is called the wall-attraction A* (W*) algorithm, and features a settable parameter that controls the balance between performance and admissibility of the solution. By conducting a set of experiments the influencing parameter is optimized. A case study is finally presented, featuring a conceptual aircraft environment that validates the above theories. Applying the W* algorithm, the wire <b>harness</b> <b>routing</b> application can connect any source and destination nodes satisfying according the relevant constraints meanwhile the valuable time and resources are saved.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} optimal power harness design based on a modified ant colony optimisation algorithm. The optimisation of the <b>harness</b> <b>routing</b> topology is formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimisation problem in which the main objectives are to minimise the length (and therefore the mass) of the harness. The modified ant colony optimisation algorithm automatically routes different types of wiring, creating the optimal harness layout. During the optimisation the length, mass and bundleness of the cables are computed and used as cost functions. The optimisation algorithm works incrementally on a finite set of waypoints, forming a tree, by adding and evaluating one branch at a time, utilising a set of heuristics using the cable length and cable bundling as criteria to select the optimal path. Constraints are introduced as forbidden waypoints through which digital agents (hereafter called ants) cannot travel.

40|$|<b>Harness</b> 3 D <b>routing</b> in {{aircraft}} Electrical Wiring Interconnection System (EWIS) {{design is}} very complex because {{of both the}} intrinsic complexity of EWIS and {{the increasing number of}} design constraints. The complexity hinders the improvement of the design efficiency and makes the design error prone. Considering that many harness components are selected from catalogues and the design work is largely repetitive and mostly rule based, there are many opportunities to automate {{a significant part of the}} design process. Nevertheless, none or very limited solutions to automate the 3 D routing have been found. Aiming for the automation of <b>harness</b> 3 D <b>routing,</b> in this research, an innovative approach has been proposed that models and solves the 3 D routing problem as an optimization problem. The challenge to solve above optimization problem is that the number of design variables, namely the number of clamping points, is not known a priori. The number is actually an output of the 3 D routing. In order to handle this challenge, a two-step, hybrid optimization strategy has been devised. The first step, called Initialization, generates a preliminary harness definition using a road map based path finding method without knowing the number of design variables. The second step, called Optimization uses conventional optimization method to refine the preliminary harness definition while satisfying all design constraints. This approach has been implemented into a software application and several cases have been executed to validate the system functionality. The results have demonstrated that the tool is capable of handling cases of representative complexity and design constraints and deliver 3 D harness models in full automation.

40|$|ABSTRACT- In this paper, {{the use of}} {{head mounted}} display {{immersive}} virtual reality (VR) is investigated as both a cable <b>harness</b> design <b>routing</b> and an assembly planning tool. Due {{to the nature of}} this technology being more intuitive as an interface for generating design and process planning information, {{it is important to understand}} in detail the activities being carried out by the designer whilst immersed in the 3 D virtual environment since health and safety recommendations dictate a maximum of around 20 minutes exposure for the user. After covering earlier work comparing CAD/VR productivity studies, follow-on work is outlined describing an immersive VR-based design platform developed for the design, assembly planning and installation planning of cable harnesses. This is presented in the form of recent, extensive system evaluations which analysed a number of participants carrying out cable routing design tasks. User activities were broken down using a novel design task categorisation scheme which enabled a detailed understanding of the design activity being carried out.

40|$|Wire harness {{design is}} an {{increasingly}} complex task. Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) and optimization techniques {{can be used}} to support designers in handling this complexity. The wire harness design process can be divided in three main parts, namely electrical design, configuration design and geometrical routing. This paper describes the latest progress {{in the development of a}} KBE application aiming at the automation of the routing phase. Discrete optimization techniques are used to design shortest path harnesses, while complying with different type of constraints. Some preliminary results have been presented in a previous paper, where only geometrical constraints were addressed. However, wire harness design is affected also by other types of rules and constraints, which need to be accounted to obtain more realistic design results from the optimization process. This paper describes some new developments in the routing application to account for the presence of critical zones inside the aircraft. As study case, the presence of heat sources inside the airframe is considered, which either force the harness to be routed elsewhere, or require the use of wire protections, with obvious consequences on weight and manufacturing. First, some mathematic transformation techniques are used to model the presence of heat sources inside the routing environment. Then the A* algorithm is used for compute the 3 D routing, aiming at minimum wire harness weight. The main architecture of the routing application is presented and its functionality is demonstrated with samples of wire <b>harness</b> <b>routing</b> inside a wing. The results show that the proposed KBE application can automate the routing of wire harness while taking into account different rules and constraints. The modeling approach for a heat source can be generalized and extended to address other criticality such as abrasion, electromagnetic interference, corrosion, etc. The achieved level of automation relieves designers from the repetitive work associated with the frequent changes affecting the design environment.

40|$|Beyond {{the current}} ExoMars programme, the European Space Agency (ESA) is {{investigating}} {{a range of}} technology developments and exploration mission opportunities leading to a future Mars Sample Return Mission (MSR), a critical next in the exploration of Mars. To fulfil their scientific objectives, all of these missions require an arm with a long reach capable of performing a variety of tasks in stringent environmental conditions, such as low gravity sampling and precise sample handling and insertion. As part of a CREST- 2 project supported by the UK Space Agency (UKSA), a consortium of UK companies have co-founded and developed LARAD, a new Lightweight Advanced Robotic Arm Demonstrator {{to address some of}} the underlying challenges related both to the design as well as operation of long arms to perform the payload deployment and sample return operations of future missions. The 15 kg terrestrial demonstrator is built as a 2 m long arm with 6 degrees of freedom. This arm is capable of deploying a payload with a mass up to 6 kgs or operating a 4 kg end-effector at 2 m. It is using cutting edge technologies on both the hardware and software levels. The mechanical structure of the arm has been manufactured using an array of new processes such as optimised 3 D printed titanium Additive Layer Manufactured (ALM) joints, Titanium/Silicon carbide metallic composites, and 3 D printed <b>harness</b> <b>routing</b> drums. A modular joint design has been produced, featuring three mechanical sizes of joints each with integrated low level communication and motor drive. The electronics, software and sensors used in the joints are common across all sizes, increasing modularity. To achieve precise positioning, very high resolution absolute position sensing is used on-board. The arm uses novel collision avoidance and path-planning strategies combined with classical control loops. The On-board Control System?s state machine combines different control strategies/modes (i. e. joint trajectory tracking, direct motor control, autonomous placement) depending on the high level user operation requirements. The high level On Board Computer (OBC) is Robot Operating System (ROS) based, enabling a flexible software approach. This project will provide a unique and representative platform to plan and rehearse science operations with full mass payload and instruments, unlike typical planetary arm developments that require scaled-mass end-effector. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art in planetary robotics and provides an overview of the top-level architecture, implementation and laboratory testing phases for the LARAD robotic arm.

40|$|The {{electronics}} in {{the automotive}} industry is facing a new era where safety critical functions are electrified, as for example drive-by-wire technology. At {{the same time as}} the number of electrical loads in the vehicles is increasing, the time to market is decreasing. Full scale prototypes of a vehicle are often only available at a late stage in the development process where changes are rather costly. This implies that prediction and simulation of a system are of importance and are useful already at an early stage of the development process. There are economic benefits that can be gained by prediction and simulation of the system such as: reduction of time to market, virtual tests, virtual prototypes and optimization of electronic circuits with respect to safety margins of filters. The high number of electrical loads in the vehicle leads to different cable <b>harnesses</b> <b>routed</b> along the body and chassis of the vehicle. These cable harnesses will contain both power conductors and communication conductors, routed close together. When conductors are routed close to each other, a signal on one conductor can interfere with the signal on another conductor. This phenomenon is called crosstalk. Crosstalk can increase the noise levels, create unplanned spikes or destroy data on nearby conductors. Hence it should always be a prime suspect in an electromagnetic interference investigation or a candidate for prediction. Crosstalk between two conductors is coupled by the mutual inductance and capacitance. When these parameters are known, the crosstalk can be estimated by using a circuit simulation. The mutual inductance and capacitance between the conductors as well as the self inductance and capacitance of each conductor depend on the surrounding environment. This implies that the conductor layout is an important factor when it comes to designing a system that is robust against crosstalk. This thesis focuses on estimation of the parasitic components in a system with two conductors and a ground structure. Since the parasitic components are affected by the conductor layout, five different layouts are investigated. The parameters are estimated by using analytical calculations, electromagnetic simulations with the software CableMod and measurements. An approximate method for fast analytical calculations is proposed and evaluated. The parameter values estimated with the different methods are compared in the thesis. The values yielded from the accurate analytical calculation and the simulations agree well. Some of the measured values deviate from the theoretical values, and it is shown that the differences emanate from the fact that the theoretical models do not exactly describe the measurement setup. The different parameter setups from the different estimation methods and the investigated conductor layouts are employed in circuit simulations in the software LTSpice/ Switchercad III. The circuit simulations show that the proposed approximate analytical calculation method is sufficient to use for prediction of crosstalk and comparison between different conductor layouts...|$|R
40|$|<b>Harness</b> 3 D <b>routing</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} steps in the design of aircraft Electrical Wiring Interconnection System (EWIS), due to the intrinsic complexity of the EWIS, the increasing number of applying design constraints, and its dependency on the design changes of the airframe and installed systems. The current routing process employed by EWIS design is largely based on the manual work of expert engineers, partially supported by conventional CAD systems. As a result, the routing process is quite inefficient, error prone and unable to deliver optimal solutions. Although many harness components are selected from catalogues and the design process is largely repetitive and rule based, it has been found that none or very limited automation solutions, which can significantly decrease the workload of engineers and increase their efficiency, are currently available. In this research, an innovative approach is proposed to solve the 3 D routing automation as an optimization problem. Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) and optimization methods are proposed to achieve the minimum cost routing solutions that satisfy all relevant design rules and constraints. The basic idea is to achieve the optimal EWIS routing solutions by optimizing the position of the harnesses clamping points, which are used as way-points to route the harnesses inside the aircraft digital mock-up. The challenge to solve this optimization problem is that the number and initial value of design variables, namely the number and position of clamping points, are not known a priori. In order to handle this challenge, a two-step, hybrid optimization strategy has been devised. The first step, called Initialization, uses a road map based path finding method to generate a preliminary harness definition, including the required number and preliminary position of its clamping points. The second step, called Refinement, uses a conventional optimization method to move the position of the clamps and refine the preliminary harness definition aiming for the minimum cost and the satisfaction of all the design constraints. This approach has been implemented into a KBE application and tested on several routing cases. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of handling cases of representative geometric complexity and design constraints and delivering proper 3 D harness models in full automation. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Flight mirror {{assemblies}} (FMAs) {{of large}} telescopes, {{such as the}} International X-ray Observatory (IXO), have very stringent thermal-structural distortion requirements. The spatial temperature gradient requirement within a FMA could be as small as 0. 05 C. Con ventionally, heaters and thermistors {{are attached to the}} stray light baffle (SLB), and centralized heater controllers (i. e., heater controller boards located in a large electronics box) are used. Due to the large number of heater <b>harnesses,</b> accommodating and <b>routing</b> them is extremely difficult. The total harness length/mass is very large. This innovation uses a thermally conductive pre-collimator to accommodate heaters and a distributed heater controller approach. It minimizes the harness length and mass, and reduces the problem of routing and accommodating them. Heaters and thermistors are attached to a short (4. 67 cm) aluminum portion of the pre-collimator, which is thermally coupled to the SLB. Heaters, which have a very small heater power density, and thermistors are attached to the exterior of all the mirror module walls. The major portion (23. 4 cm) of the pre-collimator for the middle and outer modules is made of thin, non-conductive material. It minimizes the view factors from the FMA and heated portion of the precollimator to space. It also minimizes heat conduction {{from one end of the}} FMA to the other. Small and multi-channel heater controllers, which have adjustable set points and internal redundancy, are used. They are mounted to the mechanical support structure members adjacent to each module. The IXO FMA, which is 3. 3 m in diameter, is an example of a large telescope. If the heater controller boards are centralized, routing and accommodating heater harnesses is extremely difficult. This innovation has the following advantages. It minimizes the length/mass of the heater harness between the heater controllers and heater circuits. It reduces the problem of routing and accommodating the harness on the FMA. It reduces the risk of X-ray attenuation caused by the heater harness. Its adjustable set point capability eliminates the need for survival heater circuits. The operating mode heater circuits can also be used as survival heater circuits. In the non-operating mode, a lower set point is used...|$|R
