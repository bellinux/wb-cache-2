As a result, the Spanish raid on Cornwall on 13 August of the same year was carried out in retaliation.|$|E

Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned per curiam majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied.

25|$|Henrietta Maria's {{religious}} activities {{appear to have}} focused on bringing a modern, 17th century European form of Catholicism to England.

Charles came under increasing criticism for his <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> to stem the flow of high-profile conversions. Henrietta Maria even gave a requiem mass in her private chapel for Father Richard Blount, S.J. upon his death in 1638. Henrietta Maria also continued to act in masque plays throughout the 1630s, which met with criticism from the more Puritan wing of English society. In most of these masques she chose roles designed to advance ecumenism, Catholicism and the cult of Platonic love.|$|E

However Darvas argues that there were certain actions, or <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> on the part of EU institutions and governments, that have amplified the effects on CEE countries of the crisis. The European Central Bank has given little direct support to non-euro-area countries, and the EU has done little for EU neighbourhood countries.
