5|$|Hurricane Carmen was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season. A destructive and widespread storm, Carmen originated as a tropical disturbance that emerged from Africa {{toward the end of}} August. The disturbance traveled westward, spawning a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on August29. The storm moved through the Caribbean Sea, and <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> conducive to intensification, it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Carmen moved ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula, where, despite striking a sparsely populated region, it caused significant crop damage and killed several people. Before the storm's arrival, officials had set up several evacuation centers, and many residents had moved to higher ground.|$|E

5|$|In its {{formative}} stages, Chanchu {{was located}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> generally favorable for intensification.

Late on May10, the JTWC upgraded Chanchu to typhoon status, estimating 1minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph). By contrast, the JMA estimated it intensified only into a severe tropical storm with winds of 95km/h (60mph). Turning more to the west, Chanchu made landfall on Samar in the eastern Philippines on May11. Despite moving through the archipelago, Chanchu intensified slightly within the Sibuyan Sea, striking Mindoro on May12 with 1minute winds of 160km/h (100mph), according to the JTWC. On May13, Chanchu emerged into the South China Sea, and later that day the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status.|$|E

5|$|Olaf {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave {{that left the}} coast of Africa on September 17. Over {{the next two weeks}} it moved westbound into the East Pacific Ocean. Initially, the wave was not <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> conductive for further development. However, on October 2, a low-level circulation was noted on satellite imagery. This circulation quickly became better defined over the next several hours while located 400 miles (645km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. The next day, Dvorak Classifications, a tool that estimates a tropical cyclone intensity, were placed at 1.5. This is equivalent to winds of around 30mph (50km/h). In addition, a ship nearby reported winds of 35mph (45km/h). Microwave imagery also indicated that the center was near the associated convection. Based on this, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression.|$|E

40|$|The {{physiological}} and behavioural responses of slaughter pigs reared <b>in</b> either <b>a</b> barren <b>environment</b> or <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enriched <b>environment</b> (larger pens with straw bedding) to preslaughter handling and mixing at transport were studied. Enriched-reared pigs had higher salivary cortisol {{concentrations in the}} home pen before and after transport than barren housed pigs, {{but at the end}} of the lairage period salivary cortisol concentrations did not differ between enriched- and barren-housed pigs. In pigs reared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> barren <b>environment,</b> salivary cortisol concentrations increased significantly after transport and being in lairage, as compared to home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In pigs reared <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enriched <b>environment,</b> salivary cortisol concentrations did not significantly change after any stage of preslaughter handling and transport as compared with home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In the truck, pigs reared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> barren <b>environment</b> tended to spend more time walking, standing and manipulating other pigs than enriched-reared pigs. Moreover, pigs reared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> barren <b>environment</b> tended to spend more time walking and fighting in lairage than enriched-reared pigs. Results showed that rearing conditions may affect the behavioural and physiological responses of pigs to preslaughter handling and mixing at transport. The tendency for increased manipulation of pen mates and fighting, and the significant increases in salivary cortisol in response to mixing at transport and being in lairage in pigs reared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> barren <b>environment</b> indicate that pigs reared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> barren <b>environment</b> are likely to experience more stress during common preslaughter procedures than pigs reared <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enriched <b>environment...</b>|$|R

Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, {{there was no significant}} difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates that there are some other costs with breeding <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> with high population density, an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Ivan {{originated}} {{from an area}} of disturbed weather near the equator {{during the first week}} of October 1997. Two equatorial troughs, one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere developed from this system.

The eastern low developed into Typhoon Joan, while the western cyclone became the system that would intensify into Typhoon Ivan. Situated <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> without significant convective activity, this system initially struggled to become organized. However, the disturbance began to mature, and by October11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) discovered a low-level circulation center, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day.|$|E
