5000|$|Brighton General Hospital {{stands at}} the top of Elm Grove at the Queen's Park Road junction. The main building, which is Grade II-listed and forms the hospital's Arundel Building, was built as the Brighton workhouse between 1865 and 1867 by local {{architect}} George Maynard and the London firm of J.C. and G. Lansdown. [...] It rises to four storeys and has a 37-window, stucco-faced Italianate façade. Other decoration <b>includes</b> <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> tower with a cupola and a pediment with carved dolphins (the Brighton coat of arms). During World War I it was used as a military hospital, then reverted to being a workhouse. [...] It was renamed the Elm Grove Home in 1930, but most of the site became a hospital in 1935. The final workhouse inmates were moved to other sites in 1940. In 1948 the hospital took the name Brighton General. [...] Many additions {{have been made in the}} 20th and 21st centuries, including an ambulance station to the west (built in 1951-52 on the former allotments of the workhouse). Since 2002 Brighton & Sussex Universities Hospital NHS Trust have run the hospital. [...] Its hilltop position means it can be seen from many parts of the city.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} that mitigates multi-bit-upset (MBU) in multi-bit-latch (MBL) without performance degradation by applying well-slits. The area overhead in an MBL macro for processor design, which <b>includes</b> <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> buffer and a checker, is only 5. 4 % in a 28 nm technology. Sixty-hour acceler-ated neutron irradiation test observed no MBUs in the MBL with well-slits. The proposedmitigation technique achieved excellent ro-bustness against MBUwithout any increase in SBU rate. TheMBL with the proposed mitigation technique helps improve reliability of electronic devices. Index Terms—Latch, multiple cell upset, neutron, single event, soft-error. I...|$|E
30|$|The {{control logic}} {{takes care of}} multiplexing, the correct data pixels from the memory {{locations}} to the floating point pixel calculation module. In addition, this module <b>includes</b> <b>a</b> <b>clock</b> cycle counter. The following floating point pixel calculation module and memory access stages of the design are all pipelined. Each block in Figure[*] 3 - memory accesses and writes, the resizing frame, compare with low-resolution frame, resize error, and adjust hypothesis frame with error frame - are stages of the pipeline. We found that the longest latency of all the pipelined stages is 12 clock cycles at 103.15 and 122.25 MHz for the Cyclone II FPGA and Stratix III FPGA, respectively. Thus, every stage of the pipeline is 12 clock cycles. The counter helps ensure that the correct pixel data from the M 4 k memory blocks are flopped into the floating point pixel calculation module at the correct time.|$|E
