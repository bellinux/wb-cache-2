40|$|Sustainable use {{of forest}} {{resources}} {{is needed to}} establish a forestry management plan. Forest management plans exist at the provincial level according to the conditions and problems. Forestry planning at Provincial level depicts current forest conditions, institutional conditions, the contribution of economy, social and ecology associated with the provincial level strategic issues. This paper tries to elaborate the local <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> of <b>forestry</b> from good governance perspective, and role of stakeholders of local <b>development</b> forest <b>planning.</b> The research was based on qualitative descriptive approach to the study site {{in the province of}} Yogyakarta and West Papua. The result shows that forest planning in the region is top-down with respect to existing regional characteristics. To realize the principles of good governance, a gap for each stakeholder role in the arrangement, implementation, monitoring and evaluation to reporting should be made. The role of government in the area of <b>forestry</b> <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> in terms of good governance, the rule of law for the regulation in the forestry sector has been completed.

The first projects were planned under an existing broader program, the United Nations World Food program (1975 - 200). These projects essentially concerned agro-forestry and demonstrations trials. Vietnam started its economic renovation policy (known as "Doi Moi") in 1986 with a series of major economic programs and industrial <b>development</b> <b>plans.</b> Among them, the program 327 (1993 - 1998) was initially planning substantial effort to rehabilitate forest degraded lands. It soon shifted to focus on forest protection in critical zones. Finally, the program 661 (1998 - 2010), also known as "Five million hectares reforestation program" (5 MHRP), really put the emphasis on a substantial increment of the nation's forest areas. By the end of this program, the national forests are expected to cover more than 14 million hectares. The program includes both protection of existing forests and reforestation. Initially, Most of the production plantations were planned to be established with fast growing exogenous species (i. e. eucalyptus).

40|$|Assessment of slope {{instability}} on forest lands in South Westland {{was limited to}} the resource allocation level of evaluating slope movements on forest lands with the prime objective of providing an overview of slope movement potential adequate for <b>forestry</b> <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> Three sites were selected for detailed investigation on the three most unstable landform units which were identified by previous studies, viz:- 1. Greenland Group Hill Country: Boulder Creek; 2. Alpine Fault Zone slopes: Havelock Creek, and; 3. Cretaceous-Tertiary Hill Country: Grave Creek. Investigations were divided into three stages, engineering geology field and laboratory studies, assessment of slope movement processes and instability controls, and implications of {{slope instability}} for forest management. The dominant type of slope failure at Boulder Creek is debris slump/slide-avalanche in crushed hornfelsed sandstone and puggy tectonic breccia bedrock materials with failures typically initiated during high intensity rainstorm events and seismic events. The Boulder creek catchment is presently undergoing a period of increased slope activity which is generating a substantial quantity of sediment and is overloading the stream channel with rock debris. Boulder Creek provides an exceptional example of slope instability problems in Greenland Group Hill Country, this being explained by the oversteepened sides of the glaciated Moeraki River valley in fault-crushed bedrock. Alpine Fault Zone slopes fail most commonly by debris slide-avalanche in crushed mylonite schist and crushed garnet schist bedrock triggered by high intensity rainstorm events. Investigations at Havelock Creek also identified large-scale rock (block) slide failures in the same crushed bedrock materials which are initiated by infrequent seismic events. The Grave Earthflow, located in Cretaceous-Tertiary Hill Country, was triggered by construction of State Highway 6 in 1963 - 65. Failure is taking place by a complex rotational slide-earthflow type of movement along a zone of basal shear in grey mud material derived from faulting in lower Otumotu Formation bedrock. Surface movement monitoring investigations measured a high rate of movement of up to 419 cm/year. Unloading of toe support in December 1984 caused an instantaneous acceleration in movement rates which subsequently declined during the monitoring period of March 1985 to June 1986. This deceleration process obscured any climatic influences on movement. Slope failure potential in South Westland slopes is governed by the fundamental causes of slope instability: the distribution of weak fault zone materials and crushed bedrock, and the steep topography (20 - 65 °). Aerial photograph evidence suggests that slope instability features develop very rapidly (within one rainstorm event) and active instability periods occur in short-lived episodes (less than 50 years) which are coincident with the occurrence of heavy precipitation periods. Recommendations for future management of South Westland forest lands are:- 1. Alpine Fault Zone slopes should be limited to protection forestry management practices. 2. Greenland Group Hill Country and Cretaceous-Tertiary Hill Country should be assessed by more detailed phases of evaluation for small-scale bush-mill harvesting methods only. 3. Engineering geology methods of investigation and data presentation have been demonstrated to make a valuable contribution to forest resource allocation studies and it is recommended that these methods be applied to all levels of evaluation of slope movement potential on forest lands...|$|R

An introduction to the convoluted policy malaise surrounding the use of forests in regulated carbon markets is also presented. Whilst there are many opportunities and potential benefits of using forests to produce offsets, relatively few carbon forestry projects currently exist, particularly in regulated carbon markets.

40|$|The {{investigation}} aims at elaboration {{and practical}} application of multicriteria evaluation methodology {{to compare the}} <b>forestry</b> <b>development</b> levels {{in the context of}} regions based on index method. Elaborated methodology provides 5 assessment criteria: intensity of forest reproduction and regeneration, profitability of logging, forestry financial return, forestry protection and security level, and legislation observance. Three main indices were selected to ensure evaluation proportionality. The individual indices of each indicator by regions are calculated and the group integral indices by each criterion along with the reconciled integral index by all groups of criteria are defined. Application of this methodology by the example of Ukrainian forestry allowed conducting ranking and grouping of regions by indicators of integral indices for certain years and the period of 2011 − 2013. The diagrammed map is plotted to demonstrate the results visually. It revealed that certain highly forested regions did not ensure appropriate <b>forestry</b> <b>development</b> level as individual steppe zone regions.

40|$|Private {{forestry}} {{is considered}} to encompass all forms of forestry carried out on private land and, therefore, is characterised by diversity in scale, ownership, species and management objectives. Private forestry suffers in many localities, and particularly in north Queensland, from the dilemma that markets are unlikely to develop without suitable quantities of available material. Private <b>forestry</b> <b>development</b> is unlikely to occur without some certainty of markets. Private forestry continues to grow in importance in Australia as the area available for public native forestry continues to decline in most States {{and the proportion of}} the plantation estate in private ownership continues to increase. The need for some certainty in markets for private forest products continues to grow apace. In north Queensland, the potential for profitable private forestry exists but this potential cannot be realised without development of markets for the products. All of the mechanisms examined to assist in private <b>forestry</b> <b>development</b> will depend for their success on the building of positive commercial relationships between the parties in the value chain and, therefore, depend on cooperation between all levels of government, industry and landholders.

Since 1991, the "Communal <b>Forestry</b> <b>Development</b> in the Bolivian Highlands (Altiplano) " {{project has}} been {{promoting}} self-supporting agroforestry activities, integrated into the farmerproductive system, boosting the satisfaction of needs in forest products, increasing agriculture production and conserving natural resources. High demands on land and the difficult climatic conditions prevailing in Potosi department, where the project is located, are serious constraints to a massive forestation. Taking these constraints into account, the project has developped a strategy, the Communal <b>Forestry</b> <b>Development,</b> which is focussed on an integrated and participative approach : "integrated" means the technical available alternatives, including agroforestry actions (promotion of forester, fruit, and forrage trees and shrubs) as well as hydraulic and soil conservation actions, are implemented inside the productive agro-sylvo-pastoral systems. Within the scope of an implication of the stakeholders, the project uses "participative" ways as communautary planning of agroforestry priorities. Those objectives are reached by means of training, extension and communication. Another orientation consists in a flexible coordination with all the organizations working on the field. The project is now implementing a second phase. The results which have been registered so far lead towards a strenghthening of integrated actions and increasing responsabilities of as well communities as other institutions.
