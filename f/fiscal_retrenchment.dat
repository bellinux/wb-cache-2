It finds that timely countercyclical fiscal measures contribute to shortening the length of crisis episodes by stimulating aggregate demand. Fiscal expansions that rely mostly on measures to support government consumption are more effective in shortening the crisis duration than those based on public investment or income tax cuts. But these results do not hold for countries with limited fiscal space where fiscal expansions are prevented by funding constraints. The composition of countercyclical fiscal responses matters as well for output recovery after the crisis, with public investment yielding the strongest impact on growth. These results suggest a potential trade-off between short-run aggregate demand support and medium-term productivity growth objectives in fiscal stimulus packages adopted in distress times.

40|$|The recent sharp {{increase}} in fiscal deficits and government debt in many countries raises questions regarding their impact on long-term sovereign bond yields. While economic theory suggests that this impact {{is likely to be}} adverse, empirical results have been less clear cut, have generally ignored nonlinear effects of deficits and debt through some other key determinants of yields, and have been mostly confined to advanced economies. This paper reexamines the impact of fiscal deficits and public debt on long-term interest rates during 1980 - 2008, taking into account a wide range of country-specific factors, for a panel of 31 advanced and emerging market economies. It finds that higher deficits and public debt lead to a significant increase in long-term interest rates, with the precise magnitude dependent on initial fiscal, institutional and other structural conditions, as well as spillovers from global financial markets. Taking into account these factors suggests that large fiscal deficits and public debts are likely to put substantial upward pressures on sovereign bond yields in many advanced economies over the medium term.

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} effects of {{government}} spending cuts on economic activity {{in an environment of}} severe fiscal strain, as reflected by a sizeable risk premium on government debt. Specifically, they consider a "sovereign risk channel," through which sovereign default risk spills over {{to the rest of the}} economy, raising funding costs in the private sector. The authors' analysis is based on a variant of the model suggested by Cúrdia and Woodford (2009). It allows for costly financial intermediation and inter-household borrowing and lending in equilibrium, but maintains the tractability of the baseline New Keynesian model. They show that, if monetary policy is constrained in offsetting the effect of higher sovereign risk on private-sector borrowing conditions, the sovereign risk channel exacerbates indeterminacy problems: private-sector beliefs of a weakening economy can become self-fulfilling. Under these conditions, <b>fiscal</b> <b>retrenchment</b> can limit the risk of macroeconomic instability.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of several essays on welfare state retrenchment in advanced industrial democracies since 1990. The intent {{is to provide a}} strong empirical grounding for the theories of welfare state retrenchment using original data sets and state-of-the-art machine learning methods. It also goes beyond the causes of retrenchment to provide suggestive evidence for several effects of retrenchment on the economic behavior of individuals. Overall, the dissertation finds that retrenchment events are most likely to occur when highly-indebted, labor-docile countries experience public fiscal crises, exemplified by rising sovereign debt yields, which are preceded by a weakening of the governing power held by incumbent politicians. Political weakness creates electoral uncertainty which, in combination with economic frailty, sets off a rise in the premium states must pay to issue further debt. This creates significant <b>fiscal</b> pressure for <b>retrenchment.</b> Once retrenchment is carried out, evidence suggests that its effects impact the behavior and mindset of individual consumers, potentially decreasing their expenditures and optimism over their short-term economic future...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the evolution and implementation of the multi-district concept as an appropriate system for the delivery of vocational education in Nebraska. To make this determination the following questions were investigated: To what extent is multi-district programming conducted in other states and how are programs identified, financed, and legislated? What are the most commonly used criteria in establishing multi-district programs in other states? What secondary vocational programs are offered in Nebraska, how are they financed, and what are the secondary program enrollments? What are the attitudes of Nebraska school administrators and board members regarding the multi-district concept for Nebraska? What impact have pilot multi-district projects in Nebraska had on the concept for multi-district programming in Nebraska? What recent activities have impacted on providing vocational education through some type of cooperative effort in Nebraska?^ The review of literature indicated that multi-district programming is being carried on successfully in the majority of states, both rural and urban. ^ The findings of the study indicated that: (1) The proportion of funding varied widely between state, federal, and local sources in most states. 2 ̆ 2 Area 2 ̆ 2 was the most commonly used descriptor for programs. Most states had legislation or statutes which created or allowed specifically for multi-district operations. (2) Geographic and demographic conditions, current and potential enrollments, evidence of need, programs of instruction, administrative and operational plans, and finance were generally accepted criteria for the development, approval, and review of program plans. (3) Over 80 percent of Nebraska high schools had insufficient enrollment to offer comprehensive vocational programs. A wide variation existed in local financial efforts to provide vocational programs, with less than two percent of the funding coming from state appropriations. (4) Nebraska administrators and board members were of the opinion that the implementation of the multi-district concept in Nebraska would be beneficial to the schools. (5) Limited cooperative venture programming had been implemented in a few areas of the state. (6) A legislative interim study of vocational education, public hearings, <b>fiscal</b> limitations and <b>retrenchment,</b> and increased student demand for vocational programs had all renewed interest in, and given visibility to, the condition of vocational education in Nebraska. ^ Further study is warranted in areas of vocational funding and program access.
