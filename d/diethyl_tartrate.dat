50|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of {{the resulting}} epoxide {{is determined by the}} diastereomer of the chiral tartrate diester (usually <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> or diisopropyl tartrate) employed in the reaction. The oxidizing agent is tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Enantioselectivity is achieved by a catalyst formed from titanium tetra(isopropoxide) and <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate.</b> Only 5-10 mol% of the catalyst in the presence of 3Å molecular sieves (3Å MS) is necessary.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} work {{describes the}} synthesis of compounds carrying a vicinal difluoro motif and the evaluation of this structural element to influence the conformation of organic molecules. The synthesis of erythro and threo 1, 2 -difluoro- 1, 2 -diphenylethane was achieved by bromofluorination and subsequent halogen exchange from stilbene. Oxidative degradation of the phenyl rings allowed to access erythro and threo 2, 3 - difluorosuccinic acids {{and a variety of}} derivatives thereof. The conformations of these compounds were investigated by means of X-ray analysis and NMR spectroscopy. Conformational analysis of derivatives of 2, 3 -difluorosuccinic acid was carried out using JHFandJHHNMR coupling constants. A clear preference for the conformations in which the two vicinal C-F bonds are gauche emerged from these calculations, which was confirmed by temperature and solvent dependent NMR analyses. The vicinal difluoro motif was incorporated into small peptide structures. In the solid state, a strong preference to align the vicinal C-F bonds gauche to each other was observed and when adjacent to an amide moiety, the C-F bond was found to prefer an anti periplanar orientation with respect to the carbonyl bond. These effects appeared to override steric and electrostatic interactions. The conformation of these fluorinecontaining peptides showed a clear dependence on the stereochemicaol rientation of the C-F bonds, and this appears to be an effective tool for influencing the secondary and consequently tertiary structure in a predictable manner. In order to access single enantiomerso f peptides having the vicinal difluoro, motif, a stereoselectiver oute to R,R and SS 2, 3 -difluorosuccinic was developed. This involved nucleophilic fluorination of the cyclic sulfates generated from (R, R) - and (SS) - <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrates</b> and subsequent deoxofluorination of the intermediate fluorohydrins.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae to {{the action}} of three antibiotics and diethyl ether was determined. Infected swine were used in an in vivo sensitivity detection system. The parameter of susceptibility was lesion prophylaxis. In vivo, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae appeared to be resistant to <b>diethyl</b> ether, tylosin <b>tartrate,</b> and erythromycin, but was susceptible {{to the action}} of chlortetracycline. Chlortetracycline was effective in preventing the development of lesions when given at levels which would be practical in commercial swine operations...|$|R
50|$|<b>Diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> is {{an organic}} compound, the ethyl ester of tartaric acid. It exists in {{both as a}} chiral isomer, showing both left- and {{right-handed}} forms, {{as well as a}} meso stereoisomer, which is not chiral. The chiral isomer is far more common.|$|E
50|$|The first {{reported}} synthesis, by Stoll and Seebeck in 1951, begins the alkylation of L-cysteine with allyl bromide to form deoxyalliin. Oxidation of this sulfide with hydrogen peroxide gives both diastereomers of L-alliin, differing in {{the orientation of}} the oxygen atom on the sulfur stereocenter.A newer route, reported by Koch and Keusgen in 1998, allows stereospecific oxidation using conditions similar to the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation. The chiral catalyst is produced from <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> and titanium isopropoxide.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Kagan and {{co-workers}} {{were able to}} demonstrate NLE effects with the sharpless epoxidation of (E)-Geraniol (Figure 11). Under sharpless oxidizing conditions with Ti(O-i-Pr)4/(+)-DET/t-BuOOH, Kagan and coworkers were able to demonstrate {{that there was a}} non-linear correlation between the eeproduct and the ee of the chiral catalyst, <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> (DET). As one can see from Figure 11, a greater eeproduct than expected was observed. According to the ML2 model, Kagan and coworkers were able to conclude that a less reactive heterochiral DET complex was present. This would therefore explain the asymmetric amplification observed. The NLE data is also consistent with the Sharpless mechanism of asymmetric epoxidation.|$|E
50|$|Racemic (±) {{fluparoxan}} 6 {{was first}} synthesised by a convergent route, which involved converting the bis-benzyl ether of cis-butene-l,4-diol 1 into its epoxide 2 followed by acid catalyzed ring opening to a racemic-diol {{which was then}} converted into the racemic trans bis-tosylate 3. Coupling 3-fluorocatechol 4 with the racemic trans bis-tosylate 3 in the presence base gave on deprotection the benzodioxan diol 5 which was converted to racemic 6 via coupling its bis-mesylate to benzylamine followed by deprotection.The individual chiral isomers (+) 7 and (-) 8 of fluparoxan were originally prepared from the (+) and (-) isomers of <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> via the corresponding chiral trans bis-tosylates in a convergent route similar to that shown in the synthesis of racemic fluparoxan.|$|E
40|$|A new {{and highly}} {{selective}} method for {{the synthesis of}} hydroxyl-substituted tetrahydropyrans is described. This method utilizes titanium(IV) isopropoxide and <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> to perform a diastereoselective epoxidation followed by in situ epoxide activation and highly selective endo-cyclization to form the desired tetrahydropyran ring. The HIJ ring fragment of the marine ladder polyether yessotoxin was synthesized using this two-stage tactic that proceeds with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{esterification}} of <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> was studied. The research {{was focused on}} the enhancement of reversible reaction yield, which is accomplished by dewatering of the reaction mixture. The removal of water shifts the equilibrium towards the main product. Pervaporation was applied for this purpose, and results were compared to distillation. The advantages and limitations of both processes are discussed. The experimental part consists of dewatering of mixture after the reaction had reached the equilibrium, and was subsequently fed to the test rig equipped with a single zeolite membrane purchased from Pervatech B. V. Results show a significant conversion increase as a result of water removal by pervaporation. Compared to distillation no addition of organics is necessary to efficiently remove water above the azeotrope. Nevertheless, some limitations and issues which call for optimisation are pointed out. A simple numerical model is proposed to support design and sizing of the pervaporation system. Various modes of integrated system operation are also briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} syntheses of {{catalysts}} and their applications in asymmetric reactions. Initially, the project focused on phase transfer catalysts; quaternary phosphonium salts derived from <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> or from commercially available phosphorus compounds {{and their use}} primarily in the alkylation of N,N-diphenyl methylene glycine tert-butyl ester. Although some of the salts showed the ability to catalyse the alkylation reaction, all products obtained were racemic. The project then focused on bifunctional organocatalysis; catalysts derived from isoquinoline and BINOL were studied in Michael addition reactions between ethyl nitropropionate and MVK. Possible evidence for a bifunctional effect was observed, however, all Michael addition products obtained were racemic. Finally, an examination of proline-derived diamines as catalysts for aldol reactions is reported. Reversing {{the positions of the}} acid and base moieties of the catalyst results {{in the formation of the}} opposite enantiomer of the aldol product. In addition, these proline-derived diamines, along with two catalysts derived from a biarylazepine, were tested in a series of asymmetric reactions, with the best enantioselectivities (up to 90 % ee) obtained in the conjugate addition between enones and nitro-containing compounds.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that a chiral solvent can induce an asymmetry in the ternary solubility phase diagram of two enantiomers. Despite this concept was considered as a relevant tool {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century, only a few studies can be found in the literature [1]. For example, Yamamoto et al. reported solubility differences in the case of a chiral cobalt salt in pure enantiomeric <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> [2]. However, no general conclusions can be deduced from the reported studies. We propose to establish the complete ternary phase diagrams both for compound and conglomerate forming systems, in order to quantify and understand how chiral solvent-solute interactions can affect them. General conclusions regarding the feasibility of chiral resolutions with the help of optically active solvents are intended. Preliminary work involved the investigation of the effect of ethyl lactate as chiral solvent on the enantiomeric mandelic acid system. Up to now, several solubility isotherms in the ternary phase diagram as a function of the enantiomeric excess of the solvent ((S) -ethyl lactate / (R) -ethyl lactate) have been determined. However, no exploitable effect was observed in this system. In order to detect the impact of the chiral solvent interactions in general, currently we screen a variety of chiral solvents. For this purpose, we consider that the best solvent candidate should be able to recognize the solute chirality by means of selective or specific non-covalent interactions. There is large experience in using chiral solvents as a chemical shift agent in NMR spectroscopy [3]. We use a similar approach in order to detect the existence of specific chiral interactions in solution, which might provide a more suitable situation for modifying the solid-liquid equilibria. [1] J.

40|$|Papuamides A and B, a novel 22 -membered cyclic depsipeptides, {{were shown}} to possess anti-HIV {{activity}} and antitumor activities against a variety of human cancer cell lines. The papuamides contain several non-proteinogenic amino acid residues such as (2 R, 3 R) -β-methoxytyrosine (β-MeOTyr), (2 S, 3 S, 4 R) - 3, 4 -dimethylglutamine (DiMeGln) and a previously undescribed 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 2, 6, 8 -trimethyldeca-(4 Z, 6 E) -dienoic acid (Dhtda) moiety. ^ Towards the total synthesis of Papuamides A and B, all four diastereomers of 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 2, 6, 8 -trimethyldeca-(4 Z, 6 E) -dienoic acid were synthesized from the commercially available isomers of <b>diethyl</b> <b>tartrate</b> in 10 - 11 steps with 10 % overall yield. A crucial, highly Z-selective Wittig reaction approach was developed to couple two fragments of Dhtda. To assign the relative stereochemistry of the Dhtda moiety, NMR spectra of the diastereomers of synthetic Dhtda were recorded in various solvents and correlated with those of natural Dhtda, resulting in a conclusion that the likely configuration of Dhtda is either (2 R, 3 S, 8 S) or its enantiomer (2 S, 3 R, 8 R). ^ Callipeltin A, a novel 22 -membered cyclic depsipeptide was shown to exhibit anti-HIV activity, antitumor activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines and antifungal activity. Callipeltin A also showed a powerful inhibition of the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger in guinea pigs. Callipeltin A contains several proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acids, including (2 R, 3 R, 4 S) - 4 -amino- 7 -guanidino- 3, 4 -dihydroxyheptanoic acid (AGDHE), (2 R, 3 R) -β-methoxytyrosine (β-MeOTyr), (2 S, 3 S, 4 R) - 3, 4 -dimethylglutamine (DiMeGln) and (2 R, 3 R, 4 S) - 3 -hydroxy- 2, 4, 6 -trimethyl heptanoic acid (TMHEA). ^ In pursuit of the total synthesis of callipeltin A, all the necessary and appropriately protected non-proteinogenic amino acid building blocks were synthesized in an enantio- and diastereoselective fashion. In our efforts to scale up, some of the crucial steps were re-optimized to obtain the required amino acid residues in high yields and multigram quantities. ^ To expedite the total synthesis of callipeltin A and analogues, an Fmoc-based solid phase approach has been developed. The TG Sieber amide resin anchored to the side chain of the N-methylglutamine residue was chosen for the relatively low amounts of TFA needed for cleavage of the peptide from the solid support. In efforts to the synthesis of callipeltin A, a reliable on-resin esterification method was developed in high yield and purity. One pot on-resin macrolactamization of the linear peptide was successfully achieved that also effectively {{reduced the number of}} steps of the synthesis. The coupling of Arg residue was accomplished with both the resin-bound Gln and DiMeGln during the efforts to study the difficult AGDHE coupling that still needs a careful examination. ...|$|E
