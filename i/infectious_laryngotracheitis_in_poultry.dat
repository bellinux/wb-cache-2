40|$|The {{large amounts}} of {{feathers}} produced by the poultry industry, that is considered as a waste was explored for possible uses in various industries, such as meals for animals, biofuels, biodegradable plastic materials, combating water pollution and more. That review mentions these uses, but concentrate on the utilization of feathers for the {{diagnosis of viral infections}} and for monitoring vaccine viruses in chickens after vaccination. The viral diseases in which diagnosis using nucleic acids extracted from the feather shafts was described are, Marek's disease virus, circoviruses, chicken anemia virus, fowlpox virus, avian retroviruses, avian influenza virus and <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus. <b>In</b> two cases, of Marek's disease virus and of <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus, the differentiation of vaccine and wild-type viruses from feather shafts was made possible, thus allowing for monitoring the vaccination efficacy.

One hundred and sixty one-day-old chicks were randomly allocated into four groups, housed in isolated cages of 40 birds each: groupⅠwas Huangqi Maxingshigan decoction treatment group, group II as Ding Chuan San control group, group III as the model group, and group IV as the blank control group. Except for the blank control group, other groups were challenged with <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus via the intratracheal route on age day 52. Birds in group I were administered Huangqi Maxingshigan decoction at a concentration of 0. 4 mL, or with Ding Chuan San in group II for comparison at 48 h post virus challenge (day 54) when they showed clinical signs, 2 times daily for 5 days consecutively. Then, the superoxide dismutases (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in serum, the expression of IFN-γ, IL- 4 mRNA in spleen, the sIgA contents in tracheal fluid, the sIgA secreting cells in trachea were determined on day 5, day 15, day 25 post infection. The results showed that Huangqi Maxingshigan decoction could correct Th 2 -dominant Th 1 /th 2 imbalance through up-regulation of IFN-γ, and down-regulation of IL- 4 at the transcriptional level, enhance cell-mediated immunity, ease inflammatory responses caused by ILTV.

Three groups resulted from the combinations of PCR-RFLP patterns: 19 field isolates formed Group I, and the remaining two isolates together with the chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine strains formed Group II. Group III comprised the tissue-culture origin (TCO) vaccine strain by itself. The PCR-RFLP results agreed with the sequencing results of two ICP 4 gene fragments. The ICP 4 gene sequence analysis showed that the 19 field isolates classified into Group I by RFLP-PCR were identical among themselves, but were different to the TCO and CEO vaccines. The two Group II isolates could not be distinguished from one of the CEO vaccines. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses discriminated between the Brazilian and non-Brazilian isolates, as well as between the TCO and CEO vaccines. Sequence analysis of the TK gene enabled classification of the field isolates (Group I) as virulent and non-vaccine.

40|$|A recent (November 2010) {{outbreak}} of <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> (ILT) <b>in</b> a multi-age laying hen facility in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, is described.

In the outbreak described here, the affected population was approximately eight million hens, with flock sizes ranging from 100, 000 to 2, 900, 000 chickens. The average mortality ranged from 1 to 6 %, and morbidity was around 90 % (most of the twenty seven farms {{of the area}} were positive for ILT virus). Three multi-age laying farms from one company were selected for this report. Clinical signs included prostration, dyspnea, conjunctivitis, occasional swelling of the paranasal sinuses and bloody mucous nasal discharge. Severely affected chickens presented with dyspnea, gasping and became cyanotic before death. At necropsy, these chickens had fibrinous exudate blocking the larynx and the lumen of cranial part of the trachea. In addition, conjunctivitis with intense hyperemia, edema and sinuses with caseous exudate were present. On histopathology, there were marked necrosis and desquamation of respiratory ephitelium and conjunctiva with numerous syncytial cells formation and fibrinous exudate. Moderate to marked non suppurative (especially lymphocytes and plasma cells) infiltration in the lamina propria also was observed. Sixteen out of 20 examined chickens, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed in the syncytial cells. The DNA extracted from larynx and trachea produced positive PCR results for ILT virus (ILTV) DNA using formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. Amplicons from a small region of ICP 4 gene were submitted to sequencing and showed 100 % identity with ILTV EU 104910. 1 (USA strain), 99 % with ILTV JN 596963. 1 (Australian strain) and 91 % with ILTV JN 580316. 1 (Gallid herpesvirus 1 CEO vaccine strain) and JN 580315. 1 (Gallid herpesvirus 1 TCO vaccine strain) ...|$|R

Method In the filtration experiments, 23 inch Berkefeld V and N candles and Seitz discs have been used. The Berkefeld candles were given a preliminary test of their ability to retain bacteria by the filtration of a young (6 to 24 hour) broth culture of a chromogenic strain of B. prodigiosus. A like test was made at each filtration. To determine whether B. prodigiosus or other bacteria were present, two or more blood or plain agar slants were inoculated with 1 loopful of the unfiltered suspensions and other tubes of the same culture media with 0. 5 to 2 cc. of the filtrates. In addition when the suspension was in broth a portion of the filtrate was incubated and examined for growth. The cultures were not discarded until they had been incubated at least 10 days. In all instances the media inoculated with unfiltered material yielded a profuse growth of B. prodigiosus whereas the media inoculated with filtrates remained sterile. The comparative porosity of the Berkefeld filters was determined by the waterflow test of Ward and Tang (2) by which measurement was made of the amount of water that will flow through them in 5 minutes at 10 cm. negative pressure.

40|$|ABSTRACT Avian <b>Infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> (AILT) is a {{respiratory}} tract disease {{of great importance}} because it causes significant economic losses <b>in</b> the <b>poultry</b> industry around the world. It {{is caused by a}} Gallid herpesvirus type 1, a member of the genus Iltovirus. The target system for Avian <b>Infectious</b> <b>Laryngotracheitis</b> virus (AILTV) infections is the respiratory system, and the main organ in which the virus remains latent is the trigeminal ganglia. However, the virus has demonstrated tropism for other organs besides the {{respiratory tract}}. The main transmission routes are ocular and respiratory. Infected birds with clinical symptoms are main sources of transmission, but birds with latent infections, litter, and contaminated fomites may also transmit the virus. Clinical signs usually appear 6 - 12 days after natural exposure and may be moderate or severe. The causative agent of this disease can be propagated in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of developing chicken embryos and replicate in mature chicken kidney cells, as well as in a variety of epithelial chick embryo cells, such as kidneys, liver and lungs. There are several procedures for the diagnosis of ILT such as the observation of clinical signs, the detection of gross and histopathological lesions, and the use of molecular techniques, including RFLP, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Vaccination with different types of vaccine provides a good expectation on disease control, such as vaccines produced in chicken-embryo-origin (CEO), tissue-culture-origin (TCO), and recombinant vaccines. However, in endemic areas, biosecurity measures and best management practices are important for the control of the disease. It is distributed worldwide and, in South America, it has been reported in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Argentina causing great economic losses...|$|R
