40|$|Some {{species of}} plant-mutualistic ants kill <b>the</b> {{vegetation}} growing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> their host plant, creating {{an area of}} bare ground (clearing). <b>The</b> reduced competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clearing may facilitate the establishment of host species sprouts (clones and seedlings), which <b>in</b> turn benefits <b>the</b> ants with additional food and shelter (“sprout-establishment hypothesis”). To test this hypothesis, the density and origin of Acacia collinsii sprouts growing inside clearings and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> acacia plants without clearings were compared. Also, to assess the pruning selectivity of acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex spinicola), seedlings were transplanted into clearings. The reaction of ants towards unrewarding acacia seedlings (without food and shelter) was also tested. The density of acacia sprouts growing inside clearings was almost twice that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> host plants without clearings, and sprouts were inhabited by nestmates of the colony that made the clearing. Clones and seedlings were found in similar proportions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clearings, and ants did not kill unrewarding acacia seedlings or seedlings unrelated to their host. The benefit reported here for the ants could be <b>in</b> conflict with <b>the</b> host plant, especially when the plant has rhizomal reproduction...|$|R

40|$|Earlier GLM {{analyses}} of the impact <b>of</b> pelagic fishing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> Robben and Dassen Islands on the dynamics of penguins breeding on those islands are extended to cover a wider set of data series, and to consider relationships involving sardine and anchovy separately as well as together. This <b>in</b> turn allows <b>the</b> estimation of <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> penguin population growth rate to be expected from suspending pelagic fishing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vicinities</b> <b>of</b> these islands. Interpretation of results is confounded by poor precision which {{is a consequence of}} the shortness of the time series. Likely the most that could be said with some confidence is that the results of the analyses do not support the hypothesis that suspending fishing around Robben and Dassen Islands would enhance penguin reproductive success there...|$|R
