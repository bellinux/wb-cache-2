50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>iniencephaly.</b> The more severe group is <b>iniencephaly</b> apertus, {{involving}} the development of an encephalocele. In the other group, <b>iniencephaly</b> clausus, the encephalocele is absent.|$|E
50|$|While {{anencephaly}} {{experiences a}} partial to {{total lack of}} the neurocranium, <b>iniencephaly</b> does not. In anencephaly, the retroflexed head is not covered with skin while in <b>iniencephaly,</b> the retroflexed head is covered with skin entirely. Cervical vertebrae are malformed and reduced in <b>iniencephaly</b> while they are almost normal in anencephaly.|$|E
50|$|Even though KFS does {{experience}} malformed {{cervical vertebra}} due to failure of segmentation during early fetal development, {{there is not}} retroflexion of the head as seen in <b>iniencephaly.</b> While <b>iniencephaly</b> clausus is fatal, KFS is not and can be surgically corrected. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} correctly diagnose KFS and not mistake it for <b>iniencephaly</b> clausus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iniencephaly</b> of {{both types}} carry a lethal prognosis, {{sometimes}} even ending in spontaneous abortion or stillborns. Most infants die {{within hours of}} childbirth. There are only six reported cases of relatively long-term survival of those born with <b>iniencephaly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Animal {{studies have}} shown that {{administration}} of the drugs vinblastine, streptonigrin, triparano, sulfonamide, tetracycline, antihistamines, and antitumor agents to pregnant mothers have resulted in offspring born with <b>iniencephaly.</b> [...] The drug clomiphene, a drug commonly used for ovulation stimulation in fertility treatments, has also been seen to be associated with <b>iniencephaly.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since newborns with <b>iniencephaly</b> so rarely survive past childbirth, a {{standard}} treatment does not exist.|$|E
50|$|Once {{a mother}} has {{given birth to}} a child with <b>iniencephaly,</b> risk of reoccurrence {{increases}} to 1-5%.|$|E
50|$|Specific types include: {{spina bifida}} which affects the spine, {{anencephaly}} {{which results in}} little to no brain, encephalocele which affects the skull, and <b>iniencephaly</b> which results in severe neck problems.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that obesity of the mother {{increases}} the risk of neural tube disorders such as <b>iniencephaly</b> by 1.7 fold while severe obesity increases the risk by over 3 fold.|$|E
50|$|Since {{many of the}} {{characteristics}} of <b>iniencephaly,</b> such as congenital retroflexion of the spine and fusion of the cervical vertebrae, are shared with other disorders, key differences are important to note.|$|E
50|$|Though the <b>iniencephaly</b> is not genetic {{with its}} cause unknown, {{studies have shown}} that there are certain factors that can {{increase}} the risk of mothers giving birth to children with these anomalies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iniencephaly</b> {{is thought}} to make up around 1% of all fetal abnormalities, with an {{incidence}} rate estimated at 0.1 to 10 in 10,000 deliveries.For unknown reasons, this disease seems to occur most often in newborn females (about 90%).|$|E
50|$|Pregnant {{mothers are}} advised to take folic acid {{supplements}} to reduce risk of <b>iniencephaly</b> by up to 70%. Pregnant mothers are also advised not to take antiepileptic drugs, diuretics, antihistamines, and sulfa drugs, {{all of which have}} been associated with increased risk for neural tube defects.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{accurate}} {{method of diagnosis}} is prenatal screening through real-time fetal images. However, since maternal body habitus leads to diagnostic difficulties using this method, MRI and sonography are {{the most commonly used}} technique since there is no exposure to ionizing radiation. [...] At the beginning of the second trimester, the central nervous system (CNS) and anatomic structures of the fetus can be clearly visualized and the characteristic malformations of <b>iniencephaly,</b> such as a shortened trunk, marked lordosis in the cervicothoracic vertebrae, absence or partial absence of the occipital squama, abnoramal fusion of vertebrae, closed vertebral arches, formation of an encephalocele (for <b>iniencephaly</b> apertus), and dorsiflexion of the head in respect to the spine, can be precisely diagnosed as well as the severity and location established. Once established, further decisions can be made with regard to terminating the pregnancy or providing a plan of adequate postnatal care.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of NTDs: open, which are more common, and closed. Open NTDs occur when the brain and/or spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or {{vertebrae}} (back bones). Examples of open NTDs are anencephaly, encephaloceles, hydranencephaly, <b>iniencephaly,</b> schizencephaly, and spina bifida. Rarer types of NTDs are called closed NTDs. Closed NTDs occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin. Common examples of closed NTDs are lipomyelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, and tethered cord.|$|E
5000|$|The {{affected}} infant {{tends to}} be short, with a disproportionately large head. The fetal head of Infants born with <b>iniencephaly</b> are hyperextended while the foramen magnum is enlarged and opens through the widened pedicles. The defective neural arches directly into the upper cervical reach of the spinal canal, causing {{the formation of a}} common cavity between most of the spinal cord and the brain. The skin of the anterior chest is connected directly to the face, bypassing the formation of a neck, while the scalp is directly connected to the skin of the back. Because of this, those born with this anomaly either have a highly shortened neck or no neck at all. This causes extreme retroflexion, or backward bending, of the head in a [...] "star-gazing" [...] fashion. The spine is severely distorted as well along with significant shortening due to marked lordosis. The vertebrae, especially cervical, are fused together in abnormal shapes and their numbers are reduced. The spinal cord is almost always defective while the ventricular system is often dilated and the cortex is thinned. Sometimes, in the case of <b>iniencephaly</b> apertus, an encephalocele (sac-like protrusions of the brain through an opening in the cranium) forms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iniencephaly</b> {{is a rare}} neural tube defect {{that results}} in extreme bending of the head to the spine. The {{diagnosis}} can usually be made on antenatal ultrasound scanning, but if not will undoubtedly be made immediately after birth because the head is bent backwards and the face looks upwards. Usually the neck is absent. The skin of the face connects directly to the chest and the scalp connects to the upper back. The infant will usually not survive {{more than a few}} hours.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{pathogenesis}} of <b>iniencephaly</b> {{is still}} unknown {{though there are}} proposed theories, most of which view the neural tube malformation from the primary neural anomaly standpoint.Marin-Padilla and MarinPadilla have proposed that the cause for the abnormalities {{has to do with}} a deficiency in the primary mesoderm. P. Erdinçler, et al. suggests from their findings that the cause of the anomaly is actually a defect in the occipital bone and rachischisis of the posterior vertebral arches leading to herniation of neural tissue through the opening in the bone during gestation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Iniencephaly,</b> a term {{derived from}} the Greek word [...] "inion" [...] for nape of the neck, is a rare type of cephalic {{disorder}} that was first described by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1836. Those afflicted with the disorder all share 3 common characteristics: a defect to the occipital bone, spina bifida of the cervical vertebrae and retroflexion (backward bending) of the head on the cervical spine. Stillbirth {{is the most common}} outcome, with a few rare examples of live birth, after which death almost invariably occurs within a short time.|$|E
40|$|<b>Iniencephaly</b> {{is a rare}} kind {{of neural}} tube defect that is {{classified}} into two types of <b>iniencephaly</b> apertus and <b>iniencephaly</b> clausus. This anomaly could be diagnosed prenatally by obstetric ultrasonography and terminated by therapeutic abortion; however, it could be undiagnosed until birth similar to our case due to the abnormal position of the fetus or lack of experience of the sonographer. Due to abnormality of the neural tube, which causes abnormal head and neck position, all these cases will die shortly after birth. We hereby introduce the photos and imaging findings of a case of an alive neonate with <b>iniencephaly</b> clausus...|$|E

40|$|<b>Iniencephaly</b> {{is a rare}} neural tube defect {{characterized}} by extreme retroflexion of {{the head with the}} absence of neck due to spinal deformities. The important features that help us to diagnose a case of <b>iniencephaly</b> are occipital bone deficit leading to enlarged foramen magnum, fusion of malformed cervical and thoracic vertebrae, and upward turned face with chin continuous with chest because of the absence of neck. The differential diagnoses include anencephaly with spinal retroflexion, Klippel–Fiel syndrome, nuchal tumors such as teratoma, goiter, and lymphangioma and Jarcho–Levin syndrome. Previously many case reports on radiological features of <b>iniencephaly</b> are published, but there are very few articles on necropsy findings and differential diagnosis.

40|$|The {{necropsy}} {{reports of}} 294 cases of anencephaly and 50 cases of <b>iniencephaly</b> have been examined, and a tubulated list of associated malformations produced.

Forty-one per cent of the series had other malformations, and other malformations were more common in those cases with spina bifida than in those without. The most frequent single malformations were: hydronephrosis (8 %), cleft palate (8 %), diaphragmatic hernia (5 %), exomphalos (5 %), hare lip (4 %), and horseshoe kidney (4 %).

40|$|In {{the period}} 1980 - 1987, neural tube defects were {{two to three}} times more {{prevalent}} in populations covered by EUROCAT registries in the United Kingdom and Ireland (UKI) than in Continental Europe and Malta (CEM). 1864 NTD cases in a total population of 580, 000 births in UKI and 455 cases in a population of 380, 000 births in CEM were analysed to find if there were differences in the ratio of prevalence rates between UKI and CEM according to site of the defect and association with non-central nervous system (CNS) anomalies. The prevalence rate ratio was high for anencephaly with accompanying spina bifida, <b>iniencephaly,</b> and upper spina bifida, and low for encephalocele, lower spina bifida, and anencephaly without other neural tube defects. There was a greater female excess for anencephaly with accompanying spina bifida, <b>iniencephaly,</b> and upper spina bifida than for other defects in both geographic areas. There was a female excess for encephalocele in UKI but a male excess in CEM. Certain sites (anencephaly with accompanying spina bifida, <b>iniencephaly,</b> and encephalocele) {{were more likely to have}} accompanying non-CNS anomalies. The prevalence rate ratio of multiply malformed NTD was in general lower than for isolated NTD but showed the same pattern by site. The prevalence rate ratio was high for multiply malformed anencephaly with accompanying spina bifida, <b>iniencephaly,</b> and upper spina bifida. The sex ratio was similar between isolated and multiply malformed cases when site of the defect is taken into account. It is concluded that the geographic prevalence pattern and sex ratio differ according to site of NTD but do not differ substantially according to whether NTD is isolated or associated with non-CNS anomalies...|$|E

40|$|<b>Iniencephaly</b> is a {{rare and}} mostly lethal type of neural tube defect. The pattern of {{inheritance}} of this group of malformations is multifactorial, rendering {{the identification of the}} underlying causes. Numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate the genetic basis of human neurulation. Essential signaling pathways of the development of the CNS include the planar cell polarity pathway, which is important for the initiation of neural tube closure, as well as the sonic hedgehog pathway, which regulates the neural plate bending. Genes influencing the different stages of neurulation have been investigated for their eventual {{role in the development of}} these malformations. Among the environmental factors, folic acid seems to be the most important modifier of the risk of human neural tube defects. Genes of the folate metabolism pathways have also been investigated to identify mutations resulting in increased risk of neural tube defects.
