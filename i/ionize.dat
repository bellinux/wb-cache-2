The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons.

5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would <b>ionize</b> before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E

The ionic radius of hexacoordinate Md3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 91.2pm; 1988 calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and ionic radius produced a value of 89.6pm, as well as an enthalpy of hydration of −(3654±12)kJ·mol−1.

5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they <b>ionize</b> and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating.

40|$|Foscarnet (trisodium {{phosphonoformate}} hexahydrate) is an antiviral agent used {{to treat}} cytomegalovirus disease in immunocompromised patients.

Prevention of <b>ionized</b> hypomagnesemia following foscarnet administration could blunt the development of <b>ionized</b> hypocalcemia.

Although 71 % and 58 % of 156 predominantly surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients were hypocalcemic by the total serum Ca or calculated <b>ionized</b> Ca level, respectively, only 12 % were hypocalcemic by directly measured serum <b>ionized</b> Ca measurement.

We conclude that: total serum Ca and calculated <b>ionized</b> Ca concentrations are poor indicators of the true serum <b>ionized</b> Ca status in critically ill surgical patients, and we recommend direct measurement of serum <b>ionized</b> Ca levels in these patients; and variability in the affinity of Ca for binding proteins in critical illness may explain the poor correlation between serum total and <b>ionized</b> Ca measurements...|$|R
40|$|The <b>ionizing</b> {{background}} of cosmic hydrogen {{is an important}} probe of the sources and absorbers of <b>ionizing</b> radiation in the post-reionization universe. Previous {{studies show that the}} ionization rate should be very sensitive to changes in the source population: as the emissivity rises, absorbers shrink in size, increasing the <b>ionizing</b> mean free path and, hence, the <b>ionizing</b> background. By contrast, observations of the <b>ionizing</b> background find a very flat evolution from z~ 2 - 5, before falling precipitously at z~ 6. We resolve this puzzling discrepancy by pointing out that, at z~ 2 - 5, optically thick absorbers are associated with the same collapsed halos that host <b>ionizing</b> sources. Thus, an increasing abundance of galaxies is compensated for by a corresponding increase in the absorber population, which moderates the instability in the <b>ionizing</b> background. However, by z~ 5 - 6, gas outside of halos dominates the absorption, the coupling between sources and absorbers is lost, and the <b>ionizing</b> background evolves rapidly. Our halo based model reproduces observations of the <b>ionizing</b> background, its flatness and sudden decline, as well as the redshift evolution of the <b>ionizing</b> mean free path. Our work suggests that, through much of their history, both star formation and photoelectric opacity in the universe track halo growth.

The most widely used application for these matrices is studying porphyrin like compounds such as chlorophyll. These matrices have been shown to have better ionization patterns that do not result in odd fragmentation patterns or complete loss of side chains.
