500|$|I {{loved my}} drunk scenes. I know {{that may sound}} very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|At Peking Airport, contingents of the Chinese {{military}} {{await the}} arrival of the American presidential aircraft [...] "Spirit of '76", carrying Nixon and his party. The military chorus sings the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. After the aircraft touches down, Nixon emerges with Pat Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The president exchanges stilted greetings with the Chinese premier, Chou En-lai, who heads the welcoming party. Nixon speaks of the historical significance of the visit, and of his hopes and fears for the encounter ("News has a kind of mystery"). The scene changes to Chairman Mao's study, where the Chairman awaits {{the arrival of}} the presidential party. Nixon and Kissinger enter with Chou, and Mao and the president converse in banalities as photographers record the scene. In the discussion that follows, the westerners are confused by Mao's gnomic and frequently impenetrable comments, which are amplified by his secretaries and often by Chou. The scene changes again, to the evening's banquet in the Great Hall of the People. Chou toasts the American visitors ("We have begun to celebrate the different ways") and Nixon responds ("I have attended many feasts"), after which the toasts continue as the atmosphere becomes increasingly convivial. Nixon, a politician who rose to prominence on anti-communism, announces: [...] "Everyone, listen; <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> say one thing. I opposed China, I was wrong".|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am {{lucky that}} way, Sally. Drink acts some ways with some people, and some ways with others. It makes some people blab out just {{the things they}} don't want known; it makes some people quarrelsome; it shuts up some people's mouths altogether. That is the way with me. I take what I take quiet, and though the coppers round here see me drunk pretty often they can't never say as I am drunk and disorderly, so they <b>just</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> find my way home as I can.' ...|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest, Clarkson stated {{that she and her}} producers strove to record her voice in the album as it is heard at live performances, with as little auto-tune processing as possible, saying [...] "What separates this album are the vocals. They sound richer and fuller, and, for the first time, how I sound when I’m performing live. The producers I worked with <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> sing and be me." [...] Clarkson remarked that [...] "It was a lot of soulful stuff. You know what I'm saying? Like, Radiohead is alternative, but they're very soulful. And Sheryl Crow, very soulful singer-songwriter. So it's all very soulful, rhythmic pop rock." [...] Shortly after the final track listing was revealed, MTV observed that the word [...] "you" [...] featured prominently in the songs' titles. Clarkson asserted [...] "They're all different 'you's'. There's no common, like, it wasn't like one, I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, it wasn't like that. No, I just think life is about relationships, so I always write about all these different ones going on in my life and I don't really have a filter. So it's usually very [...]" ...|$|E

5000|$|Konecny {{was drafted}} first {{overall in the}} 2013 OHL Priority Selection by the 67's, winning the Jack Ferguson Award for first overall draft pick. After his first preseason {{training}} camp with the team he laughed that, [...] "I took a few shots from the older guys, they were <b>just</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> know I'm still a rookie ... I'm going {{to work hard and}} do whatever I can control and let things fall into place." [...] He earned two primary assists in his first OHL game on September 20, 2013, and became a draw for fans in his first month with the team.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two and threepence." [...] The barber paused. [...] "Well, look here," [...] he continued, {{with the}} remains of a {{calculation}} in his tone, which calculation had been the reduction to figures of the probable monetary magnetism necessary to overpower the resistant force of her present purse and the woman's love of comeliness, [...] "here's a sovereign--a gold sovereign, almost new." [...] He held it out between his finger and thumb. [...] "That's as much as you'd earn in {{a week and a half}} at that rough man's work, and it's yours for <b>just</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> snip off what you've got too much of." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nicklaus started fairly slowly {{during his}} first year on the PGA Tour in 2000 but in April he put {{together}} three strong rounds at the BellSouth Classic in Atlanta, Georgia and found himself tied for the 54-hole lead with Phil Mickelson. When torrential rains struck on Sunday, leaving much of the course unplayable, Tour officials canceled the final round {{and called for a}} sudden-death playoff to determine a champion. On the first hole, a par-three, Mickelson hit the green while Nicklaus left his shot just short in a bunker. It took Nicklaus two more shots to get on the green, while Mickelson sank his birdie putt to win the tournament. Despite his disappointment, Nicklaus was encouraged, saying, [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> know that there are good things coming down the road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along, Jarvis," [...] he invited, as {{the latter}} entered with a {{rustling}} heap of correspondence. [...] "We'll sort the letters {{as quickly as possible}} this morning.

5000|$|Boyd {{states that}} the lyrics were {{inspired}} by a difficult break up {{he was going through}} upon recording the song. Boyd stated that writing the song helped him work through his emotions on the departure."'Energy' {{and a lot of the}} record was written during the breakup, and that song in particular is about my realization that I can’t be dependent on any one person except myself. It’s just a constant reminder of where I was at that point in my life and now the song <b>just</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> know that I can’t get back there again.”He explains that [...] "The Energy" [...] is in reference to having the energy to be self-sufficient, and not dependent on any one person. [...] MTV described the lyrics as [...] " [...] a misty reverie to a full-throttle venting session" [...] while describing its sound as having [...] "propulsive guitars, emotionally expressive vocals and galvanic rhythms".|$|R
