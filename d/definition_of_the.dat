5|$|The {{proposed}} <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{second is}} effectively {{the same as}} the current definition, the only difference being that the conditions under which the measurements are made are more rigorously defined.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{kilogram}} {{remained unchanged}} throughout the twentieth century, the 3rd CGPM in 1901 clarified that the kilogram was {{a unit of}} mass, not of weight. The original batch of 40 prototypes (adopted in 1889) were supplemented {{from time to time}} with further prototypes for use by new signatories to the Metre Convention.|$|E

5|$|An alloy of 90% {{platinum}} and 10% iridium {{was used}} in 1889 to construct the International Prototype Metre and kilogram mass, kept by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. The meter bar was replaced as the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental unit of length in 1960 by {{a line in the}} atomic spectrum of krypton, but the kilogram prototype is still the international standard of mass.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second relied on quantum theory, the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E

5|$|In {{information}} theory, the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of}} self-information and information entropy is often expressed with the binary logarithm, corresponding {{to making the}} bit the fundamental unit of information.

5|$|It is {{expected}} that the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kilogram and several other units will change on May 20, 2019, following a final vote by the CGPM in November 2018. The new definition will use only invariant quantities of nature: the Planck constant, the speed of light, and the caesium hyperfine frequency.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to extend the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow to more general inputs than curves, for instance by using rectifiable varifolds or the level set method. However, these extended definitions may allow parts of curves to vanish instantaneously or fatten into sets of nonzero area.|$|E

5|$|It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Méchain and Delambre's result (443.296lignes) was slightly too short for the meridianal <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metre. Arago and Biot extended the survey to the island of Formentera in the western Mediterranean Sea in 1806–1809, and found that one ten-millionth of the Earth's quadrant should be 443.31lignes: later work increased the value to 443.39lignes. The modern value, for the WGS84 reference spheroid, is m or lignes.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are seeing}} far greater {{variability}} in the prototypes than previously believed. The increasing divergence in the masses of the world's prototypes and the short-term instability in the IPK has prompted research into improved methods to obtain a smooth surface finish using diamond turning on newly manufactured replicas and has intensified {{the search for a}} new <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kilogram.
