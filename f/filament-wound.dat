50|$|Tubes {{are usually}} made either of steel or aluminium, {{although}} there is composite scaffolding, which uses <b>filament-wound</b> tubes of glass fibre in a nylon or polyester matrix, {{because of the high}} cost of composite tube, it is usually only used when there is a risk from overhead electric cables that cannot be isolated. If steel, they are either 'black' or galvanised. The tubes {{come in a variety of}} lengths and a standard diameter of 48.3 mm. (1.5 NPS pipe). The chief difference between the two types of metal tubes is the lower weight of aluminium tubes (1.7 kg/m as opposed to 4.4 kg/m). However they are more flexible and have a lower resistance to stress. Tubes are generally bought in 6.3 m lengths and can then be cut down to certain typical sizes. Most large companies will brand their tubes with their name and address in order to deter theft.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} provide the {{necessary}} performance to launch polar-orbiting shuttles from the SLC-6 launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, SRBs using <b>filament-wound</b> cases (FWC) were designed to be more lightweight than the steel cases used on Kennedy Space Center-launched SRBs. Unlike the regular SRBs, which had the flawed field joint design {{that led to the}} Challenger Disaster in 1986, the FWC boosters had the [...] "double tang" [...] joint design (necessary to keep the boosters properly in alignment during the [...] "twang" [...] movement when the SSMEs are ignited prior to liftoff), but used the two O-ring seals. With the closure of SLC-6, the FWC boosters were scrapped by ATK and NASA, but their field joints, albeit modified to incorporate the current three O-ring seals and joint heaters, were later incorporated into the present-day field joints on the current SRBs.|$|E
5000|$|Relative to {{liquid fuel}} rockets, solid fuel rockets have lower {{specific}} impulse, {{a measure of}} propellant efficiency. The propellant mass ratios of solid propellant upper stages is usually in the [...]91 to [...]93 range which {{is as good as}} or better than that of most liquid propellant upper stages but overall performance is less than for liquid stages because of the solids' lower exhaust velocities. The high mass ratios possible with (unsegmented) solids is a result of high propellant density and very high strength-to-weight ratio <b>filament-wound</b> motor casings. A drawback to solid rockets is that they cannot be throttled in real time, although a programmed thrust schedule can be created by adjusting the interior propellant geometry. Solid rockets can be vented to extinguish combustion or reverse thrust as a means of controlling range or accommodating warhead separation. Casting large amounts of propellant requires consistency and repeatability which is assured by computer control. Casting voids in propellant can adversely affect burn rate so the blending and casting takes place under vacuum and the propellant blend is spread thin and scanned to assure no large gas bubbles are introduced into the motor. Solid fuel rockets are intolerant to cracks and voids and often require post-processing such as x-ray scans to identify faults. Since the combustion process is dependent on the surface area of the fuel; voids and cracks represent local increases in burning surface area. This increases the local temperature, system pressure and radiative heat flux to the surface. This positive feedback loop further increases burn rate and can easily lead to catastrophic failure typically due to case failure or nozzle system damage.|$|E

40|$|The {{compressive}} {{performance of}} a <b>filament-wound</b> cylinder can be severely degraded by unavoidable fiber curvatures due {{to the presence of}} crossover bands. These crossover bands contain fiber undulations which influence the compressive strength, stiffness, and associated failure mechanisms of a <b>filament-wound</b> structure. The primary objectives of this study were to identify failure mechanisms and measure the compressive strength and stiffness of test specimens which model the microundulations. Compressive tests were conducted on flat-panel coupons which were developed to model the mechanics of large-scale fiber undulation regions in <b>filament-wound</b> composite cylinders. The primary effect of the undulation regions within a <b>filament-wound</b> structure is to initiate failure. Depending on the overall laminate configuration, the failure process includes various combinations of failure mechanisms, such as delaminations, matrix splitting and/or fiber fracture. These failure mechanisms are aggravated by the presence of large deformations caused by the reduction in local compressive stiffness and the introduction of complex material couplings due to the fiber undulation. Furthermore, the adjacent layers have been shown to strongly influence the compressive strength, stiffness, and associated failure mechanisms by weakening or reinforcing the laminate...|$|E

40|$|The {{predicted}} compressive {{stiffness and}} buckling strength of <b>filament-wound</b> cylinders using classical lamination theory is {{significantly higher than}} those observed experimentally.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method for predicting the residual stress state, resin cure state, and layer locations for <b>filament-wound</b> multilayer, multimaterial, orthotropic cylinders was developed. Submodels {{have been developed}} for each sequence in the filament winding process. ^ The submodels developed address the majority of the phenomena affecting the stress and cure state of a <b>filament-wound</b> composite cylinder. Contributions to the existing technology include: (1) Composite layer stiffness model which accounts for radial and meridional stiffness and increasing contribution of the resin as cure progresses. (2) Resin flow model allows axial as well as radial flow through the laminate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides the}} theoretical background and concept for analyzing the <b>filament-wound</b> pressure vessels with thin metallic liners. The thin metallic liner is serving mainly as a permeation barrier to hold liquid or gas, while the composite is sized to carry {{majority of the}} pressure loads. The bilinear material model is selected to simulate the material stress-strain curve which governs the metal linear behavior. An equivalent Poisson 2 Ì† 7 s ratio is proposed {{to take into account}} the apparent change of Poisson 2 Ì† 7 s ratio when liner stress exceeds the yield strength of material. The subjects investigated in this dissertation are classical lamination theory, quadratic failure criterion, bilinear material model, finite element analysis for axisymmetric solids, and linear elastic fracture mechanics. The objective of this dissertation is to establish a rational analysis procedure for <b>filament-wound</b> pressure vessels with metal liners. ^ Four sample cases are analyzed to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed finite element program FEASY 4 ND in solving the axisymmetric shell problems. The cases investigated include the parametric study on Poisson 2 Ì† 7 s ratio, the thick-walled and thin-walled sphere analyses, and analysis of a sample <b>filament-wound</b> pressure vessel with a thin metallic liner. The <b>filament-wound</b> pressure vessel is analyzed at proof, operating, and design burst pressures. The liner cycle life is calculated based on the principle of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The effect of crack geometry (a/ 2 c), compressive effectivity factor f, proof pressure, operating pressure, and edge effect on the liner cycle life are also investigated. An empirical formula for conservatively predicting the liner cycle life of the sample pressure vessel in terms of the ratio of operating and proof pressures, and compressive effectivity factor is derived using least-squares curve-fit technique. ...|$|E
40|$|A <b>filament-wound</b> {{spinning}} composite disk is characterised by the mosaic-patterned {{configuration of}} the layers produced during a filament-winding process. In this structure, each helically wound layer consists of curved triangular-shaped units alternating in the radial and circumferential directions. The mosaic-patterned configuration is not normally considered in the general stress analysis procedures based on the conventional modelling of laminated composite structures, including those available in FEA packages. However, the filament-winding mosaic pattern of the composite layer could significantly affect the stress fields developed due to rotational loading. Therefore, a methodology for the FE modelling {{and analysis of the}} <b>filament-wound</b> disk taking into account this effect is developed and structural analyses are performed using ANSYS, with different types of filament-winding mosaic patterns incorporated. Also, the disk is modelled and analysed using a conventional method and the differences in predicted stress values from both techniques are demonstrated through distributions of various stresses. The modelling governed by the first order shear deformation theory is performed using the SHELL 281 element. Firstly, using a conventional approach, the <b>filament-wound</b> composite disk is modelled as a laminated circular plate composed of different numbers of plies in which interlacing of plies due to filament-winding is not considered. Alternatively, three designs composed of 4, 8 and 14 plies are chosen to model the mosaic-patterned structure and to demonstrate changes in the stress levels in different layers and the extent of the influence of ply interlacing. Each design is associated with three types of mosaic-patterned configurations, namely 4, 6 and 8 mosaic units around the circumference of the disk. The disk is rotated at a constant angular velocity with the boundary conditions to prevent in-plane rigid body motions in both the radial and circumferential directions and also out-of-plane rigid body motion in the axial direction. As observed, the stress levels in the thin <b>filament-wound</b> composite flywheel disk could be underestimated in case of a structural analysis using the conventional mechanics of laminated structures. The layers of the <b>filament-wound</b> composite flywheel disk are reinforced with radially varying fibre trajectories that result in continuous changes in fibre orientation angles which generate stiffness variations and composite laminates with such stiffness variations are called variable-stiffness laminates. Thus, varying fibre trajectories should be modelled accurately to incorporate the actual stiffness variations for FEA of variable-stiffness composite structures. Therefore, a modelling approach is developed that would take into account the continuously varying fibre orientation angles derived from the predefined changing fibre trajectories. FE modelling of variable-stiffness laminates is performed using the proposed method and corresponding results obtained from various analyses are reported. Based on the results obtained from the numerical analyses of the <b>filament-wound</b> flywheel disk, various design aspects are assessed in terms of the dimensions and energy storage capacity of the disk. Parametric and comparative analyses of various disks are performed using different performance-controlling factors...|$|E
