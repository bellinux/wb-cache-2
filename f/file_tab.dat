The previous Office button—a round button adorned with the Microsoft Office logo—had a different appearance from the ribbon tabs in the Office 2007 interface and was positioned away from them, with a target that extended toward {{the upper left}} corner of the screen in accordance with Fitts's law. Microsoft has stated that this button enhanced the usability of Office, but many users saw it as [...] "branding decoration, rather than a functional button."

40|$|Summary: ADAPT-nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (ADAPT-NMR) offers an automated {{approach to the}} concurrent acquisition and processing of protein NMR data {{with the goal of}} complete backbone and side chain assignments. What the approach lacks is a useful graphical interface for reviewing results and for searching for missing peaks that may have prevented assignments or led to incorrect assignments. Because most of the data ADAPT-NMR collects are 2 D tilted planes used to find peaks in 3 D spectra, {{it would be helpful to}} have a tool that reconstructs the 3 D spectra. The software package reported here, ADAPT-NMR Enhancer, supports the visualization of both 2 D tilted planes and reconstructed 3 D peaks on each tilted plane. ADAPT-NMR Enhancer can be used interactively with ADAPT-NMR to auto-matically assign selected peaks, or it can be used to produce PINE-SPARKY-like graphical dialogs that support atom-by-atom and peak-by-peak assignment strategies. Results can be exported in vari-ous formats, including XEASY proton file (. prot), PINE pre-assignment file (. str), PINE probabilistic output file, SPARKY peak list file (. list) and TALOSþ input <b>file</b> (. <b>tab).</b> As an example, we show how ADAPT-NMR Enhancer was used to extend the automated data collection and as-signment results for the protein Aedes aegypti sterol carrier protein 2.

40|$|Much of {{software}} developers’ {{time is spent}} understanding unfamiliar code. To better understand how developers gain this understanding and how software development environments might be involved, a study was performed in which developers were given an unfamiliar program and asked to work on two debugging tasks and three enhancement tasks for 70 minutes. The study found that developers interleaved three activities. They began by searching for relevant code both manually and using search tools; however, they based their searches on limited and misrepresentative cues in the code, environment, and executing program, often leading to failed searches. When developers found relevant code, they followed its incoming and outgoing dependencies, often returning to it and navigating its other dependencies; while doing so, however, Eclipse’s navigational tools caused significant overhead. Developers collected code and other information that they believed {{would be necessary to}} edit, duplicate, or otherwise refer to later by encoding it in the interactive state of Eclipse’s package explorer, <b>file</b> <b>tabs,</b> and scroll bars. However, developers lost track of relevant code as these interfaces were used for other tasks, and developers were forced to find it again. These issues caused developers to spend, on average, 35 percent of their time performing the mechanics of navigation within and between source files. These observations suggest a new model of program understanding grounded in theories of information foraging and suggest ideas for tools that help developers seek, relate, and collect information in a more effective and explicit manner...|$|R
