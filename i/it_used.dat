5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or tandem landing gear configuration. <b>It</b> <b>used</b> wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into fairings. The main undercarriage of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E

5|$|Another Trojan in this wave, TorrentLocker, {{initially}} {{contained a}} design flaw comparable to CryptoDefense; <b>it</b> <b>used</b> the same keystream for every infected computer, making the encryption trivial to overcome.

5|$|Apollo {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} American scientific programs ever. It cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars or an estimated $ in present-day US dollars. (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $, accounting for inflation.) <b>It</b> <b>used</b> the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects. The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.|$|E
5|$|As the {{war years}} went, the newspaper's {{finances}} gradually improved. The Norwegian state became more active in production and trade and contributed many advertisements. Demokraten acquired its own type-setting machine in October 1918 and a printing press in 1917, which <b>it</b> <b>used</b> from 1 January 1918. From 1 July 1918, circulation once again increased to six days a week.|$|E

40|$|The {{information}} systems (IS) community has developed many theories, approaches, and models that identify conditions and determinants of successful <b>IT</b> <b>use.</b> However, each {{model in the}} IS literature has evolved to address specific aspects and dimensions. This has led to conflicting results concerning the impact of <b>IT</b> <b>use.</b> Consequently, while a rich body of knowledge has emerged, with prominent models such as the Technology Acceptance Model or the IS Success Model, the complexity of defining a suitable multi-dimensional construct for <b>IT</b> <b>use</b> has largely been neglected. In this paper, we develop a new causal model of <b>IT</b> <b>use.</b> Based on Adaptive Structuration Theory, we argue for the multidimensionality of <b>IT</b> <b>use</b> and thoroughly derive its components. Moreover, we introduce two new concepts into studies of successful IT use: functional affordance and symbolic expression. Both establish a relation between the IT system under investigation and its users. In doing so, we provide a novel, synthesized approach for investigating <b>IT</b> <b>use</b> {{in the context of}} post-adoptive behaviours and the framework of Adaptive Structuration Theory...|$|R

5|$|Braathens Helikopter A/S was a Norwegian {{helicopter}} airline {{based at}} Stavanger Airport, Sola, and Bergen Airport, Flesland. <b>It</b> <b>used</b> {{a fleet of}} seven Aérospatiale Super Pumas to serve offshore oil platforms in the North Sea. The customers were Phillips Petroleum, Norsk Hydro, Statoil, Amoco and British Petroleum, serving their oil fields Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk, Valhall, Ula and Gyda. Braathens Helikopter operated from 1989 to 1993, after which it was sold to and merged with the main competitor, Helikopter Service. Braathens Helikopter was owned by Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi and was a sister company of the airline Braathens SAFE.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the routing through Muskegon was altered. Instead of {{terminating}} in {{the park}} at the outlet of Muskegon Lake into Lake Michigan, M-46 was routed to follow US16 to the car ferry docks. The last section of gravel highway was also paved in Newaygo County near the Montcalm County line. The routing of M-46 between Casnovia and Howard City was altered in 1973 when the US131 freeway was opened north of Cedar Springs by then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. M-46 was restored to the Kent City–Cedar Springs roadway <b>it</b> <b>used</b> in the 1930s and routed concurrently along US131 again.|$|E
5|$|Dunne's {{bartender}} came to wider {{attention with}} the wartime columns, and the Dooley pieces were soon in newspapers nationwide.

Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time and inspiration for new columns, and they ended in 1915, except for a brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure {{due in part to}} his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that <b>it</b> <b>used</b> have proved a lasting barrier for potential readers.|$|E
