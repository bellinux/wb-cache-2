Food liking influences hunger and fullness, however, {{the direction of}} this influence remains unclear due to the difficulty in capturing the complexity of hunger and fullness feelings and the subjective nature of evaluating food liking. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of food liking (utilizing a bittering agent) on feelings of hunger and fullness utilizing the Five-Factor Hunger and Fullness Questionnaire [(1) mental hunger, (2) physical hunger, (3) mental fullness, (4) physical fullness and (5) food liking]. Thirty participants attended two breakfast sessions one week apart in which they evaluated hunger and fullness feelings produced by two equal-caloric smoothies that differed only in that one contained a bittering agent to lower liking. Levels of the bittering agent were determined from a screening procedure and were panellist specific, targeting a 20 % drop in liking. Evaluations were made at 0 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, and 180 minutes after consumption. Food intake from an ad libitum snack offered three hours after breakfast was covertly recorded. The more palatable control smoothie provided significantly greater mental <b>fullness</b> <b>factor</b> sensations over the three-hour testing period than the bitter smoothie. Physical <b>fullness</b> <b>factor</b> ratings were initially higher for the bitter smoothie than the control smoothie, but dropped to a nearly equal level two hours after consumption. Mental and physical hunger factor sensations were nearly equal between the two smoothies over the three hour testing period. Subjects consumed on average 77 more calories from the ad libitum snack following the bitter smoothie in comparison to the control (p-value < 0. 05). These findings suggest that food liking and mental fullness are critically important to understanding satiety and future calorie consumption...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} research was to develop and test a questionnaire to assess satiety sensations. Factor analysis of satiety related questions revealed five factors: mental hunger, physical hunger, mental fullness, physical fullness and food liking. In the first validation study, thirty participants evaluated satiety feelings produced by oranges and oatmeal at 0 min, 60 min and 120 min after consumption. Food intake from an ad libitum snack offered two hours after breakfast was covertly recorded. The factor scales and traditional single-item scales (hunger, fullness, desire, and prospective consumption) revealed that oatmeal was more satiating than oranges. The factor scales offered enhanced understanding over the traditional scales by showing that oranges produced much more mental hunger and slightly more physical hunger than the oatmeal. The factor scales also had smaller distributions around the means and greater effect sizes than the traditional scales indicating a greater sensitivity to the differences between the oranges and the oatmeal. In a second study, participants evaluated satiety feelings produced by two equal-calorie smoothies that differed only in that one contained cumin to lower acceptability. The more palatable regular smoothie provided greater mental <b>fullness</b> <b>factor</b> sensations than the spiced cumin smoothie. Again, all of the factor scales produced smaller distributions around the means and greater effect sizes. In a third validation study, hunger and satiety of oligofructose, inulin, soluble corn fiber, resistant wheat starch and a control with no added fiber in chocolate crisp bars was evaluated. Food intake was measured at an ad libitum lunch served 180 min after breakfast and subjects recorded food intake over the remainder of the 24 hr study day. Breath hydrogen and methane and GI tolerance were assessed. While {{there were no significant differences}} in hunger or satiety found using the traditional scales or factor scales among the fiber treatment bars, the factor scales exhibited the least amount of variability with smaller standard deviations around the means. The oligofructose bar produced the greatest amount of breath hydrogen, bloating and flatulence ratings while the control bar produced the least. The multi-item hunger and <b>fullness</b> <b>factor</b> scales offer enhanced sensitivity and understanding of satiety produced by foods...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFood {{processing}} impacts both food {{structure and}} nutritional density. The effect of food structure on satiety and glycemic potentials is well recognized. However, {{the association between}} processing, satiety and glycemic potentials and nutrient profiles has not been much studied, especially in the diets of the elderly. Therefore, this study aimed at exploring relations between the level of food processing, consumption and nutrient profiles and satiety and glycemic potentials among 6686 French elderly people (≥ 65 years). Dietary assessment was realized through a web-based 24 h dietary record tool. Among a total of 2688 foods, 280 generic foods were aggregated based on a consumption threshold of at least 5 % by the population. The satiety potential was calculated using the <b>Fullness</b> <b>Factor</b> equation, and the glycemic potential using the glycemic index and the glucose glycemic equivalent. Foods and dishes were ranked according to an adapted international NOVA classification as raw/minimally-processed (G 1), processed (G 2) and ultra-processed (G 3). ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the more food is processed, the lower its satiety potential and nutrient density and the higher its glycemic impact, especially when comparing G 1 and G 3. Besides, the foods consumed in the greatest quantity daily {{tend to be the}} most satiating, and ultra-processed foods were among the less frequently consumed both in terms of percentage and daily quantity (around two-fold difference between minimally- and ultra-processed foods). In conclusion, because it is partly related to health food potential, the degree of processing, especially for ultra-processed products, should be taken into consideration more when evaluating consumption profiles of different populations...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) is an ecologically {{important}} {{forage fish}} in the Salish Sea serving as a link between secondary consumers and top predators. In this study we investigated variation in length, stomach <b>fullness,</b> condition <b>factor,</b> and catch per unit effort (CPUE) through the fall season in 2013 in order to infer the timing of overwintering dormancy. We also tested for differences between locations. Population structure and variation through the fall season were compared between populations at the San Juan Channel wave field and Jackson Beach and between past year’s findings (2006, 2010, 2012). The wave field population was significantly larger and was in greater condition than the population at Jackson Beach. Through the fall season for the wave field population: length remained stabled, stomach fullness remained stable, condition factor declined, and CPUE remained stable. For the Jackson Beach population: length remained stable, stomach <b>fullness</b> declined, condition <b>factor</b> remained stable, and CPUE decline. These results suggest an earlier shift into overwintering dormancy for the wave field population compared to Jackson Beach...|$|R
40|$|Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) {{is defined}} as a chronic symptom-based disease that affects the upper {{gastrointestinal}} tract, resulting in mucosal damage caused by the retrograde flow of gastric acid from the stomach through an incompetent cardiac sphincter into the lower oesophagus. Typically, symptoms include dyspepsia, epigastric pain, heartburn, belching, bloating, nausea, early satiation and postprandial <b>fullness.</b> Several risk <b>factors</b> have been identified, which mainly include alcohol (15 %), aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (25 %), corticosteroids, obesity and pregnancy (10 %), hiatal hernias (60 - 80 %), hypercalcaemia, Helicobacter pylori infection (40 - 90 %) and hypersecretory states (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Complications of GORD include non-oesophageal reflux disease, erosive oesophagitis, Barrett’s oesophagus and adenocarcinoma. A study in the USA showed that GORD was responsible for the greatest direct cost of any gastrointestinal disease, and most of that expenditure was on pharmacotherapy. The pharmacological management of GORD will be the focus of this article. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} modelling and solution approach based on discrete-event simulation and response surface methodology {{for dealing with}} average passenger travel time optimization problem inherent to the metro planning process. The objective {{is to find the}} headways optimizing passenger average travel time with a satisfactory rate of carriage fullness. Due to some physical constraints, traffic safety and legal requirements, vehicle speeds cannot be raised any further to decrease travel time. But travel time can be optimized by arranging headways (i. e. the time period between the departure times of two consecutive transportation vehicles) in a timetable. In the presented approach, simulation metamodels that best fit the data collected from the simulated experiments are constructed to describe the relationship between the responses (average travel time and rate of carriage <b>fullness)</b> and input <b>factors</b> (headways). Then, the Derringer-Suich multi-response optimization procedure is used to determine the optimal settings of the input factors that produce the minimum value of the average travel time by providing a proper rate of carriage fullness. This methodology is applied for a real metro line, and good quality solutions are obtained with reduced number of experiments that needed to provide sufficient information for statistically acceptable results.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study {{examined}} the prevalence of upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and symptom groupings and determined impact on disability days in a nationally representative US sample. METHODS: A telephone survey of 21, 128 adults was conducted including questions {{about the presence of}} upper GI symptoms during the past 3 months. Respondents were categorized as symptomatic (ie, reported GI symptoms once per month) or asymptomatic. The survey included questions about missed work, leisure activity, or household activity days. Symptom groupings were identified by using factor analysis, and cluster analysis was used to assign respondents into distinct groups {{on the basis of these}} symptom groupings. RESULTS: The prevalence of an average of 1 or more upper GI symptoms during the past 3 months was 44. 9 %. The most common symptoms experienced during the past 3 months were early satiety, heartburn, and postprandial <b>fullness.</b> <b>Factor</b> analysis identified 4 symptom groupings: (1) heartburn/regurgitation; (2) nausea/vomiting; (3) bloating/abdominal pain; and (4) early satiety/loss of appetite. Five respondent clusters were identified; the largest clusters were primarily early satiety/fullness (44 %) and gastroesophageal reflux disease-like symptoms (28 %). Two small clusters reflected nausea and vomiting (7 %) and a heterogeneous symptom profile (4 %). Symptomatic respondents reported significantly more missed work, leisure, and household activity days than asymptomatic respondents (all P <. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis separated GI symptoms into groupings reflecting gastroesophageal reflux disease and dyspepsia: early satiety, postprandial fullness, and loss of appetite; bloating and abdominal pain/discomfort; and nausea and vomiting. These upper GI symptoms were associated with significant loss of work and activity days. status: publishe...|$|E
