40|$|In {{this study}} it is shown that group lending {{is not always}} {{effective}} {{in dealing with the}} information and enforcement issues associated with financial intermediation, In particular, by transferring all screening responsibilities onto borrowers, efficiency is lost in the intermediation process, creating poor quality matches between borrowers and loan contracts. This results in high client exit. This phenomenon is especially exaggerated in environments in which group lending based on joint liability is a new lending technology in the financial market. Drawing upon theories of job matching and technology adoption, client exit is described in a choice theoretic framework. Basically, when faced with a <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> or exiting, a client compares her expected benefits of borrowing to her expected costs. She exits when the costs of borrowing are greater than the benefits of borrowing. Interesting exit/stay outcomes arise when joint liability is modeled into the choice.

40|$|Abstract Background Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESC) have the {{capacity}} to self-renew and remain pluripotent, while continuously providing a source of a variety of differentiated cell types. Understanding what governs these properties at the molecular level is crucial for stem cell biology and its application to regenerative medicine. Of particular relevance is to elucidate those molecular interactions which govern the reprogramming of somatic cells into ESC. A computational approach {{can be used as a}} framework to explore the dynamics of a simplified network of the ESC with the aim to understand how stem cells differentiate and also how they can be reprogrammed from somatic cells. Results We propose a computational model of the embryonic stem cell network, in which a core set of transcription factors (TFs) interact with each other and are induced by external factors. A stochastic treatment of the network dynamics suggests that NANOG heterogeneity is the deciding factor for the stem cell fate. In particular, our results show that the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> in the ground state or commitment to a differentiated state is fundamentally stochastic, and can be modulated by the addition of external factors (2 i/ 3 i media), which have the effect of reducing fluctuations in NANOG expression. Our model also hosts reprogramming of a committed cell into an ESC by over-expressing OCT 4. In this context, we recapitulate the important experimental result that reprogramming efficiency peaks when OCT 4 is over-expressed within a specific range of values. Conclusions We have demonstrated how a stochastic computational model based upon a simplified network of TFs in ESCs can elucidate several key observed dynamical features. It accounts for (i) the observed heterogeneity of key regulators, (ii) characterizes the ESC under certain external stimuli conditions and (iii) describes the occurrence of transitions from the ESC to the differentiated state. Furthermore, the model (iv) provides a framework for reprogramming from somatic cells and conveys an understanding of reprogramming efficiency as a function of OCT 4 over-expression. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} of mobile phones among young adults in Finland {{is close to}} 100 %. Nearly everybody is permanently connected to a huge network of computer-mediated communication. This thesis is a phenomenologically based case study about normative and rational behaviour of mobile phone users concerning availability and network connectivity. The role of the mobile phone in society is described from a micro-sociological perspective. With a special focus on related aspects of interaction theory, society {{is presented as a}} network of interactions that is being enhanced through the mobile phone, consequently leading towards an "online society". In this work, social norms are explained to be the regulating element of conduct. They are internalised and considered part of the rational orientation that the rational choice theory defines as the decisive element of individual behaviour. Qualitative interviews with nine students between 21 and 24 years of age investigate the reasons and patterns of behaviour for remaining permanently connected to the mobile phone network. The method applied is a derived form of focussed interviews. According to the analysed material, the individuals share a common sense that missed calls are to be responded to by calling back. The possibility to reply is assured by choosing unobtrusive alerting modes instead of switching the device off, since reachability is an elementary desire to maintain social contacts. Mobile phone users want to be assured that they do not miss any incoming contacts. Ignoring incoming calls on purpose is considered to be rude, due to the very personal nature of the mobile phone compared to the landline telephone. Also, people get remarkably confused when they can not reach the telephone of a close friend for a longer time, which is another strong indicator for the existence of widespread guiding principles on how to interact in the mobile phone society. In conclusion, this research proves that general rules do exist and that they are affecting the life-world of the users, influencing their own behaviour as well as their expectations concerning the action of others. Often these norms are subconscious, the individual does not even recognise them as a norm and refers to them as habits. But, even though mobile phone users are facing prevalent expectations concerning their availability, the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> <b>staying</b> connected to the network is in most cases not based on normative pressure but on the rational demand to receive the benefits of network communication...|$|R

An adjusted generalised linear model was calculated to investigate the effect of our intervention. On initial presentation the algorithms were overruled in 123 (39. 3 %) of the cases. Mean length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> tended to be shorter in the proADM (n= 154, 6. 3 days) compared with the control group (n= 159, 6. 8 days; adjusted regression coefficient - 0. 19, 95 % CI - 0. 41 - 0. 04; p= 0. 1).

40|$|International audience: In {{their choice}} of mates, females may use {{alternative}} tactics, including a comparative assessment of males in a population, using one or several relative preference criteria. Traits involved in female choice should presumably be variable between, but not within males, thus potentially providing reliable cues of male identity and quality for prospecting females. In lekking species, sexual selection is usually intense, and females can freely choose mates. Studying the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, a bird with an exploded lek mating system, we first identified male phenotypic traits that showed higher among, than within variation (plumage pattern, display rates and call structure). Among those and other traits (ornaments and their symmetry, body condition, lek spatial organization and territory quality), we identified phenotypic traits that correlated with male attractiveness toward females. At least four phenotypic male traits were correlated with female attraction, i. e. body condition, lek attendance, ornamental symmetry and display rates.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of complex {{communication}} and a global knowledge of the environment, cockroaches are able to assess the availability of resources and to reach a consensual decision: the group aggregates in a single resting site. We show that the aggregation dynamics and the collective shelter selection of cockroaches are influenced by their social context as, unlike single individuals, groups of cockroaches {{are more likely to}} respond to environmental heterogeneities. The <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> individuals to <b>stay</b> under a shelter relies on the modulation of their resting time, according to the perception of two local cues: (1) the shelters luminosity and (2) the number of congeners. This study on the cockroach species Periplaneta americana highlights a shelter-selection mechanism based on an amplification process resulting from the interactions between congeners. This mechanism leads to complex spatiotemporal aggregation dynamics characterized by transient bimodality, bifurcation patterns (shelter selection) and the existence of a quorum size in the settlement behaviour of the cockroaches. Finally, we discuss the generic aspect for other gregarious species of the collective decision-making process demonstrated for cockroaches. FLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

However, the importance of the costs of resource acquisition to the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> subordinates to <b>stay</b> or leave and to help or not have been hardly studied experimentally. Here we reduced the overall food availability (zooplankton) for experimental populations of the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher in the field and measured effects on subordinates' spacing, dispersal, interactions, and helping behaviour. When plankton availability was reduced, all helpers increased feeding rate and moved further away from shelter. Helping correlated negatively with feeding, which suggests a trade-off between foraging effort and cooperation. All group members attacked experimentally presented egg predators later in the food reduction treatment and small helpers in particular decreased their defence effort against them. Furthermore, all subordinates tended to perform less work when food was reduced. This is the first study where food availability was generally reduced in the environment of a cooperative breeder, without affecting the resource distribution between territories. Thereby, our experimental manipulation did not provide dispersal incentives to the test animals, which might have interfered with the <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> subordinates to cooperate. The experimental variation of the costs of resource acquisition for group members revealed significant effects on foraging, spacing, social interactions, and helping behaviour, which highlights the potential importance of ecological constraints on the behaviour, social structure and cooperation propensity in highly social vertebrates. © 2010 The Authors.

In the study six interviews were conducted with three sets of parents. These interviews were then analysed with Janet Finch’s (1989) definition of negotiation of family responsibilities. The study finds that the negotiation on care leave is a result of the negotiation of the shared view of reality. This image is in turn influenced by a number of institutional aspects such as job design, relative resources, and the couple's ideological points. Previous studies that found that relative resources, converted to salary, affects the distribution greatest. Instead the results of this study points out that the nature of work is most important for how parents divide their care leave. If one parent have work that easier can be pushed forward or to be away from, the latter tend to be the one who stays at home. This arrangement, however, is affected by a number of other factors.
