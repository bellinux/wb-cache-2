40|$|Control of aphids on {{agricultural}} crops can {{be obtained}} by various cultural practices, but insecticides figure prominently in most programmes aimed at obtaining economic control of aphid species which are persistent virus vectors. A recent advance in insecticide formulations has been the development of granulated systemic aphicides. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the properties of two of these granulated insecticides, namely <b>Isolan,</b> a carbamate and phorate, an organophosphate. In particular an attempt was made to assess the persistence and phytotoxicity of these granulated systemic insecticides following application to the soil. Because <b>Isolan</b> and phorate are comparatively new insecticides in New Zealand, an endeavour was made to establish the relative aphicidal properties of these chemicals in the vapour phase and as contact insecticides, in order to envisage their suitability as granular applied aphicides...|$|E

Inclusion of piperonyl butoxide as a synergist with Sevin (1 -naphthyl methylcarbamate), Zectran (4 -dimethylamino- 3, 5 -xylyl methylcarbamate), or m-isopropylphenyl methylcarbamate also produced evidence of monofactorial inheritance...|$|E
