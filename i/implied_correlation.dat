Specifically, they tend to be more accurate than the simple forecasts based on time-series data (i. e., historical correlations and exponentially weighted moving average correlations) and contain useful information that is not present in the other forecasts.

40|$|Option {{written on}} several foreign {{exchange}} rates (FXRs) depends on {{correlation between the}} rates. To evaluate the option, historical estimates for correlations can be used but usually they are not stable. More significantly, pricing of the option using these estimates is usually inconsistent to the traded vanilla contracts. To price options written on several FXRs with the same denominating currency, financial practitioners and traders often use <b>implied</b> <b>correlations</b> calculated from <b>implied</b> volatilities of FXRs that form "currency triangles". However, some options may have underlying FXRs with different denominating currencies. In this paper, we present the formula for the <b>implied</b> <b>correlations</b> between such FXRs.

40|$|The multivariate {{lognormal}} {{model is}} a basic pricing model for derivatives with multiple underlying processes, for example, spread options. However, the market observation of <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> skew examplifies how inaccurate the constant correlation assumption in the multivariate lognormal model can be. In this paper, we study alternative modeling approaches that generate <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> skews {{while at the same}} time maintain practical tractability. First, we propose a multiscale stochastic volatility model, and derive asymptotic formulas for option valuation and <b>implied</b> <b>correlation.</b> The {{model is a}} two-dimensional extension of the multiscale stochastic volatility model proposed in [20] which was tested on single underlying options. To obtain option valuations, we only need to calibrate a set of special parameters, and we propose a calibration procedure using option prices on individual underlying assets. From our simulated results, the multiscale stochastic volatility model generates <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> skews, and the asymptotic formulas are easy and fast to implement. However, in the multiscale stochastic volatility model, the stochastic volatilities introduce non-tradable sources of risk, and the market is no longer complete. Alternatively, we propose a local correlation model, which assumes the instantaneous correlation to be a deterministic function of time and the underlying prices. This model can be viewed as a two-dimensional extension of Dupire’s local volatility model. The local correlation approach preserves the completeness of the market and low dimensionality of uncertainty...|$|E

In this paper we use VaR calculation in a reverse way to imply the correlation between asset price changes. The distribution of <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> under normality is also studied in order to take into account any bias and sampling error. Empirical results for US and UK equity markets show that <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> is not constant but tends to be higher for long positions than for short positions. This result is statistically significant and can be interpreted as departure from normality. Our test provides a new way – by focusing the tail dependence - to assess the model risk associated with quantitative methods based on normality in asset management and risk management areas. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we employ the L´evy copula model to {{determine}} basket option prices. More precisely, basket option prices {{are determined by}} replacing the real basket with an appropriate approximation. For the approximate basket we determine the underlying characteristic function and hence we can derive the related basket option prices by using the Carr-Madan formula. Two approaches are considered. In the first approach, we replace the arithmetic sum by an appropriate geometric sum, whereas the second approach {{can be considered as}} a three-moments-matching method. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of our approximations; several L´evy models are calibrated to market data and basket option prices are determined. In a last part we show how our newly designed basket option pricing formula can be used to define <b>implied</b> L´evy <b>correlation</b> by matching model and market prices for basket options. Our main finding is that the <b>implied</b> L´evy <b>correlation</b> smile is flatter than its Gaussian counterpart.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of an introductory chapter, three main chapters, and a concluding chapter. In Chapter 2, my co-author and I provide new empirical evidencethat the distribution of liquidity has a strong in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power on intraday market volatility. To this end, we introduce a novel way of summarizing the relative depth provision in the whole limit order book. Our measure, global depth, considers the entire quoted depth and assigns weights decreasing with distance from the best quotes. We document that global depth outperforms alternative predictors of volatility, such as the bid-ask spread, standard depth variables, and measures of trading activity, in explaining the variations in market volatility. The third chapter, forthcoming in the Journal of Banking and Finance, investigates the effects of competition and signaling in a pure order driven market and examines the trading patterns of agents when walking through the book is not allowed. We show that the variables capturing {{the cost of a}} large market order are not informative for an impatient trader under this market mechanism. We also document that the competition effect is not present only {{at the top of the}} book but persistent beyond the best quotes. Moreover, we show that institutional investors’ order submission strategies are characterized by only a few pieces of the limit order book information. The fourth chapter provides evidence that <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> is a significant indicator of market-wide risk. From an aggregate perspective, I document that <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> explains an important fraction of the variation in market excess returns, with high <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> followed by an increase in subsequent market returns. The predictive power is stronger at a forecast of bimonthly, quarterly and semiannually return horizons and robust to the inclusion of standard predictors. Moreover, I show that the information content of the correlation risk premium on market returns is fully driven by the <b>implied</b> <b>correlation.</b> My findings indicate that periods of high market-wide correlation produce a deterioration of the investment opportunity set and, as a consequence, an increase in the equilibrium expected return...|$|E

40|$|A {{currency}} trio {{is a set}} {{of three}} currencies and their respective exchange rates, which have a relationship fixed by a triangular arbitrage condition. This condition forms the basis for the derivation of a geometric interpretation of the relationships between the exchange rates. In the geometric framework, the three currencies in a currency trio are represented by a triangle, where each of the vertices represents a currency. The volatilities of the exchange rates are represented by the lengths of the sides joining the respective currencies and the cosine of each angle represents the correlation between the two exchange rates depicted by the angle's adjacent sides. The geometric approach is particularly useful when dealing with implied data as it allows the calculation of <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> using implied volatility. This is valuable as implied volatility is frequently quoted in the foreign exchange market; whereas, <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> is not directly quoted and is more difficult to extract from market data. This dissertation aims to thoroughly investigate the geometric framework and use it to visualise and interpret the relationships between currencies in a currency trio. The analysis will initially look at currency trios with realised spot data before moving on to implied data. In the implied data context, the framework will be used to extract and evaluate <b>implied</b> <b>correlation</b> estimates using implied volatility data extracted from the foreign exchange market. The framework will be extended to investigate whether an illiquid option can be proxy hedged using options on the two other currencies in a currency trio. Finally, the findings will be discussed and the feasibility of the applications of the framework will be considered...|$|E
