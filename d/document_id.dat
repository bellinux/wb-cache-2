25|$|The {{trail was}} opened on 16 June 1961, {{as a result}} of the Polish–Czechoslovak treaty {{concerned}} with tourism and mutual relations. It was made possible to hike along the border, but it still involved some formalities (e.g. identity card and check-in to a hotel) and the trail was not accessible to tourists outside these two countries. In the 1970s and 1980s Polish and Czech dissidents met on the trail, including Jacek Kuroń and Václav Havel. With the implementation of martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981 the trail was closed. It was reinstated in 1984. Paradoxically, despite the declared friendship, the trail route was the subject to some formal issues: Czech authorities claimed that the route infringed the Czech territory by 2 metres. Trips to the peak of Sněžka were possible only if accompanied by a guide approved by local authorities (including the army and militia). After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the name changed to Polish-Czech Friendship Trail and the regulations were reduced considerably: the check-points were often left unstaffed and only random inspections on the border were performed. On the introduction of the Schengen rules in 2007, all border controls were eliminated. Nonetheless, any persons crossing the border must have a valid identity <b>document</b> (<b>ID</b> card, passport) with them.|$|E

40|$|Web {{search engines}} use highly {{optimized}} compression schemes to decrease inverted index size and improve query throughput, and many index compression techniques {{have been studied}} in the literature. One approach taken by several recent studies [7, 23, 25, 6, 24] first performs a renumbering of the <b>document</b> <b>IDs</b> in the collection that groups similar documents together, and then applies standard compression techniques. It is known that this can significantly improve index compression compared to a random document ordering. We study index compression and query processing techniques for such reordered indexes. Previous work has focused on determining the best possible ordering of documents. In contrast, we assume that such an ordering is already given, and focus on how to optimize compression methods and query processing for this case. We perform an extensive study of compression techniques for <b>document</b> <b>IDs</b> and present new optimizations of existing techniques which can achieve significant improvement in both compression and decompression performances. We also propose and evaluate techniques for compressing frequency values for this case. Finally, we study {{the effect of this}} approach on query processing performance. Our experiments show very significant improvements in index size and query processing speed on the TREC GOV 2 collection of 25. 2 million web pages...|$|R

The predominant operation on inverted indices asks for intersecting two sorted lists of <b>document</b> <b>IDs</b> which might have vastly varying lengths. We compare previous theoretical approaches, methods used in practice, and one new algorithm which exploits that the intersection uses small integer keys. We also take different data compression techniques into account. The new algorithm is very fast, simple, has good space efficiency, and is the only algorithm that performs well over the entire spectrum of relative list length ratios. ...|$|R

Finally, it saves the encrypted index in the database. The input documents are ready for encryption once the indexing is finished. For the encryption of a document, this method first creates a new document in the database and writes the encrypted stream in this.

40|$|Biometric {{recognition}} {{techniques have}} been widely employed in numerous applications, such as access control, identity check etc. In this {{paper we propose a}} method for protecting personal identity documents against forgery by using 2 D face image on the <b>ID</b> <b>document.</b> The main components of this method includes detection of the face image from the document, extracting features from partial face images and converting the extracted features to binary feature vectors using Local Gradient Increasing Pattern (LGIP) approach. The binary feature vectors are concatenated to form a binary template which can be encoded and stored on the <b>ID</b> <b>document</b> {{in the form of a}} 2 D bar code.
