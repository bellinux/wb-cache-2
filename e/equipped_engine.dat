Following a general formulation of the breathing phenomenon, a versatile model is proposed for any type of variable valve gear device.

50|$|For use on {{cars and}} light trucks, the rotary pump or {{distributor}} pump was developed. It uses a single injection cylinder driven from an axial cam plate, which injects into the individual fuel lines via a rotary distribution valve. Later incarnations {{such as the}} Bosch VE pump vary the injection timing with crankshaft speed to allow greater power at high crank speeds, and smoother, more economical running at slower revolution of crankshaft. Some VE variants have a pressure-based system that allows the injection volume to increase over normal to allow a turbocharger or supercharger <b>equipped</b> <b>engine</b> to develop more power under boost conditions.|$|E
50|$|Each vehicle {{has their}} own {{exclusive}} chassis.

Every vehicle can be equipped with a C-Unit (Computer-Unit), a fire control system that affects the hit rate of equipped weapons. (In Metal Max Returns, it has more functions.) The above two are necessary for vehicles so if one of these becomes broken or unequipped, the Vehicle will be unable to move by itself.|$|E

The MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air which meant that the EX passed both Japan and US emission standards, while the new cylinder head design of the engine gave way for a Jet valve which introduced an extra swirl of air to the combustion chamber, swirling the fuel-air mixture for a cleaner, efficient and more thorough burn.|$|E

5000|$|Between 1800 and 1840, on the machine-screw side, {{it became}} common {{practice}} to build {{all of the}} relevant screw-cutting machine elements into engine lathes, so the term [...] "screw-cutting lathe" [...] ceased to stand in contradistinction to other metalworking lathe types as a [...] "special" [...] kind of lathe. Meanwhile, on the wood-screw side, hardware manufacturers had developed for their own in-house use the first fully automatic automated special-purpose machine tools for the making of screws. The 1760-1840 development arc was a tremendous technological advance, but later advancements would make screws even cheaper and more prevalent yet again. These began in the 1840s with the adaptation of the engine lathe with a turret-head toolholder to create the turret lathe. This development greatly reduced the time, effort, and skill needed from the machine operator to produce each machine screw. Single-pointing was forgone in favor of die head cutting for such medium- and high-volume repetitive production. Then, in the 1870s, the turret lathe's part-cutting cycle (sequence of movements) was automated by being put under cam control, in a way very similar to how music boxes and player pianos can play a tune automatically. According to Rolt (1965), {{the first person to}} develop such a machine was Christopher Miner Spencer, a New England inventor. [...] may have contemporarily independently invented a machine similar to Spencer's. However, the wood-screw-making machines of the 1840s and 1850s factory production machine tools as opposed to small-machine-shop machine tools, such as those developed by Cullen Whipple of the New England Screw Company and Thomas J. Sloan of the American Screw Company, had anticipated the machines of Spencer and Vander Woerd in various ways, albeit approaching the problem of automated screw production from a different commercial angle. All of the above machine tools (i.e., screw-cutting lathes; suitably <b>equipped</b> <b>engine</b> lathes and bench lathes; turret lathes; turret-lathe-derived screw machines; and wood-screw-factory screw machines) were sometimes called [...] "screw machines" [...] during this era (logically enough, given that they were machines tailored to screw making). The nomenclatural evolution whereby the term [...] "screw machine" [...] is often used more narrowly than that is discussed above.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a test program to {{retrofit}} a high performance fixed ratio Nasvytis Multiroller Traction Drive {{in place of a}} helical gear set to a gas turbine engine are presented. Parametric tests up to a maximum engine power turbine speed of 45, 500 rpm and to a power level of 11 kW were conducted. Comparisons were made to similar drives that were parametrically tested on a back-to-back test stand. The drive showed good compatibility with the gas turbine engine. Specific fuel consumption of the engine with the traction drive speed reducer installed was comparable to the original helical gearset <b>equipped</b> <b>engine...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of biodiesel on some tribology characteristics of a bus diesel engine with a mechanically controlled fuel injection system. The tests have been performed on a fully <b>equipped</b> <b>engine</b> test bed, on a fuel injection test bed and on a discharge coefficient testing device. The tested fuel was neat biodiesel produced from rapeseed. Attention {{was focused on the}} biodiesel influence on the pump plunger surface roughness, on the carbon deposits in the combustion chamber, on the injector and in the injector nozzle hole. The pump plunger surface was analyzed by experimentally determined roughness parameters and by a microscope. The carbon deposits at fuel injector and in the combustion chamber were examined using endoscopic inspection. The deposits in the injector nozzle were investigated indirectly by measuring the nozzle discharge coefficient. Numerical simulation has been performed in order to estimate the influence of the discharge coefficient variation on the computed injection characteristics. The obtained results indicate that biodiesel usage may even improve the pump plunger lubrication conditions. Furthermore, the carbon deposits in the combustion chambers did not vary significantly in quantity but they were noticeably redistributed. Finally, it was found out that the variation of the nozzle discharge coefficient has {{to be taken into account}} only if high accuracy of numerical simulation is desired...|$|E

50|$|The unit {{aircraft}} were basic CH-3C Sikorsky helicopters models.

In early 1968, the engines were upgraded from the 1300 hp model to the 1500 hp models which was a vast improvement in the high temperature/humidity environment.
