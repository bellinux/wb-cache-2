5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female. Given that older studies show no difference in incidence between men and women, {{it has been suggested}} that the use of oral contraceptives in women is behind the disparity between the sexes. A 1995 report <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E

He {{remained}} close to his mother; his brother told Melman that Abu Nidal would return to Nablus <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia every year to visit her. It was during one of those visits in 1962 that he met his wife, whose family had also fled from Jaffa. The couple had a son and two daughters.|$|E

5|$|In November 2009, the Royal Saudi Land Force, {{as part of}} a {{military}} effort against insurgent intrusions of the kingdom's border, started using the Apache in Operation Scorched Earth; this also involved launching air strikes against Houthi rebels operating inside neighboring Yemen. In January 2010 the rebels claimed to have shot down an Apache; this was denied by the Saudi military. In late January 2010, the leader of the Shiite rebels announced their withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> territory, this announcement followed a key battle on 12 January when Saudi forces reportedly took control of the border village of Al Jabiri.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the {{regional}} Arab Spring, Bahrain's Shia majority started large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed protests following a pre-dawn raid on protesters camped in Pearl Roundabout. A month later it requested security assistance <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia and other GCC countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched {{a crackdown on}} the opposition that included conducting thousands of arrests and systematic torture. Almost daily clashes between protesters and security forces led to dozens of deaths. Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing. More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed as of March 2014.|$|E
5|$|When the Gulf War {{started on}} January 16, 1991, Jennings began a {{marathon}} anchoring stint {{to cover the}} story, spending 20 of the first 48 hours of the war on-air, and leading ABC News to its highest-ever ratings. After interrupting regular Saturday morning cartoons on January 19 to broadcast a military briefing <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, Jennings and ABC became concerned about the emotional impact of the war coverage on children. Out of that concern, Jennings hosted a 90-minute special, War in the Gulf: Answering Children's Questions the next Saturday morning; the program featured Jennings, ABC correspondents, and American military personnel answering phoned-in questions and explaining the war to young viewers.|$|E

5|$|Fund-raising for {{the center}} was led by Terry McAuliffe, a friend of Clinton's who had also contributed heavily to the Clinton-Gore {{campaign}} in 1995. Clinton himself was prohibited by law from personally soliciting donations {{for the center}}, but he did host private events relating to the library. There were no other legal restrictions on donations, and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited private donations, {{all of which were}} tax deductible. Approximately $10 million of contributions came <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). Donations exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals. Various American organizations also contributed millions of dollars to the foundation.|$|E
5|$|In late 2000, Wail {{traveled}} to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9/11 Commission believes {{that three of the}} future muscle hijackers, including Wail and Waleed, traveled in a group <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.|$|E
5|$|The Al Hayat Museum is the complex's most {{recognized}} establishments; {{it consists}} of ten halls spread over two floors, exhibiting rare Qur'anic manuscripts from different periods, starting from the first century Hijra (700AD). Manuscripts on parchments that originate <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia (Mecca and Medina), Damascus and Baghdad, {{are present in the}} museum. The manuscripts undergo special procedures for the preservation of these artifacts, in order to protect them from damages. Some of the artifacts present in the museum include a rare manuscript of the Qur'an, dating to 1694AD and was printed in Germany. The museum also houses the world's oldest translated copy of the Qur'an, which was translated to Latin in Switzerland and dates to 955AD. The first copy of the Qur'an, written during the reign of Caliph Uthman ibn Affan, is on display in the museum alongside a number of small copies of the Qur'an, which could only be read using optical instruments.|$|E

5|$|Following the Iraqi {{invasion}} of Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing prepared to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s the museum {{acquired}} several important American aircraft; a B-17G Flying Fortress in 1978, a B-29 Superfortress in 1980, and a B-52 Stratofortress in 1983. With Duxford's {{association with the}} US Army Air Forces (USAAF), in the mid-1980s plans developed for a commemoration {{of the role of}} American air power in the Second World War. A group of American supporters was formed, and the architect Sir Norman Foster was commissioned to design a new building. Fundraising for the project began in 1987, support and funds being sought in the United States; the Founding Member was General Jimmy Doolittle in 1989. Fundraising events were held across the US in Houston (1989), Washington, D.C., (1991) and Los Angeles (1992). The project was widely supported in the United States by some 50,000 individual subscribers. A further $1million of funding was secured <b>from</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, and £6.5million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. On 8 September 1995 the groundbreaking for the new building was performed by wartime 78th Fighter Group veteran, Major James E Stokes.|$|E
