5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen objects were tinted blue, and hyperspace {{was replaced by a}} shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added killer satellite enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> than the original and does not allow saucers to be hunteda common strategy for Asteroids high scores.|$|E
5|$|The Miller {{brothers}} {{wrote the}} entire first novel, but were unsatisfied with the result; the Millers {{pointed out that}} writing a character for a novel <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> than writing the characters of a game. Hyperion recruited author David Wingrove {{to assist with the}} project; the Millers ended up giving Wingrove a detailed draft, and the author rewrote the entire book. The book's design was made to fit the themes of the game; the novels are made to look like journals found in Myst, with embossed covers and pages darkened as though with time and use.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
50|$|Softwoods are not {{necessarily}} softer than hardwoods. In both groups {{there is an enormous}} variation in actual wood hardness, with the range in density in hardwoods completely including that of softwoods; some hardwoods (e.g. balsa) are softer than most softwoods, while the <b>hardest</b> hardwoods <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> than any softwood. The woods of longleaf pine, douglas fir, and yew <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> in the mechanical sense than several hardwoods.|$|R

5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E

25|$|Although it has {{excellent}} running time, the tradeoff is {{that this}} algorithm uses exponential amounts of memory (many gigabytes of memory are needed for n above 50), <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to program than the other methods, and can't currently be used to count free polyominoes.|$|E

25|$|This <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> {{in higher}} dimensions: higher-dimensional {{manifolds}} cannot be directly visualized (though visual intuition {{is useful in}} understanding them), nor can their diffeomorphism classes be enumerated, nor can one in general determine if two different descriptions of a higher-dimensional manifold refer to the same object.|$|E
25|$|If {{continuity}} is not given, {{the converse}} {{is not necessarily}} true. A simple converse is that if u and v have continuous first partial derivatives and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations, then f is holomorphic. A more satisfying converse, which <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to prove, is the Looman–Menchoff theorem: if f is continuous, u and v have first partial derivatives (but not necessarily continuous), and they satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations, then f is holomorphic.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} ED is {{not defined}} archaeologically, but {{political}}ly. The conquests of Sargon and his successors upset the political equilibrium throughout Iraq, Syria, and Iran. The conquests lasted many years into the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad and built on ongoing conquests during the ED. The transition <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to pinpoint within an archaeological context. It {{is virtually impossible to}} date a site to either ED III or Akkadian period based on ceramic or architectural evidence alone.|$|E

25|$|The Sphinx is a {{monolith}} {{carved into}} the bedrock of the plateau, which also served as the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area. The nummulitic limestone of the area consists of layers which offer differing resistance to erosion (mostly caused by wind and windblown sand), leading to the uneven degradation apparent in the Sphinx's body. The lowest part of the body, including the legs, is solid rock. The body of the lion up to its neck is fashioned from softer layers that have suffered considerable disintegration. The layer in which the head was sculpted <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Crab Nebula X-ray {{spectrum}} {{there are}} three features that differ greatly from Scorpius X-1: its spectrum <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder,</b> its source diameter is in light-years (ly)s, not astronomical units (AU), and its radio and optical synchrotron emission are strong. Its overall X-ray luminosity rivals the optical emission and could be that of a nonthermal plasma. However, the Crab Nebula appears as an X-ray source that is a central freely expanding ball of dilute plasma, where the energy content is 100 times the total energy content of the large visible and radio portion, obtained from the unknown source.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, Émile Durkheim {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} to suggest that gods represent an extension of human social life to include supernatural beings. In line with this reasoning, psychologist Matt Rossano contends that when humans began living in larger groups, they may have created gods as a means of enforcing morality. In small groups, morality can be enforced by social forces such as gossip or reputation. However, it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to enforce morality using social forces in much larger groups. Rossano indicates that by including ever-watchful gods and spirits, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.|$|E

25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials. The British Society of Audiology has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of non-speech sounds. The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called surtitles) {{began to}} appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally {{condemned}} as a distraction, today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's proscenium arch, or individual seat screens where spectators {{can choose from}} more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a RAI broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.|$|E
500|$|Thio Li-ann {{has noted}} {{that it is not}} clear whether the Court of Appeal was laying down [...] "intentional and {{arbitrary}} discrimination" [...] as the sole test for whether executive acts comply with Article 12(1) of the Constitution, or whether it is only one possible test and that executive acts can also be challenged if they fail a reasonable classification test. This is because [...] "rbitrariness implies the lack of any rationality", and it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> for a plaintiff to prove that executive action is irrational than to show that there is no reasonable classification in the action.|$|E

500|$|With {{the twelfth}} nocturne Fauré {{returned}} to the scale and complexity of his middle-period works, but both melodically and harmonically it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to comprehend. There are deliberate dissonances and harmonic ambiguities that Pinkas describes as [...] "taking tonality to its limit while still maintaining a single key." [...] Morrison writes that [...] "the ecstatic song of No 6 is transformed in a central section where lyricism is soured by dissonance, held up, as it were, to a distorting mirror." [...] The work is in Fauré's customary nocturne form, A–B–A, but with a reiteration of the material of the second section, harmonically transformed, followed by a coda that draws on material from the opening section.|$|E
500|$|Seamounts often project upwards into {{shallower}} zones more {{hospitable to}} sea life, providing habitats for marine {{species that are}} not found on or around the surrounding deeper ocean bottom. Because seamounts are isolated from each other they form [...] "undersea islands" [...] creating the same biogeographical interest. As they are formed from volcanic rock, the substrate <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> than the surrounding sedimentary deep sea floor. This causes {{a different type of}} fauna to exist than on the seafloor, and leads to a theoretically higher degree of endemism. However, recent research especially centered at Davidson Seamount suggests that seamounts may not be especially endemic, and discussions are ongoing on the effect of seamounts on endemicity. They have, however, been confidently shown to provide a habitat to species that have difficulty surviving elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|There {{are seven}} glass {{vessels in the}} collection, but {{a larger number of}} pieces in {{transparent}} rock crystal or quartz, a mineral that might easily be taken for glass. This was always a much more valuable and prestigious material, qualifying as a semi-precious stone. [...] Needing very patient grinding and drilling, it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> to work than glass (though correspondingly less easy to break once finished), and the pieces include mounts or bases in precious metal, which none of the actual glass has; nor are the rock crystal pieces painted. [...] Read's catalogue groups these and other pieces in semi-precious stone with the objects in gold, as opposed to the [...] "silver plate", which probably reflects how a Renaissance collector would have ranked them. [...] There are ten pieces in crystal and nine in other stones.|$|E
