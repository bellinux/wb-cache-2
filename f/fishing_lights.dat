50|$|<b>Fishing</b> <b>lights</b> {{fall into}} two {{different}} groups: those that are portable {{and those that are}} permanently mounted. Generally, portable lights are powered by batteries and this sets practical limits to the kind of light that can be used. Most portable light sources are relatively low in light intensity and have short operating times. Lights drawing more than a few tens of watts are not practical. The old classic, a 12 volt automobile incandescent headlight mounted on a Styrofoam float ring, is probably the least expensive and lasts for a few hours before the battery is discharged. Battery-operated fluorescent lamps are three times more efficient in converting electricity to light. Therefore, comparing lamps of similar brightness, they can be operated about three times longer before the battery is discharged. Also, the operating lifetime of fluorescent lights are about ten times longer than incandescent lights. Commercial portable <b>fishing</b> <b>lights</b> based on fluorescent lamps vary widely in intensity. The best use 25-40 watt lamps that emit about 1000-3000 lumens per tube. Costing $160-$200, they are available through the internet, sport stores and catalogs. Lights made up of LED lights are an up-and-comer but to date are 10 to 100 times less bright than a fishing light using a standard 25-40 watt fluorescent lamp. LEDs are extremely efficient in converting electrical energy to light. As the cost of LEDs decrease and their brightness increases, expect to see functional <b>fishing</b> <b>lights</b> consisting of large arrays of LEDs.|$|E

5000|$|In 14 March 2016, the Argentine Mantilla-class {{patrol vessel}} Prefecto Derbes shelled and sunk the Lu Yan Yuan Yu 010; all 32 crew members were rescued. According to the Argentine Coast Guard, the vessel was found fishing {{illegally}} within the Exclusive Economic Zone (ZEE) of Argentina (latitude S 42° 34.8" [...] | Lon W 55°4.7") {{off the coast}} of Puerto Madryn, a zone known for squid. The coast guard reported that it hailed the fishing vessel over radio—in Spanish and English—and both visual and audio signals were sent to make contact. However, the vessel turned off its <b>fishing</b> <b>lights</b> and proceeded to flee towards international waters without responding. Next, the coast guard fired [...] "warning shots", but the trawler made some attempts to ram the coast guard during the pursuit. The Prefecto Derbes opened fire on the trawler, which stopped only before sinking. The coast guard rescued four people, including the captain, while the remaining 28 crew were rescued by a nearby Chinese vessel.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, {{a significant}} {{fraction of the}} light shining {{on the surface of}} the water is lost by reflection and, thus, will not be available to attract fish and members of their food chain. Security lights can be modified to operate submerged in water. Positioning the bulb underwater delivers approximately twice as much light to attract fish. However, the modification must be done professionally as the high voltages that power these lamps can be lethal. Commercially made, submersible <b>fishing</b> <b>lights</b> are available on the internet. The power ballast and lamp housing is mounted on a pole in a dry location. The lamp, potted in a waterproof housing, is connected to the ballast via a waterproof cable. Floating like a fishing line bob, the lamp is positioned underwater by weights on its submerged power supply cord. The bulb is fragile so some manufacturers offer protective covers and hard lenses. However, one unique feature of the submerged, unprotected bulb is that its outer glass envelope gets hot enough to prevent establishment of marine growth. When the bulb has a protective cover or is not operated daily occasional cleaning is required. A permanently fixed fishing light attractor is most effective if it is operated every night. It takes to a week or two for larger fish to discover the increasing concentration of bait fish attracted to the light. Once discovered, the fish return regularly — often arriving at predictable times of the evening.|$|E

40|$|Illex argentinus, the Argentine short-finned squid, is an {{important}} species within the Patagonian shelf ecosystem, where it supports a major multi-national fishery. The fishing fleet operating in this region is comprised of jigging vessels which attract squid using powerful incandescent lights. These <b>fishing</b> <b>lights</b> are detectable in remotely sensed satellite imagery which makes the fishery unusually amenable to a large-scale analysis of its spatial dynamics. In this paper, long-term inter-annual variability in fleet distribution and extent is examined using imagery from the Defence Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) for the period 1993 – 2005. The fishery was found to occupy a wide area across the shelf and slope, with regions of consistent fishing activity observed {{on the high seas}} (45 – 47 °S) and {{to the north of the}} Falkland Islands (Malvinas). Distribution of the fishery over the 13 -year study period was variable, with 28 % of the fished area occupied in 1 – 2 years, and 7 % of the area occupied in 12 – 13 years. Annual catch levels were positively associated with the extent of the area occupied by the fleet. Higher catches corresponded to the fishery occupying a wide latitudinal range, whereas lower catches were observed during 2004 and 2005 corresponding to a contraction of the fishery away from the south of its range. In years of very high catches, fishing took place along almost the entire latitudinal range of the species. Due to the intensity of fishing, changes in the distribution of the fleet can reflect shifts in the distribution of I. argentinus; this has potential for the long-term monitoring of this highly variable squid fishery...|$|E
40|$|Cephalopod {{movement}} {{occurs during}} {{all phases of}} the life history, with the abundance and location of cephalopod populations strongly influenced by the prevalence and scale of their movements. Environmental parameters, such as sea temperature and oceanographic processes, have a large influence on movement at the various life cycle stages, particularly those of oceanic squid. Tag recapture studies {{are the most common}} way of directly examining cephalopod movement, particularly in species which are heavily fished. Electronic tags, however, are being more commonly used to track cephalopods, providing detailed small- and large-scale movement information. Chemical tagging of paralarvae through maternal transfer may prove to be a viable technique for tracking this little understood cephalopod life stage, as large numbers of individuals could be tagged at once. Numerous indirect methods {{can also be used to}} examine cephalopod movement, such as chemical analyses of the elemental and/or isotopic signatures of cephalopod hard parts, with growing interest in utilising these techniques for elucidating migration pathways, as is commonly done for fish. Geographic differences in parasite fauna have also been used to indirectly provide movement information, however, explicit movement studies require detailed information on parasite-host specificity and parasite geographic distribution, which is yet to be determined for cephalopods. Molecular genetics offers a powerful approach to estimating realised effective migration rates among populations, and continuing developments in markers and analytical techniques hold the promise of more detailed identification of migrants. To date genetic studies indicate that migration in squids is extensive but can be blocked by major oceanographic features, and in cuttlefish and octopus migration is more locally restricted than predictions from life history parameters would suggest.

40|$|Fishery {{lights on}} the surface could be {{detected}} by the Day and Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP). The DNB covers the spectral range of 500 to 900 nm and realized a higher sensitivity. The DNB has a difficulty of identification of <b>fishing</b> <b>lights</b> from lunar lights reflected by clouds, which affects observations for the half of the month. Fishery lights and lights of the surface are identified from lunar lights reflected by clouds by a method using the DNB and the infrared band, where the detection limits are defined {{as a function of}} the brightness temperature with a difference from the maximum temperature for each level of DNB radiance and with the contrast of DNB radiance against the background radiance. Fishery boats or structures on islands could be detected by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on the polar orbit satellites using the reflected microwave by the surface reflecting targets. The SAR has a difficulty of tradeoff between spatial resolution and coverage while detecting the small targets like fishery boats. A distribution of fishery boats and island activities were detected by the scan-SAR narrow mode of Radarsat- 2, which covers 300 km by 300 km with various combinations of polarizations. The fishing boats were detected as a single pixel of highly scattering targets with the scan-SAR narrow mode of which spatial resolution is 30 m. As the look angle dependent scattering signals exhibits the significant differences, the standard deviations of scattered signals for each look angles were taken into account as a threshold to identify the signal from fishing boats and structures on the island from background noise. It was difficult to validate the detected targets by DNB with SAR data because of time lag of observations for 6 hours between midnight by DNB and morning or evening by SAR. The temporal changes of island activities were detected as a change of mean intensity of DNB for circular area for a certain scale of activities. The increase of DNB mean intensity was corresponding to the beginning of dredging and the change of intensity indicated the ending of reclamation and following constructions of facilities...|$|E

40|$|Some {{investigations}} on the {{two kinds}} of artificial bait, N. T. <b>fishing</b> <b>light,</b> type L,L, made of Acryi resin, group A (without tetron film) and group B (with tetron film), were {{carried out by the}} Keiten Maru, training ship of the Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, in the sea-front spreading over 1 °- 10 ’N~ 1 °- 20 ’S and 90 °- 50 ’E~ 93 °- 20 ’E, during the term from 5. June to 27. the same month, 1971. The investigations were also conducted for the test of hooking rate of three kinds of real bait; Saury, Mackerel and Mackerel Scad. The results obtained are as follows. 1. Compared with the group A, the hooked rate of the group B (<b>fishing</b> <b>light</b> L,L, with tetron film) was upon any conditions higher, without the distinction of the kind of bait or whether the bait was used or not. The fact seems to be caused by tetron-film-effect. 2. Compared with the hooking with <b>fishing</b> <b>light,</b> the hooking rate with real bait was generally higher. But partially, about one third of whole tests, cases were also observed that the former showed higher rate. The fact could be considered as to be caused by some effect of <b>fishing</b> <b>light.</b> As <b>fishing</b> <b>light</b> lasts longer, promising possibility is to be expected, when the studies in this field advans and the way of using improves. 3. The hooking rate of the real bait were different from the results of the previous report. The highest fishing-rate this time was in the Mackerel-Scad-Bait, followed by the Mackerel-Bait and the Saury-Bait, listed in the order of fishing efficiency. As confirmed here it is difficult to deduce what kind of real bait is most effective. But as far as these data concerned, one thing can be denied; namely the so called principle that there would cause a quite unfavorable result upon the hooking rate, if especially the Saury-Bait is not used. ...|$|R
