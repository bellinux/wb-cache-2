40|$|This article {{presents}} an historical {{analysis of the}} way governance arrangements in the petroleum industry have affected development of offshore oil resources in the Gulf of Mexico. Global competition over <b>differential</b> <b>rents</b> and natural value available from petroleum extraction were instrumental {{in the construction of}} oil prices high enough to support profitable investment offshore. Attention to the social construction of oil prices illustrates how political discourse on national security and conservation helps translate economic logic into strategic political coalitions and state action. The article shows how the unequal flow of resources in a global extractive industry, as organized by transnational corporations and states, interacts with marginal costs and <b>differential</b> <b>rents</b> to influence economic development. Development of Louisiana offshore oil after the second world war was protected by a private international price cartel, federally enforced import quotas and tax laws. Competition in the industry and the OPEC price increases of the 1970 s undermined US domination of world oil, but higher oil prices further stimulated investment offshore. The subsequent breakdown of stable governance in the 1980 s drove down oil prices, hastened restructuring of the petroleum industry and caused a rapid decline in Louisiana offshore investment.

40|$|A {{central concern}} of spatial {{economics}} is the re-lationship between rent and accessibility. In order {{to explain the}} residential locations of consumers, {{it is necessary to}} examine the rent differences that leave them indifferent among locations with different accessibilities. I Such compensating <b>rent</b> <b>differentials</b> are derived and analysed in this paper. Most models that derive compensating <b>rent</b> <b>differentials</b> focus on the differences in transportation costs at different locations in an urban area. <b>Rent</b> <b>differentials</b> are then assumed to compensate for these differences in transportation costs. Typically, the transportation costs are those incurred in move-ment to a single central location. 2 This approach has several weaknesses. First, the welfare loss to the consumer caused by a greater travel distance to a central location is not measured appropriately by the increase in total transportation costs, unless demands for and the numbers of trips made to the centre are perfectly inelastic with respect to changes in the cost per trip. 3 This point is clarified below. A second weakness of estab-lished approaches is the oversimplification of the measure of accessibility, which is usually expressed as the distance to one central location. Obviously, accessibility should include much more than a single distance measurement. Finally, the cost of time is an important element in transportation costs.

50|$|Differential {{economic}} environments have material {{effects on}} the ground. Processes of capital accumulation through space and time create new geographic landscapes shaped by crisis, deindustrialization and capital flight on the one hand, and influxes of capital and industrialization on the other. Capitalism not only reshuffles core-periphery relations, but rather, as Smith claims, it also penetrates all geographic scales. At the urban scale, <b>differential</b> <b>rent</b> gaps trigger investment and disinvestment in particular neighborhoods driving gentrification. On the global scale, integrated economies provoke time-space compression enabling enhanced communication and capital mobility. Smith argues that the subsequent erosion of the nation scale as the primary agent created a pivotal link between the global and urban scales. Since the 1990s, the increasingly integrated global economy has given greater importance {{to the role of}} the city. Indeed, world city building has become the geographical force of capitalism.

5000|$|The Government {{did try to}} pass legislation, such as the Coal Mines Act 1930, which {{provided}} for a 7 1/2-hour shift in mines. Owners were guaranteed coal prices through {{the introduction of a}} production quota system among collieries, thus doing away with cut-throat competition. This guarantee was introduced to prevent a fall in miners' wages. The Act also introduced a cartel scheme to allocate production quotas to pits under the control of a central council, while a Mines Reorganisation Commission was established to encourage efficiency through amalgamations. However, this legislation largely ignored by the mine owners due to Labours' lack of enforcement powers. There was also the Land Utilisation Act of 1931, which would have given Labour powers to purchase land anywhere in the United Kingdom, but it was mauled by the House of Lords and had no backing from the Treasury, so it was essentially a [...] "dead letter".

The Housing Act of 1930 resulted in the demolition of 245,000 slums by 1939, and the construction of 700,000 new homes.

After investigating the possibility that unobservable employee characteristics lie behind the conditional wage differentials, a hypothesis which cannot be accepted, the paper investigates the role of institutional, industry structure and industry performance characteristics in explaining interindustry wage differentials.

5000|$|Rent, Anderson argued, was {{a charge}} {{for the use of}} the more fertile soil. The least fertile soils in {{cultivation}} generated an income that simply covered the costs of production, while the more fertile soils received a [...] "certain premium for an exclusive privilege to cultivate them; which will be greater or smaller according to the more or less fertility of the soil. It is this premium which constitutes what we now call rent; a medium by means of which the expence (sic) of cultivating soils of very different degrees of fertility may be reduced to a perfect quality." [...] For Malthus and Ricardo this <b>differential</b> <b>rent</b> was sourced in the natural productivity of the soil apart from human influence. Anderson, however, insisted that continual improvement of the soil was possible and that the productivity of the least fertile soil could rise to a point that brought it much closer to that of the most fertile land; but also that the converse was true and humans could degrade the soil. Where fertility problems arise in agriculture, for Anderson this was a consequence of the failure to adopt rational and sustainable agricultural practices. He argued that since the land in England was farmed by capitalist farmers, this posed obstacles to rational agriculture, since the farmer tended to avoid all improvements, the full return for which would not be received for the duration of the lease.|$|E

However, the actors do not use immediate natural environment variables in their differentiation strategy, which operates more on territorial variables.

40|$|The {{question}} of rent {{as a political}} economic driver of urban change is not new to radical geography. Yet, it seems curious that while <b>Differential</b> <b>Rents</b> are considered pertinent, absolute rent is almost entirely replaced by (class-) monopoly rent.

First is Monopoly Capitalism School that is mainly designed by Sweezy from Bortkiewicz’s neo-Ricardian critique of Marx. And {{the second is the}} LTRPF School, which refers directly to Marx’s critique of Ricardo.

I will further argue that the tendency to question the relevance of absolute rent lies in which of the above-mentioned traditions one would take.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between wages and the scientific orientation of R&D organizations. Firms that adopt a science-oriented research approach (i. e., "science") allow their researchers to pursue and publish an individual research agenda. The adoption of science {{may be associated with}} a "taste" for science on the part of researchers (a preference effect) and/or as a "ticket of admission" to gain earlier access to scientific discoveries with commercial application (a productivity effect). These two effects differ in their impact on wages. Whereas the preference effect contributes to a negative compensating differential, the productivity effect may result in rent sharing. However, because science may be adopted by firms employing higher-quality researchers, cross-sectional evaluations of wages and science may be biased by unobserved heterogeneity. To overcome this bias, this paper introduces a novel empirical approach. Specifically, prior to accepting a given job, many scientists receive multiple job offers, allowing for the calculation of the wage-science relationship and controlling for differences in salary levels offered to individual researchers. Using a dataset composed of multiple job offers to postdoctoral biologists, the results suggest a negative relationship between wages and science. These findings are robust to restricting the sample to nonacademic job offers, but the findings depend critically on the inclusion of researcher fixed effects. Conditional on perceived ability, scientists do indeed pay to be scientists. economics of science, R&D employment, R&D management, multiple job offers, pharmaceuticals, drug discovery, biology, hedonic wage equation, compensating <b>differentials,</b> <b>rent</b> sharing...|$|R

This study focuses on rents, based on the hypothesis that <b>rent</b> <b>differential</b> between white and non-white {{areas of the city}} can be attri-buted to three major forces; (1) the rate of growth of the non-white population; (2) the rate at which whites evacuate the center city; and (3) the decree to vrl 1 ich non-~hite areas are centralized in the metropolitan area.
