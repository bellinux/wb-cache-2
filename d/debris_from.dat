5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the JACC, a search of the ocean surface by aircraft continued until 28 April. An acoustic underwater search for underwater locator beacons attached to the aircraft's flight recorders ended 14 April, followed by a sonar survey of the seafloor near an area where acoustic detections were made. The sonar survey finished on 28 May and found nil <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with these}} disappearances, a killer whale carcass bearing large wounds is beached. Police Chief Martin Brody {{believes}} that these events are {{the work of}} a shark. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who highly doubts that the town has another shark problem. Later, Brody finds <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> the destroyed speedboat in the surf just off the beach. He wades over to retrieve it and uncovers the boat driver's burnt remains.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{near the}} arch resumed between 1994 and 1996, {{directed}} by Ronny Reich and Yaacov Billig.

5|$|On 9 June 2016, The Sydney Morning Herald {{reported}} that a man had found what could possibly be <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> the aircraft at a location on Kangaroo Island, southern Australia.

5|$|On October27, the S/V Fantome, a schooner, last {{reported}} {{its location}} {{to the south}} of Guanaja, while trying to escape the brunt of the storm.

5|$|Over 1,000power {{workers from}} eight {{different}} states {{went to the}} worst hit areas to help restore power.

5|$|Raised bogs {{are most}} common in the Shannon basin. They formed when {{depressions}} left behind after the ice age filled with water to form lakes. <b>Debris</b> <b>from</b> reeds in these lakes formed a layer {{at the bottom of}} the water.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm passed through Indonesia, local {{government}} and Red Cross officials distributed assistance to the storm victims, including food, medicine, clean water, and mattresses; additionally, the government sent about $400million (2003IDR, $50,0002003USD). The affected citizens resided in temporary shelters, including schools, police offices, and shelters built by local governments. Officials deployed machines to remove <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> the roads affected by the landslides.|$|E

5|$|Thistle {{was almost}} {{completely}} destroyed. Most wooden buildings were carried {{away in the}} floodwaters.

5|$|A {{statement}} {{issued by the}} National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety. Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners, while offshore, workers were removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated. In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and inspected.

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> Times Square before it is re-opened to the public the following morning. Few traces of the previous night's celebration remain after the cleanup process is completed: following the 2013–14 drop, the New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that by 8:00a.m., it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|Another {{round of}} green flag pit stops {{commenced}} after {{three hours and}} eight minutes with Tréluyer being {{the first of the}} leaders to stop with both Toyota cars following two minutes later. The safety car was deployed when Nakajima's right-front tyre failed on the Wellington straight following contact with a LMGTE car and <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> his Toyota was littered on the track. Nakajima pulled {{over to the side of}} the circuit at Brooklands corner and stopped. Marshals were required to remove the <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> the track. The safety car drove into the pit lane 12 minutes later and racing resumed with Tréluyer remaining in first and Lieb second. Nakajima's car was transported back into his garage for repairs. Dumas turned into Franchitti's Ford and half-spun into the grass at Club corner, losing more than ten seconds to Tréluyer. Dumas was forced wide into the Woodcote corner run-off area by Rao and Rees overtook Franchitti for fifth in LMGTE Pro. After serving an earlier three-minute stop-and-go penalty for changing the car's engine Calado was running in third place in LMGTE Pro while Buemi drove the No. 5 Toyota back onto the circuit after his car was repaired. Tréluyer made a pit stop for fuel and tyres with Fässler taking over the No. 7 car. Fässler was followed by Lieb making a pit stop from the lead and handed driving duties to Jani. Fässler thus retook the lead with a nine-second advantage.|$|E
