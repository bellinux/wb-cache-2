60|$|The {{troops had}} taken {{four hours to}} do the eight miles; but the commissariat animals, as I have stated, were more than double that time upon the road. Both at Musgee and here {{there is a great}} lack of grain for the animals. One pound of grain was all they got yesterday, and to-day at twelve there is to be a similar large issue. If this sort of thing continues, the animals must inevitably break down. The drivers, after their day’s work was over, did go up into the hills and cut some grass; but the coarse grass {{contains}} very little nourishment, and the horses refuse to eat it. The mules eat it, indeed, but it can do them very little good. I have all along in my calculations of the probable duration of the campaign argued that we must expect to come to places where forage was not procurable, and that if we came to a place where for four days’ marches we could get no grain and but little grass, that we must come to a standstill and form dépôts. Of course the difficulty will be proportionately greater when we have the whole advance force, with its thousands of cavalry-horses and baggage-animals with us. We were to have started this morning at seven o’clock; but a messenger arrived at two this morning with a letter from the Commander-in-chief to General Staveley, saying that the road was so bad that we must halt for a day to enable the pioneer force to smooth some of the most impracticable places. We have also news of the head-quarters and three companies of the 33d who had pushed on by the “Phayre” road to Attala. They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> of fourteen miles to go, four of which they had comparatively cleared. They started early, and they got in the following day at twelve o’clock, having been twenty-eight hours on the road. The pioneer force is hard at work upon the road ahead, and to-morrow morning we start for Attala. It is stated to be an eight-mile march; but I hear that the opinion of those who have gone on is, that it is a good thirteen. At Attala I anticipate that we shall wait some days-that is, if forage is obtainable. Everything must now depend upon this vital point. We must push-on to some place where abundant forage can be obtained, and we must then wait {{for the remainder of the}} force to come up. This must entail a halt of some days, whenever it is; for the 3d Dragoon Guards and the 12th Bengal Cavalry were both some marches’ distance from Antalo when we left, and they will, of course, have to make a halt of a day or two at that place upon their advance, to rest their animals. I hear that in the neighbourhood of Lât there is plenty of forage; in that case Lât will probably be our halting-place, if we find we cannot obtain sufficient grass and grain at Attala. Sportsmen have been looking forward to our arrival at Lake Ashangi, as game is likely to be abundant in that neighbourhood, especially wild-fowl. We have received a letter from Mr. Massinger, which shows that any attempt at wild-fowl shooting either at early dawn or at dusk is likely to be attended with some little danger. It is, he says, very difficult, and even dangerous, to approach the shores of the lake. They are very flat, and the whole surface of the ground has been broken up into chasms and crevasses, which are filled with soft mud, and are not easily distinguishable from the surrounding soil. A long stick plunged into the soft mud found no bottom, and a person falling into one of these would, unless immediate assistance was at hand, be inevitably lost. The natives say that these crevasses were all formed by an earthquake which took place about three years ago. Previous to that time the lake had an outlet through which the overflow water made its way into the Tacazze. This outlet is now stopped, and the water has risen and filled all these chasms made by the earthquake.|$|E

50|$|Fomalhaut C or its {{original}} name, LP 876-10 is the distant third {{star of the}} Fomalhaut system. It is about five degrees from Fomalhaut, roughly halfway {{between it and the}} Helix Nebula. It is currently 2.5 light years (0.77 pc) from Fomalhaut A, and 3.2 light years away from Fomalhaut B (0.987 pc). The entire system is only around 25 light years (7.7 parsecs) from our Solar System.

50|$|Experiments {{conducted}} by Woodworth (1938) tested the duplex theory {{by using a}} solid sphere to model {{the shape of the}} head and measuring the ITDs as a function of azimuth for different frequencies. The model used <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> between the 2 ears of approximately 22-23 cm. Initial measurements found that there was a maximum time delay of approximately 660 μs when the sound source was placed at directly 90° azimuth to one ear. This time delay correlates to the wavelength of a sound input with a frequency of 1500 Hz. The results concluded that when a sound played had a frequency less than 1500 Hz the wavelength is greater than this maximum time delay between the ears. Therefore there is a phase difference between the sound waves entering the ears providing acoustic localisation cues. With a sound input with a frequency closer to 1500 Hz the wavelength of the sound wave is similar to the natural time delay. Therefore due {{to the size of the}} head and the distance between the ears there is a reduced phase difference so localisations errors start to be made. When a high frequency sound input is used with a frequency greater than 1500 Hz, the wavelength is shorter than the distance between the 2 ears, a head shadow is produced and ILD provide cues for the localisation of this sound.|$|E

40|$|Background: Fatty {{degeneration}} of the {{rotator cuff}} muscles may have detrimental effects on both anatomical and functional outcomes following shoulder surgery. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the relationship between tear geometry and muscle fatty degeneration in shoulders with a deficient rotator cuff. Methods: Ultrasonograms of both shoulders of 262 patients were reviewed to assess the type of rotator cuff tear and fatty degeneration in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. The 251 shoulders with a full-thickness tear un-derwent further evaluation for tear size and location. The relationship of tear size and location to fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles was investigated with use of statistical comparisons and regression models. Results: Fatty degeneration was found almost exclusively in shoulders with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. Of the 251 shoulders with a full-thickness tear, eighty-seven (34. 7 %) had fatty degeneration in either the supraspinatus or infra-spinatus, or both. Eighty-two (32. 7 %) of the 251 full-thickness tears <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> of 0 mm between the biceps tendon and anterior margin of the tear.

METHODS: in this prospective study dealing with a consecutive series of 38 eyes with an epimacular membrane or a vitreo-macular traction syndrome, we recorded mainly the visual acuity the day before surgery, at day 1, 8 and 6 months after surgery, duration of surgery, and complications peroperatively, at day 1, 8, and at 6 months. RESULTS: 23 eyes had a 6 -month follow-up (60 %). Mean preoperative, day 1, day 8 and 6 -month distance visual acuities were 0. 3, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 5, respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the pelvic lymph node coverage of conventional pelvic fields based on bony landmarks in Chinese patients with cervical cancer by using computed tomography (CT) simulation images to contour pelvic vessels as substitutes for lymph nodes location. Methods: A retrospective review of CT simulation images and conventional pelvic radiation planning data sets {{was performed in}} 100 patients with cervical cancer at the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage IIB to IIIB in our hospital. Pelvic arteries were contoured on CT simulation images, and the outlines of conventional pelvic fields were drawn {{as defined by the}} gynecologic oncology group (GOG) after hiding the contours. The distances between the following vessel contours and field borders were measured: D 					 1, the superior border of the anterior/posterior (AP) field and the bifurcation of abdominal aorta; D 					 2, the ipsilateral border of the AP field and the distal end of external iliac artery; and D 					 3, the anterior border of the lateral (LAT) field and the distal end of the external iliac artery. The distances were recorded as positive values if the measuring point was within the conventional pelvic fields, or they were recorded as negative values. Lymph nodes coverage was considered adequate when D 					 1 ≥ 0 mm, D 					 2 ≥ 17 mm or D 					 3 ≥ 7 mm. Results: All patients had at least 1 inadequate margin, 97 patients (97. 0 %) had 2, and 22 patients (22. 0 %) had all the 3. On the AP field, 95 patients (95 %) had the measuring point, the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta, out of the field (D 					 1 < 0 mm), and all the patients <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> less than 17. 0 mm between the distal end of the external iliac artery and ipsilateral border (D 					 2 < 17. 0 mm).
