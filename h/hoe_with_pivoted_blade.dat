The first forms of telecommu-nication were optical telegraphs using visual means of transmission, such as smoke signals and beacons, and have existed since ancient times. A significant telecommunication de-velopment {{took place in}} the late eigh-teenth century with the invention of semaphore. The semaphore is an ap-paratus for conveying information by means of visual signals, with towers equipped <b>with</b> <b>pivoting</b> <b>blades,</b> paddle...|$|R

25|$|Technological {{advances}} in weaving with foot-treadle floor looms {{and the use}} of scissors <b>with</b> <b>pivoted</b> <b>blades</b> and handles in the 13-15th century led to new designs. The upper part of dresses could now be tailored exactly to the body. Men′s dresses were buttoned on the front and women′s dresses got a décolletage. The lower part of men′s dresses were much shorter in length than those for women. They were wide cut and often pleated with an A-line so that horse riding became more comfortable. Even a knights armor had a short metal skirt below the breastplate. It covered the straps attaching the upper legs iron cuisse to the breastplate.|$|R
50|$|Bessel didn't {{construct}} such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, {{under contract}} to the Swiss Geodetic Commission, developed a symmetric pendulum 56 cm long <b>with</b> interchangeable <b>pivot</b> <b>blades,</b> <b>with</b> {{a period of about}} ¾ second. The Repsold pendulum was used extensively by the Swiss and Russian Geodetic agencies, and in the Survey of India. Other widely used pendulums of this design were made by Charles Peirce and C. Defforges.|$|R
50|$|The Jonas peeler, {{designed}} in Sweden in 1953, is a straight design <b>with</b> a <b>pivoting</b> <b>blade</b> {{attached to the}} end of an oblong metal loop handle, which is held like a knife. A shaft runs through the length of the handle. The blade has two edges to enable use in either direction, and by either hand. While often copied, the original is still made by Linden Sweden. For many decades, it has been the standard type of peeler in the United States.|$|R

50|$|A {{specialized}} type of hair-cutting shears {{known as}} texturizing shears {{are used to}} reduce hair thickness, to create special texturizing effects, or to blend layered hair. Texturizing shears have a pair of <b>pivoted</b> <b>blades</b> {{in the same way}} as normal shears, but one or both blades have teeth on the edge like a comb. Texturizing shears may also be called thinning shears or chunking shears.|$|R
5000|$|Kater {{performed}} 12 trials. He {{measured the}} period of his pendulum very accurately using the clock pendulum by the method of coincidences; timing the interval between the coincidences when the two pendulums were swinging in synchronism. He measured {{the distance between the}} <b>pivot</b> <b>blades</b> <b>with</b> a microscope comparator, to an accuracy of 10−4 in. (2.5 μm). As with other pendulum gravity measurements, he had to apply small corrections to the result for a number of variable factors: ...|$|R
50|$|To use, the {{pendulum}} was {{hung from a}} bracket on a wall, <b>with</b> the knife <b>blade</b> <b>pivots</b> supported on two small horizontal agate plates, {{in front of a}} precision pendulum clock to time the period. It was swung first from one pivot, and the oscillations timed, then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the oscillations timed again. The small weight (c) was adjusted with the adjusting screw, and the process repeated until {{the pendulum}} had the same period when swung from each pivot. By putting the measured period T, and the measured distance between the <b>pivot</b> <b>blades</b> L, into the period equation (1), g could be calculated very accurately.|$|R

The functions of the perforations are to reduce friction due {{to a reduction in}} surface area relative to that of a solid washer, and to increase the duration of use between cleanings by housing lubricant in the perforations. Over the life of the Umnumzaan, the pivot and washers have been incrementally modified.|$|R

50|$|A pair of {{scissors}} consists of two <b>pivoted</b> <b>blades.</b> In lower-quality scissors, the cutting edges are not particularly sharp; it is primarily the shearing action between the two blades that cuts the material. In high-quality scissors, the blades can be both extremely sharp, and tension sprung - to increase the cutting and shearing tension only at the exact point where the blades meet. The hand movement (pushing with the thumb, pulling with the fingers) can add to this tension. An ideal example is in high-quality tailor's scissors or shears, which {{need to be able}} to perfectly cut (and not simply tear apart) delicate cloths such as chiffon and silk.|$|R

5000|$|Compactor designs, however, {{have been}} many and varied, however the two most popular in use today are the [...] "sweep and slide" [...] system (first pioneered on the Leach 2R Packmaster), where the packer <b>blade</b> <b>pivots</b> on a moving {{carriage}} which slides back and forth, and the [...] "swing link" [...] system (such as the Dempster Routechief) where the blade literally swings on a [...] "pendulum"-style mechanism.

50|$|The two <b>pivoting</b> <b>blades</b> {{interlock}} each other. They {{are made}} of chrome-plated steel, which is harder than the thin ductile wire of the staple and strong enough to withstand the force required to remove it. The chrome plating provides a mild rust-resistance suitable for use in an office environment away from any liquids. Though the blade is made from what was originally sheet metal, the right angles and clean edges mean that a punch and die method of production would not be suitable. Therefore, the piece of sheet metal is cut using the process of blanking in a mechanical press, then bent in a press brake. This is a highly automated method which allows for a production rate of up to 1,500 units per minute.|$|R
