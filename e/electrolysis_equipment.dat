50|$|In April 2013, Hydrogenics won a {{contract}} to supply a 1 megawatt hydrogen energy storage system to German utility E.ON in Hamburg. The system will use electrolyzers based on Hydrogenics' proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology for hydrogen production and use excess power generated from regional renewable energy sources, primarily wind energy. In November the first of E.ON's P2G facilities provided by Hydrogenics became operational. The Falkenhagen facility uses wind-powered <b>electrolysis</b> <b>equipment</b> to transform water to hydrogen, which is then mixed with natural gas.|$|E

The unit, {{which has a}} capacity of two megawatts, can produce 360 cubic meters of hydrogen per hour. The plant uses wind power and Hydrogenics <b>electrolysis</b> <b>equipment</b> to transform water into hydrogen, which is then injected into the existing regional natural gas transmission system. Swissgas, which represents over 100 local natural gas utilities, {{is a partner in}} the project with a 20 percent capital stake and an agreement to purchase a portion of the gas produced. A second 800 kW power-to-gas project has been started in Hamburg/Reitbrook district and is expected to open in 2015.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades {{scientific}} papers [1 - 3] have been published on both nuclear transmutation reactions in condensed matter and relative analysis performed by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) for verifying the nuclei formation during the experiments. In this contest, a specific research activity has been developed at the Research Centers (Casaccia and Frascati) of ENEA: different experiments were set up for verifying and testing the data present in literature [2, 3]. Each step of the procedure reported in [2, 3] has been analyzed and deeply investigated: the materials such as <b>electrolysis</b> <b>equipments,</b> electrolytic solutions, electrodes, etc. were preliminarily analyzed by INAA for identifying and reducing all the pollution sources. Successively, different experiments [4] were performed using films of palladium, nickel and copper as electrodes. At {{the end of each}} test, all the materials and the electrolytic solutions used and the blank as well, were analyzed by INAA for checking and measuring the presence of nuclei originating from nuclear transmutations. INAA is in fact able to determine element content at a very low level, where other analytical techniques cannot reach with such precision and accuracy. A particular effort has been carried out to identify the conditions for false positive signals...|$|R

40|$|At present {{three key}} energy {{carriers}} {{have the potential}} to allow a transition towards a sustainable energy system: electricity, biofuels and hydrogen. All three offer great opportunity, but equally true is that each is limited in different ways. In this article we focus on the latter and develop learning curves using cost data observed during the period 1940 – 2007 for two essential constituents of a possible ‘hydrogen economy’: the construction of hydrogen production facilities and the production process of hydrogen with these facilities. Three hydrogen production methods are examined, in decreasing order of importance with regards to their current market share: steam methane reforming, coal gasification and electrolysis of water. The fact that we have to include data in our analysis that go far back in time, as well as the uncertainties that especially the older data are characterized by, render the development of reliable learning curves challenging. We find only limited learning at best in a couple of cases, and no cost reductions can be detected for the overall hydrogen production process. Of the six activities investigated, statistically meaningful learning curves can only be determined for the investment costs required for the construction of steam methane reforming facilities, with a learning rate of 11 ± 6 %, and water <b>electrolysis</b> <b>equipment,</b> with a learning rate of 18 ± 13 %. For past coal gasification facility construction costs no learning rate can be discerned. The learning rates calculated for steam methane reforming and water <b>electrolysis</b> <b>equipment</b> construction costs have large error margins, but lie well in the range of the learning reported in the literature for other technologies in the energy sector...|$|E
40|$|Direct Chemical Oxidation is an {{emerging}} ``omnivorous`` waste destruction technique which uses {{one of the}} strongest known oxidants (ammonium peroxydisulfate) to convert organic solids or liquids to carbon dioxide and their mineral constituents. The process operates at ambient pressure and at moderate temperatures (80 [...] 100 C) where organic destruction is rapid without catalysts. The byproduct (ammonium sulfate) is benign and may be recycled using commercial <b>electrolysis</b> <b>equipment.</b> The authors have constructed and initially tested a bench-scale facility (batch prereactor and plug-flow reactor) which allows treatability tests on any solid or liquid organic waste surrogate, with off-gas analysis by mass spectroscopy. Shake-down tests of the plug flow reactor on model chemical ethylene glycol confirmed earlier predictive models. Pre-reactor tests on water-immiscible substances confirmed destruction of cotton rags (cellulose), kerosene, tributyl phosphate and triethylamine. The process is intended to provide an all-aqueous, ambient pressure destruction technique for difficult materials not suitable or fully accepted for conventional incineration. Such wastes include solid and liquid mixed wastes containing incinerator chars, halogenated and nitrogenated wastes, oils and greases, and chemical or biological warfare agents...|$|E
40|$|Chemical warfare agents may be {{completely}} destroyed (converted to H{sub 2 }O, CO{sub 2 }, salts) by oxidation at 90 [...] 100 C using acidified ammonium peroxydisulfate, with recycle of NH{sub 4 }SO{sub 4 } byproduct. The process requires no toxic or expended catalysts and produces no secondary wastes {{other than the}} precipitated inorganic content of the agents. To determine oxidative capability of peroxydisulfate at low reductant contents, we measured rate data for oxidation of 20 diverse compounds with diverse functional groups; 4 of these have bonds {{similar to those found}} in VX, HD, and GB. On an equivalence basis, integral first-order rate constants for 100 C oxidation are 0. 012 {plus_minus} 0. 005 min{sup {minus} 1 } for di-isopropyl-methyl-phosphonate, methyl phosphonic acid, triethylamine, and 2, 2 {prime}-thiodiethanol at low initial concentrations of 50 ppM(as carbon) and pH 1. 5. To provide scale-up equations for a bulk chemical agent destruction process, we measured time-dependent oxidation of bulk model chemicals at high concentrations (0. 5 N) and developed and tested a quantitative model. A practical process for bulk VX destruction would begin with chemical detoxification by existing techniques (eg, hydrolysis or mild oxidation using oxone), followed by mineralization of the largely detoxified products by peroxydisulfate. Secondary wastes would be avoided by use of commercial <b>electrolysis</b> <b>equipment</b> to regenerate the oxidant. Reagent requirements, mass balance and scaleup parameters are given for VX destruction, using peroxydisulfate alone, or supplemented with hydrogen peroxide. For the use of 2. 5 N peroxydisulfate as the oxidant, a 1 m{sup 3 } digester will process about 200 kg (as C) per day. The process may be extended to total destruction of HD and hydrolysis products of G agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of new hampered by exhaustive researc several alternative production need for a tool which can prov guide {{the selection of the}} mos identify the critical areas of process most efficient. This hydrogen manufacture, consider future of synfuels technology, flowsheet simulation can fill chemical processes is often h into many variations in methods. There is a real ide early information to help t promising routes and research to make the final study uses the example of ed very important for the to demonstrate how computer this need. Three different hydrogen production processes were modeled with the ASPEN flowsheet simulation system. Steam reforming and partial oxidation of methane were studied separately and then compared. For each model the process efficiency, defined in terms of product purity, yield, and cost, was analyzed {{as a function of the}} operating conditions. Trends in behavior were plotted and methodologies for process optimization found. On comparing the processes, steam reforming was identified as the more cost effective process. Partial oxidation, although resulting in lower initial capital investment for the same size plant, has higher operating costs associated with the need for a pure oxygen feed. This process is competitive with steam reforming only if a very low cost source of oxygen is available. The third process simulated was electrolysis of water. This demonstrated the method by which flowsheet simulation can be used to compare processes based on very different technologies. It was found that because of the cost of the large amount of electricity needed, electrolysis produces hydrogen at several times the cost as that of the steam reforming process. In addition, the capital expenditure for a large scale electrolysis plant is much higher than the same size steam reforming facility because of the high cost of the necessary <b>electrolysis</b> <b>equipment.</b> This suggests that electrolysis is not a viable alternative for hydrogen manufacture on the scale needed for future synfuels processes...|$|E
