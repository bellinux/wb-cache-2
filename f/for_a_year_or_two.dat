Upon his return, he surrendered himself to authorities in West Palm Beach where he was imprisoned until his trial. Ashley may have hoped that a hometown jury might sympathize with him, however the local prosecutor petitioned the judge {{for a change of}} venue to Miami. Hearing of the prosecutor's plans, he decided to escape. According to contemporary accounts, Ashley was being escorted to his cell by Sheriff Baker's son, Robert C. Baker, when he suddenly broke away, ran out an unlocked door and climbed a 10-foot fence to freedom.|$|E

25|$|James Beckwourth, George Simpson, {{and other}} trappers such as Mathew Kinkead, {{claimed to have}} helped {{construct}} the plaza that became known as El Pueblo or Fort Pueblo around 1842. George married Juana Maria Suaso and lived there <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> before moving; however, Simpson had no legal title to the land. The adobe structures were built {{with the intention of}} settlement and trade next to the Arkansas River, which then formed the U.S./Mexico border. About a dozen families lived there, trading with Native American tribes for hides, skins, livestock, as well as (later) cultivated plants, and liquor. Evidence of this trade, as well as other utilitarian goods, such as Native American pottery shards were found at the recently excavated site. According to accounts of residents who traded at the plaza (including that of George Simpson), the Fort Pueblo Massacre happened sometime between December 23 and December 25, 1854, by a war party of Utes and Jicarilla Apaches under the leadership of Tierra Blanca, a Ute chief. They allegedly killed between fifteen and nineteen men, as well as captured two children and one woman. The trading post was abandoned after the raid, but it became important again between 1858 and 1859 during the Colorado Gold Rush of 1859.|$|E

500|$|Eadric {{raised an}} army against his uncle and Hlothhere died of wounds {{sustained}} in battle in February 685 or possibly 686. [...] Eadric died the following year, {{and according to}} Bede, whose Ecclesiastical History of the English People {{is one of the}} primary sources for this period, the kingdom fell apart into disorder. [...] Cædwalla of Wessex invaded in 686 and established his brother Mul as king there; Cædwalla may have ruled Kent directly for a period when Mul was killed in 687. [...] When Cædwalla departed for Rome in 688, Oswine, who was probably supported by Æthelred of Mercia, took the throne for a time. [...] Oswine lost power in 690, but Swæfheard (son of Sebbi, the king of Essex), who had been a king in Kent <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> remained. [...] There is clear evidence that both Swæfheard and Oswine were kings at the same time, as each witnessed the other's charters. [...] It seems that Oswine was king of east Kent, which was usually the position of the dominant king, while Swæfheard was king of west Kent.|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of emperor Ivan Alexander on 17 February 1371, Ivan Sratsimir broke off the last links that {{connected}} Tarnovo and Vidin and began to rule without even nominal acknowledgement to the authorities in Tarnovo. He was since styled, as written in the accounts of the Patriarchate of Constantinople: [...] "How should the Patriarch and the Archbishop write to ruler of Vidin and emperor Kamtsimir (Sratsimir): Most Faithful and Allmighty ruler of Vidin the whole of Bulgaria..." [...] The authority of Ivan Sratsimir was treated as {{equal to that of}} Ivan Shishman and the details suggest that he was even presented as a senior ruler. Due to the insufficient information, some early Bulgarian historians such as Konstantin Jireček supported the hypothesis that Ivan Sratsimir and Ivan Shishman were engaged in a military conflict over Sofia but the idea has been dismissed by most modern historians. In fact, despite the rivalry, the brothers scrupulously maintained relations until 1381 and Ivan Sratsimir was even considered as a potential successor by Ivan Shishman. However, J. Fine suggests that immediately after {{the death of}} his father, Ivan Sratsimir tried to seize the control over the whole of Bulgaria for himself and even captured and held Sofia <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> which led to permanent hostility between the two brothers and spoiled any chances for a common Bulgarian resistance against the Ottomans.|$|E

500|$|Lowell {{resigned}} from his Harvard professorship in 1874, {{though he was}} persuaded to continue teaching through 1877. It was in 1876 that Lowell first stepped into the field of politics. That year, {{he served as a}} delegate to the Republican National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, speaking on behalf of presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes. Hayes won the nomination and, eventually, the presidency. In May 1877, President Hayes, an admirer of The Biglow Papers, sent William Dean Howells to Lowell with a handwritten note proffering an ambassadorship to either Austria or Russia; Lowell declined, but noted his interest in Spanish literature. Lowell was then offered and accepted the role of Minister to the court of Spain at an annual salary of $12,000. Lowell sailed from Boston on July 14, 1877, and, though he expected he would be away <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> did not return to the United States until 1885, with the violinist Ole Bull renting Elmwood for a portion of that time. The Spanish media referred to him as [...] "José Bighlow". Lowell was well-prepared for his political role, having been trained in law, as well as being able to read in multiple languages. He had trouble socializing while in Spain, however, and amused himself by sending humorous dispatches to his political bosses in the United States, many of which were later collected and published posthumously in 1899 as Impressions of Spain. Lowell's social life improved when the Spanish Academy elected him a corresponding member in late 1878, allowing him contribute to the preparation of a new dictionary.|$|E

The European Union's controversial Working Time Directive conflicted with this: at first the UK negotiated an opt-out for some years, but working hours needed reform.

2500|$|Once {{the land}} was cleared, it was burnt in May and planted immediately. [...] Planting the potatoes, cucumbers, corn and {{pumpkins}} was hard work since the soil often had many rocks and roots requiring the most effective tool: a sharp stick. [...] Turnip and grain seed was sown by hand and covered with soil scratched up by the [...] "burnt-land harrow" [...] made from the crotch of a tree with protruding spikes.

2500|$|Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter, ranked Laver {{only in the}} [...] "second echelon" [...] {{of great}} players, just behind the six best.

[...] Kramer's main argument for downgrading Laver is that, [...] "Ken Rosewall beat Laver in those two World Championship of Tennis finals {{and that was a}} title Laver really wanted." [...] Kramer sees as evidence of Gonzales' superiority over Laver the fact that Gonzales defeated Laver in a US$10,000 winner-take-all, five-set match before 15,000 spectators in New York City's Madison Square Garden in January 1970, when Gonzales was 41 years old and Laver was still considered the World No. 1 player. On the other hand, Gonzales was still a top ten player when this match took place and Laver subsequently won this event, beating Gonzales in a straight-sets semifinal. Overall, his head-to-head-record with Gonzales was either 35–19 or 38–21 in favour of Laver, depending on the source. Laver was 12–5 against Gonzales during the Open Era, although Gonzales was then in his late thirties.|$|E
