5|$|At {{ground level}} {{and inside the}} lobby, bas-reliefs depict {{the origins of the}} Price company. During the 1920s John M. Lyle, an {{influential}} architect of the Beaux-arts school, was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles, and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald to the construction of the Price Building. Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by a <b>hallway,</b> <b>and</b> a projection {{at the end of the}} building references the bow of a ship.|$|E

Of the two rooms, one was the report room used for administrative work, record keeping and logbooks. It is currently used as a radio room. The second room housed a spare mantle holder. It currently houses the electrical controls, including the sensors responsible for starting the light. It also houses the backup batteries, backup diesel generator and fuel tank, {{as well as a}} small workshop.|$|E
5|$|The {{stains on}} Van der Sloot's clothes matched Flores' blood type. Blood {{was also found}} on the floor, <b>hallway,</b> <b>and</b> {{mattress}} in the hotel room. Police stated that DNA tests would be conducted on the clothes, skin found under the victim's fingernails, and the previously recovered tennis racquet. Ricardo Flores stated in interviews that his daughter's body needed to be exhumed to gather the fingernail DNA evidence, and that her body had not been cremated for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Scenes not {{involving}} the main apartments were all filmed in London {{during the week}} beginning March 30, 1998. Location shooting was done mostly for scenes featuring Joey and Chandler; outside the London Marriott, Grosvenor Square, {{and the top of}} an open-top London bus as it crosses Tower Bridge (this scene was excised from the final cut but features in the opening titles of the next episode). Interiors, such as the restaurant, the Waltham's <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> the hotel rooms, were all filmed on purpose-built sets at The Fountain Studios, Wembley. The reaction from the audience when Monica came out from under Chandler's bed covers meant the actors had to hold their position for 27 seconds. When filming ran late one evening, the production team ordered pizzas for the audience.|$|E

5|$|Three {{weeks of}} filming were {{spent in the}} Hotel Earle, a set created by art {{director}} Dennis Gassner. The film's climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel's hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post-production. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternate set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at Long Beach. A series of gas jets were installed behind the <b>hallway,</b> <b>and</b> the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet, giving {{the impression of a}} fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes. The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock.|$|E
5|$|The {{long take}} video begins with many people dancing on a hallway, until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson {{in the corner of the}} room and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the hallway to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Many USGS {{scientists}} {{worked on}} the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the ColdwaterII observation post for the {{two and a half}} weeks immediately preceding the eruption. The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston in the <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day. That Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at ColdwaterII, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption. Just prior to his departure, at 7p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13½ hours before the eruption, Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation post trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, {{lightning}} {{struck the}} hotel and the lights of both the <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> elevator flickered out. A ghostly wind blows through a window and the reflection of riders in the elevator became distorted.

Cobham Hall was also used for some interiors of Chesney Wold such as the <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> the staircase. The exterior of Bleak House was represented by Ingatestone Hall in Essex. Other houses used for interior shots and garden locations include Balls Park in Hertfordshire, Bromham Hall in Bromham, Bedfordshire, and Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire.|$|E

The name of the plaza and the building come from a sculpted stone found at the northeast corner of the Serpent Base, formed in the shape of a snake’s head. A smaller structure, denoted 1D, is a base 90cm high divided into various rooms with interior patios. These patios are square and contain drainage system for wastewater. The structure also contains an entrance <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> pits for fires in the interior.|$|E
25|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} {{in the house and}} grounds of 4315 Charlotte Street, investigators uncovered a human skull inside a closet {{on the second floor of}} his property, and a partially decomposed human head in the backyard. The search also uncovered several human vertebrae scarred by both hacksaw and knife marks stowed in a <b>hallway,</b> <b>and</b> several human teeth stowed in two envelopes. Both a hacksaw and a miter saw were discovered in the basement of the property, and a chainsaw was also found to be soiled with bloodstains, flesh, and pubic hairs. Luminol tests revealed that the floor of Berdella's basement, and two plastic trash barrels, were extensively bloodstained.|$|E
25|$|Manex also handled {{creature}} effects, such as Sentinels {{and machines}} {{in real world}} scenes; Animal Logic created the code <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> the exploding Agent {{at the end of}} the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.|$|E
