2500|$|Wallenda has {{developed}} several tricks {{that he often}} incorporates into his high-wire routine including stopping {{to make a phone}} call, sitting on the wire, and lying down on the wire. [...] He is said to be [...] "obsessed" [...] with the technological aspects of his acts, insisting on calculating every detail himself. [...] When asked why he risks his life on the high-wire, he replied [...] "I do this because I love what <b>I</b> <b>do...</b> <b>If</b> I won the lottery tomorrow, I'd still be doing what I do." [...] "Walking the wire to me is life," [...] he adds. [...] Wallenda and his family spend roughly 48 weeks per year on the road.|$|E

5000|$|I've {{always enjoyed}} what <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> you are busy, you get interested. It's like the fiddler at the dance. You'd almost play for nothing.|$|R

2500|$|Forza Horizon was {{developed}} by UK-based Playground Games, which is composed of employees who formerly worked at various studios renowned for earlier racing titles and series such as Project Gotham Racing, Driver, , Colin McRae Rally, [...] and Burnout. When asked about Playground Games' involvement, Dan Greenawalt, the head of Turn 10 Studios, said, [...] "I wouldn't trust this partner as much as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> I didn't expect them to surprise me and surprise our players. I have respect {{for their ability to}} come up with great ideas. So I think yes, they are challenged by the customers the same way we are to surprise them with innovation. That's how they see themselves, that's how we see them, it's how they see us. It's really a shared goal." ...|$|E
2500|$|After four days, , Changing Woman, went to {{the summit}} of , the Giant Spruce Mountain, and sat on a rock near the spot where she had first felt {{the warmth of the}} sun deep within her body. [...] , the Sun, came and sat beside her. He tried to embrace her, but she stopped him. [...] "What do you mean by that?" [...] she said. [...] "I want you for my own," [...] he replied. [...] "Come to the west and make a home with me there." [...] "I wish no such thing," [...] she said. [...] "I am lonely," [...] said [...] [...] "What good is all that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> I must endure my days and nights all alone?" [...] After a time a silence, [...] spoke. [...] "I am told you have a {{beautiful}} house in the east. I want such a house in the west. I want it built floating on the shimmering water, away from the shore, so that the Earth-Surface people will not bother me with their quarrels. I want white shell, and blue shell, and turquoise. I want haliotis. I want soapstone, agate, redstone, and jet. Because I will live there alone while you are gone each day, I want animals to keep me company. [...] Give me buffalo, and deer, and mountain sheep, jackrabbits, prairie dogs, and muskrats. Provide me with those things and I shall go with you to the west." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have {{captured}} a peach and a banana, as <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> you're not careful, Cap'n, you'll miss all your chances. Here, I'll divide my banana with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Laura,' said Philip, with a smile, 'I am equally {{far from}} {{guessing}} what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> <b>if</b> {{my mother had}} been anything but what she was, as from guessing what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had a talent for music.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should be}} the last man,' he said stiffly, 'to force my {{conversation}} on another. I {{was under the impression}} that you enjoyed these little chats as keenly as <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> was wrong--' ...|$|R
6000|$|Charlie didn't like that, and {{answered}} quickly, [...] "I don't believe he'd stand it {{any better than}} <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> he had those fellows at him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 16. At last, I take my Figuier, (but {{what should}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> I only knew English?) and find this much of {{clue to the}} matter:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, it does matter! Now, promise me--I insist--that {{you will}} not commit such imprudences again; for what should <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> my Astronomer Royal were to die?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't mention it. So {{he was a}} cert. It {{was only}} the merest fluke I managed to out him when <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> he'd hung on to the end, he'd have won easy. He'd been scoring points all through.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little Psyche {{is looking}} for her Cupid everywhere, as I have looked for mine. I wonder if she ever found and lost him, as <b>I</b> <b>did?</b> <b>If</b> she <b>does</b> find him again, I'll accept it as a good omen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>do</b> it there, {{where was}} <b>I</b> to <b>do</b> it? I'd said I would, and {{therefore}} when I saw him <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it." [...] Then {{the whole affair}} was told as to the black eye, the police, and the superintendent. [...] "And what's to come next?" [...] asked our hero.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will. <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> {{there has}} been {{anything}} amiss, it shall not be looked on again as amiss. But {{there has been}} only one thing amiss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] replied Elinor, [...] "you {{know much}} more of the matter than <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> you {{have any reason to}} expect such a match." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What shall <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> I can't work tomorrow!" [...] moaned Madame, seeing Alvina {{hold up the}} {{thermometer}} towards the light. [...] "Max, what shall we do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And no mistake," [...] he went on. [...] "I {{spotted him}} from the first day. How? Why? Ay, you may ask. Hadn't seen that many gentlemen in my life. Well, somehow <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> you were an Englishman, you would--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About as <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> he {{made the}} more noise, it was the {{privilege}} of his bulk. We stayed in our saddles because we had help. We are equally lame to-day, and if he likes to sit down, let him; I prefer to stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|All night I sat {{upon the}} deck of the Sparhawk, thinking, wondering, and conjecturing. I was in a strange state of mind. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wonder or {{conjecture}} whether Bertha's vessel would come back to me again; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think of what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> <b>if</b> it <b>did</b> come back. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think of what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> <b>if</b> it never came back. All night I thought, wondered, and conjectured what Mary Phillips had meant by the word [...] "but." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What would <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> Mr. Simon Girty {{tried to}} make a squaw of me?" [...] exclaimed Betty, her eyes {{flashing}} fire. [...] "Why, I'd kill him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "Don't, Willis; you'll attract attention. What--what shall <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> <b>If</b> Agnes comes back, {{and finds}} I've let the cook get away, she'll be terribly put out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mercy! What shall <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> <b>If</b> it's true--what you say--{{you must}} go!" [...] she said. [...] "And you must never come any more. Do you promise that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, she didn’t box my ears. She told me she’d {{think of}} it, but that I must speak to you. Naturally, however, I shouldn’t have said what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hadn’t {{made up my}} mind during the last {{fortnight}} that I’m not disagreeable to her.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not so well as you, if you hated this woman's Salome {{as much as}} <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> it's {{always been}} {{as bad as it}} was to-day you've {{controlled}} yourself wonderfully well never to give me any hint of it, or prepare me for it in the least." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no, mamma. Pray don't imagine that. It {{is not so}} at all. What should <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> {{you were}} to say {{anything}} to make him think so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll try to be, if you like. I know I {{ought to}} take the lawyer; but what can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> the major's {{daughter}} keeps running in my head?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'All right, Joe; {{you know}} more of these things than <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> you think that six are best, order them. I suppose the tent we shall get out there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> {{you mean}} well by her, as <b>I</b> hope you <b>do,</b> it can't fret {{you to think}} that she has got {{somebody}} to look after her till you come in and take possession. It is the commonest thing in the world when a girl is left all alone as she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Apparently {{not just}} now,” replied Archie. “I even {{indicated}} {{to you when}} <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>if</b> you’ll remember—and that was at dinner. If we two fellows are to live together pleasantly—and I {{see no reason why}} we should not—it can only be by respecting each other’s privacy. If we begin intruding—” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can {{do nothing}} for myself, my darling,' said the grandfather; 'I don't know how it is, I could once, but the time's gone. Don't leave me, Nell; say that thou'lt not leave me. I loved thee all the while, indeed <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> lose thee too, my dear, I must die!' ...|$|R
