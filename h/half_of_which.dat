5|$|A {{grant of}} £650,000 funded the {{construction}} of a technology centre with a computer suite, which opened in January 1993. Plans for a new sports hall were first discussed in 1990, but they only came to fruition in 1996, when Northgate Sports Hall opened. The Sports Council and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts donated £250,000 towards its construction; this was matched by North Kesteven District Council, while Carre's raised £50,000 towards the building work. An all-weather pitch at the school opened in 2007; it cost £649,000 to lay, <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was met by the Football Foundation.

5|$|A {{subcommittee}} of the S-1 Executive Committee, chaired by James B. Conant, and consisting of himself, Arthur Compton and Harold Urey, was appointed {{to look into the}} issue, and it similarly assessed the danger as low, but still sufficient to warrant taking some precautions. A program was initiated by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland to develop radiation detection devices suitable for use in the field. Some 48 portable detection meters were built in 1943, <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> were capable of detecting 0 to 10 roentgens per day, while the other half could detect from 0 to 100 roentgens per day. Instruments sets were stored at Manhattan District offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and the area engineer and some other officers were instructed in their use. A special team of scientists was created at the Metallurgical Laboratory who could respond to any reports of the use of nuclear weapons or radioactive poisons.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> it already owned. However, Bayer Aspirin made up {{only a small fraction of}} the British aspirin market because of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Straits of Florida on September21, the storm resumed intensification, before striking near Boca Chica Key, Florida with winds of 120mph (195km/h). By early on September22, the system peaked as a Category4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (215km/h). Shortly thereafter, another landfall occurred near Chokoloskee, Florida {{at the same}} intensity. Severe damage {{was reported in the}} state due to strong winds. The storm was considered the worst in Key West since the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane. Throughout the state, 1,200homes were severely damaged or destroyed, while 40businesses were demolished and 237suffered impact. Throughout Florida, there were three fatalities and approximately $12million (1948USD) in damage, over <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was inflicted on crops. The storm rapidly weakened while crossing the state and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as only a Category1 hurricane later on September22. Slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane became extratropical early on September24, while located northwest of Bermuda.|$|E

Revealing to Brian that he got the pig from a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes.

Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe), leading an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities.

However, his 2005–06 season {{came to an end}} during a 3–2 home defeat to local rivals Notts County on 29 August 2005, when he collided with goalkeeper Kevin Pilkington and broke his leg. Beardsley had made four appearances that season, which Mansfield finished in 16th-place in League Two. He returned to the team almost a year later, on 12 August 2006, as an 88th-minute substitute in a 1–1 home draw with Stockport County.
