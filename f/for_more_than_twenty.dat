5|$|The {{history of}} human {{activity}} in Indiana, a US state in the Midwest, began with migratory tribes of Native Americans who inhabited Indiana as early as 8000 BC. Tribes succeeded one another in dominance for several thousand years and reached their peak of development {{during the period of}} Mississippian culture. The region entered recorded history in the 1670s when the first Europeans came to Indiana and claimed the territory for the Kingdom of France. After France ruled for 100 years (with little settlement in this area), it was defeated by Great Britain in the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War) and ceded its territory east of the Mississippi. Britain held the land <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twenty</b> years, until after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War. At that time, Britain ceded the entire trans-Allegheny region, including what is now Indiana, to the new United States.|$|E

I had my foot upon the spot, where, at the same dread hour, the shriven prisoner was strangled; and struck my hand upon the guilty door--low-browed and stealthy-- through which the lumpish sack was carried out into a boat, and rowed away, and drowned where it was death to cast a net.|$|R
40|$|Although principal-agent {{models have}} been {{extensively}} used by American political scientists <b>for</b> now <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twenty</b> years, their application to the European context is much more recent. This paper discusses this evolution and argues that the principal-agent framework provides useful but insufficient insights into our understanding of independent regulatory agencies in Western Europe. This {{is due to the}} preponderant focus of principal-agent theory on the consequences of delegation, at the expenses of the causes. An explanation for the creation of these agencies is suggested that explicitly takes into account a whole set of political transaction costs that political actors are likely to take into account when designing regulatory institutions. In particular, the importance of political uncertainty in explaining independence is stressed...|$|R
60|$|That {{affair of}} Mademoiselle d'Ogeron bore as its natural fruit an {{improvement}} in the already cordial relations between Captain Blood and the Governor of Tortuga. At the fine stone house, with its green-jalousied windows, which M. d'Ogeron had built himself in a spacious and luxuriant garden {{to the east of}} Cayona, the Captain became a very welcome guest. M. d'Ogeron was in the Captain's debt <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the <b>twenty</b> thousand pieces of eight which he had provided for mademoiselle's ransom; and shrewd, hard bargain-driver though he might be, the Frenchman could be generous and understood the sentiment of gratitude.
