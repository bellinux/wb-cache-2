40|$|Whereas, {{most of the}} {{research}} in gender and politics looks at women in Congress, I examine the barriers female <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidates</b> face – particularly gender stereotypes. These obstacles may be bigger for women running for executive office than legislative office given the different role perceptions and ideal qualities voters perceive for each office. Gender politics scholars disagree over whether female <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidates</b> are more advantaged if they focus on male or female issues during their campaign. There is less debate over whether female candidates should focus on male or female traits; scholars believe focusing on masculine traits is a more advantageous strategy. In order to confront gendered perceptions of viability, female <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidates</b> attempt to confront their perceived weaknesses by emphasizing male traits in their advertisements. However, they take advantage of their perceived strengths and focus on female issues in their television advertisements. As more case studies become available, scholars should study how campaign messages change when female <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidates</b> run against other female <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidates</b> and the effects of gender stereotyping on Presidential candidates...|$|R

5|$|Morrow's first {{political}} experience {{was working in}} his uncle William O. Bradley's gubernatorial campaign in 1895. In 1899, Republican <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate</b> William S.

5|$|Coolidge {{entered the}} primary {{election}} for lieutenant governor and was nominated to run alongside <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate</b> Samuel W. McCall.

McCall and Coolidge won the 1915 election to their respective one-year terms, with Coolidge defeating his opponent by more than 50,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|Taylor v. Beckham, , {{was a case}} {{heard before}} the Supreme Court of the United States on April 30 and May 1, 1900, to decide {{the outcome of the}} disputed Kentucky gubernatorial {{election}} of 1899. The litigants were Republican <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate</b> William S. Taylor and Democratic lieutenant <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate</b> J. C. W. Beckham. In the November 7, 1899, election, Taylor received 193,714 votes to Democrat William Goebel's 191,331. This result was certified by a 2–1decision of the state's Board of Elections. Goebel challenged the election results on the basis of alleged voting irregularities, and the Democrat-controlled Kentucky General Assembly formed a committee to investigate Goebel's claims. Goebel was shot on January 30, 1900, one day before the General Assembly approved the committee's report declaring enough Taylor votes invalid to swing the election to Goebel. As he lay dying of his wounds, Goebel was sworn into office on January 31, 1900. He died on February 3, 1900, and Beckham ascended to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|As {{his term}} neared expiration, Laffoon removed Ben Johnson {{from his post}} as highway commissioner, {{replacing}} him with Tom Rhea. This move was made in order to groom Rhea {{to be the next}} governor. Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea, the Democratic Party again chose a nominating convention in lieu of a primary to choose their <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate.</b> Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county political organizations, a convention would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee. The convention was scheduled for May 14, 1935 in Lexington.|$|E

He also drew criticism for appointing his eldest son as state examiner, political supporter James Brown as tax commissioner, and other relatives and political supporters to low-ranking positions in the state government. Although the party strongly supported Alben Barkley's senatorial bid in 1926, Fields and his allies refused to support 1927 <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate</b> J. C. W. Beckham, and the governorship went to Republican Flem D. Sampson.|$|E
5|$|In 1874 Long {{chaired the}} state Republican convention, and finally won {{election}} to the state legislature. He formed {{a close relationship with}} Speaker John E.

Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own {{election to the}} speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{political}} {{forces in the}} Northwestern United States generally favored private development of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia. But the overwhelming victories of <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate</b> George W. Joseph in the 1930 Republican primary, and later his law partner Julius Meier, were understood to demonstrate strong public support for public ownership of dams. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill that enabled {{the construction of the}} Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams as public works projects. The legislation was attributed to the efforts of Oregon Senator Charles McNary, Washington Senator Clarence Dill, and Oregon Congressman Charles Martin, among others.|$|E

This spurred Republicans to recruit a serious candidate, but they struggled to do so. Former Wall Street banker Bruce Lisman announced in May 2014 that he was not running, and attention turned to former State Senator and 2012 nominee Randy Brock, State Representative Heidi Scheuermann and businessman Scott Milne.|$|E

Also in 1985, he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Cumberland College (now the University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg, Kentucky. He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Centre College in 1987. A non-partisan group co-chaired by former Kentucky <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate</b> Larry Forgy raised $60,000 to commission two sculptures of Cooper. A life-sized bronze bust of Cooper sculpted by John Tuska was installed at the Kentucky State Capitol in 1987. The other sculpture, a life-sized bronze statue crafted by Barney Bright, was placed in Fountain Square in Somerset.|$|E

He defeated William T. Barry by a margin of 709 votes, but his running mate, Joseph R. Underwood, was badly defeated by the Democratic-Republican nominee, John Breathitt. Metcalfe's election in 1828 marked the first time the governorship had been won by a candidate who was not a Democratic-Republican. However, only one Democratic-Republican would hold the office between Metcalfe's term and the election of Lazarus W. Powell in 1851.|$|E
5|$|Ruby Laffoon (January 15, 1869March 1, 1941) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 43rd Governor of Kentucky from 1931 to 1935. A Kentucky native, at age 17 Laffoon moved to Washington, D.C., to live with his uncle, U.S. Representative Polk Laffoon. He developed an interest in politics and returned to Kentucky, where he compiled a mixed record of victories and defeats in elections at the county and state levels. In 1931, he was chosen as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by a nominating convention, not a primary, making him the only Kentucky <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate</b> to be chosen by a convention after 1903. In the general election, he defeated Republican William B. Harrison by what was then the largest margin of victory in Kentucky gubernatorial history.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} between Chandler and Laffoon led to factionalism {{within the state}} Democratic Party. When no strong <b>gubernatorial</b> <b>candidate</b> emerged from the Chandler faction in 1939, Chandler threw his support behind Johnson. John Y. Brown, Sr. announced he would challenge Johnson in the primary. This solidified the Chandler faction's support, as Brown was {{an outspoken critic of}} the Chandler administration. Brown gained the support of Chandler critics, notably former governor Ruby Laffoon, Tom Rhea, Earle C. Clements, and Alben Barkley. He further garnered the support of the United Mine Workers and labor boss John L. Lewis. It was to no avail, as Johnson defeated Brown in the primary by over 33,000 votes to secure the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.|$|E
