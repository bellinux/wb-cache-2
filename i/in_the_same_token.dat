Contrary to the “indigenist” agenda, Latin American states, such as Chile, aim to use IBE as a tool of assimilation for indigenous people into a single national identity. Ortiz concludes that IBE programs do not have the unanimous support of Mapuche communities. He argues that there needs to be a greater attention and autonomy given to IBE programs in Mapuche communities by Mapuche leaders.

40|$|Probability theory faces {{difficulties}} when it {{is applied}} to describing uncertain objects in geographic information system (GIS). This is mainly {{due to the fact}} that an object in GIS is normally described by a series of discrete vertexes. Modeling uncertainty objects should be therefore based on error of the composed vertexes. This type of model is normally complex and relatively difficult to implement because of many unknown factors, such as the number of vertexes of a polygon, error nature of each individual vertex and error correlation among the vertexes. In this paper, a probabilistic paradigm for handling uncertain objects in GIS by randomized graph algebra is presented. The theoretical basis for this paradigm is the randomized graph algebra-a probability theory for graph-which is newly proposed in this study. Classical probability theory is based on numerical algebra and is also an extension of numerical algebra by further defining probability density within a numerical domain. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> this study begins with defining graph algebra as the basis for probability theory for graph.

Second, we construct a measure space by generating sigma-algebra and defining measurable function upon it.

Factors such as Earning Ability Payment Scheme, Members’ Cooperation, and Well-being have been identified as the factors that could be used as influential factors of the effectiveness of microcredit finance among the small business operators. The respondents were satisfied with household income and saving that has been generated due to AIM microfinance program. Thus AIM microcredit program among the small scale business is able to move the individual utility indifference curve to the next level. Not only their income have improved but the satisfaction also can be in intangible form where by societal traits of cooperation and caring among the microcredit loaners has been developed. Communication and teamwork brought more successful cases among participants due to monitoring and motivation among members. This could be due to the systems that instituted by AIM in having weekly meeting among the loaners and make them close to each other. Similarly the easy repayment scheme of loan make it more attractive for the loaners to take microcredit financed from AIM.

30|$|Yet, {{there is}} a {{far-reaching}} consensus that normative goals are ignored once they collide with hard economic and/or security interests. In addition to that, norms may become blurred, conflicting or contradictory. Harnisch (2013), for example argues, that the same norms that have informed Germany’s post-war strategic culture of military restraint were used to justify humanitarian interventions in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Indeed, during the red/green coalition government of Schroeder (1998 – 2005) the norm ‘No more war’ was replaced by ‘No more Auschwitz’ {{to put it on}} higher moral ground to justify interventions abroad. Other shortcomings of pure normative concepts are that they rest on abstract, unproven assumptions. To argue, for example, that disaster diplomacy reflects the new national identity of Japan (see Maslow et al., 2015) is problematic because it is assumed that {{there is a}} national normative consensus on disaster risk mitigation policies. This is however not the case. Likewise, the constructivist concept of ontological security (i.e. maintaining a stable sense of self) is unable to offer a viable explanation for policy reorientations in Japan. The argument advanced by Hagstroem and Gustafsson (2015), that there has been an identity shift in Japan from economic super-power to “that of a law-abiding country, which is threatened and even victimised by morally inferior neighbours” (17) seems not only inaccurate but also biased. Does it mean that, first, countries that pretend or claim to respect laws are de facto always “law-abiding” and, second, that they are “morally” superior to countries that do not pretend so? As mentioned already, norms are not absolute and do not exist by themselves but are embedded in the hard social reality of external pressures, material interests, electoral considerations and power politics. Germany, for example, decided to send ground troops to Afghanistan despite its norms of military restraint and its claim of never starting or participating in a war again. One of the reasons for Germany’s intervention was the perceived need of the Schroeder/Fischer government to be internationally recognized and treated as equal military partner. Likewise, Japan decided to resume so-called scientific whaling activities, despite its claim to respect the legally binding ruling by the International Court of Justice against Japan’s scientific whaling practices (International Court of Justice 2014). In this specific case the protection of the Japanese fishing industry interests trumped ideational norms of respect for international law. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token</b> Japan put pressure on the regional government in Okinawa to approve the prefectural relocation of a US military base, despite very strong local anti-base and anti-militarist sentiments and decided to legalize collective self-defense, even so the Constitution forever renounces war as a means to settle conflicts, even so public opinion has remained anti-militarist in their attitudes and beliefs (Midford, 2011; Vosse et al. 2014) and even though UN Charter article 51 states that collective self-defense is only to last”…until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security”.|$|E

5000|$|Importantly, natural {{selection}} might favour genetic lines with both plastic and fixed developmental and affective patterns. In other words, there is value to having both kinds at once. In light of inclusive-fitness considerations, {{children who were}} less malleable (and more fixed) would have [...] "resistance" [...] to parental influence. This could be adaptable some times, and maladaptive other times. Their fixedness would not only have benefited themselves directly, but even their more malleable siblings indirectly. This is because siblings, like parents and children, have 50% of their genes <b>in</b> common. By <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>token,</b> had parenting influenced children in ways that enhanced fitness, then not only would more plastic offspring have benefited directly by following parental leads, but so, too, would their parents and even their less malleable siblings who did not benefit from the parenting they received, again for inclusive-fitness reasons. The overall effect may be to temper some of <b>the</b> variability <b>in</b> parenting. That is, to make more conservative bets.|$|R
