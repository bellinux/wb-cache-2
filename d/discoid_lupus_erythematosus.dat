25|$|<b>Discoid</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> is an {{uncommon}} autoimmune {{disease of the}} skin in dogs. It does not progress to systemic lupus erythematosus in dogs. The most common initial symptom is scaling and loss of pigment on the nose.|$|E
25|$|Neonatal lupus is the {{occurrence}} of SLE symptoms in an infant born from a mother with SLE, most commonly presenting with a rash resembling <b>discoid</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> and sometimes with systemic abnormalities such as heart block or enlargement of the liver and spleen. Neonatal lupus is usually benign and self-limited.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} SLE is not clear. It {{is thought to}} involve {{genetics}} together with environmental factors. Among identical twins, if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one will be as well. Female sex hormones, sunlight, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and certain infections, are also believed to increase the risk. The mechanism involves an immune response by autoantibodies against a person's own tissues. These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. Diagnosis can be difficult {{and is based on}} a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. There {{are a number of other}} kinds of lupus erythematosus including <b>discoid</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> neonatal lupus, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.|$|E

40|$|Three {{patients}} with the unusual combinations of <b>discoid</b> <b>lupus,</b> systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (SLE), and progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) are reported. The first patient developed PSS eight years after a diagnosis of <b>discoid</b> <b>lupus</b> had been made and this was complicated by myositis six years later. The second patient developed PSS more than 20 years after being diagnosed as having SLE. The third patient developed SLE with predominant features of urticarial vasculitis six years after PSS. Mild myositis also ensued. There were no antibodies to U 1 RNP demonstrable {{in any of these}} patients. The clinical progression of SLE to PSS or vice versa in the absence of features of mixed connective tissue disease is distinctly uncommon...|$|R

2500|$|The 19th century's {{research}} into lupus continued {{with the work}} of Sir William Osler who, in 1895, published the first of his three papers about the internal complications of erythema exudativum multiforme. [...] Not all the patient cases in his paper had SLE but Osler's work expanded the knowledge of systemic diseases and documented extensive and critical visceral complications for several diseases including lupus. Noting that many people with lupus had a disease that not only affected the skin but many other organs in the body as well, Osler added the word [...] "systemic" [...] to the term lupus erythematosus to distinguish this type of disease from <b>discoid</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> Osler's second paper noted that reoccurrence is a special feature of the disease and that attacks can be sustained for months or even years. [...] Further study of the disease led to a third paper, published in 1903, documenting afflictions such as arthritis, pneumonia, the inability to form coherent ideas, delirium, and central nervous system damage as all affecting patients diagnosed with SLE.|$|E

Strong associations were found with biological false positive seroreaction for syphilis and thrombocytopenia. The most striking association, however, was with the high prevalence of thrombosis. This tendency to thrombosis was independent of disease activity of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> The <b>lupus</b> anticoagulant appears to be a useful marker for a subset of patients with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> at risk for the development of thromboembolic complications...|$|R

40|$|Chronic lupus-like illness, {{characterized}} by arthralgia, cutaneous manifestations of <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> and photosensitivity, occurred in two mothers of boys with chronic granulomatous disease; one mother also had Raynaud's phenomenon, pleuritis, and unexplained fevers, and both had recurrent stomatitis. Both mothers were carriers {{with a population}} of defective leukocytes demonstrable in vitro. Neither had hypergammaglobulinemia or positive tests for antinuclear antibodies, <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> cells, or rheumatoid factors.

Oral <b>discoid</b> <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> results in oral lesions which present themselves as white spots, ulcers, and central erythema lesions.

40|$|Eight {{patients}} with features of both Sjogren's syndrome and systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> are presented. Clinical and laboratory findings {{in these patients}} form a spectrum of disease. Outstanding laboratory features are marked hypergammaglobulinemia, destructive salivary gland lymphoid infiltration, and uniform presence of anti-DNA antibodies. Three patients had severe renal disease of <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> in addition to classical Sjogren's syndrome, an unusual combination. Patients with coexistent Sjogren's syndrome and systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> have hyperactivity of both humoral and cellular immune systems. T H E COEXISTENCE of rheumatoid arthritis with dry mouth or dry eyes, or both (sicca complex), con-stitutes the classical features of Sjogren's syndrome (1 - 3). The sicca complex is associated less frequently with scleroderma (4 - 5), polyarteritis nodosa (6, 7), polymyositis (3, 8), and <b>discoid</b> <b>lupus</b> (9, 10). There are several brief reports of Sjogren's syndrome in association with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (7, 10 - 14). Another paper reports the occurrence of <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> cells in 10 of 28 {{patients with}} Sjogren's syndrome (15). One of these patients had proteinuria, but diagnostic data for systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> were not presented {{for any of the}} patients. From another point of view, the parotid glands are rarely enlarged in patients with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (14, 16). <b>Lupus</b> renal disease in association with Sjogren's syndrome has been de-scribed in the English literature in only two patients (11, 14.) This report was stimulated by our recent obser-vation of three young women with Sjogren's syn-drome, systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> and active nephritis (Cases 3 to 5).

Papular lesions demonstrated fewer florid dermal and epidermal changes but a similar marked mononuclear cell infiltrate which in all groups was composed predominantly of T lymphocytes (68. 4 + 2 - 11. 2 SD) with the mean helper: suppressor (corrected Leu 3 a:T 8) ratio 1. 73 +/- 0. 60 SD.

40|$|HYPERSENSITIVITY {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for the unpredictability of <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (L. E.).

40|$|One {{theory for}} the {{pathophysiology}} of photosensitive autoimmune skin diseases is that photoinduction of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) secretion leads to keratinocyte apoptosis and translocation of previously sequestered cellular antigens that then activate the immune system. We previously found {{an association of}} the overproducing TNFα- 308 A variant with adult dermatomyositis and with subacute cutaneous <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> Here we focused on mannose binding lectin (MBL), {{which is one of}} several proteins involved in clearance of apoptotic cells and could thereby lessen photosensitive autoimmunity. We examined three variant MBL polymorphisms associated with decreased MBL protein (Asp 54, Glu 57, and the LX promoter polymorphism) in adult dermatomyositis, subacute cutaneous <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> and <b>discoid</b> <b>lupus,</b> and controls. The variant Asp 54 allele was positively associated with adult dermatomyositis in a dose-responsive fashion (p= 0. 0004), as was the Glu 57 allele (p= 0. 004). None of the three variant MBL alleles considered individually was significantly associated with either subacute cutaneous <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> or <b>discoid</b> <b>lupus.</b> In adult dermatomyositis patients homozygous for the wild-type TNFα- 308 G allele (GG), i. e., presumably without elevated TNFα production, 69 % had {{at least two of the}} MBL polymorphisms, versus 20 % of healthy GG controls (p= 0. 0011). Combinations of low-producing MBL variants were over-represented in adult dermatomyositis in a dose-responsive fashion (p= 0. 0002). In adult dermatomyositis patients with one variant TNFα- 308 A allele (GA), 46 % had at least two MBL polymorphisms, versus 7 % of GA controls (p= 0. 0077). Thus, low-producing MBL genes are very strongly associated with adult dermatomyositis. Our model is that genetic polymorphisms leading to overproduction of apoptotic keratinocytes and then impaired clearance of these cells contribute to the pathogenesis of adult dermatomyositis, a photoinduced autoimmune skin disease...|$|R
