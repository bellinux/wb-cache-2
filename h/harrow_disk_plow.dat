Geostatistics provides some tools that {{may be useful to}} study the dynamics of soil surface variability. The objective {{of this study was to}} show how it is possible to apply geostatistics to analyze soil microrelief variability. Data were taken at an Oxisol over six tillage treatments, namely, disk <b>harrow,</b> <b>disk</b> <b>plow,</b> chisel plow, disk harrow + disk level, disk plow + disk level and chisel plow + disk level. Measurements were made initially just after tillage and subsequently after cumulative natural rainfall events. Duplicated measurements were taken in each one of the treatments and dates of samplings, yielding a total of 48 experimental surfaces. A pin microrelief meter was used for the surface roughness measurements. The plot area was 1. 35 × 1. 35 m and the sample spacing was 25 mm, yielding a total of 3, 025 data points per measurement. Before geostatistical analysis, trend was removed from the experimental data by two methods for comparison. Models were fitted to the semivariograms of each surface and the model parameters were analyzed. The trend removing method affected the geostatistical results. The geostatistical parameter dependence ratio showed that spatial dependence improved for most of the surfaces as the amount of cumulative rainfall increased...|$|E

Los tratamientos fueron: incorporación del fertilizante a 10 cm con rastrillo pulidor, a 15 cm con rastra-arado, a 25 cm con arado de discos y a 30 cm con cincel-abonador; testigo absoluto sin fertilizar. Se presentaron incrementos en rendimiento a la incorporación del fertilizante a 30 cm, mostrando diferencias altamente significativas con la fertilización a 10 cm y el testigo, los incrementos en rendimiento fueron de 64. 9 % y 109. 7 % en promedio para cada uno de los semestres. Igualmente, se observaron aumentos en el diámetro del capítulo, en el peso de 1. 000 semillas, en la altura de planta y disminución en el porcentaje de semillas vanas en el capitulo. Los porcentajes de cáscara, almendra, aceite y proteína no respondieron a la fertilización profunda.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of soil tillage on agronomic traits and productivity of sugarcane. The experiment was conducted in the municipality of Goianésia (GO) on a Red-Yellow Latosol of medium texture using the CTC- 2 variety. The experimental design was randomized blocks with six treatments and four replications. The treatments were: T 1) desiccation + moldboard plow + harrow, T 2) moldboard plow + harrow, T 3) harrow + moldboard plow + harrow, T 4) no-till, T 5) subsoiler, and T 6) harrow + disc plow + harrow. The number, diameter, height and productivity of stalks were evaluated. The treatment which resulted in the highest number of stalks was harrow + moldboard plow + harrow; however, this treatment was differed only from the treatment with moldboard plow + harrow. The seedbed preparation with desiccation + moldboard plow + harrow and also <b>harrow</b> + <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> + <b>harrow</b> provided the highest yield of sugarcane stalks.

Agricultural ecosystems can {{play a significant role}} in production and consumption of greenhouse gases, specifically, carbon dioxide. Information is needed on the mechanism and magnitude of gas generation and emission from agricultural soils with specific emphasis on tillage mechanisms. This work evaluated four different tillage methods on the short-term CO 2 and water vapor flux from a clay loam soil in the Northern Cornbelt of the USA. The four tillage methods were moldboard plow only, moldboard <b>plow</b> plus <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> twice, <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> and chisel <b>plow</b> using standard tillage equipment following a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop compared with no tillage. The CO 2 flux was measured with a large portable chamber commonly used to measure crop canopy gas exchange initiated within 5 minutes after tillage and continued intermittently for 19 days. The moldboard plow treatment buried nearly all of the residue and left the soil in a rough, loose, open condition and resulted in maximum CO 2 loss.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects of five tillage systems on the physical properties of a cohesive Yellow Argisol. The experiment was installed in the field on January 21, 2011 and lasted 260 days, in an area previously used as pasture with Brachiaria grass without liming or fertilization, but irrigated by a low pressure spray system. The treatments, in five replications and in a randomized block design, consisted of: 1) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> + ridge-furrow tillage (raising a ridge along the planting row), 135 days after transplanting (DP + RID); 2) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> (DP no RID); 3) subsoiler (SB); 4) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> + scarification with three shanks along the plant row (DP + SPR); and 5) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> + scarification with three shanks in the total area (DP + STA). In all tillage systems, furrows were mechanically opened for the papaya plants. After the treatments, the mechanical resistance to penetration was determined, followed by soil moisture, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), bulk density (BD), macroporosity (Ma), microporosity (Mi), and number of fruits per plant. There were differences in penetration resistance (PR) between treatments. The subsoiler was more effective to decrease RP to a distance of 0. 35 m from the plants, perpendicular to the plant row. The scarifier resulted in a lower PR than DP or SB, even at the depth of 0. 40 m, and it was more effective at greater distances perpendicular to the plant. All tillage systems induced a PR between 2. 0 and 3. 0 MPa at the depth with the highest concentration of papaya tree roots (0 - 0. 25 m), improving the physical conditions to this depth. There was no statistical difference among the treatments for BD, Ma, Mi, MWD, and GMD at a depth of 0. 20 m. The <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> changed the physical properties of the soil most intensely to a depth of 0. 20 m.

In this research, a heavy duty <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> or <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> was used as a rotating knife to cut the sugarcane stubble. The parabolic disk was chosen because it is proven reliable as soil working tools and it is available in the market as spare part of <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> or <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> unit.

Therefore, understanding soil displacement through tillage translocation {{is an important}} step toward developing tillage practices that do not degrade soil resources. Our primary objective was {{to determine the effects of}} soil condition (i. e. grassland stubble versus previously tilled soil), opening angle, and harrow speed on soil translocation. A second field study also conducted on a Lixisol but only in the stubble field, quantified displacement effects of mouldboard ploughing. The field studies were located 12 km South of Évora, Portugal. Soil displacement or translocation after each tillage operation in both studies was measured using aluminium cubes with a side length of 15 mm as ‘tracers’. Offset angles for the <b>harrow</b> <b>disk</b> were 20 ◦, 44 ◦ and 59 ◦; tractor velocities ranged from 1. 9 to 7. 0 km h− 1 and tillage depth ranged from 4 to 11 cm. The depth of mouldboard ploughing was approximately 40 cm with a wheel speed of 3. 7 km h− 1. The translocation coefficients for the two implements were very different averaging 770 kgm− 1 for the mouldboard plough and ranging from 9 to 333 kgm− 1 for the <b>harrow</b> <b>disk.</b> This shows that the mouldboard plough was more erosive than the <b>harrow</b> <b>disk</b> in these studies. All three variables (soil condition, opening angle, and tillage velocity) were critical factors affecting the translocation coefficient for the <b>harrow</b> <b>disk.</b> Displacement distances were the largest for compacted soils (stubble field), with higher opening or offset angles, and at higher velocities. The results also showed significant correlation for (a) mean soil displacement in the direction of tillage and the slope gradient and (b) soil transport coefficient and the opening angle.

And noise is produced in electrical systems by creating a short circuit (Wok, 2011). Self-induced and induced vibration are used in tillage systems. Induced vibration is created by energy consumption and self-induced vibration is created by collision among the blades and soil at the shank (Soeharsono and Setiawan, 2010).

40|$|A mobile {{instrumentation}} system {{was developed and}} mounted on an MF 285 tractor to measure the performance parameters of the tractor and attached implements. The system measures implement draft, fuel consumption, real forward velocity, tillage depth and engine speed. Other parameters such as wheel slippage, drawbar power and traction efficiency would be calculated by ASABE standard. Overall energy efficiency for the tractor-implement system was calculated, too. Three implements included of moldboard <b>plow,</b> <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> and chisel plow at four forward velocities (1. 5, 2. 3, 3 and 4  km/h) in 23  cm depth and 1500  rpm engine speed was examined. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of resulted data revealed that increase of forward velocity results in increase of implement draft, wheel slippage, drawbar power and overall energy efficiency but results in decrease of traction efficiency. Furthermore, fuel consumption decreased by increase of velocity from 1. 5  km/h to 3  km/h but increased by increase of velocity from 3  km/h to 4  km/h. Moreover, {{it was observed that}} draft requirement for implements in tests ranged from 8. 2  kN for the <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> to 13  kN for the chisel plow and fuel consumption ranged from 10. 72  L/ha for the chisel plow to 26. 5  L/ha for the moldboard plow. The ranges in mentioned parameters indicate that energy saving can be readily done by selecting energy-efficient implements and by proper matching of the tractor size and operating parameters to the implements...|$|R

Após oito anos (1985 a 1993), a fertilidade do solo foi avaliada, num Latossolo Vermelho Distrófico típico, em Passo Fundo, RS, em quatro sistemas de manejo do solo: 1) semeadura direta (SD); 2) cultivo mínimo (CM); 3) preparo convencional do solo com arado e grade de discos (PCD); e 4) preparo convencional do solo com arado de aivecas e grade de discos (PCA), e em três sistemas de cultivo: sistema I (trigo/soja), sistema II (trigo/soja e ervilhaca/milho) e sistema III (trigo/soja, ervilhaca/milho e aveia branca/soja). O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos completos ao acaso, com parcelas subdivididas, e três repetições. A parcela principal (4 x 90 m) foi constituída pelos sistemas de manejo do solo e a subparcelas (4 x 10 m), pelos sistemas de cultivo. Os valores de pH, Al, Ca + Mg trocáveis, matéria orgânica (MO), P extraível e K disponível diferiram entre os sistemas de manejo e de cultivo do solo. Os teores de MO, P e K, na camada 0 - 5 cm, foram mais elevados nos sistemas conservacionistas (CM e SD) em relação àqueles observados nos preparos convencionais do solo (PCD e PCA). Os valores de MO, P e K foram mais elevados na camada 0 - 5 cm, quando comparada com a observada de 15 a 20 cm de profundidade, em todos os sistemas de manejo e cultivo do solo. Cropping systems and soil managment can change soil chemical properties. Soil fertility characteriscs were assessed {{after eight years}} (1985 to 1993) on a typical dystrophic red latosol located in Passo Fundo, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Four soil management systems - 1) no-tillage, 2) minimum tillage, 3) conventional tillage using a <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> plus <b>disk</b> <b>harrow,</b> and 4) conventional tillage using a moldboard <b>plow</b> plus <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> - and three cropping systems [I (wheat/soybean), II (wheat/soybean and common vetch/corn), and III (wheat/soybean, common vetch/corn and white oat/soybean) ] were evaluated. A randomized complete block design, with split-plots and three replicates, was used. The main field plots (4 x 90 m) were formed by soil management systems, while the subplots (4 x 10 m) consisted of crop systems. The pH and concentration of exchangeable Al, exchangeable Ca + Mg, soil organic matter, extractable P, and exchangeable K were affected by soil management and cropping systems.

The present research examines the impacts of agricultural activities on buried skeletal remains, both in archaeological and medicolegal contexts. Juvenile pig (Sus scrofa) skeletons were utilized to simulate buried juvenile human aged 3 to 5 years to test the influence of original burial depths and different plowing intervals on the dispersal and the degree of damage caused by an offset <b>disk</b> <b>plow.</b> Ten juvenile pig skeletons were buried in relatively anatomical position, five at a bottom depth of 15 cmbs (cm below the surface) and five at 22 cmbs. They were subjected to different intervals of plowing with one burial at each depth subjected to a single, three, five, seven, or ten plow passes. The disturbed area was surveyed for surface material, and the plow furrows were excavated in 1 m by 1 m units. The excavated soil was screened using a ¼" mesh screen, except for two burials that were screened using a nested ¼" and ⅛" mesh screen to test the differences in recovery between the two screen sizes. The recovered skeletal material was inventoried and assessed for damage. The results of this research showed that while original burial depth had some effect on distribution of bone and the degree to which bone was damaged, the relationship was not statistically significant. The number of plowing intervals did have a significant effect on the distribution and degree of damage. The damage caused to bone by the offset <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> would be distinguishable from perimortem trauma in dry bone. Comparison of the recovery rates of ¼" and ⅛" mesh found that ⅛" contributed to a higher recovery of juvenile remains at least 3 to 5 years of age in soil with a high gravel content...|$|R
