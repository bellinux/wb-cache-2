30|$|In summary, ZnO/β-CD {{nanocomposite}} shows superior photocatalytic activities towards photocatalytic <b>decoloration</b> of RhB dye under solar light irradiation, {{which is}} due to the lower band gap energy of ZnO in ZnO/β-CD system. Moreover, concentration of RhB, irradiation time, dose of the catalysts used and pH of the reaction medium have significant effects on photocatalytic <b>decoloration</b> of RhB dye. β-CD can include the RhB into its cavity and is adsorbed onto the surface of MO, it could play a role as bridge or channel for RhB to get onto the MO surface and accumulate the higher concentrations, which makes the <b>decoloration</b> of RhB more easily and effectively in the presence of hydroxyl radicals produced during photocatalytic <b>decoloration</b> processes. The GC–MS spectral studies confirm the photocatalytic <b>decoloration</b> pathway of RhB dye which follows the steps such as N-deethylation, cleavage of chromophore and mineralization of dye. Based on the findings, ZnO/β-CD nanocomposite can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for the photocatalytic <b>decoloration</b> of RhB dye.|$|E

30|$|Laccase and MnP {{were the}} only {{detected}} decolorizing enzymes in the culture media. With respect to lignin peroxidase, {{it is known that}} the culturing conditions {{used in the present study}} for Trametes fungi do not result in lignin peroxidase activity (Swamy and Ramsay [1999 b]). Furthermore, although DNA sequences for putative versatile and dye-decolorizing peroxidases exist in at least one of the fungal species of the presented study (Hofrichter et al. [2010]; Ruiz-Dueñas et al. [2007]), respective enzyme activities have yet to be demonstrated in this genus. For example, manganese-independent peroxidase (versatile peroxidase) was not detected in T. versicolor by Gavril et al. ([2007]). In addition, assaying for this enzyme (de Jong et al. [1992]) and dye-decolorizing peroxidase (Sugano et al. [2006]) did not detected any activity in the present study. The roles of laccase and MnP in the <b>decoloration</b> process is further supported by lag periods prior to <b>decoloration</b> corresponding to enzyme production in the culture media (Table 4). Once induced, degradation rates improved dramatically, with complete <b>decoloration</b> occurring in as little as 15 hours (Figure 1). However, dye <b>decoloration</b> by T. versicolor has been shown to be initially low regardless of the levels of measurable MnP and laccase (Swamy and Ramsay [1999 b]). This is supported by our findings that enzyme activities did not closely correspond to rate of <b>decoloration</b> (Table 4), thus indicating that other important factors are required for prolonged <b>decoloration.</b>|$|E
