25|$|Although {{some states}} took {{action against the}} Klan, the South needed <b>federal</b> help. <b>President</b> Ulysses <b>S.</b> Grant and Congress passed the Enforcement Acts of 1870 and the Civil Rights Act of 1871, {{also known as the}} Ku Klux Klan Act, {{intended}} to suppress the vigilante violence of the Klan. This authorized the government to prosecute crimes committed by groups such as the Klan, as well as the use of federal troops to control violence. The administration began holding grand juries and prosecuting Klan members. In addition, it used martial law in some counties in South Carolina, where the Klan was the strongest. Under attack, the Klan dissipated. Vigorous federal action and the disappearance of the Klan had a strong effect in temporarily reducing the numbers of murders.|$|R
50|$|Carl Strandlund, an {{engineer}} with 150 patents, {{came up with}} the idea for enameled steel prefabricated homes during World War II, when he worked for a Chicago company that made vitreous enamel products, initially kitchenware, but later, architectural paneling used on some gas stations and restaurants, in particular, early White Castle outlets. After a conversation with Wilson Wyatt, director of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), he set up the Lustron Corporation in 1947 with the help of $12 million ($ in modern dollars) in <b>federal</b> loans. <b>President</b> Harry <b>S</b> Truman, who had appointed Wyatt, was concerned about the possible shortage of housing, as many men were due to leave the military in the coming years with the war over, yet there had been virtually no new residential construction since it had started in 1941.|$|R
50|$|The German Head {{of state}} is the <b>Federal</b> <b>President.</b> As in Germany's {{parliamentary}} system of government the Federal Chancellor runs {{the government and the}} politics of the day while the role of the <b>Federal</b> <b>President</b> is mostly ceremonial. The <b>Federal</b> <b>President,</b> by his actions and public appearances, represents the state itself, its existence, its legitimacy, and unity. His office involves an integrative role.
