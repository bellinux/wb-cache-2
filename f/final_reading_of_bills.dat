5000|$|Elbowgate was an {{incident}} in which Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was accused of having [...] "manhandled" [...] two opposition members of parliament—one Conservative and one NDP—in the House of Commons on May 18, 2016. It took place as opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) sought to delay a closure motion on the <b>final</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bill</b> C-14, a bill to amend the Criminal Code to allow physician-assisted death. Numerous MPs, including Green Party leader Elizabeth May, have suggested that Trudeau's actions {{may be explained by}} the time-sensitive nature <b>of</b> this <b>bill,</b> which had to be passed before the Supreme Court invalidated certain sections of the Criminal Code that could have put voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted death in a legislative grey area.|$|R

50|$|In 2006, Congressional {{representatives from}} Northern Luzon took {{advantage}} <b>of</b> the <b>final</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> House <b>Bill</b> 5749 {{to lobby for}} a project that would extend the expressway system to Rosario, {{as a means to}} boost trade, tourism, and speed up transportation in the provinces of Tarlac, Eastern Pangasinan, and La Union. As a result of this lobbying, the Arroyo administration announced in October 2006 a ten-year period in which the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) would be extended from Mabalacat, Pampanga to Rosario, La Union and the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) would be extended from Calamba, Laguna to Lucena in Quezon and eventually up to Matnog, Sorsogon.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vote was}} held on 6 November 1820, three {{years to the day}} since Caroline's only daughter, Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales, had died. Each peer rose and said either [...] "content", {{indicating}} support for the bill, or [...] "not content", to oppose it. The vote was 123-95 in favour. Though the majority was 28, it was considered a narrow victory. Eleven of the votes in favour were from the bishops who sat in the House of Lords, while many of the votes against were from the richest and most powerful peers. As seats in the House of Commons were often controlled by rich and powerful landowners, it meant that the Commons were almost certain to reject the bill. Consequently, {{over the next few days}} the Lords debated dropping the divorce clause, but the Whigs had spotted a tactical opportunity. Lord Grey now spoke in favour of retaining the divorce clause, since by doing so it made the bill more likely to fail in the Commons. On 10 November, a <b>final</b> <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> took place, and a further vote was held. The bill passed by 108-99, with a majority of 9.|$|R

Shortly after 11 p.m., the Senate passed Bill C-38 on third and <b>final</b> <b>reading</b> by a margin of 47 to 21, with 3 abstentions.|$|R
