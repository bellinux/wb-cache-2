5|$|At JAMMA's 1992 Amusement Machine Show in Japan, {{held during}} 27–19 August 1992, Namco debuted a racing game called Sim Drive for the Namco System 22 arcade system board. It was {{a sequel to}} Eunos Roadster <b>Driving</b> <b>Simulator,</b> a Mazda MX-5 driving {{simulation}} arcade game that Namco developed with Mazda and released in 1990. Its 3D polygon graphics stood out for its use of Gouraud shading and texture mapping. After a location test at the show, where it was previewed by the November 1992 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Sim Drive had a limited Japanese release in December 1992, but {{did not get a}} mass-market release. It served as a prototype for Ridge Racer.|$|E

Plans for the facility were conceived around 1999, and it was constructed in 2000. The facility received an award from the American Society of Civil Engineers for design-build project of the year in 2002. Around 2002, the Zerega shops began overhauling NYCT buses to operate on ultra-low-sulfur diesel. The facility includes paint booths for MTA buses, and was designed to maintain compressed natural gas (CNG) equipment.

50|$|Driving {{simulators}} {{are being}} increasingly used for training drivers {{all over the}} world. Research has shown that <b>driving</b> <b>simulators</b> are proven to be excellent practical and effective educational tools to impart safe driving training techniques for all drivers. There are various types of <b>driving</b> <b>simulators</b> that are being used like train simulators, bus simulator, car simulator, truck simulator etc. As of May 2012 the DVLA has removed <b>driving</b> <b>simulators</b> in some places into the hazard perception test that is required prior to taking the practical driving examination, lowering the chance of gaining experience. This includes learner drivers being able to park a car in various examples that require successful parking in order for candidates to pass the test.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the game industry, the Unreal Engine has also seen adoption by many non-gaming projects. For instance, visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic employed the Unreal Tournament version of the engine to recreate Rouge City, a fictional place in the 2001 film A.I. Artificial Intelligence, {{in order to help}} Steven Spielberg plan out camera angles for scenes set in Rouge City. The popular children's TV show LazyTown used Unreal Engine 3 during filming to generate virtual sets for real-time integration with footage of actors and puppets performing in front of green screens. On the architectural side, HKS announced in 2007 that it had licensed UE3 to produce detailed interactive environments of its projects. Among them was the Cowboys Stadium, whose owners were able to explore its design before construction was completed in 2009. The Unreal Development Kit also was used by the Michigan Department of Transportation, who in 2010 designed a multiscreen <b>driving</b> <b>simulator</b> in a close partnership with Parsons Brinckerhoff to show how vehicles can be plugged in to the national transportation grid. That year also saw the premiere of Chadam, an Unreal Engine 3-powered animated internet series produced by HDFilms and distributed by Warner Bros. Television Group.|$|E

INTRODUCTION All <b>driving</b> <b>simulators</b> include four components:. a simulation of the physics of the vehicle model and the road surface. a simulation of the surrounding environment, including other vehicles and their surroundings. a system that enables the operator to interpret the state of the model, e. g., video and audio displays, real or virtual instrument panels, a motion base. control devices, e. g., steering wheel, br [...] ...|$|R
500|$|Concerning the game's playability, the Japanese {{release was}} judged [...] "impossible to play" [...] by GameSpot and IGN, which both felt the Western {{versions}} were an improvement, {{even though the}} game was still [...] "far more sensitive than it ought to be". Still, Game Revolution found the car default settings unbalanced and hard to re-adjust properly, and criticized the game's inconsistent AI, like Allgame and IGN. Famitsu reported long load times and a high difficulty level, noting that the game was aimed more toward fans of sim racing than fans of arcade-style gameplay, due {{to the difficulty of}} steering. Game Informer and GameZone echoed Famitsus review, stating that the load times quickly become a [...] "game-ending nightmare", and calling the game's handling [...] "touchy", [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "revolutionary", but acknowledging that most players would simply find it too challenging and frustrating to be fun. While Game Informer alleged that [...] "there is a masterpiece for <b>driving</b> <b>simulator</b> buffs buried in here", Allgame was much more negative, stating that the cars [...] "seem overly light on their tires" [...] and that it [...] "feels like you're driving on ice".|$|E

Crash Bandicoot - Time Line ] |publisher=Naughty Dog |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} Programmers Andy Gavin, Stephen White and Greg Omi created three new gameplay engines for the game. Two of the three new engines were three-dimensional in nature and were created for the airplane and jet-ski levels; the third new engine was created for the motorcycle levels in the style of a <b>driving</b> <b>simulator.</b> The new engines combined make up a third of the game, while the other two-thirds of the game consist of the same engine used in the previous games. Jason Rubin explained that the [...] "classic" [...] engine and game style was preserved due {{to the success of the}} previous two games and went on to say that [...] "were we to abandon that style of gameplay, that would mean that we would be abandoning a significant proportion of gamers out there." [...] An arbitrary plane z-buffer was created for the jet-ski and flooded Egyptian hallway levels of the game. To create a completely fluid feel for the water on these levels, an environment map that reflects the sky was fitted onto the surface of the water. A real shadow was given to the Crash character at the request of the Sony Computer Entertainment America producers, who were [...] "sick of that little discus that's following him around." [...] To create an [...] "arcade" [...] experience in the airplane levels and to differentiate them from flight simulators, the enemy planes were programmed to come out in front of the player and give the player ample time to shoot them before they turn around and shoot the player rather than come up behind the player and hit them from behind. The Relic system was introduced to give players a reason to return to the game after it has been completed.|$|E

2500|$|Motion {{sickness}} due to {{virtual reality}} {{is very similar}} to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films. [...] In virtual reality, however, the effect is made more acute as all external reference points are blocked from vision, the simulated images are three-dimensional and in some cases stereo sound that may also give a sense of motion. The NADS-1, a simulator located at the National Advanced <b>Driving</b> <b>Simulator,</b> is capable of accurately stimulating the vestibular system with a 360-degree horizontal field of view and 13 degrees of freedom motion base.
