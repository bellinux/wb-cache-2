He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E

Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not <b>deserve</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man.
