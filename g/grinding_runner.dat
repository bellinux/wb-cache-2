40|$|In those bachelor’s thesis {{there is}} {{effected}} background research and description of inside and universal grinding machines. This thesis contains introduction {{where you can}} find history of cutting machines innovative trends for fucture and basic separation this machines. Next chapter describes the most important main parts cutting machines. In next part of thesis own principle grinding as technological operation is described. Theme of main principle of stock removal, main problems and their reduction or remove are spreaded here. Next chapter is devoted {{one of the most important}} part of grinding process especially grinding disks. There are introduced the most important properties and characteristics of <b>grinding</b> <b>runner</b> for its use in technical practice. The biggest attention in those baccalaureate work is devoted to grinding machines. In those part there are introduced main requirements for these machines, main principle of their activities and further movement in modernizing, automatization and change from NC controlled machines to CNC machinery including illustrate personal simulation grinding. Follows dividing CNC grinding machines. In part inside grinding machines there is preliminary basic rating and also problems which come on with these grinding machines and their division into grinding machine with revolving workpiece,with dead centre workpiece with planetary movement of <b>grinding</b> <b>runner</b> and nearer description of two of them. The main problem at these grinding machine is high spindle speed at machining, that is why there are also mentioned two basic version of these spindles. About universal grinding machine there is lineation of their activities, using and their constructional design including presentation of concrete grinding machines. At the last part of those work there are mentioned different manufacturers of inside and universal grinding machine including examples of their products, technical parameters of grinding machines and pictorial documentation. Related to the most of the universal grinding machines has special device for grinding inside hole, there isn´t mentioned much producers of inside grinding machines...|$|E

Above the bedstone is {{the turning}} runner stone which {{actually}} does the <b>grinding.</b> The <b>runner</b> stone spins above the stationary bedstone creating the [...] "scissoring" [...] or grinding {{action of the}} stones. A runner stone is generally slightly , while the bedstone is slightly [...] This helps to channel the ground flour to the outer edges of the stones {{where it can be}} gathered up.|$|R
5000|$|Various nylons {{break down}} in fire and form {{hazardous}} smoke, and toxic fumes or ash, typically containing hydrogen cyanide. Incinerating nylons {{to recover the}} high energy used to create them is usually expensive, so most nylons reach the garbage dumps, decaying very slowly. [...] Nylon is a robust polymer and lends itself well to recycling. Much nylon resin is recycled directly in a closed loop at the injection molding machine, by <b>grinding</b> sprues and <b>runners</b> and mixing them with the virgin granules being consumed by the molding machine.|$|R
