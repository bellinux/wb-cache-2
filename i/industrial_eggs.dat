40|$|In {{this work}} the {{development}} of a method to determine semicarbazide (SEM) in fresh whole egg and in whole egg and egg white powders as those used in the food industry, by using LC-MS/MS is described. The method is based on a recently validated one for the determination of SEM in baby food. SEM is extracted from egg with 0. 2 mol. L- 1 hydrochloric acid and derivatised with 2 nitrobenzaldehyde. The extract is neutralised and purified by passing through a solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde derivative is eluted with ethyl acetate. The eluate is evaporated to dryness and the residue re-dissolved in methanol: water mobile phase. SEM is determined by reversed phase LC-MS/MS. The “in-house” validation of this method has been performed taking into account the “Harmonized guidelines for single-laboratory validation of methods of analysis” (IUPAC Technical report) and the Commission Decision (2002 / 657 /EC). The performance characteristics of the method were established by in-house validation procedures employing assays with standard solutions, sample blanks and spiked samples. Linearity, matrix effect, trueness, precision, selectivity, limits of detection and of quantification were determined. The fitness for purpose of this method was assessed based on its performance characteristics. LOD’s of 0. 15 µg•kg- 1 and 0. 4 µg•kg- 1 for whole fresh <b>egg</b> and <b>industrial</b> <b>egg</b> powders, respectively, were obtained. The LOQ for fresh whole egg was 0. 2 µg•kg- 1 and for <b>industrial</b> <b>egg</b> powders 0. 8 µg•kg- 1.

40|$|Egg {{white is}} a key {{ingredient}} in many food products as it combines high nutritional quality withexcellent functional properties.

Thepresent work highlighted the effect of a wide range of dry heating rates (from 1 to 10 days between 60 and 90 C) simultaneously on the interfacial properties, antigenicity and susceptibility to in vitrodigestion of egg white proteins. Thanks to a powerful statistical methodology, i. e. multiple factor analysis(MFA), that enables to consider all the data in a common space, intermediate dry heating treatments (2 e 5 days at 70 C or 1 e 2 days at 80 or 90 C) were found to be good compromise to improve egg whitefunctionality without enhancing too much protein resistance to digestion or protein antigenicity...|$|R

This issue is of great importance when egg white enters into the composition of highly perishable products, such as chilled egg-based desserts. Due to the high thermo-sensitivity of its constitutive proteins, liquid egg white is stabilized at low heat-treating times and temperatures (2 to 6 min at 55 °C to 57 °C in France). The remaining of heat-resisting bacteria may shorten the shelf-life of the desserts, with damaging health and economical consequences.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of wastes due to food spoilage may help save food resources among the current worldwide food production. <b>Industrial</b> <b>egg</b> products, obtained after egg breaking, recovery and pasteurisation {{of the internal}} egg components, are used {{in a wide range}} of food, including chilled egg- and milk-based food particularly susceptible to microbial spoilage due to their low cooking temperatures. One of the main bacteria involved in the spoilage of pasteurized egg and dairy products belongs to the spore-former B. cereus group. Several members of this group may lead to food spoilage due to their enzymatic activities, even at low temperatures. However, the risk of spoilage has mainly been assessed by targeting enzymatic activities in dairy products or in vegetables foods that do not require chilled storage. In order to consider more accurately the food spoilage issue at both optimal and low temperatures, this work proposes to characterize the enzymatic potential of a collection of 68 strains of the B. cereus group, coming from pasteurized liquid egg products collected in the French egg breaking industry at two consecutive seasons. An egg-based medium was designed, allowing the kinetic characterisation of bacterial lipases and proteases at optimal and refrigeration temperatures. The results contribute to further investigate a comprehensive bacterial collection that was already characterised for its cold adaptation, its ability to grow in whole egg at higher levels than in optimum laboratory medium, to colonize the industrial surfaces, and to induce phase, texture and colour shifts of whole egg. This study contributes to the search for early markers that could help the producers of pasteurized liquid egg and dairy products to better assess the microbial quality of their products for their orientation towards specific applications...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Bacterial {{spoilage}} involves visible {{modifications of}} texture, viscosity, colour, and/or flavour of liquid egg products. These later {{are widely used}} in various foodstuffs which microbiological quality is essential. Among the flora able to resist the mild heat treatments encountered by <b>industrial</b> <b>egg</b> products, {{the presence of the}} Bacillus cereus group is a recurring problem because of the growth and hydrolytic potentials of psychrotrophic strains of this group at refrigerated temperatures, leading to spoilage events during storage. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the correlation between already known psychrotrophic genotypic and phenotypic signatures and whole egg spoilage ability at low (10 °C) and medium (30 °C) temperatures, using a collection of 68 psychrotrophic B. cereus group isolates coming from industrial pasteurized liquid whole egg products. Material and methods: Genetic profiles were designed by real-time PCR, according to specific cspA and 16 S rDNA signatures (i. e. 16 S rDNA- 1 m mesophilic and 16 S rDNA- 2 p psychrotrophic signatures). Phenotypic profiles were designed by testing growth ability at 6 °C and 43 °C on BHI-YE agar. The spoilage potential was investigated in whole liquid egg at 10 °C and 30 °C, through measurement of the cell population (after 5 days and 18 h, respectively), and investigation of the time leading to overall spoilage of the egg product, i. e. visible transformation of whole egg into a white slurry cream. As a relevant growth control, the level of population was investigated in optimum medium (BHI-YE) at both temperatures. Results: The average level of population was of the same order of magnitude in liquid whole egg and in BHI-YE at 30 °C (8. 2 ± 0. 2 log CFU/mL). Surprisingly, this level was significantly higher in liquid whole egg (7. 8 ± 0. 5 log CFU/mL) than in BHI-YE (6. 9 ± 0. 3 log CFU/mL) at 10 °C. Moreover, a strong correlation was highlighted between growth ability in whole egg at 10 °C and presence of the cspA signature. Such a correlation was neither observed in BHI-YE regardless of the temperature, nor at 30 °C regardless of the medium. Overall spoilage was observed for various incubation times, i. e from 11. 3 h to 36 h, and from 5 d to 24 d at 30 °C and 10 °C, respectively. Once more, the presence of the cspA signature was strongly associated to specific thermal conditions : the bacteria exhibiting the cspA signature were those leading to the fastest whole egg spoilage at 10 °C (P-values: 10 - 8) but not at 30 °C. To conclude, the presence of the cspA signature highlights the isolates able to grow and spoil whole egg at 10 °C, independently of their ability to grow at 10 °C in optimum medium or to spoil whole egg at 30 °C. Significance: This study provides new insights on psychrotrophic B. cereus group strains, by highlighting whole egg as a relevant model for evaluating spoilage kinetics, and the cspA signature as a relevant spoilage marker...|$|R

The larvae of both groups showed a high degree of similarity, suggesting that the hybrid larvae showed a high level of heritability from the cachara broodstock. Analysis of the total lipid content provided evidence that there is no alteration in lipid concentration during ontogeny for both groups (i. e., the cachara and hybrids). However, the fatty acid profile showed that during the endogenous feeding period (phase II), when the larvae must use the energy reserves from the mother, the cachara larvae used mainly monounsaturated fatty acids for development. This is typical for most fish species, though notably, the hybrids preferentially used saturated fatty acids. Furthermore, certain specific changes demonstrate unique patterns of energy utilization and structural substrates, which may aid in elucidating the empirical differences reported by fish farmers (i. e., that the hybrids perform better than cacharas in captivity) ...|$|R

Also we aimed to form transparent gels of EWP {{by means of}} the cold-gelation process. We showed that {{it was not possible to}} prepare cold-set gels because ovotransferrin (OT), present in EWP, was found to interfere with fibril formation. Therefore, we developed a new purification method in which first Or was selectively denatured by a heating step, subsequently precipitated by acidification and removed by centrifugation. Finally, the supernatant was desalted by ultra filtration. This resulted in a preheated EWP preparation, which mainly contains OA (> 80 %). By removing OT using this new preheat procedure transparent gels were obtained after acid-induced gelation. Fracture properties of various EWP preparations were determined and compared with those of acid-induced gels of OA and WPI. Gels formed from different EWP preparations were weak (fracture stress 1 - 15 kPa, fracture strain 0. 3 - 0. 7), and the networks consisted of thin strands with hardly any additional disulphide bonds formed during the gelation step. In conclusion, the microstructure of the aggregates formed in the first step of the cold-gelation process and the amount of additional disulphide bonds formed during the second step appeared to be the determining factors contributing to the hardness and deformability of acid-induced gels of egg white proteins...|$|R

A total of two hundred and ten H&N brown layer hens with 20 week age, were used in this research. First, preliminary experiments were designed (60 hens in total) to establish the optimal exposure dose of E. coli and to determine the nearest time of notable response {{to be used in the}} remainder studies of this research. At 35 -wk of age, 150 hens were randomly assigned into 2 groups with 3 replicates of 25 birds each; the first group was injected in the brachial wing vein with 107 E. coli colony/hen, while the second group was injected with saline and served as a control. The body temperature and plasma corticosterone concentration were measured 3 hr after injection. Specimens of liver and brain were obtained from each group and the gene expression of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, interlukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), Bax, and caspase- 3 genes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. DNA damage in the brain and liver tissues were also measured by comet assay. Hens treated with E. coli showed significant (P< 0. 05) increase of body temperature and plasma corticosterone (42. 6 °C and 14. 5 ng/ml, respectively) compared to the control group (41. 1 °C and 5. 5 ng/ml, respectively). Additional remarkable over-inflammation gene expression of p 38, IL- 1 β and TNF-α. genes were also detected in the brain (2. 2 -fold, 2. 0 -fold and 3. 3 -fold, respectively) and the liver (2. 1 -fold, 1. 9 -fold and 3. 0 -fold, respectively) tissues of the infected chickens. It is also important to note that hens injected with E. coli showed an increase in DNA damage in the brain and liver cells (P< 0. 05). These results were synchronized with activating cell death program since our data showed significant high expression of Bax gene by 2. 8 - and 2. 7 -fold and caspase- 3 gene by 2. 5 - and 2. 7 -fold in the brain and liver tissues of infected chickens, respectively (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction Breeding quail and quail <b>egg</b> <b>industrial</b> {{production}} {{because of}} the high nutritional value of these products has been developing these years. Considering the high demand and economical production, further development in the future is predicted. In order to design and effective utilization of the equipment for transportation, separation, packaging and storage, the physical and mechanical properties of quail eggs are needed. It is of great importance to study the factors which are influencing these properties. Strength of the shell {{is an important factor in}} determination of quail egg quality. Quail egg shell strength depends on several variables including specific gravity, egg weight and volume, shell thickness, weight and percentage of shell, hardness, breaking force, breaking energy, egg surface, farming conditions, type and species of birds, nutrition and geometric characteristics of eggs. Materials and Methods In this paper, initially in three phases, at 15 weeks, 19 weeks and 23 weeks, shell strength changes and physical properties of quail eggs on 90 quails during their first period of laying eggs were studied. Measured properties were included dimensions, weight, volume, specific gravity, shell thickness, weight and percentage of shell, breaking force, breaking energy, egg surface and some other properties. In the second part the effects of divergent selection for the bird’s body weight at four weeks of age on the quail eggs of fifth generation were studied. Measured properties were included dimensions, weight, volume, breaking force, breaking energy and some factors for direct and indirect measurement of strength of quail eggs. For direct measurement of the strength of eggshell of quail, two methods were employed: The first method was quasi-static compression test between two parallel plates of the universal testing machine and the second method was measuring specific gravity. In the first method, eggs were compressed between two plates using universal testing machine. The compression speed was 6 cm/min and 10 cm/min. The egg sample was placed on the fixed plate and pressed with a moving plate connected to the load cell until its rupture. In the second method, quail egg volume is measured by water displacement method, as they were weighed by digital scales and specific gravity is calculated by dividing weight per volume. Results and Discussion In the first part of the study, through the time from beginning to end of the first period eggs (from 15 weeks to 23 weeks) breaking energy, specific gravity of quail eggs and also flexibility of eggs against external forces increased. Mass, volume, large diameter, central diameter, geometric diameter mean and surface of the shell from the beginning of the period to the end of it, remained unchanged and their mean values were respectively 12. 41 gr, 11. 51 cm 3, 33. 79 mm, 26. 10 mm, 28. 45 mm and 2546 mm 2.
