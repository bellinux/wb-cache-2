25|$|Tony Rolt and Duncan Hamilton debuted the {{prototype}} at Le Mans in 1950. It was the first-ever Le Mans entry {{to have an}} overdrive transmission. Not only was the car one of the 29 finishers {{from the field of}} 66, but also finished in fourth place. This outstanding achievement sealed Healey’s contract with Nash for a limited production run of the road cars. Roger Menadue, head of Healey’s experimental department, {{played a significant role in}} the success: He filed slots in the backplates of the brakes and extended the adjusting mechanism to a small exterior lever. Thus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds</b> he could adjust the brakes during pit stops without jacking the car up—an innovation that was said to save as much as half an hour at each stop.|$|E
25|$|Consolidation is {{a process}} by which soils {{decrease}} in volume. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required to squeeze {{the water out of}} a thick deposit of clayey soil layer might be years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds.</b> A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl Terzaghi developed the theory of consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement and the time required for the settlement to occur. Soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compression index and coefficient of consolidation.|$|E

25|$|Supporters {{of hunting}} {{maintain}} that when foxes or other prey (such as coyotes {{in the western}} USA) are hunted, the quarry are either killed relatively quickly (instantly or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds)</b> or escapes uninjured. Similarly, {{they say that the}} animal rarely endures hours of torment and pursuit by hounds, and research by Oxford University shows that the fox is normally killed after an average of 17minutes of chase. They further argue that, while hunting with hounds may cause suffering, controlling fox numbers by other means is even more cruel. Depending on the skill of the shooter, the type of firearm used, the availability of good shooting positions and luck, shooting foxes can cause either an instant kill, or lengthy periods of agony for wounded animals which can die of the trauma within hours, or of secondary infection over a period of days or weeks. Research from wildlife hospitals, however, indicates that {{it is not uncommon for}} foxes with minor shot wounds to survive. Hunt supporters further say that it is a matter of humanity to kill foxes rather than allow them to suffer malnourishment and mange.|$|E
25|$|Geometric matching/ shape {{complementarity}} methods {{describe the}} protein and ligand {{as a set}} of features that make them dockable. These features may include molecular surface / complementary surface descriptors. In this case, the receptor’s molecular surface is described in terms of its solvent-accessible surface area and the ligand’s molecular surface is described in terms of its matching surface description. The complementarity between the two surfaces amounts to the shape matching description that may help finding the complementary pose of docking the target and the ligand molecules. Another approach is to describe the hydrophobic features of the protein using turns in the main-chain atoms. Yet another approach is to use a Fourier shape descriptor technique. Whereas the shape complementarity based approaches are typically fast and robust, they cannot usually model the movements or dynamic changes in the ligand/ protein conformations accurately, although recent developments allow these methods to investigate ligand flexibility. Shape complementarity methods can quickly scan through several thousand ligands <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds</b> and actually figure out whether they can bind at the protein’s active site, and are usually scalable to even protein-protein interactions. They are also much more amenable to pharmacophore based approaches, since they use geometric descriptions of the ligands to find optimal binding.|$|E
500|$|In May 2013, George H.W. Bush {{conducted}} the first carrier-borne end-to-end at-sea {{test of the}} Surface Ship Torpedo Defense System (SSTDS). [...] The SSTDS combines the passive detection of the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) that finds, classifies, and tracks torpedoes with the hard-kill capability of a Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT), an encapsulated miniature torpedo designed to locate, home in on, and destroy hostile torpedoes. This increases protection against wake-homing torpedoes like the Type 53 that don't respond to acoustic decoys. [...] The pieces of the SSTDS are engineered to locate and destroy incoming torpedoes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds.</b> [...] Each system includes one TWS and 8 CATs. [...] Initial operational capability (IOC) is planned for 2019 and all aircraft carriers are to be outfitted by 2035.|$|E

500|$|All {{species of}} sundew {{are able to}} move their tentacles in {{response}} to contact with edible prey. The tentacles are extremely sensitive and will bend {{toward the center of}} the leaf to bring the insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible. According to Charles Darwin, the contact of the legs of a small gnat with a single tentacle is enough to induce this response. This response to touch is known as thigmonasty, and is quite rapid in some species. The outer tentacles (recently coined as [...] "snap-tentacles") of D.burmannii and D.sessilifolia can bend inwards toward prey <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds</b> after contact, while D.glanduligera is known to bend these tentacles in toward prey in tenths of a second. In addition to tentacle movement, some species are able to bend their laminae to various degrees to maximize contact with the prey. Of these, D.capensis exhibits what is probably the most dramatic movement, curling its leaf completely around prey in 30 minutes. Some species, such as D.filiformis, are unable to bend their leaves in response to prey.|$|E
500|$|The {{pathologist}} {{arrived at}} the scene at 11:45.

The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well." [...] The time of death was placed at between 01:00 and 02:00 (1:00 and 2:00a.m.) 5December. In a statement issued at the time, Detective Superintendent John Porter said: [...] "It is 99% certain that the girl was murdered, attacked, chatted to or met by her killer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds</b> after Jenni Savage left her.

500|$|Upon release, Jumping Flash! 2 {{received}} mostly positive reviews. A reviewer for Next Generation {{commented that}} [...] "While it's nearly impossible for any sequel {{to have the}} same impact as an original, JF2 does an excellent job of recreating the magic of the first game, yet still adds creative details and fresh ideas throughout." [...] He found that like the original, the game is far too easy, and in particular that the impressive visual presence of the bosses is lost when the player defeats them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds.</b> However, he noted that the levels are much larger than the original's and include hidden bonuses, giving it greater longevity. Dan Hsu and Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized that the game is more of an expansion pack of the original Jumping Flash! than a new game, while Shawn Smith and Crispin Boyer applauded it for having much better graphics and larger levels than the original. IGN staff were impressed by the game's newly expanded worlds and the inclusion of bonus worlds, and noted that despite not significantly differing from the first Jumping Flash!, the game [...] "still delivers". Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu awarded the game as among the top 120 games reviewed by the publication in 2000.|$|E

500|$|At 8:32a.m. {{local time}} {{the next day}} (18 May), an {{earthquake}} measuring magnitude 5.1 rocked the area, triggering the landslide that started the main eruption. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds,</b> vibrations from the earthquake loosened [...] of rock on the mountain's north face and summit, creating a massive landslide. With {{the loss of the}} confining pressure of the overlying rock, Mount St. Helens began to rapidly emit steam and other volcanic gases. A few seconds later, it erupted laterally, sending swift pyroclastic flows down its flanks at near supersonic speeds. These flows were later joined by lahars. Before being struck by a series of flows that, at their fastest, would have taken less than a minute to reach his position, Johnston managed to radio his USGS co-workers with the message: [...] "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!" [...] Seconds later, the signal from the radio went silent, and all contact with the geologist was lost. Initially, there was some debate as to whether Johnston had survived; records soon showed a radio message from fellow eruption victim and amateur radio operator Gerry Martin, located near the Coldwater peak and farther north of Johnston's position, reporting his sighting of the eruption enveloping the ColdwaterII observation post. As the blast overwhelmed Johnston's post, Martin declared solemnly, [...] "Gentlemen, the uh... camper and the car sitting over to the south of me is covered. It's gonna get me, too. I can't get out of here..." [...] before his radio went silent.|$|E
500|$|Many {{instances}} in the episode were character-driven. The {{action of the}} Angel to torture Amy [...] "for fun" [...] was met with anger from the Doctor but also gave him courage to defeat the Angels and save Amy. Moffat stated that in the scene in which the Doctor must {{figure out how to}} save Amy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds</b> he was [...] "very basic...very pure, simple Doctor" [...] and did not have time to comfort Amy because his compassion would {{get in the way of}} his thinking process. River was also meant to understand this and explain to Amy that he needed to think. Moffat believed that Amy was [...] "passionate and a fighter and...also really smart" [...] which he showcased in the scene where Amy could not open her eyes for more than a second but was determined to do it for less than one. Moffat also believed that Amy's decision to attempt to seduce the Doctor was consistent with the character he had built up from her first episode. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment", although Moffat later admitted he regretted the way he wrote the scene, saying [...] "I played it for laughs, and it was so wrong". The Doctor's reaction was intended to be a reflection of how he often acted embarrassed and flustered when women behaved that way.|$|E
500|$|At about 00:30, {{the leading}} {{units of the}} German line {{encountered}} British destroyers and cruisers. A violent firefight at close range ensued; Westfalen opened fire on the destroyer [...] with her 15cm and 8.8cm guns {{at a distance of}} about 1,800m (2,000yd). Her first salvo destroyed Tipperarys bridge and forward deck gun. In the span of five minutes, Westfalen fired ninety-two 15cm and forty-five 8.8cm rounds at Tipperary before turning 90degrees to starboard to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. Nassau and several cruisers and destroyers joined in the attack on Tipperary; the ship was quickly turned into a burning wreck. The destroyer nevertheless continued to fire with her stern guns and launched her two starboard torpedoes. One of the British destroyers scored a hit on Westfalens bridge with its [...] guns, killing two men and wounding eight; Captain Redlich was slightly wounded. [...] At 00:50, Westfalen spotted [...] and briefly engaged her with her secondary guns; in about 45seconds she fired thirteen 15cm and thirteen 8.8cm shells before turning away. Broke was engaged by other German warships, including the cruiser she was hit at least seven times and suffered 42dead, six missing, and 34wounded crew members. An officer aboard the light cruiser [...] described Broke as [...] "an absolute shambles." [...] Despite the serious damage inflicted, Broke managed to withdraw from the battle and reach port. Just after 01:00, Westfalens searchlights fell on the destroyer Fortune, which was wrecked and set ablaze <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>seconds</b> by Westfalen and Rheinland.
