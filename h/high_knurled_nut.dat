50|$|A <b>knurled</b> <b>nut</b> is a <b>nut</b> with a <b>knurled</b> outside surface. This {{facilitates}} tightening by hand (thumb nut) or secures the nut in a substrate (insertion nut).|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} TEC-22 variant {{featured a}} threaded barrel and a 30-round magazine. The barrel threading is -20 and allows a barrel extension or suppressor to be attached. A small, <b>knurled</b> <b>nut</b> threads onto the barrel {{to protect the}} threading.|$|R
50|$|The {{video head}} drum itself of a VX machine {{also has the}} unique {{distinction}} of being completely removable and replaceable without any special tools or equipment. The drum has a <b>knurled</b> <b>nut</b> on top, which can be adjusted by hand, allowing the drum {{to be removed from}} the deck for cleaning or replacement. To this date, the VX machines have been the only VCR designed with this feature.|$|R
50|$|Knurling is {{also used}} on the grips of darts and the footpegs of BMX bicycles. Aside from adding {{functionality}} to an object (valve repairs and hand grips being {{some of the most}} common), knurling also adds a decorative pattern to the material. The <b>knurled</b> <b>nut</b> is one such application, which uses a knurled finish instead of hexagonal or square edges which helps in tightening or loosening the nut without the use of a tool. The knurled surfaces provide enough grip to hold the nut between the thumb and forefinger. Hence it is also called a thumb nut. It is mainly used on small diameter bolts.Knurled nuts are typically used in electrical components, musical instruments and in automobiles.|$|R
50|$|The gun was {{designed}} {{with a long}} barrel (305mm) which featured a compensator and cooling fins. The replaceable barrel was held in by a <b>knurled</b> <b>nut,</b> but a design fault meant that the barrel could be fitted upside down (a famous picture exists {{of a member of}} the I.R.A. brandishing a Vigneron, with the foresight below the barrel). This fault was never corrected. Empty casings are ejected out of the ejection port on the right which has a hinged dust cover. This cover opens automatically when cocking the gun. If the gun is to be kept cocked in dusty conditions the cover can be manually closed after cocking to exclude dust and grit, and it will open automatically when the gun is fired.|$|R
5000|$|Presta {{valve stems}} are 6 mm in diameter, whereas Schrader valve stems for bicycle tires are 8 mm, thus {{requiring}} a larger diameter {{hole in a}} bicycle rim. While not a concern on wider bike rims, it will weaken a narrow wheel rim, precluding their use on (road) racing bicycles. Another disadvantage of the Schrader is that the air chuck must depress the spring-loaded pin before air can flow during inflation (and potentially introducing debris into the tube or the seal inside the valve), whereas the Presta valve relies on a small <b>knurled</b> <b>nut</b> to keep it shut. To fill up a bicycle tire with a Presta-valved tube {{at a gas station}} requires an adaptor, while a Schrader-valved tube does not. Bike riders also need to purchase Presta pumps, or more commonly the dual valve capable pumps for both Schrader and Presta valves. As of this point, most CO2 inflators are also Presta only, although some manufacturers are developing Schrader compatible inflator heads which use pressure to open the Schrader valve. Presta valves are also available in a wider variety of stem lengths for aero-bicycle rims. A removable core Presta valve has become common in many applications, specifically tubeless tires where the ability to introduce sealant into the tire through the stem is considered useful.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The current {{technique}} of human pancreas digestion for islet isolation relies on selective distribution of collagenase delivered via the pancreatic duct to produce digestion and removal of peri-acinar fibrous tissue. However, the collagenase has relatively {{little effect on}} the interlobular fibrous tissue, which must therefore be broken down by mechanical means within the digestion chamber so as to release the contained acini and islets. The current way of achieving this in the Ricordi chamber is to place five or six stainless steel balls within the chamber and shake vigorously. The shaking presumably breaks down the interlobular fibrous tissue by a combination of shear force induced by the movement of tissue through the shaking process, assisted by numerous blows from the steel balls. Intuitively, one would expect some islets would be destroyed rather than released by such a battering. METHODS: In an attempt to improve the efficiency of islet isolation we have designed a new digestion/filtration chamber that consists of a glass cylinder, sealed with Teflon plates holding in mesh filters at each end, secured in place by a central threaded tie-rod and external <b>knurled</b> <b>nuts.</b> A ring-shaped piston within the cylinder can be pushed up and down the travel by two rods passing out through sealed ports in the Teflon disk at one end and connected to an external handle. The handle is used to gently push the piston up and down the travel of the cylinder, which pushes the fluid and tissue through the central lumen of the ring-piston. A series of hooks attached to the central tie-rod catch the fibrous strands of the passing tissue; the shearing forces produced cause disruption by a process thought to be similar to teasing the tissue apart with fine forceps. RESULTS: A series of initial experiments with human pancreas showed the prototype to be too large, causing temperature control problems, and a redesigned smaller chamber was produced, maintaining the crucial design features. Experience processing five human pancreata has now demonstrated that in three of five pancreata the new chamber produced a good yield (> 200, 000 I. E.) of remarkably well separated and intact islets, the entire dispersion process being under 1 hour. However, in two isolations the collagenase digestion was poor, with few free islets. A copy of the new chamber (reserved for porcine work only) has been produced, as well as a copy of the Ricordi chamber. We have confirmed that the new chamber can isolate porcine islets in large numbers (> 5000 islets/g pancreas [n = 2], but note that pig islets are small). CONCLUSION: These preliminary studies are sufficiently encouraging to justify further direct comparison with the Ricordi chamber for the purpose of animal and human islet isolation...|$|R
40|$|Follow {{the steps}} below {{to install the}} Conifer Chamber, and read the {{operational}} considerations for information on configuring the LI- 6400 software to compute leaf temperature using energy balance. Figure 2. Unscrew the <b>knurled</b> adjustment <b>nut.</b> Installation The sensor head handle must be removed to accomodate the 6400 - 05, so a tripod is usually required for making measurements. 1. Remove the male end of the leaf temperature thermocouple connec-tor by pulling straight out, and pull the air hose from {{the underside of the}} leaf chamber. 2. Unplug the log switch (not used with the conifer chamber). If the log switch wires are threaded underneath the bottom cover of the sensor head, this cover must be removed to free the log switch con-nector. a. Turn the sensor head over and remove the 3 Phillips head screws as shown in Figure 1. b. Remove the hose barbs, if necessary. You may be able to slide the cover out from underneath the hose barbs; be careful not to damage the PC board under the cover. If you remove the hose barbs, be sure and note the position of the sample and reference air hoses; the sample hose is wrapped with a piece of black shrink wrap. c. Free the wires. d. Re-assemble the cover {{on the bottom of the}} sensor head. 3. Remove the handle assembly: a. Unscrew the knurled leaf chamber adjustment nut (turn clock-wise) until it is free of the handle (Figure 2). b. With the handle latching mechanism in the closed position, wrap tape or string around the handle (where your hand would nor-mally be) so that it will stay together. Failure to do so may result in the spring coming out. Leave the handle secured in this manner. c. Remove the 2 screws (3 on some instruments) on the back side of the handle, as shown in Figure 3, using a # 1 Phillips head screwdriver. Figure 1. Remove the 3 screws on the sensor head bottom cover...|$|R
