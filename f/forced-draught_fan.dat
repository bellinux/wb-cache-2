25|$|Andes {{made her}} final three cruises {{in the first}} half of 1971. All were winter cruises in the Atlantic: the first to South and West Africa, the second to Rio de Janeiro and the third to the Caribbean. Passengers could take either one cruise or two or three of them in succession. But Andes was {{becoming}} unreliable. On the first cruise she twice suffered boiler trouble. When in Cape Town she stayed on for boiler repairs, after which she was three days late. On the second cruise the drive shaft for the <b>forced-draught</b> <b>fan</b> to Andes central boiler sheared, and as she left Rio de Janeiro her steering gear failed. On the third cruise, in the Caribbean, Andes had both boiler and engine trouble and ended up a day late.|$|E
50|$|In 1951 Oliver Bulleid was {{the chief}} {{mechanical}} engineer of the Córas Iompair Éireann and was experimenting with new forms of steam locomotive. He converted a 1907 Coey locomotive to use a Franco-Crosti boiler similar to the original Italian designs and to burn peat. The locomotive was a poor steamer and eventually was fitted with a <b>forced-draught</b> <b>fan</b> powered by a diesel engine carried on a wagon behind the tender.|$|E

50|$|The former Great Southern and Western Railway class K3 2-6-0 {{locomotive}} number 356, {{built by}} the North British Locomotive Company as an 0-6-0 in 1903 and subsequently re{{built by the}} GS&WR, was converted into a testbed for the turf-burning project. Modifications to 356 included a new firebox, fitted with tuyeres, and two Crosti-type feedwater heaters, one {{on either side of}} the main boiler, which used heat from exhaust gases to heat boiler feedwater. Preheating coils were also located in the tender's water tank, and the chimney was positioned at the rear of the tender. Turf was fed to the firebox via an auger; there was no means of regulating this process. Steaming trials with the modified 356 began in 1952. Difficulties with steaming led to the addition of a <b>forced-draught</b> <b>fan,</b> which was mounted on a wagon behind the tender and driven by a Leyland bus engine. The results of trials with 356 were mixed, and the locomotive was broken up in 1957; however, some of the concepts were incorporated into CC1.|$|E
