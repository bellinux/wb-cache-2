5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} to construct all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special {{case in which the}} crossing angle is zero for all three given circles. Another generalization is the dual of the first extension, namely, to construct circles with three specified tangential <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> the three given circles.|$|E

5|$|The planned advance {{into the}} Judean Hills would {{rely heavily on}} the ability of the lines of {{communications}} to keep the front line troops supplied with food, water and ammunition. These were already operating at considerable <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> the railhead and base areas, and as a result the advance was forced to pause on 17 November to enable supplies to be brought forward by columns under corps control, which had been sent back to railhead for rations and supplies.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This {{may be due to}} shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar in visible light.|$|E

5|$|Instead {{of solving}} {{for the two}} hyperbolas, Newton {{constructs}} their directrix lines instead. For any hyperbola, the ratio of <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle {{can be defined as}} the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton (1687) refined van Roomen's solution, so {{that the}} solution-circle centers were located at the intersections of a line with a circle. Newton formulates Apollonius' problem as a problem in trilateration: to locate a point Z from three given points A, B and C, such that the {{differences}} in <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> Z to the three given points have known values. These four points correspond {{to the center of}} the solution circle (Z) and the centers of the three given circles (A, B and C).|$|E
5|$|Regardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began. Opposition {{from the}} North Vietnamese was {{light and the}} primary problem that {{hampered}} the advance was continual heavy morning cloud cover that slowed the pace of helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved out from their positions and began patrolling at greater <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> the base. Things heated up for the air cavalrymen on 6 April, when the 3rd Brigade encountered an NVA blocking force and fought a day-long engagement.|$|E

5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack stance that allows {{the use of an}} altered set of attacks for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion on the ground at varying <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> Necrid.|$|E
5|$|Supplies for {{the advance}} were transported over land and by sea {{but it was}} only with great {{difficulty}} that two infantry divisions of XXI Corps and three mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps were maintained in the advance at such <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> base. The Navy transported stores to the mouths of the Wadi Hesi and the Nahr Sukherier as these lines were secured. The railhead was being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, but did not reach Deir Suneid until 28 November. So it was a considerable distance over which the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps worked to bring up supplies.|$|E
5|$|Winds can shape landforms, via {{a variety}} of aeolian {{processes}} such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. Dust from large deserts can be moved great <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names {{in various parts of}} the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} exoplanets, Kepler-11d is named first for its host star, Kepler-11. Because Kepler-11d was {{announced}} {{at the same time}} as the five other planets in the system, their names are sorted by their <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> the host star; thus, because Kepler-11d is the third planet from Kepler-11, it was given the designation d. Kepler-11 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA Earth-trailing satellite purposed with discovering Earth-like planets in a small area of the sky between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra by observing planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The transit causes the star's brightness to dim slightly and at a regular rate, a phenomenon that the Kepler satellite notes till future study can prove or disprove the existence of a planetary body. Kepler-11d was flagged by Kepler-11, given the designation KOI-157.|$|E
5|$|In early 1925, Nurmi {{embarked}} on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January. His debut was {{a copy of his}} feats in Helsinki and Paris. Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances. Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances. He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; a half-mile race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich. Helffrich's victory ended Nurmi's 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> 800 m upwards. Although he hated losing more than anything, Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich. The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House. Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.|$|E
5|$|It {{was assumed}} {{at first that}} the lake existed in a single long {{interval}} between 1000-1500; however, later a succession of wet and dry phases was determined from radiocarbon dating. Each phase was stable for prolonged times. About three or four highstands were identified in the lake, one theory assumes four highstands between 695-1580. One chronology assumes these highstands occurred 100 BC - 600 AD, 900-1250 and 1300-1500. Six or five different cycles are documented in Coachella. At Superstition Mountain five lake cycles from 817-964, 1290-1330, 1440-1640, 1480-1660, 1638-1689 and 1675-1687 are documented; the 1440-1640 cycle may have consisted of four sub-cycles that occurred within short time <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> each other. An older highstand was observed at East Mesa and dated to 3,850 years before present. At least 12 different cycles of lake growth and lake shrinkage occurred over the last 2,000 - 3,000 years. Radiocarbon dates of the highstands range 300 ± 100 to 1,580 ± 200 before present. The basin was probably not entirely dry between the last three highstands. The Colorado River Delta shows evidence of reduced sedimentation while the river drained into Lake Cahuilla.|$|E
