5|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside the swell. At the summit is another view area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down. About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the swell, the San Rafael Reef.

In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone <b>exits</b> <b>the</b> courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Safety {{evacuation}} {{design is}} a key content for building fire safety design. In this paper, we apply the CAFE model to conduct an one-exit room simulation. And then we establish the regression equation of exit flow rate considering the factors of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> width, <b>the</b> size of the room, the location of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> and <b>the</b> pedestrian density. So as to find the effect of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location on <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate, we analyze the correlation of the two variables. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate of large room is easily affected by <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location. And it proves that <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate decreases {{with the increase of}} <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location. At last we study the probability distribution of the number of pedestrians evacuating through <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> and list some reasons why <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate decreases with <b>the</b> increasing <b>exit</b> width...|$|R

The route enters Barry's Bay, where it turns east and meets the southern leg of former Highway62, where a concurrency with it began prior to 1998.
