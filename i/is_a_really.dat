500|$|Marshall's wit is {{best remembered}} for a phrase he {{introduced}} to the American lexicon.

500|$|... "Sun of a Gun" [...] is a synth-pop and Europop {{song that}} lasts three minutes and twenty-five seconds. It is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of E minor using common time with a tempo of 133 beats per minute. It was written by Jimmy Harry and Nanna Øland Fabricius, while Dave McCracken served as the song's executive producer. The song was written while Oh Land was in Los Angeles. Lyrically, the song depicts a relationship by comparing it to the earth's orbit. In an interview with MTV News, Oh Land described its lyrics: [...] "It's a love story about being {{in a relationship with}} a person who's kind of destructive, but you keep coming back because you can't let it go". She further confirmed [...] "that it was also a metaphor for how we orbit around the sun". The singer ended with: [...] "The sun <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> beautiful thing: a sunset, a sunrise is spectacular. But it's also something we need to protect ourselves against, because it can burn you and it can be dangerous." ...|$|E

And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations. I just, my integrity as an artist just would not take that, could not take that." ...|$|E

That was very refreshing." [...] Fazekas discussed giving Jarvis a major character arc in the second season, saying that he [...] "really got a taste for adventure with Peggy in the first season, so, when she comes back into his life, he's so happy because he's so bored with being Howard Stark's butler ... what that starts <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> interesting story for him, which is, how much did he really understand about what Peggy does? For him, it's like a fun diversion, even though he's in danger ... we will see in Jarvis' story how he grows to understand that and where he comes out in the end. It will have a cost for him, and it {{will have an impact}} on his relationship with Peggy".|$|E

500|$|In 2006, {{he played}} Mark Thatcher in Coup!, a dramatisation of the {{attempted}} coup in Equatorial Guinea. He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios. He accepted the {{part because it}} was [...] "funny, plausible, plausibly absurd and cruel" [...] and he liked {{that it was a}} translation from an original French play. He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: [...] "Nick <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good actor and really good to work with in that you can have completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego-free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier. If there's only two of you in a play, you are equally responsible – there's nobody else to blame if it goes wrong. So its a greater risk and there's no hiding". At the end of the year, he appeared opposite Richard Wilson in Whipping it Up, a play about whips in a fictional David Cameron government. To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon.

When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on."

500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
