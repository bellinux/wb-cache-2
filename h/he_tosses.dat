He decides to perform a test to see if the wolf and his pet dog are one and the same; <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> a stick for the wolf to fetch, only to receive a giant bone instead. The boy shrugs this off and assumes that it is the same dog.|$|E

25|$|The slam of Cox's {{dressing}} room door awakens Box, who suddenly remembers his bacon. When {{he sees a}} mutton chop on the gridiron, he assumes it is Bouncer's, and throws it out the window, hitting a pedestrian outside. He once again puts the bacon on the fire, and goes to his {{dressing room}} to retrieve his breakfast utensils. The slam of Box’s dressing room door sends Cox scurrying back in, assuming it {{is the sound of}} someone knocking.

They can be seen when Frodo is {{captured}} by the orcs of Cirith Ungol and his mithril shirt leads to a confrontation between Shagrat, a Black Uruk of Mordor, and an orc from Minas Morgul called Gorbag. Gorbag threatens to stab Shagrat if he tries to steal the shirt, but <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> it aside and throws Gorbag down a long flight of stairs, where he falls on top of several other Uruk-hai. A huge brawl between orcs and Uruk-hai spreads all over the fortress, allowing Sam to enter the tower with ease.|$|E
25|$|Lisa {{protests that}} the Simpsons cannot accept the tobacco executives' money, but Homer misinterprets this {{statement}} and rejects the offer as insulting, demanding $150 billion for tomacco, which they refuse. Dumped {{back at the}} farmhouse, the family sees tomacco-addicted animals from other farms eating their crops. With only one plant left, the family runs into the house, where Lisa urges Homer to destroy it, but Homer refuses until the livestock breaks in. <b>He</b> <b>tosses</b> the plant {{into the air and}} it lands {{in the hands of a}} Laramie executive. The executives' helicopter leaves, but a tomacco-addicted sheep has sneaked on board and attacks them. The helicopter crashes, killing everyone on board except for the sheep and destroying the final tomacco plant. The Simpsons return home to find that the Southern gentleman and his wife are still waiting for Homer to go through the duel. Homer does and is shot in the arm, but declines to go to the hospital until after eating one of Marge's mincemeat pies.|$|E

500|$|The boy devotes {{himself to}} study, while {{distancing}} {{himself from the}} vices of his peers. [...] He embraces and then rejects religion, and a cross <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> to the floor trips and kills his mother. [...] He becomes a successful scientist, and in middle age marries and has two daughters, but is cold and indifferent to his family. [...] One by one he loses them: his wife dies after {{having an affair with}} a musician, one daughter falls into depression when her labor-organizer lover is framed and hanged for murder, and the other daughter falls in love with a man who pimps her to others. [...] Driven insane by the loss of all who were close to him, he equips himself with the forbidden drum to play music with a leering piper who has roamed his grounds for years.|$|E
500|$|After work, the {{employees}} {{arrive at an}} Italian restaurant named Louie Volpe's to celebrate the Dundies. Moments after being introduced, Deangelo disappears into the bathroom to vomit. Eventually, Michael is able to psych him up, and the show begins. The show continues to go poorly, with most of Michael's jokes offending more than amusing {{the employees}}. Dwight wins the [...] "Promising Assistant Manager" [...] Dundie, but as he is still mad at Michael for not recommending he replace Michael, <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> his award in the trash. Erin wins the [...] "Cutest Redhead" [...] award and gives a speech in which she breaks up with Gabe, who takes the stage to protest, then leaves in humiliation.

The staff urges {{him to make a}} speech, but as he nervously tries to yell over his Walkman, the ceremony is kicked out of the restaurant. Michael is upset that his last Dundies Award show was a disappointment, but the staff convinces him to continue the event at the office.|$|E
500|$|Tales {{of extreme}} {{sensitivity}} are infrequent in world culture {{but a few}} have been recorded. The 11th-century Kathasaritsagara by Somadeva tells {{of a young man}} who claims to be especially fastidious about beds. After sleeping in a bed on top of seven mattresses, and newly made with clean sheets, the young man rises in great pain. A crooked red mark is discovered on his body, and upon investigation a hair is found on the bottom-most mattress of the bed. [...] An Italian tale called [...] "The Most Sensitive Woman" [...] tells of a woman whose foot is bandaged after a jasmine petal falls upon it. The Brothers Grimm included a [...] "Princess on the Pea" [...] tale in an edition of their Kinder- und Hausmärchen, but removed it after they discovered that it belonged to the Danish literary tradition. A few folk tales feature a boy discovering a pea or a bean assumed to be of great value. After the boy enters a castle and is given a bed of straw for the night <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> and turns in his sleep, attempting to guard his treasure. Some observers are persuaded that the boy is restless because he is unaccustomed to sleeping on straw, and is therefore of aristocratic blood.|$|E

500|$|... (1984) {{continues}} where Part III leaves off, with Jason (Ted White) {{found by}} the police and taken to the local morgue after removing the axe. Upon arrival, Jason kills the coroner and a nurse before returning to Crystal Lake. A group of friends rent a house on Crystal Lake and fall victim to Jason's rampage. After killing the teens, Jason seeks out Trish (Kimberly Beck) and Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman), who live next door. While distracted by Trish, Jason is attacked and killed by Tommy. [...] (1985) follows Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd), who was committed to a mental health institution after the events of The Final Chapter and grew up constantly afraid that Jason (Tom Morga) would return.

Tommy, supervisor Pam (Melanie Kinnaman), and a young boy named Reggie (Shavar Ross) manage to defeat Roy. They eventually learn that Roy had a son who was murdered by one of the patients at the institution, triggering Roy to take on Jason's likeness and kill everyone there. [...] (1986) begins with Tommy (Thom Mathews) visiting Jason's grave after being released from another mental institution. Tommy inadvertently resurrects Jason (C. J. Graham) with a piece of the fence surrounding the cemetery acting as a lightning rod. Jason immediately heads back to Crystal Lake and kills the people working at the new summer camp. Tommy eventually chains Jason to a boulder that <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> into the lake, where he leaves Jason to die.|$|E

[...] Nick Catucci of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "On Watching Movies, <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> in a chain saw: punch-drunk slow-and-arty beats he produced with Diplo, Flying Lotus and his pal Earl Sweatshirt.

2500|$|In the {{original}} Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman's personality is rough and aggressive. The character often attacks and terrorizes wife beaters, profiteers, lynch mobs, and gangsters {{in a rough}} manner and with a looser moral code than audiences today might be used to. Superman in the comics of the 1930s is unconcerned about the harm his strength may cause. <b>He</b> <b>tosses</b> villainous characters {{in such a manner}} that fatalities would presumably occur, although these are seldom shown explicitly on the page. This came to an end in late 1940 when new editor Whitney Ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, banning Superman from ever killing. The character was softened and given a sense of humanitarianism. Ellsworth's code, however, is {{not to be confused with}} [...] "the Comics Code", which was created in 1954 by the Comics Code Authority and ultimately abandoned by every major comic book publisher by the early 21st century.|$|E

2500|$|At the Pawn shop, Gold {{is looking}} in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace.

When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab and Jekyll is left unconscious, but the ambush does leave a splatter of the serum, prompting Gold to steal Jekyll’s heart, then pours the serum onto his dagger that will be useful in killing Hyde. [...] As Gold leaves, <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> Jekyll’s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.|$|E
2500|$|For this event, about 2,000 people participate, {{many of them}} {{soldiers}} from the Battle of Puebla reenactment. The young people who play the couple are chosen each year. This action takes place {{in front of the}} municipal palace, which stands in as the corregidor’s home. One of the generals plays the role of the corregidor. The daughter receives three messages from the bandit. The bandit enters the scene to music, fireworks and musket fire. The daughter is waits for him on the balcony, already dressed in white. The bandit then climbs up to the balcony, subdues the soldiers guarding her and takes her down to his horse. Just before doing so, however, <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> large amounts of play money to the crowds yelling “Viva la plata” (Long live money (lit. silver)). The couple escapes on his horse as one group of soldiers pursue {{and the rest of the}} soldiers fire at the pursuers. [...] At three pm, a priest marries Lorenzo and the daughter. However, the story does not have a happy ending. At four pm is the “quema del jacal” (burning of the shack). This is the burning of a small shack made of palm fronds at one end of the plaza. It represents the house of the bandit with the couple inside. The legend has been interpreted as the hopes for equality among Mexico’s social classes after its Independence as the daughter is of the elite and the bandit is poor. The shack is also interpreted as the various wars of Mexico from the “flower wars” of the Mesoamerican era up through much of the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Quan Chi's {{signature}} special move {{since his}} MK4 debut {{has been his}} [...] "Skull Ball", a glowing, green skull-shaped blast of energy that he shoots at his opponents; it was waist-high and impossible to duck in MK4, but reduced to life-sized in future installments. Alex Vo of GameSpy considered his specials in Armageddon to be [...] "decent", but his Escrima fighting style could lead into [...] "lengthy attacks which ... can take out more than 20% of a life bar." [...] Quan Chi was unlockable in MK2011 after completing the story mode; Mitchell Saltzman of GameFront described Quan Chi therein as capable of [...] "frustrating players with his long, drawn out, and damaging combos", while his [...] "Teleport Stomp" [...] maneuver—present in every game except Deadly Alliance and renamed [...] "Sky Drop" [...] in the reboot—was best used against opposing players who overused projectile attacks. In Quan Chi's [...] "X-Ray" [...] attack, his opponents injure themselves, starting with smashing their own head with a hard skull-shaped object <b>he</b> <b>tosses</b> at them, followed by a self-inflicted neckbreaker. According to Prima Games, Quan Chi {{was one of the}} weakest characters in MK2011, with at least half of their test matches with him won against just three other characters, for a poor 38% overall victory rate. Bryan Dawson of Prima Games listed Quan Chi in his 2014 selection of the [...] "cheapest" [...] Mortal Kombat characters, as he had [...] "80-percent-damage combos if [...] land a hit and have enough meter to burn." [...] In Mortal Kombat X, Quan Chi's three gameplay variations are [...] "Summoner", which allows him to summon a demonic bat to use in offensive attacks; [...] "Sorcerer" [...] allows Quan Chi to create three distinct magical fields, and [...] "Warlock" [...] allows him more combos with portals.|$|E
