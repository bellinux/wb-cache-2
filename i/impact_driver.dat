40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{has been}} {{successfully}} used as an environmental assessment tool {{for the development of}} ecologically sustainable products. The application of LCA in the early design stage has been constrained by the requirement of large amounts of data and time for carrying out the assessment. In addition, the complexity of LCA causes further difficulties for product developers. In order to integrate the environmental assessment into the process of product development, this research proposes an integrated decision model for sustainable product development and a simplified LCA approach for the application in the early stage of product design. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it incorporates the environmental aspects of product development into the existing product development framework. It enables designers {{to strike a balance between}} the product’s environmental performance and other traditional design objectives. The simplified LCA approach is based on the concept and application of Environmental <b>Impact</b> <b>Drivers.</b> Material-based environmental <b>impacts</b> and Energy-based environmental impacts are used to predict the total environmental impact of a product. Two sets of <b>impact</b> <b>drivers</b> were developed accordingly. The Material-based <b>Impact</b> <b>Drivers</b> were identified by classifying materials into 16 groups according to the nature of the materials and their environmental performance. Energy-based <b>Impact</b> <b>Drivers</b> were developed for various energy sources in major industrial regions. Product LCA cases were used to verify the proposed methods. The results computed by the application of the <b>impact</b> <b>drivers</b> were compared with the results of full LCA studies. It is concluded that with the proposed approach, the product’s environmental performance can be assessed in a very short time and with very basic data input requirements and acceptable accuracy...|$|R

50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the <b>impact</b> <b>driver</b> down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square socket head screws that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot head screws and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{applications}} use {{air driven}} or {{electric impact wrench}} or <b>impact</b> <b>driver</b> to deliver the amount of shock and torque required to tighten or loosen the different bolts or nuts in use. Inside an impact wrench there is a rotating hammer, usually driven by electricity or air pressure, {{that is used to}} incrementally rotate the output shaft. The impact wrench is designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft via a hammering action. While typical impact wrenches deliver between 500 and 1500 ft-lbs of torque, some larger impact wrenches such as the Ingersoll Rand 599A1 can deliver near 80,000 ft-lb (10850 Nm) of torque which is enough to tighten hex nuts 7" [...] across flats. Even if the socket attached to the impact wrench does not turn, it is still subjected to successive shock blows by the impact wrench's internal hammer(s). These successive blows are often enough to loosen or tighten a tight or corroded nut or bolt or in some cases break or strip the fastener. Impact wrenches are hard on the sockets since the sockets in use also get hammered. Regular chrome plated [...] "hand sockets" [...] like those commonly included with hand ratchet wrench tool sets are not suitable for this kind of high load impact application. Hand sockets, when used with an impact wrench, can break or shatter explosively if they are used with an impact wrench. Impact sockets are specifically designed and manufactured for impact gun use, and are nearly always made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel that is then heat treated for extra durability. Most impact sockets made for [...] "standard" [...] hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design. For more flexibility many impact sockets are made with swivel type socket—socket wrench attachment geometry. These impact sockets are rarely, if ever, chrome-plated, as chrome will chip off under impact use, and the process of chrome plating hardened steel causes some hydrogen embrittlement which can cause parts to crack. Instead, impact sockets are most commonly finished with a black oxide surface or other conversion treatment to provide some corrosion and rust protection and improved appearance even after hard impact wrench use. Although ordinary hand sockets should never be used with impact wrenches, impact sockets can be used with hand socket wrenches and other hand drivers.|$|E

40|$|Wet and rainy {{conditions}} <b>impact</b> <b>driver,</b> vehicle, and roadway. These effects cause {{a reduction}} in speed or density (car-following headway) or both which, in turn, cause {{a reduction in}} highway capacity. This paper is a synthesis of 26 studies relating wet conditions to speed and capacity. If the results from all reviewed studies after 1980 with original data from freeways are averaged assuming equal weights, then, the average speed reduction is 4. 7 mph in light rain (11 studies) HCM 2000 suggests 6. 0 mph {{which is similar to}} FHWAs 10 % reduction and 19. 6 mph in heavy rain (2 studies) HCM 2000 suggests 12. 0 mph which is higher than FHWAs 16 % reduction. The average capacity reduction is 8. 4 % in light rain (7 studies) and 20. 0 % in heavy rain (1 study). The impact of rainy conditions on highway capacity is important. Much additional research is needed for reducing the wide variance of observations in past studies. A methodology is needed for capacity and LOS analysis of freeways, intersections and arterials that accounts for wet conditions as part of typical conditions. ...|$|E
