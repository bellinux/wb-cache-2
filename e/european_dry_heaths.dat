50|$|Beinn a Ghlò {{has such}} a {{diversity}} of flora {{that it has been}} declared a SSSI and a SAC over an area of 80 square kilometres. It is a region of <b>European</b> <b>dry</b> <b>heaths</b> and there are many species of alpine and marsh plants on the mountain such as the rare yellow oxytropis (Oxytropis campestris), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), rock speedwell (Veronica fruticans), rock sedge (Carex rupestris) and green spleenwort (Asplenium viride).|$|E
50|$|The Woolmer Forest Special Area of Conservation (SAC) was {{designated}} in April 2005 and covers 666.68 ha. Its main habitats are heath (62%), coniferous woodland (22%) and dry grassland (10%). Its most important features are the dystrophic areas of open water, in particular Cranmer Pond, a shallow 8 ha pool {{thought to have}} been created by peat cutting, and Woolmer Pond; and large extents of <b>European</b> <b>dry</b> <b>heaths.</b> In both cases the area {{is considered one of the}} best in the UK. In addition, the SAC supports a significant presence of North Atlantic wet heaths with Erica Tetralix, and transition mires and quaking bogs.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{habitats}} {{are continuing}} to deteriorate in Europe with {{an increasing number of}} wild species which are also seriously threatened. Consequently, a coherent European ecological network (Natura 2000) for conservation of natural habitats and the wild fauna and flora (Council Directive 92 / 43 /EEC) was created. Even so, there is currently no standardized methodology for surveillance and assessment of habitats, a lack that it is particularly problematic for those habitats occupying large areas (heathlands, forests, dunes, wetlands) and which require a great deal of effort to be monitored. In this paper we evaluate the changes affecting the <b>European</b> <b>dry</b> <b>heaths</b> (Nat- 2000 4030) from the SCI Os Ancares–O Courel (Galicia, NW Spain) during the past decade. High-resolution aerial imagery analyses and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used. Losses of more than 7, 000 ha (20. 3 %) of <b>European</b> <b>dry</b> <b>heaths</b> were computed during the 2003 – 2011 period in the SCI Os Ancares–O Courel, and also an increase of the degree of fragmentation was demonstrated for this habitat. Paradoxically, major impacts (afforestations, pasturelands) were financed by agri-environmental funds from the EU. Rather than promote biodiversity, these activities have provoked serious damages in this habitat of community interest, which is in complete opposition to the objectives of protection involved in the declaration of the SCI Os Ancares–O Courel...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Many {{natural and}} {{semi-natural}} vegetation communities {{are sensitive to}} eutrophication; most eutrophication is caused by human activities. Critical loads have been developed in Europe to provide an effects-based approach to pollutant abatement including nitrogen deposition. Critical loads to protect ecosystems from eutrophication from excess nitrogen are only specified for very broad habitat types (eg "dry heaths") and as a range of values (eg between 10 and 20 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1). There may be considerable variation in vegetation communities within a broad habitat {{and there is a}} requirement (eg. from conservation agencies etc.) for more precise critical loads for more clearly specified receptors (habitats, vegetation communities). This paper demonstrates the use of Endorsement Theory to rationalise incomplete, qualitative and conflicting information on abiotic parameters (eg, climate, management) that may influence the vegetation response to nitrogen deposition and hence the critical loads. The results are shown for 22 heaths described in the National Vegetation Classification, identifying whether the critical load should be nearer the upper or lower limit of the published ranges. The policy implications for critical loads exceedance for <b>European</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>Heaths</b> are also discussed...|$|E

500|$|Like {{most other}} proteaceae, B.oblongifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter.

40|$|Moorland {{habitats}} {{dominated by}} the dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris provide important ecosystem services. Drought is projected to intensify throughout their range, potentially leading to increased fire severity as moisture is a key control on severity. We studied the effect of low fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire severity by using 2 × 2 m rain-out shelters prior to completing 19 experimental fires in two sites in Scotland (UK) : a <b>dry</b> <b>heath</b> with thin organic soils and a raised bog with deep, saturated peat, both dominated by Calluna vulgaris. Reduced FMC of the moss and litter (M/L) layer at both sites, and the soil moisture of the <b>dry</b> <b>heath,</b> increased fire-induced consumption of the M/L layer and soil heating at both sites. Increase in fire severity was greater at the <b>dry</b> <b>heath</b> than at the raised bog, e. g. average maximum temperatures at the soil surface increased from 31 °C to 189 °C at the <b>dry</b> <b>heath,</b> but only from 10 °C to 15 °C at the raised bog. Substantial M/L layer consumption was observed when its FMC was below 150 %. This led to larger seasonal and daily soil temperature fluctuation, particularly at the <b>dry</b> <b>heath</b> during warm months. The results suggest that low FMC following predicted changes in climate are likely to increase wildfire severity and that the impact on vegetation composition and carbon stores may be greater at heathlands than at peatlands. Managed burning aiming to minimise fire severity (e. g. ignition of the M/L layer and exposure to lethal temperatures of ericoid seeds) should be carried out when the FMC of the M/L layer is above 150 % and the FMC of the soil is above 200 – 300 %...|$|R

40|$|Question: Are {{differences}} in landscape use of semi-domesticated reindeer {{reflected in the}} vegetation of summer grazing grounds? Location: Alpine heaths, central east Sweden. Methods: <b>Dry</b> <b>heath</b> and grass heath vegetation plots with inferred grazing intensities (high, intermediate and low) were selected a priori from an interpolated pellet count map compiled in 2002. In each plot, faecal pellets were counted, environmental variables measured and vegetation sampled by listing presence and absence. Species composition was compared with a detrended correspondence analysis, and a canonical correspondence {{analysis was used to}} infer relations between species composition and environmental variables. Plots were also clustered to provide groupings for an indicator species analysis. Results: Significant {{differences in}} faecal pellet count were present between the highest and lowest grazing intensities for both vegetation types, showing that the pattern in the interpolated pellet maps was robust. Differences in species composition between grazing intensities were found for the <b>dry</b> <b>heath</b> only. Here, there was an apparent grazing gradient, with lichens and mosses in the low-use plots and grasses and herbs in the high-use plots. No such gradient was found for the grass heath. Conclusions: Within the <b>dry</b> <b>heath</b> vegetation type, grazing levels had a subtle effect on the vegetation, while no effects were seen in the grass heath, probably {{as a result of the}} dominance of more grazing-tolerant graminoids. Even in the <b>dry</b> <b>heath,</b> species richness did not differ between grazing levels, but the relative abundances of species differed...|$|R
