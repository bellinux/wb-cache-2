50|$|Misselden's {{economic}} writings were prompted {{mainly by}} {{the appointment of}} the standing commission on trade (1622). In his Free Trade, or the Means to make Trade flourish, London, 1622, he discussed {{the causes of the}} alleged decay of trade, which he attributed to excessive consumption of foreign commodities, exportation of bullion by the East India Company, and defective searching in the cloth trade. His object appears to have been to disarm the opposition to the regulated companies, especially the Merchant Adventurers', and turn it against the <b>joint-stock</b> <b>associations.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Act {{requires}} {{demand on}} the corporation for a shareholder derivative action. The {{standard of care}} required for indemnification of a director is changed from a subjective standard to an objective reasonableness standard. In order {{to be entitled to}} mandatory indemnification, a director must be wholly successful in his or her defense of the action. Only disinterested directors may vote to authorize indemnification. A corporation may enter into contracts to indemnify or to advance funds. The Act provides that corporate officers are subject to the same standards as directors regarding indemnification issues. Advances for expenses may be authorized by a majority vote of disinterested directors or, if none are available, by a vote of all the directors or of the disinterested shareholders. The Act permits corporations to merge with limited liability companies and nonprofit corporations, as well as <b>joint-stock</b> <b>associations</b> or limited partnerships; either of the merging entities may be the surviving corporation. The Act also provides for the survival of remedies and rights of a dissolved corporation for the a period of two years after dissolution. hmt...|$|R

50|$|In 1908 the <b>Joint-Stock</b> <b>Association</b> of Wool Products {{owned by}} Frederick Wilhelm Schweikert bought a plot at 223 Wólczańska Street {{of the area}} more than 10 000 m2. Around 1910, a five-storey factory depot {{building}} was erected on the plot. According to the initial assumptions, {{it was to be}} 21 meters wide and about 43 meters long. During the extension in 1913, the building was elongated by nearly 18 meters on the eastern side. Moreover, a tower with a water tank at the top was built in the north-east corner. Nowadays the building is 22 m wide and 100 m long.A few years ago the building and its interior were revitalized and adapted to the needs of a library: floors, window and door woodwork were replaced, ceilings were reinforced, and the interior was converted. The revitalisation design was developed at Autorska Pracownia Projektowa ARTA Sp. z o.o. The formal opening of Library's building was in 2004.|$|E

60|$|Besides the {{controlling}} council or local sub-Parliament, local business has its executive department. With respect to this, {{the same questions}} arise as {{with respect to the}} executive authorities in the state, and they may, for the most part, be answered in the same manner. The principles applicable to all public trusts are in substance the same. In the first place, each executive officer should be single, and singly responsible for the whole of the duty committed to his charge. In the next place, he should be nominated, not elected. It is ridiculous that a surveyor, or a health officer, or even a collector of rates should be appointed by popular suffrage. The popular choice usually depends on interest with a few local leaders, who, as they are not supposed to make the appointment, are not responsible for it; or on an appeal to sympathy, founded on having twelve children, and having been a rate-payer in the parish for thirty years. If, in cases of this description, election by the population is a farce, appointment by the local representative body is little less objectionable. Such bodies have a perpetual tendency to become <b>joint-stock</b> <b>associations</b> for carrying into effect the private jobs of their various members. Appointments should be made on the individual responsibility of the chairman of the body, let him be called mayor, chairman of Quarter Sessions, or by whatever other title. He occupies in the locality a position analogous to that of the prime minister in the state, and under a well organized system the appointment and watching of the local officers would be {{the most important part of}} his duty; he himself being appointed by the council from its own number, subject either to annual re-election, or to removal by a vote of the body.|$|R

5000|$|By 1836-37 Laffitte had his affairs {{sufficiently}} {{in order}} to revive his 1825 plan for the Commanditaire. He created (15 July 1837) the Caisse Générale du Commerce et de l'Industrie to help provide long-term credit for industrial enterprise. The commandite rather than the <b>joint-stock</b> form of <b>association</b> was employed. The venture was capitalized at 55 million francs. The Bank of France imposed some annoying restrictions (the term [...] "Banque" [...] could not be employed), but otherwise the venture's approval went forward successfully. Laffitte's principal associates were his brother, Martin Laffitte (1783-1840), and the sugar industrialist François Lebaudy (1799-1863). Was this company the prototype for the great joint-stock investment banks {{of the second half}} of the 19th century in France? Historians continue to research and ponder this question. Laffitte himself appears to have understood that the Caisse Générale did not fulfill his dream of a real [...] "banque d'affaires." [...] He wrote in his Mémoires: [...] "If I was never able to create a great credit establishment like the one I would have wished, I at least built a great banking house that will be useful to Commerce and my family for a long time. That's a manly enough achievement for a 70-year old. Although others after me succeed in creating great credit establishments, for me there will remain the pride in having tried." ...|$|R
