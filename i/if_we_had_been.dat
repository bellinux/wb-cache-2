Mrs. Binney acted as <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years; and, {{being the first}} London lady with whom I {{had the pleasure of}} acquaintance, I saw in her what I have since seen in English people of all ranks, who are really genteel - a most skilful and yet an indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at case with them. I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E

500|$|Neither brother married. Wilbur once quipped {{that he did}} {{not have}} time for both a wife and an airplane. Following a brief {{training}} flight he gave to a German pilot in Berlin in June 1911, Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, [...] "When we think what we might have accomplished <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose." [...] Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters. Wilbur urged American cities to emulate the European – particularly Parisian – philosophy of apportioning generous public space near every important public building. He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would [...] "come home white".|$|E

2500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} of her choice {{to go through}} with the procedure, Casali said: [...] "Milo is here because of the love of his mother and father. If that is judged wrong, the world has lost its sense of proportion. We tried to have a baby by artificial insemination before Roberto died. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> successful, Milo would have been conceived during matrimony. What difference does it make that the conception occurred after Roberto's death?" [...] The press focused on Milo for much of his early life, reporting on 'milestones' such as his first birthday and first day at school. After his mother's death, Milo revealed: [...] "Mum collected all the newspaper articles I appeared in." ...|$|E

At last he said, “I might, anyhow, find out in a rough sort of way whether <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> blown north or south. <b>We</b> will see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can find a {{perfectly}} straight stick, ten or twelve feet long. If I fix that upright in sand the shadow would help us. It was the 25th of March yesterday, and the sun at noon would therefore be exactly overhead of the line at twelve o’clock. Therefore, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> blown north, <b>we</b> should get a very short shadow to the south at twelve o’clock; whereas <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> blown south, {{there would be a}} shadow north. It might not be more than an inch long; but even that would tell us something.” ...|$|R

"Even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deceived in the girl," [...] she said, thoughtfully--"even if {{she were}} {{disposed}} to flirt with other men--even then {{there might be a}} stronger motive than ever for her wishing to get rid of Abbott.

6000|$|My dear friends, {{this is the}} {{heaven for}} which we are all to strive--a heaven of goodness, wherein God dwells. And {{therefore}} an eternal and everlasting heaven, as eternal as goodness and as eternal as God himself; and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are living in it, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> all <b>we</b> need. But we may begin to live in it here. To what particular place our souls go after death, Scripture does not tell us, and we need not know. To what particular place our souls and bodies go after the resurrection, Scripture tells us not, and we need not know. But this Scripture tells us, and that is enough for us, {{that they will be}} in heavenly places, in the presence of Christ and of God. And this Scripture tells us--and indeed our own conscience and reason tell us likewise-- that though death may alter our place, it cannot alter our character; though it may alter the circumstances round us, it cannot alter ourselves. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> good and pure before death, we shall be good and pure after death. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> led and inspired by God's Spirit before death, so shall we <b>be</b> after death. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in heavenly places before death, thinking heavenly thoughts, feeling heavenly feelings, and doing heavenly deeds, then we shall be in heavenly places after death; for <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> with us the Spirit of God, whose presence is heaven; and as long as we are holy, good, pure, unselfish, just, and merciful, we may be persuaded, with St. Paul, that wheresoever we go, all will be well; for 'neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' ...|$|R
