40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the dynamics of an arterial first pass gadolinium (Gd) contrast medium (CM) bolus at the descending aorta (DAo), depending on various saline <b>flush</b> and Gd <b>volumes.</b> Using an ultra-fast two- dimensional GE-sequence (Siemens Vision®, 1. 5 -T), 200 sequential cross-sectional images of the addressed vessel (1 slice/s) were obtained. Several saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> (15 mL, 30 mL, and 60 mL) were applied following the administration of 10 mL Gd (single dose) {{to a group of}} 4 normal volunteers (body weight 50 – 55 kg) using a mechanical MR injector (injection rate = 3. 0 mL/s). Additionally, when performing a second test series, the saline volume remained constant, while the Gd volumes were varied from half doses to triple doses (5, 10, 20, and 30 mL Gd were given to every volunteer of the group). The signal intensity versus time (SI/T) curve at a measured region of interest (ROI) within the DAo was calculated. The bolus arrival time (BAT), the maximal signal-to-noise ratio (SNRmax), the bolus time length (BL; 75 and 80 maximum intensity duration), the slope of the SI/T curve, and the areas below the SI/T curve for both the 80 and 75 maximum intensity duration level (INT 80 and INT 75) were calculated. The increase of saline <b>flush</b> <b>volume</b> from 30 to 60 mL caused significant bolus lengthening of approximately 50 (mean BL = 9. 5 s, 10. 3 s, and 15. 4 s for 15 mL, 30 mL, and 60 mL saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes,</b> respectively, measured as SI/T duration at the 75 SNRmax level). Using saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> equal to or higher than 30 mL increased the slope of the SI/T curve. A continuous increase of INT 75 / 80 by using higher saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> was found. Different saline and Gd volumes did not affect the SNRmax and the BAT. Only the low dose (0. 05 mmol/kg Gd) showed a 17 – 21. 6 significantly lower SNRmax. The BL and the INT increased mainly by enlarging of applied Gd volume from single to double dose (BL 75 and INT 75 were 9. 6 s and 1305, 12. 3 s and 2121, 38. 5 s and 6181, 37. 8 s and 6613 for 5, 10, 20, and 30 mL applied Gd volume, respectively). The arterial bolus length benefits from increasing Gd and saline <b>flush</b> <b>volumes</b> due to increased venous bolus length and wash out effects of Gd within the injection site of the vein. Doses larger than a single dose are not needed to increase the SNR in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography images of the thoracic aorta...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{relation}} between contrast medium (CM) application and sequence parameters will be discussed with respect to clinical use of the contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) in the peripheral vessel region. The adjustment of the sequence parameters, the CM application timing and the bolus geometry is necessary for an effective use of CE-MRA. Investigation protocols for several vascular regions differ mainly corresponding to varying fields of view and slab thickness. Restrictions of increasing the measurement time are expected in peripherally localized vessels if fast arteriovenous transit time occurs. The vessel contrast depends from (1) optimal CM bolus timing and (2) bolus geometry defined by {{the parameters of the}} intravenous bolus injection (flow rate, dose and NaCl <b>flush</b> <b>volume).</b> Our study results have shown that the bolus remains compact but also shorter if a higher flow rate is being applied at equal dose. The enlargement of the NaCl <b>flush</b> <b>volume</b> has evidently caused an increased intraarterial CM concentration and a slightly bolus lengthening. The exact timing regimen requires an automated mechanical CM injection pump. In most countries, a total dose of 0. 3 mmol/kg Gd is allowed for application during one investigation. Therefore, obtaining an angiogram of the entire iliac and leg region this total dose must be separated. 0. 1 mmol/kg {{for each of the three}} measurements can be recommended. Otherwise, using this lower CM dose results in less spatial resolution. At least a dosage of 0. 2 mmol/kg Gd is necessary to achieve a higher spatial resolution. The calculation of CM dosage should be also related to the dedicated vessel region of interest than to the body weight only...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} assessment as {{to water}} consumption in WC cisterns {{has contributed to}} the development of flushing system technologies, which allow smaller <b>flushing</b> <b>volumes.</b> The purpose of this work is to assess the performance of the the low water consumption requirement of WC cisterns with dual flushing system (6 / 3 L), when compared to 6 L <b>flushing</b> <b>volume</b> WC cisterns in multifamily buildings. The research methodology consisted of a case study in a multifamily residential building with submetering system, by monitoring the total water consumption and the two flushing systems using water meters installed in WC cisterns. By means of a mathematical model, a comparison of the design flowrate in the main branch was carried out considering the two types of WC cisterns. The results indicated that the water consumption in the 6 L WC cistern was 20 % in relation to the total domestic consumption, whereas the water consumption observed in the dual-flush WC cistern (6 / 3 L) was 16 %. The dual flushing system (6 / 3 L) presented about 18 % consumption reduction impact as compared to the 6 L system. The design flowrate values in the main branch, obtained by the mathematical model, were 0. 35 L/s for systems with 6 L WC cistern and 0. 34 L/s with dual-flush WC cistern (6 / 3 L), that is, a reduction of similar to 3 %. Practical application: The knowledge of the performance in field of dual-flush WC cistern contributes to industry to improve this system and to users to aid their choice of technologies aimed at water conservation, and so assisting to the development of sustainable buildings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The optimum {{protocol}} for expander <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{with respect to}} the timing and application of radiotherapy remains controversial. Methods Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups. Metallic port integrated anatomic breast expanders of 250 cc were implanted on the back of each animal and controlled expansion was performed. Group I underwent radiotherapy with full expanders while in Group II, expanders were partially deflated immediately prior to radiotherapy. Control group did not receive radiotherapy. The changes in blood flow at different <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments</b> were investigated in Group II by laser Doppler flowmetry. Variations in the histopathologic properties of the irradiated tissues including the skin, capsule and the pocket floor, were compared in the biopsy specimens taken from different locations in each group. Results A significant increase in skin blood flow was detected in Group II with partial expander deflation. Overall, histopathologic exam revealed aggravated findings of chronic radiodermatitis (epidermal atrophy, dermal inflammation and fibrosis, neovascularisation and vascular changes as well as increased capsule thickness) especially around the lower expander pole, in Group II. Conclusions Expander deflation immediately prior to radiotherapy, may augment the adverse effects, especially in the lower expander pole, possibly via enhanced radiosensitization due to a relative increase in the blood flow and tissue oxygenation. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{velocity}} of dripline flushing in subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems affects system design, cost, management, performance, and longevity. A 30 ‐day field {{study was conducted}} at Kansas State University to analyze the effect of four targeted flushing velocities (0. 23, 0. 30, 0. 46, and 0. 61 m/s) for a fixed 15 min duration of flushing and three flushing frequencies (no flushing or flushing every 15 or 30 days) on SDI emitter discharge and sediments within the dripline and removed in the flushing water. At {{the end of the}} field experiment (371 h), the amount of solids carried away by the flushing water and retained in every lateral were determined as well as laboratory determination of emitter discharge for every single emitter within each dripline. Greater dripline flushing velocities, which also resulted in greater <b>flushing</b> <b>volumes,</b> tended to result in greater amounts of solids in the flushing water, but the differences were not always statistically significant. Neither the frequency of flushing nor the interaction of flushing frequency and velocity significantly affected the amount of solids in the flushing water. There was a greater concentration of solids in the beginning one‐third of the 90 m laterals, particularly for treatments with no flushing or with slower dripline flushing velocities. As flushing velocity and concurrently <b>flushing</b> <b>volume</b> increased, there was a tendency for greater solids removal and/or more equal distribution within the dripline. At the end of the field study, the average emitter discharge as measured in the laboratory for a total of 3970 emitters was 0. 64 L/h. which was significantly less (approximately 2. 5 %) than the discharge for new and unused emitters. Only six emitters were nearly or fully clogged, with discharges between 0 % and 5 % of new and unused emitters. Flushing velocity and flushin...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{effect of}} {{postoperative}} radiotherapy following autologous flap breast reconstruction is controversial. The {{aim of this}} study was to measure whether adjuvant radiotherapy following immediate deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) free flap breast reconstruction affected flap volume. Methods: Sixty-eight women underwent immediate autologous DIEP flap reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer. Twenty-two of the 68 received postoperative radiotherapy (45 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks). Intraoperative flap volume data were collected prospectively. Volumetric assessment was carried out a minimum of 1 year after surgery. Patients who had <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment</b> surgery after initial reconstruction were analysed separately. Results: The mean age of the women was 52 (range 37 - 69) years and median follow-up was 3. 5 (range 1 - 10) years. There was no statistically significant difference in volume change between patients who had and those who did not have postreconstruction radiotherapy for the whole cohort (median reduction 65 versus 0 ml) or when women who had undergone further <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment</b> surgery were excluded. Conclusion: In this study postoperative radiotherapy did not significantly affect breast volume after DIEP flap reconstruction. The potential need for postoperative radiotherapy should not deter women from undergoing immediate DIEP flap breast reconstruction. Copyright © 2009 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.
