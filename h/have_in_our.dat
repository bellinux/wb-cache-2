[...] In {{a review of}} the early novels in the sequence, Arthur Mizener wrote: [...] "Powell makes his great egoists, for all their absurdity, something not essentially different from all the rest of us; even Widmerpool, the most extravagant of the lot, is not. However sublimely ridiculous he becomes, he continues to remind us, not so much, perhaps, of what we have done, as what we <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> time, known we might do".|$|E

500|$|In 1922, Hemingway {{moved with}} his wife Hadley to Paris, where he worked as foreign {{correspondent}} for the Toronto Star. [...] He became friends with and was influenced by modernist writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. The year 1923 saw his first published work, a slim volume titled Three Stories and Ten Poems, followed the next year by another collection of short vignettes, in our time (without capitals). [...] Hoping to <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> time published in New York, in 1924 he began writing stories {{to add to the}} volume with [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] planned as the final piece. He started writing the story in May of that year but did not finish until September as he spent the summer helping Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford launch the journal the transatlantic review.|$|E
500|$|While on {{vacation}} in Antalya, Turkey {{with his mother and}} sister, Lyashenko was found dead in his hotel room the morning of July 6, 2003. [...] His death was initially reported to be a suicide. Reports by Turkish police confirmed this, stating that Lyashenko had left a suicide note and attempted to cut his arms and wrists before hanging himself. A Turkish police officer, speaking anonymously, said that Lyashenko apologized for killing himself in the note. New York Rangers general manager Glen Sather said of Lyashenko, [...] "Roman was a quality individual who had a positive impact on everyone he touched, {{both on and off the}} ice." [...] Dallas Stars general manager Doug Armstrong expressed similar sentiments: [...] "Roman was a quality young man who we were privileged to <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> organization for three years." [...] Lyashenko was buried in Yaroslavl on July 12, 2003.|$|E
500|$|From 1586, Walsingham {{received}} many dispatches from his agents in mercantile communities and foreign courts detailing Spanish preparations for {{an invasion of}} England. Walsingham's recruitment of Anthony Standen, {{a friend of the}} Tuscan ambassador to Madrid, was an exceptional intelligence triumph and Standen's dispatches were deeply revealing. Walsingham worked to prepare England for a potential war with Spain, in particular by supervising the substantial rebuilding of Dover Harbour, and encouraging a more aggressive strategy. On Walsingham's instructions, the English ambassador in Turkey, William Harborne, attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the Ottoman Sultan to attack Spanish possessions in the Mediterranean in the hope of distracting Spanish forces. Walsingham supported Francis Drake's raid of Cadiz in 1587, which wrought havoc with Spanish logistics. The Spanish Armada sailed for England in July 1588. Walsingham received regular dispatches from the English naval forces, and raised his own troop of 260 men as part of the land defences. On 18 August 1588, after the dispersal of the armada, naval commander Lord Henry Seymour wrote to Walsingham, [...] "you have fought more with your pen than many <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> English navy fought with their enemies".|$|E

500|$|Many {{people within}} Major League Baseball spoke out {{in support of}} Joyce, {{offering}} their sympathies and noting his exceptional reputation. New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera said, [...] "It happened to the best umpire we <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> game. The best. And a perfect gentleman. ... It's a shame for both of them, for the pitcher and for the umpire. But I'm telling you {{he is the best}} baseball has, and a great guy. It's just a shame." [...] Former Chicago Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas said, [...] "I would tell , 'I feel for you. There have been only 20 perfect games in the history of baseball. The umpire situation was the same one I had—they blew it. At least I had the satisfaction of getting the no-hitter. You don't. I feel for you. You pitched a tremendous game. At least you have the satisfaction of the umpire saying he was sorry. But that doesn't help your situation as far as a perfect game." [...] Pappas' own bid for a perfect game on September 2, 1972, was spoiled when umpire Bruce Froemming called a borderline 3-and-2 pitch to 27th-batter Larry Stahl a ball, issuing a walk to the pinch-hitter. Former Yankees pitcher Don Larsen—who threw the fourth perfect game of the modern era and the only one in World Series history on October 8, 1956—said, [...] "I feel sorry for the umpire, and I just feel real badly for the kid. He's probably wondering right now whose side God is on." ...|$|E

[...] Carson half-heartedly supported Carleton's plans. He was tired. He had suffered an injury two years before that gave him great trouble. He resigned from the Army in February 1863. Carleton refused to accept the resignation because he wanted Carson to lead a campaign against the Navajo.|$|E

2500|$|Sultan Hamid {{apparently}} {{considered the}} under evaluation presented to him of 900,000 as exaggeration. The German {{chief of staff}} of the Ottoman Third Army, Colonel Felix Guse, complained that [...] "The Turks knew only poorly their country, on top of that the possibility of getting reliable statistical figures was out of the question. Fa'iz El-Ghusein, the Kaimakam of Kharpout, wrote in his book, that according to the Ottoman official statistics there were about 1.9 million Armenian's in the Ottoman Empire. Another indication that other statistics might have existed is that Polybius in his book published in 1919, refer to a said “Ottoman Official Census of 1910.” The Turkish historian Dr. Secil Akgun, claimed: “The Ottomans do not have a definite number. That is, we <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hands contradictory numbers regarding the Armenian population within the borders of the Ottoman Empire. I would think that Basmacıyan gives the most accurate number. This is to be between two and three million.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Dewey's biographer Richard Norton Smith wrote, [...] "For fifteen years... {{these two}} combatants waged {{political}} warfare. Their dispute pitted East against Midwest, city against countryside, internationalist against isolationist, pragmatic liberals against principled conservatives.

[...] In a 1949 speech, Dewey criticized Taft and his followers by saying that [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> party some fine, high-minded patriotic people who honestly oppose farm price supports, unemployment insurance, old age benefits, slum clearance, and other social programs... these people believe in a laissez-faire society and look back wistfully to the miscalled 'good old days' of the nineteenth century... if such efforts {{to turn back the}} clock are actually pursued, you can bury the Republican Party as the deadest pigeon in the country." [...] He added that people who opposed such social programs should [...] "go out and try to get elected in a typical American community and see what happens to them. But they ought not to do it as Republicans." ...|$|E
