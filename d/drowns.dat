40|$|Background: The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) {{external}} codes (E codes) for <b>drowning</b> {{assist in}} determining the primary event leading to <b>drowning,</b> but do not alone allow the precise deter-mination of the overall <b>drowning</b> rates. Aims: To analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} ICD E codes for <b>drowning.</b> To describe the pattern and trend of <b>drowning</b> deaths that are classified with E codes other than for <b>drowning.</b> Setting: Finland, 1969 – 2000. Methods: Mortality files of Statistics Finland were searched electronically using the injury codes (I codes) and E codes for <b>drowning.</b> Cross analysis of I and E coded drownings was performed to determine the rate and pattern of <b>drowning</b> cases classified with E codes other than for <b>drowning.</b> Time trends were calculated using the Poisson regression model. Results: Of 13 705 <b>drowning</b> deaths, 644 (4. 7 %) were not identified with the E codes for <b>drowning.</b> The great majority (n= 547, 84. 9 %) of these cases were traffic accidents resulting in <b>drowning.</b> No sig-nificant time trends were found even after the introduction, in 1996, of the ICD 10 th revision.

40|$|Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimates}} {{that there are}} at least 372, 000 deaths by <b>drowning</b> each year, making <b>drowning</b> the third leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide. Despite its global impact, <b>drowning</b> remains a neglected public health issue and relatively under-researched area. Objective: (1) To conduct a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and address gaps in our understanding of the <b>drowning</b> problem at the global, national, and local level; and (2) to provide policy-makers and advocates with comprehensive information to inform their <b>drowning</b> prevention efforts. Methods: This study involved retrospective reviews of five data sources: (1) global <b>drowning</b> data were extracted from the WHO mortality database for all countries that reported deaths using ICD- 10 <b>drowning</b> codes; (2) data on non-fatal <b>drowning</b> victims who required hospital admission in Canada were obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) s Discharge Abstract Database; (3) data on non-fatal <b>drowning</b> victims who required an emergency department visit were obtained from CIHIs National Ambulatory Care Reporting System; (4) data on unintentional fatal <b>drowning</b> deaths in Canada were obtained from the <b>Drowning</b> Prevention Research Centre (DPRC) database; (5) data on child <b>drowning</b> fatalities in private backyard pools in Ontario were collected from the case files at the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario using a structured questionnaire. Results: The results presented in this dissertation can inform <b>drowning</b> prevention globally, nationally, and locally. Internationally, official data categorization methods contribute to an underestimation of the burden of fatal <b>drowning.</b> In Canada, fatal <b>drowning</b> {{is only part of the}} problem; non-fatal <b>drowning</b> presents a substantial burden and the characteristics of non-fatal <b>drowning</b> differ significantly from fatal <b>drowning.</b> Further, although bystander intervention plays an important role in the survival of a <b>drowning</b> person, non-professional bystanders often intervene with high-risk, contact rescues, or do not attempt a rescue at all. Finally, children who <b>drown</b> in private backyard pools in Ontario often access the pool directly from the residence, yet most municipalities have not enacted isolation fencing bylaws. Conclusion: Addressing gaps in epidemiological <b>drowning</b> research at the global, national, and local level revealed several recommendations for policy, prevention, and future research...|$|R

In South Africa there is sound {{information}} and an emerging knowledge base for <b>drowning</b> prevention. However, there remains a scarcity of analyses of <b>drowning</b> in the country. The purpose of this analysis was to quantify the magnitude and describe occurrence of unintentional <b>drowning</b> deaths in five major South African cities, recorded between 2001 and 2005 by the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System. <b>Drowning</b> in South African cities occurred at rates of between 1. 4 and 2. 7 / 100, 000 population.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{which is}} titled An algorithm of care about <b>drowning</b> {{people from the}} perspective of paramedics deals with the procedure in prehospital emergency care about <b>drowning</b> people. The procedure of rescue is meant here as an initial technical rescue of a <b>drowning</b> person from the water and then follow-up medical care. At the beginning of the theoretical part there is the definition of <b>drowning</b> and the division of <b>drowning</b> and getting <b>drowned.</b> After that there is the slightly detailed description of the pathophysiology of <b>drowning</b> where the processes that occur in <b>drowning</b> are mapped. There is also mentioned the statistics of <b>drowning</b> and prevention of <b>drowning.</b> Furthermore the material and technical equipment for the rescue of a <b>drowning</b> with water rescue and emergency medical services are processed. This chapter outlines the basic utilities for needs of <b>drowning</b> person of water rescue and emergency medical services. The described equipment is briefly defined and there are highlighted some benefits of life-saving utilities. The last part of the theoretical work is in details. I dealt there with the algorithm of care about <b>drowning</b> people and there is properly shown the exact procedure of rescue of <b>drowning</b> person from the first noticing to the post-resuscitation treatment. The aim of this bachelor thesis was to map the process of pre-hospital care of emergency medical services and water rescue from <b>drowning</b> and map material and technical equipment of water rescue and emergency medical services. In the research part of the thesis was used qualitative method of interviewing with prepared questions. Interviews were given by respondents from the Czech Red Cross Water Rescue Service and Emergency Medical Services from the South Bohemia. Questions were especially about the procedure of rescue of <b>drowning</b> person and about the equipment for rescue from <b>drowning.</b> Both the above-mentioned objectives of the work were done. The result is the exact procedure of pre-hospital emergency care from <b>drowning</b> with water rescue and emergency medical services. Then I maped material and technical equipment of water rescue and emergency medical services for needs of <b>drowning</b> person. This work includes two different views on the process of pre-hospital emergency care in the condition of <b>drowning.</b> It turned out that both rescue IRS coincides in certain procedures or in usable equipment. There were also distinct variances in procedure of rescue and the usage for the rescue of <b>drowning</b> people. The interviews also created recommendations for extension of the material and technical equipment for the rescue of <b>drowning</b> person...|$|R
2500|$|Dry <b>drowning</b> is a {{term that}} has never had an {{accepted}} medical definition, and that is currently medically discredited. Following the 2002 World Congress on <b>Drowning</b> in Amsterdam, a consensus definition of <b>drowning</b> was established. Based on this definition, <b>drowning</b> is the [...] "process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid." [...] This definition resulted in only three legitimate <b>drowning</b> subsets: fatal <b>drowning,</b> non-fatal <b>drowning</b> with illness/injury, and non-fatal <b>drowning</b> without illness/injury. In response, major medical consensus organizations have adopted this definition worldwide and have officially discouraged any medical or publication {{use of the term}} [...] "dry drowning". Such organizations include the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, the Wilderness Medical Society, the American Heart Association, the Utstein Style system, the International Lifesaving Federation, [...] the International Conference on <b>Drowning,</b> Starfish Aquatics Institute, the American Red Cross, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Emergency Physicians.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT - In the {{geological}} record a <b>drowning</b> process is documented by {{various types of}} shallow water-to-pelagic or shallow water to mixed benthic/pelagic carbonate transitions. <b>Drowning</b> unconformities are paraconformities, to disconformities, to angular unconformities, and their <b>drowning</b> surfaces range from planar to highly irregular morphologies. <b>Drowning</b> successions display a mix of products of both the benthic and pelagic carbonate factories. These successions can be also bounded by unconformities. <b>Drowning</b> unconformities and <b>drowning</b> successions are contrasted through a description and discussion of examples of escarpment-bounded platforms from the Jurassic of the Northern Apennines and, subordinately, from Sicily and other Tethyan sectors. The areal distribution of <b>drowning</b> unconformities and successions is discussed with reference to a complex depositional system whose architecture {{was the product of}} the riftinduced fragmentation of a regional Hettangian carbonate megabank. The examples in this study show <b>drowning</b> unconformities to be exclusive to intrabasinal highs, while <b>drowning</b> successions are found both on highs and in hangingwall basins. <b>Drowning</b> unconformities, with their long associated hiatuses, and <b>drowning</b> successions are often seen to merge laterally into one another over very short distances on the same intrabasinal high. The deposits of the <b>drowning</b> succession are sometimes missing {{on the top of the}} platform, while they are found forming clinoforms along its flanks, evidence that sediment could be permanently swept from the highs in these depositional systems at this stage...|$|R
