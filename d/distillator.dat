The system will treat water from shower room, urine, impure condensation from gas recycle system, and so on. The H 2 O recycle system is composed of prefilter, ultrafiltration membrane, reverse osmosis membrane, and <b>distillator.</b> Some results are shown for a bullet train of toilet-flushing water recycle equipment with an ultraviltration membrane module. The constant value of the permeation rate with a 4. 7 square meters of module is about 70 1 /h after 500 th of operation. Thermovaporization with porous polytetrafluorocarbon membrane is also proposed to replce the <b>distillator...</b>|$|E
40|$|Up to now, the {{majority}} of people treat plastic waste by burning and disposing it directly to the surrounding environment. The burning of the waste causes air pollution due to toxic compound called dioxin which is harmful for human health. Meanwhile, the dumping of plastic waste into water bodies can causing some negative effects such as the clogging of water duct or river which may lead to flooding. Annually, the number of plastic bag used can reach 500 million – 1 billion, which is equal to 10 fold wrapping of earth surface (Nitizen, 2008). The best handling of plastic waste are using reuse or recycle methods which are environmentally friendly {{and at the same time}} can gain economical value 1). The study is aimed to: 1) understand the capability of oven <b>distillator</b> in processing plastic waste into plastic grain and liquid smoke, 2) understand the influence of liquid smoke towards wood durability, 3) understand the price of the oven <b>distillator</b> and the corresponding break even point (BEP). The study was an experimental one and employed pre test and post test with control group design, and simultaneously assessing equipment 2 ̆ 7 s production capacity.

40|$|The {{first part}} {{describe}} my {{work on the}} frozen spin target project HYDILE. This target {{has to be made}} of very pur HD (hydrogen deuterium) better than 99, 95 %. However commercial HD is never found with a concentration better 98 %. The goal was, then, to build an HD distillation facility which could produce pur HD. We describe, in this thesis, the design of the <b>distillator</b> and the implementation of a quadrupole mass spectrometer to monitor the HD purity during the distillation process. The second part of the thesis concerns the analysis taken at the electron accelerator facility TJNAF(Virginia,USA). We look at the electroproduction of Delat resonances involving Deep Virtual Compton Scattering(Delta VCS). The interpretation of this reaction in terms of GPDs can provide new insights to the nucleon structure. We focus on the measurement of the beam spin asymetrie which comes from the interference of the Bethe Heitler process with the Delta VCS. AUCU...|$|E
40|$|The {{polarized}} Hydrogen-Deuteride (HD) {{target is}} developed mainly {{for the study}} of φ meson photoproduc-tion on the proton and neutron. The polarized HD system consists of five large refrigerators. At RCNP, pure HD gas with an amount of 1 mol is produced by using the HD gas <b>distillator,</b> and the HD gas is solidified in a dilution refrigerator system (DRS). The polarization of the solid HD is made and frozen by aging at B= 17 T and at T= 14 mK. The polarized HD is moved from the DRS to a 4 He refrigerator (SC) by using another 4 He refrigerator (TC 1). The SC is moved to SPring- 8 /LEPS by using a truck. At SPring- 8 /LEPS, the polarized HD is moved from the SC to a dilution refrigerator(IBC) by using another 4 He refrigerator (TC 2). The IBC provides a magnetic field of 1 T and a temperature of 300 mK during the physics experiment for a few months [1]. The staying time of HD target in each refrigerator is summarized in Table. 1. A polarized HD target was produced {{for the first time in}} 2008. After the aging time of 53 day, the polarization degree and the relaxation time (T 1) of the hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D) in the HD were measured by using the NMR system [2]. NMR signals of H and D observed are shown in Fig. 1. The reference data of H (B= 1 T, T= 4. 2 K) and D (B= 7 T, T= 4. 2 K) at thermal equilibrium state were measured. The polarization degree is assumed to be proportional to the area of the NMR signals (A). The T 1 was obtained by fitting the function, A(t) = A(0) exp(−t/T 1), to the data as shown in Fig. 2. The T 1 measured is summarized in Table. 1...|$|E
40|$|Ginger (Zingiber officinale) and Zingiber zerumbet are {{medicinal}} plants {{that come from}} Zingiberaceae family, which contain high quality of essential oil. Both of these plants are widely used traditionally as an ailment and loss of appetite. In recent research the phytochemical component in both plants {{has been found to}} possess many interesting pharmacological and physiological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-obesity effects. In this study, the essential oil from the plants was extracted using Turbo Extractor <b>Distillator</b> (TED). TED is accelerated hydrodistillation that allows to increase the input quantity and reduce the distillation time. The result is a very fresh product which makes an ideal base for the production of natural extracts for use in flavours. The aim of this research is to use the Zingiber officinale and Zingiber zerumbet as raw material to produce highly active herbal extracts, which enhanced with active compounds in the larger scale processing platform. The extraction was done using different type of solvent that is 100 % water and 30 % ethanol. The raw material to solvent ratio used is 1 : 5 and time is from 1 hour to 6 hours. For extraction using 100 % water, Zingiber zerumbet produce a high oil yield (0. 3 %- 0. 5 %) than Zingiber Offinale (0. 1 %- 0 3 %). Zingiber Offinale produce high powder extract than Zingiber zerumbet for both types of solvent. From high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) result, ginger powder extract from 100 % water show high 6 -gingerol than oil or powder extract for 30 % ethanol that is 24. 8 (jg/ml. For Zingiber zerumbet, the result shows that the^essential oil contains more zerumbone than powder extract for both solvent The production of herbal products in larger scale will ensure the supply chain in the increasing demand from herbal consumers. The huge demand is not only on a quantity basis, but also on herbal quality basis. The herbal quality is mainly focused on the content of bioactive marker besides nutritional composition...|$|E
