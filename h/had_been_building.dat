5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, {{in which the}} {{unanimous}} court held that separate public schools for {{black and white students}} was unconstitutional. Although agitation for an end to racial segregation in schools (and society at large) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>building</b> in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{separated}} and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing {{the largest and}} most bureaucratic government {{in the history of the}} empire. He established new administrative centres in Nicomedia, Mediolanum, Antioch, and Trier, closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome <b>had</b> <b>been.</b> <b>Building</b> on third-century trends towards absolutism, he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, German Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, {{unaware of}} what was {{happening}} in Germany, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>building</b> up the strength of his forces. He was aided in this by the escape from Sicily of three divisions, which managed to cross the Straits of Messina without serious loss of men or equipment. In August, five infantry and two panzer divisions moved into northern Italy. After the loss of Sicily, Hitler amended the German plans, deciding to hold the Salerno-Naples area with five infantry divisions, while the 1st Parachute Division was ordered to the Apulia region.|$|E

5|$|Elgar's {{principal}} large-scale {{early works}} were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on {{the qualities of}} his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, {{appeared to be a}} sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>building</b> up throughout the decade.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan was {{declared}} Khaghan in 1206. The Mongols had united under his leadership, and defeated the rival tribes of the steppes. In the same period, China {{was divided into}} three separate states. In the north, the Jurchen Jin dynasty controlled Manchuria and all of China north of the Huai River. The Tangut Western Xia ruled parts of the western China, while the Song Dynasty reigned over the south. The Mongols subjugated Western Xia in 1210. In that same year, the Mongols renounced their vassalage to the Jin. Hostilities between the Jin and Mongols <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>building</b> up. The Mongols coveted the prosperity of Jurchen territory. They may have also harbored a grudge against the Jin for assassinating Ambaghai, one of Genghis' predecessors, and for the Jin emperor Wanyan Yongji's rude behavior to Genghis when Wanyan Yongji was still a Jurchen prince.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to make the vehicle stand out in the market against similar rivals, which {{included}} its own derivatives, Peugeot added a more glamorous two-door cabriolet to the standard three-door hatchback. Although announced at the hatchback's launch, the first models were not available until 1982. Designed and built by the Italian coachbuilder Pininfarina, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>building</b> open-top Peugeots since the 1960s, it came only with the 1360cc engine; two engine versions were offered, 53 or 59kilowatts (72 or 80PS)—the former was dropped after 1984, at which time a slightly revised cabriolet was released featuring the later style 104 dashboard, twin carburettors and a lined hood; the 80bhp engine was shared with the Rallye. At the time of its launch it was the only cabrio small car available from the manufacturer, although other models subsequently entered the market segment created by the Samba, including PSA's own Citroën Visa Decapotable. Pininfarina built 13,062Samba cabriolets.|$|E

5|$|Tension <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>building</b> {{among the}} base's staff in recent days, and most {{suspected}} that an attack would come {{against one of}} the border stations in the near future. Ample evidence of the coming attack was discovered by British patrols, but signs of enemy troop movements were disregarded and newly cleared positions were mistaken for ambush sites. Thus the base was continually left with the bare minimum number of men as the majority that could be spared went out on patrol. As a result of these conditions, only 36 men were present in the base {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 April 1965 when it came under ferocious attack by 150 to 400 Indonesian troops, supported by artillery and rocket fire. Immediately, the Indonesians swarmed into one segment of the trenches and destroyed one of the two mortars.|$|E
5|$|Thuyet {{had already}} decided to place Hàm Nghi {{at the head of}} the Phong Trào Cần Vuơng (Loyalty to the Emperor Movement), which sought to end French rule with a royalist rebellion. Phan helped the cause by setting up bases in Hà Tĩnh and {{creating}} his own guerrilla army. Thuyet had hoped to secure support from the Qing Dynasty of China, but Phan thought that Vietnam's best chance of effective support came from Siam. Gia Long, the founder of the Nguyễn Dynasty and great-grandfather of Tự Đức, had married his sister off to the King of Siam. He had also used Siam as a base-in-exile during his quest for the throne in the 1780s. However, direct appeals to the Siamese government only yielded a few pack trains of firearms and ammunition. In preparation for the revolt, Thuyet <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>building</b> up an armed base at Tan So for over a year.|$|E
