In particular, the bathyal zone {{has been identified as}} the key depth stratum requiring further macroecological research [1], particularly in the Southern Hemisphere [2]. Here we analyze a large biological data set derived from 295 research expeditions, across an equator-to-pole sector of the Indian, Pacific, and Southern oceans, to show that the bathyal ophiuroid fauna is distributed in three broad latitudinal bands and not primarily differentiated by oceanic basins as previously assumed. Adjacent faunas form transitional <b>ecoclines</b> rather than biogeographical breaks. This pattern is similar to that in shallow water despite the order-of-magnitude reduction in the variability of environmental parameters at bathyal depths.

40|$|Detecting {{structure}} in population genetics and case-control studies is important, as it exposes phenomena such as <b>ecoclines,</b> admixture and stratification. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear dimension-reduction technique commonly {{used for this}} purpose, but it struggles to reveal complex, nonlinear data patterns. In this paper we introduce non-centred Minimum Curvilinear Embedding (ncMCE), a nonlinear method to overcome this problem. Our analyses show that ncMCE can separate individuals into ethnic groups in cases in which PCA fails to reveal any clear structure. This increased discrimination power arises from ncMCE's ability to better capture the phylogenetic signal in the samples, whereas PCA better reflects their geographic relation. We also demonstrate how ncMCE can discover interesting patterns, even when the data has been poorly pre-processed. The juxtaposition of PCA and ncMCE visualisations provides a new standard of analysis with utility for discovering and validating significant linear/nonlinear complementary patterns in genetic data...|$|R

40|$|The species-environment {{relationship}} {{is a fundamental}} structural property of natural ecosystems. Marine sedimentary macrofauna {{is known to be}} structured by a range of environmental variables; however, the mechanisms by which environmental variables covary to form complex-gradients (i. e., groups of intercorrelated environmental variables), and how these are related to coenoclines (i. e., gradients in species composition), remain poorly understood. We classified our study area into geomorphological features that were used for stratified sampling of macrofaunal polychaetes, molluscs, and echinoderms. The resulting species-by-site matrix was subjected to indirect gradient analysis by a multiple parallel ordination strategy, using detrended correspondence analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling. One major and one minor coenocline were identified. Based on the correlation between complex-gradients and the main coenocline we hypothesise the existence of two <b>ecoclines</b> that we have termed Periodic hypoxia and Periodic physical forcing. We conclude that a combination of recurrent (periodical) and extreme events is likely to determine the variation found in the species composition of marine sedimentary ecosystems.

We used moving split window boundary analysis with dissimilarity functions, usually applied to detect ecotones and landscape boundaries at a coarse scale. The results were {{compared with those of}} correspondence analysis and clustering methods for the same data set, {{as well as with the}} local frequency distributions of populations along the studied transects. The MSW technique, usually applied in boundary and transition zone detection, was effective at a fine scale as well. The visible boundaries and transition zones were detectable with this method in most cases, but only sharp and narrow boundaries were verified with ordination and classification. If the changes are gradual in microtopography, then it is possible to detect transition zones between the vegetation patches. These types of transition zones can be considered as <b>ecoclines.</b> Despite the gentle microtopographical gradient, a marked border was detected between the Artemisio-Festucetum pseudovinae and the Achilleo-Festucetum pseudovinae communities. However, neither MSW did indicate boundary zone nor multivariate methods could distinguish sharply between these two communities. The small patches of the Artemisio-Festucetum pseudovinae association appear transitional between the adjacent communities in species composition along both transects. These patches cannot be considered as representing a distinct community type, and thus should be considered as ecotones...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{pattern of}} {{vegetation}} is the macroscopic manifestation {{of biological diversity}} and the ecological order in space and time. How is this overwhelmingly diverse, yet wonderfully ordered spatial pattern formed, {{and how does it}} evolve? To answer these questions, most traditional approaches have been empirical and inductive, based primarily on vegetation classification and gradient analysis. In contrast, here we develop a statistical thermodynamic model of the organizational order of vegetation (OOV) {{that can be used to}} derive vegetation patterns at large scales. We define OOV as a thermodynamic measure of the degree of structural and functional self-organization of natural vegetation in a given environment, which is related to the complexity and stability of ecosystems. The model unites OOV, ecosystem entropy, actual annual evapotranspiration, and mean annual temperature in the same thermodynamic framework. We use the model to calculate OOV values for major world biomes and derive their global pattern. The vegetation gradients predicted by the model contain the major <b>ecoclines</b> empirically identified by Communities and Ecosystems (1975) 385. In addition, the thermodynamic model predicts more gradients of ecosystems at the global scale, which provides theoretical insights into large-scale vegetation pattern analysis. This paper demonstrates that, as we deal with the complexity, diversity, and heterogeneity of ecological systems, statistical and non-equilibrium thermodynamics may serve as both a theoretical framework and a practical modeling approach to integrate patterns and processes across scales. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The albedo of {{a forest}} with {{snow on the ground}} is much less than that of snow-covered low {{vegetation}} such as tundra. As a result, simulation of the Northern Hemisphere climate, when fully forested south of a suitably chosen taiga/tundra boundary (<b>ecocline),</b> produces a hemispheric surface air temperature 1. 9 K higher than that of an earth devoid of trees. Using variations of the solar constant to force climate changes in the GLAS Multi-Layer Energy Balance Model, the role of snow-albedo feedback in increasing the climate sensitivity to external perturbations is reexamined. The effect of snow-albedo feedback is found to be significantly reduced when a low albedo is used for snow over taiga, south of the fixed latitude of the <b>ecocline.</b> If the <b>ecocline</b> shifts to maintain equilibrium with the new climate - which is presumed to occur in a prolonged perturbation when time is sufficient for trees to grow or die and fall - the feedback is stronger than for a fixed <b>ecocline,</b> especially at high latitudes. However, this snow/vegetation-albedo feedback is still essentially weaker than the snow-albedo feedback in the forest-free case. The loss of forest to agriculture and other land-use would put the present climate further away from that associated with the fully forested earth south of the <b>ecocline</b> and closer to the forest-free case. Thus, the decrease in nontropical forest cover since prehistoric times has probably affected the climate by reducing the temperatures and by increasing the sensitivity to perturbations, with both effects more pronounced at high latitudes...|$|E

40|$|The Columbia River Gorge {{represents}} an <b>ecocline</b> of shifting environmental factors, species populations, and vegetation associations. Combinations of wind, temperature, and precipitation create different environmental regimes {{from the west}} to the east. The north wall of the Gorge supported four physiognomic associations: western conifer forest, central mixed forest, central broadleaf forest, and eastern steppe. Each association comprised species distributed individually along the <b>ecocline.</b> Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), dull Oregongrape (Berberis nervosa), sword fern (Polystichum munitum), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), vine maple (Acer circinatum), and red bilberry (Vaccinium parviflorum) were centered in the western conifer forest. Garry oak (Quercus garryana), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), poison oak (Rhus diversiloba), and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) were centered in the central mixed forest. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), northern buckwheat (Eriogonum compositum), Wyeth's lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus var. humicola), western serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), mockorange (Philadelphus lewisii), and Sandberg's bluegrass (Poa sandbergii) were centered in the eastern steppe.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study was to investigate vegetation-environment relationships and examine patterns of changes in forest understorey vegetation in five Chinese subtropical forests. Furthermore, an Ecological Field Theory (EFT) model for single-tree influence on understorey vegetation was applied to assess the relative contributions of tree influence to variation in understorey species composition. In focus are five study areas, located in the southern and southwestern parts of China and consisting of subtropical mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests. In each study area, fifty sample plots 1 m 2 in size were randomly placed within each of ten 10 × 10 m macro-plots. Plant species composition was recorded in all 250 1 -m 2 plots, using frequency in sub-plots as a measure of species abundance. A total of 33 environmental variables were recorded for the 1 -m 2 plots as well as the 10 × 10 m macro-plots. All trees in all macro-plots were mapped and measured. The three ordination methods – DCA, LNMDS and GNMDS – were used in parallel to find corresponding (consensus) ordination axes, which were likely to represent true gradients in species composition. Three dimensions (axes, gradients) were needed to describe the variation in vegetation in two areas, two dimensions in the other three areas. GNMDS was finally chosen for interpretation and presentation of vegetation–environment relationships. Environmental interpretation of ordinations was made by split-plot GLM and non-parametric correlation analysis. Four major underlying complex environmental gradients were correlated with the species composition gradients: (1) A litter-related compositional gradient, reflected in favourability for bryophytes, was found in four areas (TSP, LCG, CJT and LXH). (2) A topography-related compositional gradient, reflected in variation both in vascular plant and bryophyte species composition, was found in four areas (TSP, LGS, CJT and LXH). Relationship with inclination was found in three areas (TSP, CJT and LXH) and with aspect favourability and heat index in two areas (LGS and CJT). (3) A soil acidity/soil mineral nutrients-related compositional gradient, reflected in variation in vascular plant species composition, was found in three areas (LCG, LGS and CJT). This was related to soil mineral nutrients concentrations in one of these areas (LGS). Finally, (4) a tree density-related compositional gradient with variation mainly at the macro-plot scale was observed as the first axis (GNMDS 1) in two areas (LCG and LXH). These four gradients will be referred to as the litter-layer depth, topography (inclination and aspect favourability), soil acidity/soil mineral nutrient concentrations, and tree density <b>ecoclines</b> (i. e. gradients in environmental conditions and species composition). Four out of twelve consensus ordination axes could not be interpreted ecologically by the environmental variables available. Changes in understorey vegetation (single-species abundances, species number and species composition) in the 1 -m 2 sample plots were studied in four areas during a first two-year, a consecutive three-year and a full five-year period. The results showed that: (1) a larger number of vascular plant species than expected by chance decreased and increased significantly in abundance in two and two areas, respectively; (2) the number of vascular plant species per plot increased significantly in two areas; (3) a larger number of bryophyte species than expected by chance decreased and increased significantly in abundance in three and two areas, respectively; (4) the number of bryophyte species number per plot decreased significantly in two areas but increased significantly in one other area. Finally, (5) significant plot displacement along gradients in species composition (interpreted GNMDS ordination axes) was observed in two areas for the main gradient (GNMDS 1) and one area for the second gradient (GNMDS 2). The patterns of change observed for bryophytes are attributed to climatic fluctuations. The increase in the abundances and numbers of vascular plant species is most likely due to seasonal variation and more favourable climatic growth conditions during specific years. No clear indications were found of changes for vascular plant species that may be linked to soil acidification or direct effects of air pollutants. An EFT model for single-tree influence on ground species composition was developed for each of the five study areas. Optimal model parameters were found by maximizing the eigenvalue of one constrained ordination axis (RDA), obtained by use of the tree influence index as the only constraining variable. Results showed that: (1) the eigenvalue of the first RDA axes varied between the five study areas, generally accounting for only a small part of the variation in species composition; and (2) the relative amount of compositional turnover attributable to tree influence differed between study areas and between species groups, but was generally low. We concluded that in Chinese subtropical forests, trees influence the understorey more in a collective manner than through the effect of single trees. List of papers.

40|$|The climatic {{controls}} on decomposition rates have gained considerable interest {{in recent years}} because of a perceived risk that elevated global temperatures could lead to positive green house gas feedbacks from soil ecosystems. Previous relationships between decomposition rates and abiotic variables like temperature and moisture have been proved confounding, particularly for dryland ecosystems.

The sites were characterised by variable anthropogenic influence, ranging from building rooftops in two cities to a natural reserve. The sites also included two suburban ecoclines, {{one of which was}} exposed to sewer pollution. Filamentous fungal colonies were quantified and identified via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Interestingly, we found that both fungal diversity and abundance were low in urban areas compared with suburban <b>ecocline</b> or environments little affected by anthropogenic influence.

Our {{results revealed that}} Pinus cembra [...] Larix decidua forests near timberline were rather closed between 9000 and 2500 B. C. (9600 - 4000 14 C yr BP), when timberline fluctuations occurred within a belt 100 - 150 m above today's tree limit. The treeline <b>ecocline</b> above timberline was characterized by the mixed occurrence of tree, shrub, dwarf-shrub, and herbaceous species, {{but it did not}} encompass more than 100 - 150 altitudinal meters. The uppermost limit reached by timberline and treeline during the Holocene was ca. 2420 and 2530 m, respectively, i. e., about 120 to 180 m higher than today. Between 3500 and 2500 B. C. (4700 - 4000 14 C yr BP) timberline progressively sank by about 300 m, while treeline was lowered only ca. 100 m. This change led to an enlargement of the treeline-ecocline belt (by ca. 300 m) after 2500 B. C. (4000 14 C yr BP). Above the treeline <b>ecocline,</b> natural meadows dominated by dwarf shrubs (e. g., Salix herbacea) and herbaceous species (e. g., Helianthemum, Taraxacum, Potentialla, Leontodon t., Cerastium alpinum t., Cirsium spinosissimum, Silene exscapa t., and Saxifraga stellaris) have been present since at least 11, 000 cal yr ago. In these meadows tree and tall shrub species (> 0. 5 m) never played a major role. These results support the conventional hypothesis of a narrow <b>ecocline</b> with rather sharp upper timberline and treeline boundaries and imply that today's treeless alpine communities in the Alps are close to a natural stage. Pollen (percentages and influx), stomata, and charcoal data may be useful for determining whether or not a site was treeless.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the ecotone was formalised by Clements (1 905) as a {{boundary}} zone between plant communities. Little research exists on the ecological importance or the geographical variability of these zones. Two types of boundaries are acknowledged: the ecotone and the <b>ecocline.</b> The ecotone is a sharp boundary; the <b>ecocline</b> a gradual boundary. The term 'transitional area' is proposed here to more accurately describe these areas as this research demonstrates that a complex continuum exists between the two end points. Additionally, mosaics often complicate {{the nature of the}} transition and may form a boundary type in their own right. Upland plant communities represent important semi-natural habitats within the British Isles. Effective management depends on an understanding of their structure and function. This research is primarily concerned with the description of structure (spatial pattern and variability in floristic composition) but explanation of these patterns is only possible through an understanding of function (vegetation dynamics). Pilot studies determined an appropriate methodology for studying transitional areas. The approach progressed from a linear transect to a two-dimensional rectangular transect. The pilot studies also evaluated a range of methods for data analysis. Extended field sampling followed which included 23 sites in 4 locations: Dartmoor, Snowdonia, North York Moors and Barra, Western Isles of Scotland. Data analysis exposed the complexities of the transitional areas sampled but 'noise' often obscured the true characteristics. To overcome this a Species Ratio Index Model was devised to identify the strength of signal for each boundary. The final characterisation of transitional areas is based on three main components: ecotone, <b>ecocline</b> and mosaics, each displaying varying amplitude. Of the sites sampled, few boundaries revealed single characteristics and the majority were far more complex than their observed patterns implied. On the basis of this characterisation a classification is proposed which incorporates both natural and anthropogenic factors. The classification represents an important contribution to the understanding of boundary types. This study reinforces the significance of boundaries in the landscape. The potential for future research is great, particularly through the development of a predictive model for management purposes...|$|E

Collecting was undertaken during the dry season, in November 1993, by diving (with and without SCUBA). Nine stations were sampled on a transect extending from a reef outside the river mouth to a mangrove system at {{the upper end of}} the estuary. Four major regions were distinguished along the <b>ecocline</b> based on numerical analyses of hydroid species/station location data: (1) nearshore reef — a sandstone ledge outside the entrance of the estuary; (2) river mouth — a sandy and shelly flood-tidal delta area inside the entrance of the Rio Formoso; (3) mid-estuary — a muddy and rocky, mangal-fringed, poikilohaline region in the middle reaches of the Rio Ariquindá; (4) upper estuary — a muddy, mangal-dominated, strongly poikilohaline region at {{the upper end of the}} estuary in the Rio Porto Alegre. Species numbers were highest in mid-estuary and on the nearshore reef, intermediate at the river mouth, and lowest in the upper estuary. Only three eurytopic species, including two euryhaline opportunists (Clytia gracilis, Obelia bidentata) and an estuarine endemic (Garveia franciscana), were found at the two landwardmost stations in the upper estuary. Euryhaline marine species comprised part or all of the fauna at stations along the rest of the system.

40|$|Inselbergs are rock {{outcrops}} forming "xeric islands" in {{the rain}} forest. Plants on inselbergs endure very harsh edaphic and microclimatic conditions. Monocotyledonous mats develop on the rock surface, and grasslands are present on the shallow soils. The inselberg-rain forest <b>ecocline</b> {{is characterized by the}} spatial transition from an herbaceous fringe to a shrubby fringe, a forest fringe and a saxicolous forest. We describe here the plant communities of the inselberg grasslands and herbaceous fringes of 24 sites in Southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. The plant communities defined from the classification of 177 phytosociological relevés are compared to the existing phytosociological literature and the correlation between the floristic data and the environmental and spatial variables is analyzed. We define a new phytosociological order: the Sclerio melanotrichae-Habenarietalia procerae, two new alliances and four new associations. Herbaceous fringes and grasslands differ both in their flora and in their life form spectra, but the main differentiating factor in the floristic data set is the geographical location of the relevés rather than the plant formation. Three ecogeographical groups of inselbergs are identified. Weeds are {{an important component of the}} inselberg flora. They are well adapted to the harsh inselberg habitat by their ability to cope with unpredictable environmental fluctuations (e. g. drought). Grazing and trampling by wild herds of buffaloes contribute to create suitable habitats for these species. Epiphytes are present in the herbaceous fringes. This is explained by the similarity of the environmental conditions on the rock and on the inselberg rain forest <b>ecocline</b> with the environmental conditions encountered by epiphytes in the upper part of the forest canopy. The inselberg grasslands and herbaceous fringes contribute to the regional biodiversity in three ways: a) fourteen species are restricted to the inselberg habitat and to the Guineo-Congolian region, b) fourteen species are only present on the inselbergs {{in the rain}} forest zone, their main distribution being in the savannah or at higher altitudes, c) the inselberg grassland and herbaceous fringe plant communities do not exist outside the inselberg habitat. © 2006 Gebrüder Borntraeger.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{examines}} nitrogenase activity in Alnus,Myrica, Anabaena, Plectonema, and peat, with particular attention to field use of the acetylene reduction assay. The rate of nitrogenaseactivity was found to be very sensitive to temperature change, except for blue-green algae in reduced light. Low p 0 (_ 2) values reduce the rate of nitrogenase activity by nodules of Alnus and Myrica. Nitrogenase activity in Anabaena occurs at 40 %ºC in condition of low p 0 (_ 2). Characteristics of acetylene reduction by peat indicate that the reaction is caused by a living enzyme. A mixture of aerobic and anaerobic conditions stimulates acetylene reduction by peat, therefore it is suggested that microbial associations may be important for heterotrophic nitrogen fixation in peat. Theoretical and practical aspects of the relationship between nitrogenise activity and temperature are discussed. The second part of the thesis is concerned with the distribution of certain elements, and heterotrophic nitrogenase activity in relation to peatland ecology. The nutrient <b>ecocline</b> in mires is defined by a floristic gradient, in relation to which the above mentioned factors are examined. Heterotrophic nitrogenase activity was estimated in peat collected from eleven different mire complexes; a trend of increasing activity was observed from bogs to rich fens, with a significant decline in extreme rich fens. The amounts of Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe, Al, Mn and Zn, in peat and mire vegetation in relation to the <b>ecocline</b> are described, with nitrogen and phosphorus being discussed in detail. In rich mires, P, N and K are the elements most highly concentrated into the mire vegetation, in poor mires the most concentrated elements are N and Mn.

40|$|Most estuarine ecology {{textbooks}} {{have included}} the so-called Remane diagram which is derived from German studies in the Baltic Sea region during {{the early part of}} the 20 th Century. The model shows how aquatic species diversity changes from freshwater to more marine areas. In essence it aims to show the relative proportions of each component of the fauna (freshwater, brackish and marine) and how these change along a salinity gradient. These combined components decrease in diversity with a progression from both the freshwater and marine ends of the spectrum, with the 5 e 7 salinity area being dominated by a small number of true brackish/estuarine species. The way in which the Remane diagram has been interpreted (and misinterpreted) and used (and misused) in the literature is discussed here. We primarily investigate whether the model needs to be modified to help provide an understanding of current biotic distribution patterns within estuaries and how these patterns might be influenced by climate change. Using global estuarine examples for a variety of taxa we discuss the appropriateness of the Remane model beyond the zoobenthos (on which the model was originally based) and provide a revised model that is more suited to estuaries worldwide.

40|$|International audienceIntertidal mudflats {{are rich}} and {{fluctuating}} systems. The upper 20 cm support a high diversity and density of microorganisms that ensure diversified roles. The depth profiles of microbial abundances and activities were measured in an intertidal mudflat (Marennes-Oléron Bay, SW France) at centimeter-scale resolution (0 - 10 cm below the sediment surface). The {{aim of the}} study was to detect microbial stratification patterns within the sediments and how this stratification is shaped by environmental drivers. Two sampling dates, i. e. one in summer and another in winter, were compared. The highest activities of the microbial communities were observed in July in the surface layers (0 - 1 cm), with a strong decrease of activities with depth. In contrast, in February, low microbial bulk activities were recorded throughout the sediment. In general, prokaryotic abundances and activities were significantly correlated. Variation partitioning analysis suggested a low impact of predation and a mainly bottom-up-controlled prokaryotic community. Hence, in the top layer from the surface to 1 – 3. 5 cm depth, microbial communities were mainly affected by physicochemical variables (i. e., salinity, phosphate and silicate concentrations). Below this zone and at least to 10 cm depth, environmental variables were more stable and prokaryotic activities were low. The transition zone between both layers probably represents a rather smooth gradient (environmental <b>ecocline).</b> The results of our study provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between micro-organisms and their environment in a fluctuating ecosystem such as an intertidal mudflat...|$|E

DCA analysis indicated a gradual compositional turnover of the phytoplankton community within the estuary. GAM modelling of species response curves along the estuarine gradient was used to identify taxa that had their population maximum in the river, the coastal zone or within the estuary. Taxa that had their population maximum within the estuary did not form a homogenous community but comprised species with different salinity optima and rather restricted salinity tolerances. The observed changes in community composition along the estuarine transition zone correspond more closely to an <b>ecocline</b> than to an ecotone model. Despite the fact that few taxa had their population maximum at or near the salinity gradient, alpha diversity did not display a minimum around the salinity gradient. This lack of a diversity minimum within the estuary was ascribed to an important contribution of taxa of riverine or coastal origin to alpha diversity within the estuary contributed. On average 55 % of the alpha diversity in the estuarine samples was due to riverine or coastal taxa. Beta diversity displayed a clear maximum around the salinity gradient. For planktonic organisms which are subject to mass effects, beta diversity is probably a better indicator for the impact of the salinity gradient on diversity in estuaries than alpha diversity.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of two contrasting alpine forest. pasture ecotones located in the Central Pyrenees (sites Ordesa and Tessó). We define ecotone structure as the spatial distribution of trees of different size classes and growth-forms, {{and the relationship between}} these aspects and the spatial distribution of understory vegetation and substrate. The studied ecotones are dominated by Pinus uncinata and have been little affected by recent anthropogenic disturbances (logging, grazing). One rectangular plot (30 x 140 m 2) was located within each site encompassing treeline and timberline with its longest side parallel to the slope. The distribution of size and growth-form classes at Ordesa followed a clear sequence of increasing size downslope, from shrubby krummholz individuals to bigger arborescent trees. At Ordesa, regeneration was concentrated near the krummholz area and over rocky substrates. At Tessó, regeneration was abundant above the treeline, where the cover of the dominant understory shrub (Rhododendron ferrugineum) decreased. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis of tree and plant cover data, with respect to spatial location in the ecotone and substrate cover, demonstrated that elevation was an important factor controlling the distribution of trees and understory plants in both ecotones. Finally, k-means clustering with spatial constraint revealed abrupt spatial clusters along the slope at Ordesa. However, the ecotone at site Tessó was composed of elongated downslope spatial clusters suggesting greater spatial heterogeneity and subtle gradual changes due to other factors in addition to the altitudinal gradient (snow avalanches). These contrasting structures correspond well with the ecotone (sharp boundary, Ordesa) and <b>ecocline</b> (gradual transition, Tessó) concepts. This suggests the dominant role of different local environmental factors: wind at site Ordesa and avalanches at Tessó. Positive feedbacks, like facilitation among P. uncinata individuals (nurse effect), may maintain and intensify the sharpness of the ecotone at Ordesa...|$|E
40|$|A {{short history}} of Dutch dune {{vegetation}} research is presented as {{an introduction to the}} present research in the Delta region. Remarkably enough the main results of dune research were presented as dissertations. The classics F. Holkema, L. Vuyck, J. Jeswiet, J. Bijhouwer and W. van Dieren are mentioned. The broadening basis is marked by the outstanding thesis of V. Westhoff, the first all-round phytosociological and ecological study of Dutch dunes. New ideas from this work are mentioned. The work of some pupils and collaborators of Westhoff is discussed. The new approach consists of concentration of the research in the Delta region, development of new ideas and establishment of field stations in the dunes. The scientific value of the Delta dunes is treated. Especially the Voorne dunes are considered as outstanding. Some future changes that threaten the area, are mentioned. The organisation of the Delta dune research is discussed, especially the work of a special Research Group, operating from the Biological Station “Weevers’ Duin” at Voorne. The current botanical problems are treated. It is stressed that they are placed in the framework of the ecological relation theory of C. G. van Leeuwen, which is a new, highly stimulating, system-theoretical approach. This relation theory is introduced and commented. Four environmental types are treated, the uniform, the variegated, the ecotone and the <b>ecocline</b> environment. The dune environment is discussed as a system of gradients. The main gradients are mentioned: the zonation of dry dunes, zonation of slacks, gradient from sea dunes towards estuaries, the complex salt-fresh gradient, the complex wet-dry gradient, and the complex gradient in the human and animal factors. The dune vegetation is treated as a continuum. 24 vegetational series are mentioned. A series consists of closely related communities, forming a continuum. Some problems concerning selection and sampling are discussed. The controversy between Anglo-American and Zürich-Montpellier scholars is elucidated on some points. The Braun-Blanquet scale of combined estimation is advocated. The study of pattern and instability in vegetation research is emphasized. Some methods in structure analysis are mentioned. Recent problems in vegetation systematics are discussed. The application of methods in the Delta research is consequently mentioned. An extensive bibliography, covering important botanical work in Dutch dunes, ends the paper...|$|E
40|$|Goss Moor NNR is a unique, {{rare and}} nationally-important wetland habitat in Mid- Cornwall. The {{majority}} of the habitats were created {{as a result of}} a long history of tin-stream mining, which ceased in the early 1900 s. Phytosociological surveys of poor-fen and willow carr communities provide the first formal descriptions of the vegetation at this site. The poor-fen survey revealed twelve poor-fen vegetation types, which were distributed along a primary environmental gradient of organic matter depth, surface water height and bare substrate. Separation of the poor-fen communities by a moisture gradient was considered as spatial evidence for hydroseral succession, which begins with the colonisation of open-water pools created by tin excavations. The Salix cinerea ssp. oleifolia willow carr was divided by eight understorey communities, according to age, defined by reference to five sets of aerial photographs of Goss Moor taken over the last six decades. The average number of poor-fen species per unit area in the understorey generally decreased with age. This relationship was related to the increase in canopy cover and, therefore, shade. Willow was found to invade areas with the greatest amounts of accumulated organic material and a low water table. In the oldest and driest willow, oak saplings were found, indicating the beginning of secondary woodland. An architectural analysis of willow showed that useful age descriptors were the height of the first fork, the number of live secondary shoots, tree height and dbh, all of which generally increased with age. Spatial successional patterns were characterised using the lattice-wombling technique in three large rectangles or 'tranomes'. Plant communities were associated with either abrupt or diffuse boundary types. Abrupt boundaries or ecotones were found between heath communities and densely vegetated tall-herb fen and species-poor willow carr wetland vegetation. Diffuse or <b>ecocline</b> transitions occurred between communities with subtle differences in their composition. Spatial relationships between swamp and poor-fen communities were taken as evidence for space-for- time successions, these patterns varied according to location and microtopography. Investigations into the water regime showed water depth was governed by substrate heterogeneity. Homogeneous microtopography was associated with deep inundations and greatest amplitude in water depth, and most closely resembled rainfall fluctuations. The most complex microtopography resulted from the most intense tin-streaming activity. Therefore the anthropogenic history of Goss Moor plays an important role in governing the contemporary water regime and vegetation distribution. Of the wetland communities, rush pasture was the driest and poor-fen the wettest. The communities of open habitats were wetter than the willow communities. The youngest willow community was drier in the summer than the other five vegetation types studied, which was indicative of the conditions necessary for willow scrub colonisation to take place. The N:P ratio revealed that nitrogen was the limiting nutrient in all of the wetland vegetation types suggesting an early stage of successional development. High water levels were thought to be responsible for the prevalence of N-limitation on Goss Moor, creating deoxygenated substrates and leading to the demise of nitrifying bacteria and thus a reduction in the rate of soil N mineralisation. Plant strategies were used to classify the species from a number of wetland communities ranging from open-water pools to willow carr, in order to apply them to Grime's triangular model. The ten communities were ordered into a logical successional sequence. However, the model needs to be modified to account for succession in the aquatic environment. Based on the findings of this thesis, a number of suggestions were made for the effective management of the wetland habitats on Goss Moor. These include: evaluation of willow scrub before removal so those areas of vegetation subsequently opened-up can be monitored; and the creation of new ponds to encourage the growth of certain poor-fen communities, which are species-rich, but only account for a small area of the whole resource...|$|E
40|$|The botanical {{control of}} nature {{reserves}} based on structure ecology In contrast with previous ideas the human control of nature reserves is nowadays seen as indispensable {{for the preservation}} of variety-in space and stability-in-time. Botanical control of nature reserves has for its object the conservation of their various plant communities against alterations coming from the inside and the outside. A second purpose is the enlarging of their internal spatial variety, for the more variety-in-space is present the more varietyin-time can be counteracted. In both cases the cybernetical term “regulation amplifying” is an adequate expression for our activities. The theoretically most difficult problem in modern control is due to its preponderant external character which type is inevitably leading to convergence and some loss of spatial structure. This loss will be the greater the more our methods and tools are going into the convergent direction. Some knowledge about this difficulty may however protect us from unjustified reproaches to the controller involved. Our ancestors did not meet these problems, firstly because they were missing the technical resources for increasing the environmental convergence to an excessive height and secondly because, as agrarians, they formed part of a whole, some relics of which we are trying to preserve now. The old-fashioned agricultural and mining systems automatically led to regulation amplifying in the landscape around their dwelling places by three factors: 1. Stability of the methods. 2. Isolation by distance (development of anthropogeneous ecoclines). 3. Action on a small scale. Provisionally estimated only 5 — 10 % has remained now of the former biological richness of the Netherlands (less than a century ago) which was mainly based on those three fundaments. All human operations in nature are bringing about change and disturbance. In fig. 1, expressing the second factor (<b>ecocline</b> of human influence) nearly all possible types of normal anthropogeneous disturbance are drawn as concentric circles around a village; the intensity of the influence is gradually decreasing from the inside to the outside: manuring, farming, hay-making, burning, pasturing, cutting of sods, digging out, coppice exploitation, extensive forestry, raking of sphagnum, removal of moss and litter and non-intervention. The two arrows directed to the centre not only indicate the effect of treading on ways but they are also marking the concentration of nutrients from the outside to the inside. In fig. 2 nearly the same types of disturbance are shown “en profil”, together with the principal effects on vegetation and soil and most of the synsystematical units belonging to the various categories of human influence. It is stressed that the removal of soil and organic materials are representing the two most important {{and at the same time}} most expensive measures for the botanical control of nature reserves in man-made landscapes. Two main types of control are discerned here, viz. an internal control (continuation of oldfashioned agricultural and mining methods within the reserve) and an external one (protection against the effects of modern agricultural and mining methods coming from the outside). With regard to both types three basic rules are given, for the greater part leaning on the three factors mentioned before: Basic rule I. The preservation of the botanical richness of a nature reserve is most assured if its treatment forms as good as possible a copy of and is directly connected with the methods applied formerly, and is later on subject to as little change as possible. Basic rule II. In case the character and size of a nature reserve are suitable, its internal regulation can be amplified by furthering the development of ecoclines based on the degree of human influence within the area. Basic rule III. Our controlling operations have to be done gradually and on a small scale. Basic rule IV. The external protection of nature reserves in landscapes with a coarse-grained pattern has to be based on their form and size. The more concentric the form and the larger the surface the more safe the areas will be against alterations threatening them from the outside. Basic rule V. If the extension of a nature reserve is sufficient the controller has to take advantage of the ecoclines which are developing along the outskirts by interaction of internal and external influences. In this connection it is a condition that oligotrophic circumstances are predominating over eutrophic ones. Basic rule VI. If alterations are induced from the outside the internal botanical control has to be directed on the delaying of the processes evoked by them...|$|E
40|$|The isomorphy {{of natural}} and anthropogeneous landscapes {{with regard to the}} {{environmental}} conditions in border areas The contact in space between opposite situations constitutes two main types of boundaries. The distinction of these two types offers a useful expedient in ecology. It may also clarify the question why the effects of old-fashioned and modern agricultural systems on the biological richness of man-made landscapes in Western Europe are quite opposite, viz. by increasing respectively reducing the spatial variety. In the neighbourhood of a straight boundary line (fig. 1, A 2) total difference is existing between the white border on the left (w) and the black one on the right (z). This entire difference between the two frontier areas (external) is connected with complete equality within them (internal). It means that in the direction of d (fig. 1, A 3) we shall find a relation of isolation, unequality or closure, while in the direction of o we may expect a relation of communication, equality or openness. The combination of wide external difference and high internal equality marks the phenomena of concentration, damming up and convergence, as for example can be observed along shores (migration birds, seaside visitors, tidal drift) and in the behaviour of water on plastic raincoats. In the case of undulating boundary lines (fig. 1, B 2) {{the difference between the two}} border areas has diminished. Both are black and white together, so that in the direction d + (o) (fig. 1, B 3) openness or equality has been gained at the cost of some closure. On the other hand much closure or difference has been gained within the two borders, so in the direction o + (d). The combination of less external and more internal variety marks the phenomena of dispersion, expansion and divergence. This dispersion is maximal in a gradual transition zone between two or more contrasting situations, as demonstrated in fig. 2, A. Vegetation patterns in the latter type of boundaries, here called “limes divergens”, are characterised by a fine granulation and faint lines of demarcation, which can hardly be discerned. The vegetation in such gradient areas is comparatively rich in species, most of them represented by only a few individuals. Moreover a limes divergens is marked by stable internal conditions and stabilizing qualities, as for example can be observed in the behaviour of water on woollen raincoats. In boundaries of this type (“more-or-less”) a high amount of variety-in-space is coupled with a low amount of variety-in-time. The vegetation profile of fig. 3, B represents an example of a natural gradient area (<b>ecocline)</b> between grassland and woodland on limestone. In the first-named type of boundaries, here called “limes convergens”, vegetation patterns show a coarse granulation and sharp lines of demarcation, which can easily be discerned. In this case the vegetation is poor in species, most of them represented by many individuals. Boundaries of this type are met with in frontier areas where two or more contrasting situations alternate in time (fig. 2, B, C, D and fig. 4, 1 C). Thus a limes convergens is marked by unstable internal conditions (“now-and-then” or “to-and-fro”). Here a low amount of variety-in-space is coupled with a high amount of variety-in-time. It is suggested to confine the concept of “ecotone” to the limes convergens. Either category has its own characteristic organisms. Orchids are mentioned here as typical gradient plants, while species such as Potentilla anserina and Agrostis stolonifera are representative of the limes convergens. The vegetation profile of a natural instable environment, as for example can be distinguished on salt marshes (fig. 3, A), is isomorphic to that of the modern anthropogeneous landscape. The fixation of the relations in the latter one is only an artificial stability. The uncertainty of “nowand-then” is always threatening here. This subtype of the limes convergens forms the habitat of those mobile organisms which need the combination of at least two widely differing types of environment situated contiguously without a gradual transition zone between them (fig. 4, 2 (a + b), (b + c)). These “shuttling” animals, such as gulls and many amphibians, live temporarily in large concentrations or colonies, another aspect of convergence. A special subtype of the limes divergens is found in places where instability shows gradual differences in space. The borders along old-fashioned footpaths and tracks across a moorland are wellknown examples of man-made frontier areas of this subtype with characteristic plants such as Orchis maculata, Carex flacca, and Linum catharticum. There also exist typical annuals, such as Cicendia filiformis and Juncus mutabilis, that shuttle from year to year within the gradual transition area (fig. 5, 2 c). The modern technical civilization favours more and more the limes convergens by making sharp lines of demarcation, monotonous vegetations, barrages, ballasted roads, straight canals, by soil hardening and by scale enlarging in re-allotments. On the contrary the former agricultural and mining (peat digging etc.) systems automatically lead to amplification of the spatial diversity in life circumstances. This regulation amplifying between nobsphere and biosphere was mainly the result of three factors: 1. The methods did not change for centuries. By this stability (no variety-in-time) the variety-inspace steadily increased. 2. Isolation by distance gave a gradual restriction to human influence. This restraint was minimal near the dwelling-places in the centre of the action-radius and maximal at the outside, with all possible degrees of influence between the extremes (fig. 6). 3. Our ancestors were operating gradually and on a small scale. By this dispersion in time, which has the same effects as dispersion in space, the spatial variety increased still more. Besides these three main factors numerous smaller elements of divergence occurred in the landscape, such as the unevenness of the soil surface, the windings of ways and watercourses and the tracks already mentioned before...|$|E
