5|$|Governors {{first began}} to assert their own power during the American Civil War as the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{attempted}} to remove command of the militia from the governor. In response, the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> was effectively suppressed, during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers. In 1889, the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.|$|E

5|$|The 1925 <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{faced the}} threat of schism over {{the actions of the}} Presbytery of New York. Attempting to deescalate the situation, <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{moderator}} Charles Erdman proposed the creation of a special commission to study the church's problems and find solutions. The commission's report, released in 1926, sought to find a moderate approach to solving the church's theological conflict. In agreement with the Auburn Affirmation, the commission concluded that doctrinal pronouncements issued by the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> were not binding without the approval of a majority of the presbyteries. In a defeat for conservatives, the report was adopted by the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly.</b> Conservatives were further disenchanted in 1929 when the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> approved the ordination of women as lay elders.|$|E
5|$|The <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{established}} the state's first sales tax at two percent in 1962. The {{revenues from the}} tax led {{to a host of}} new projects across the state. The <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> also passed the Indiana Civil Rights bill in 1963, granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment. In 1970 a series of constitutional amendments were passed. Among them was one that authorized the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> to meet annually instead of biennially.|$|E

5|$|The {{authority}} and {{powers of the}} Indiana <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> are established in the state constitution. The <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> has sole legislative power within the state government. Each house can initiate legislation, with the exception that the Senate is not permitted to initiate legislation that will affect revenue. Bills are debated and passed separately in each house, but must be passed by both houses before they can submitted to the governor. Each law passed by the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> must be applied uniformly to the entire state; the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> has no authority to create legislation that targets only a particular community.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana <b>General</b> <b>Assembly,</b> consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly.</b> If vetoed, a bill is returned to the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override a veto, the Indiana <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} checks and {{balances}} built into the state constitution that limit {{the power of the}} <b>General</b> <b>Assembly.</b> Other clauses allow the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> to balance and limit the authority of the other branches of the government. Among these {{checks and balances}} is the governor's authority to veto any bill passed by the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly.</b> The <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> may in turn override his veto by simple majority vote in both houses. Bills passed by a super majority automatically become law without requiring the signature of the governor. Once the bill is made law, it can be challenged in the state courts which may rule the law to be unconstitutional, effectively repealing the law. The <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> could then override the court's decision by amending the state constitution to include the law. The <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> has historically been the most powerful branch of the state government, dominating a weak governor's office. Although the governor has gained more power in the past fifty years, the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> still retains the power to remove much of that authority.|$|E

5|$|Article IX {{involves}} {{amendments to}} the New Jersey state constitution.

On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported the Democrats and another who supported the Republicans.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the {{legislature}} {{was the scene}} of intense debate. At the beginning of the war, the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> was controlled by the southern sympathetic Democrats. Governor Oliver Morton and the Republican minority were able to prevent the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> from meeting in 1862 and 1863 by denying the body quorum. Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by this crisis again led to the near bankruptcy of the state. In 1864, the Republicans gained a majority and convened the <b>General</b> <b>Assembly</b> to remedy the state's funding problems.|$|E
