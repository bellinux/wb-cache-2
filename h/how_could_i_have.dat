500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{spent his}} early years {{in front of the}} cameras on Leave it to Beaver as [...] "Gilbert Bates" [...] (56 episodes), Talbot {{abandoned}} acting for a career as a journalist. In an article in Salon.com he looked back with a sense of humor about his past role. [...] "In the interests of historical accuracy I should say that, yes, Gilbert was a troublemaker and an occasional liar, but my character was certainly no Eddie Haskell â€“ that leering teenage hypocrite who spoke unctuously to parents ('Well, hello Mrs. Cleaver, and how is young Theodore today?') and venomously to the Beav ('Hey, squirt, take a powder before I squash you like a bug')."! [...] "I have spent my adult life trying to conceal my Leave it to Beaver past or correcting the historical record. Either way the series has become inescapable. When I was a kid, I loved acting; in fact, I badgered my father and mother until they allowed me to work. But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known as an innocent 9-year-old that I was taking part in a television program that would live on for 40 years as an icon for baby boomers? In the early '80s, I turned down an offer to revive my role as Gilbert in a dreadful Beaver reunion series. [...] "I'm trying to establish myself as a documentary filmmaker and an investigative reporter," [...] I explained to the producers. [...] "I can't go back to being Gilbert!" ...|$|E
60|$|Very unwillingly--but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> refused {{without giving}} offense?--I entered the room.|$|E
60|$|I haven't done {{a stroke}} of work since the Atlantic dinner; have only moped around. But I'm going to try tomorrow. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>have.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will send}} you the message by the boy Gregorio," [...] said the girl. [...] "I knew you were braver than that small slayer of men who never smiles. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>have</b> thought <b>I</b> cared for him?" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY (naively {{concerned}} about him). Oh, I {{never thought of}} that. It was brutal of me; but I couldn't help it, <b>could</b> <b>I?</b> <b>How</b> else <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got the papers? (Supplicating.) General: you will save him from disgrace.|$|R
6000|$|OCTAVIUS. [dithyrambically] Jack: we men are all coarse. We never {{understand}} how exquisite a woman's sensibilities are. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{done such a}} thing! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you were}} going away," [...] she said, [...] "without a word I thought--you didn't care. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known that you were just--stupid?" ...|$|E
6000|$|They both {{admitted}} that they never had seen the key. [...] "And {{if it had been}} there <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> reached it?" [...] he continued.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But why,' {{said the}} young man, 'why run {{the chance of}} that {{occurring}} which so nearly happened? If Rose had--I cannot utter that word now--if this illness had terminated differently, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> you ever <b>have</b> forgiven yourself! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>have</b> know happiness again!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{accused me}} of knowing every thing, & reproached me for not having stopped the marriage. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I!</b> She <b>had</b> been shewn my letters, and every one else. It is utterly false that she ever opened the desk--the nurse {{had nothing to do}} with the separation-- ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS WARREN. Well, you shouldn't go {{off like}} that without letting me know. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> tell what <b>had</b> become of you? And night coming on too! ...|$|R
6000|$|Pray {{continue}} to write at your leisure. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> forgot {{so long to}} thank you for your obliging present, which I shall value on every account? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great Heavens, I'm not joking. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{the heart}} to joke at a moment like this, when the friend of my youth has {{suddenly}} become a social leper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Dunham! If {{you begin}} in that way, I can't talk to you. It shows that you're {{still out of}} your head. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in Venice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank Heaven for that," [...] his son {{answered}} fervently, {{with one}} hand on his breast, drawing a deep sigh as he spoke. [...] "You're my father, sir, and it isn't for me to reproach you; but if you had only done THAT--oh, my mother! my mother! I don't know, sir, I'm sure, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> forgiven you; <b>I</b> don't know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> kept my hands off you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{lips were}} upon mine before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak. She was drawing {{me away from}} the door. Her eyes, her arms, her whole body seemed to be {{pleading}} with me. Then suddenly there came a low knocking at the door. I stood away--no longer a prisoner. It was a wonderful intervention this! <b>How</b> else <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> escaped? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Delicious!" [...] Mr. Waddington replied. [...] "Most {{exquisite}} tobacco! Makes me shiver {{inside to}} think <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> smoked that other filthy rubbish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But, {{my dearest}} Katherine, the blow was as unlooked-for by me as by yourself. I had not, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> a remote {{suspicion}} {{of what was}} passing through his mind?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost my head so completely?" [...] she said, with a lenient {{amusement}} in her aberration {{which she}} was not always able to feel in her husband's.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{the courage}} to say a word, when I had nothing {{on the face of}} the earth to offer you but my {{worthless}} self?" [...] answered Tom, warmly.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lapham sighed helplessly. [...] "I shouldn't {{know how}} to get it in. It's so late now; I don't see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> the face." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{took time}} to {{consider}} this. [...] "I might have been vexed, or hurt, I suppose, but I don't see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> really <b>have</b> been offended." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has been}} my right hand from the very first," [...] Brooks said, slowly. [...] "I really don't see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done without her. She is such a capital organizer, too." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, I {{had always}} known {{that this was the}} one flaw in my dedication, but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} her to have the wit to see it? I was very depressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rebuke him! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> rebuked him? though I {{had never}} owned {{it to myself}} I now feel that I had loved him before he had ever spoken to me of love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you want}} me to tell you that you were irresistible? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sent you away? But you! What made you come back to me with your very heart on your lips?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{wondered}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been so unobservant as {{to overlook}} this. Here was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into liquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That {{makes the}} matter very different,' says she, {{turning up the}} whites of her eyes. 'How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>have</b> {{reconciled}} it to my conscience to see my blessed child married to a Papist? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>have</b> taken him to Molloyville? Well, this obstacle being removed, I must put myself {{no longer in the}} way between two young people. I must sacrifice myself; as <b>I</b> always <b>have</b> when my darling girl was in question. YOU shall see her, the poor dear lovely gentle sufferer, and learn your fate from her own lips.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{wondered}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{thought she}} looked white, or anything but burning red, when she answered {{that she had had}} it safe, a little while ago, she thought, but it was not worth looking for.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{as clear}} as day. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> missed it before? There it seemed to stand out almost legible on the flagstaff. I read it now with ease: [...] "Berry Pomeroy Athletic Club." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eza! of course!" [...] I exclaimed,--"certainly it is Eza! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{forgotten}} it? I am {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} reminding me {{of the name of}} that village. Perhaps you have been there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The rose that blossomed on {{her cheek}} faded in his. There {{was a moment of}} silence. Then he said frankly, [...] "I owe you some apology. Forgive my folly and {{impertinence}} a moment ago. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{stayed with}} him, anyhow," [...] she said. [...] "You know, he's been put back--he only gets two pounds fifteen a week now. He couldn't {{expect me to}} live upon that." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{first words}} were enough. <b>I</b> {{wondered}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> been in doubt. I knew the voice now. It was one which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not heard for five years, but one which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never forget if I lived for ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} don't--dash it!" [...] said Colonel Mant. [...] "We're coming to that. And I {{should like to}} begin by saying that, though in a sense it was my fault, I fail to see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> acted---" ...|$|R
