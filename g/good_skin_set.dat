40|$|PURPOSE: To report two new suture {{techniques}} for best esthetic skin healing. METHODS: Using the pig skin slices routinely employed for surgical technique training two {{new types of}} skin sutures were performed. One defined as inverted or hidden X point suture and other as totally hidden intradermal running suture. The first were performed using 4 - 0 polypropilene stitch and the intradermal with 4 - 0 poliglicolic stitch. RESULTS: It was confirmed <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> layers union and contention with best esthetic result than observed with the traditional X and intradermal suture techniques. CONCLUSION: Macroscopic examination of the hidden X point and totally hidden intra-dermal sutures and centrifuge <b>skin</b> traction confirmed <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> layers union and contention with best esthetic result than observed with the traditional X and intradermal sutures techniques...|$|R

40|$|Guinea-pigs {{sensitized}} by {{subcutaneous injection}} of chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) cells combined with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) displayed <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> reacitons 24 and 48 h after challenge with CLL cells. Equally good responses were also demonstrated using nuclei from the leukaemic cells {{in combination with}} BCG. These reactions were significantly greater than those produced {{in the same manner}} but without BCG. Sera form the animals were examined for the presence of antibodies against CLL cells by cytotoxicity and immunofluorescence techniques. Only samples from guinea-pigs innoculated with CLL cells were found to contain significant antibodies. Histological examination showed that whereas leukaemic cells persisted at the sensitizing injection site leukaemic cell nuclei could not be visualized. It is suggested that because leukaemic cell nuclei in combination with BCG are able to induce <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> reactivity without provoking a vigorous humoral antibody response they may have possible advantages over leukaemic cells when used for immunotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{consumer}} video conferencing, lighting {{conditions are}} usually not ideal thus the image qualities are poor. Lighting affects image quality on two aspects: brightness and skin tone. While {{there has been much}} research on improving the brightness of the captured images including contrast enhancement and noise removal (which {{can be thought of as}} components for brightness improvement), little attention has been paid to the skin tone aspect. In contrast, it is a common knowledge for professional stage lighting designers that lighting affects not only the brightness but also the color tone which plays a critical role in the perceived look of the host and the mood of the stage scene. Inspired by stage lighting design, we propose an active lighting system which automatically adjusts the lighting so that the image looks visually appealing. The system consists of computer controllable LED light sources of different colors so that it improves not only the brightness but also the skin tone of the face. Given that there is no quantitative formula on what makes a <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> tone, we use a data driven approach to learn a <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> tone model from a collection of photographs taken by professional photographers. We have developed a working system and conducted user studies to validate our approach. Index Terms—Active lighting, image quality, video conference, visual perception, skin tone I...|$|R

His Proserpine, like his model Jane Morris, is an exquisitely beautiful woman, with delicate facial features, slender hands, and flawlessly pale <b>skin</b> <b>set</b> off by her thick raven hair. Rossetti painted it at a time when his mental health was extremely precarious and his love for Jane Morris was at its most obsessive.|$|R

The proposed technique is novel and unique in that texture characteristics of the human skin are used to select appropriate skin color thresholds for skin segmentation. Two homogeneity measures for skin regions that take into account both global and local image features are also proposed.

50|$|A major {{constituent}} chemical, hyperforin, {{may be useful}} for treatment of alcoholism, although dosage, safety and efficacy have not been studied. Hyperforin has also displayed antibacterial properties against Gram-positive bacteria, although dosage, safety and efficacy has not been studied. Herbal medicine has also employed lipophilic extracts from St John's wort as a topical remedy for wounds, abrasions, burns, and muscle pain. The positive effects that have been observed are generally attributed to hyperforin due to its possible antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. For this reason hyperforin {{may be useful in}} the treatment of infected wounds and inflammatory skin diseases. In response to hyperforin's incorporation into a new bath oil, a study to assess potential skin irritation was conducted which found <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> tolerance of St John's wort.|$|R
40|$|The therapy of {{critically}} colonized or locally infected chronic wounds often {{demands a}} antiseptic treatment {{to ensure the}} removal of pathogenic micro-organisms {{that could lead to}} an infection. Therefore, wound dressings combined with antimicrobial agents such as silver, povidone-iodine or polihexanide are increasingly utilized. Polihexanide is regarded first choice for chronic wounds because of its <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> and wound tolerance beside its antimicrobial effectivity. Furthermore, it possesses the ability to induce proliferation in vitro as well as in animal models. The present study was able to show that polihexanide has a positive effect on the proliferation of human keratinocytes in concentrations up to 2 µg/ml. On the other hand, higher concentrations of polihexanide inhibit cell proliferation or were directly cytotoxic to the tested cell types in vitro...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in subcutaneous fat and the relative amounts of PUFAs in plasma in two groups of dogs. Group 1 included dogs with a <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> and coat condition. Group 2 was comprised of dogs with pruritus and compatible clinical signs of atopy. The fatty acid composition of the total lipid fraction was analyzed by gas chromatography. In subcutaneous fat, the concentration of adrenic acid (22 : 4 n- 6) was lower in the group of pruritic dogs compared to dogs with healthy skin. The amount of dihomogammalinolenic acid (20 : 3 n- 6; DGLA) in plasma lipids from pruritic dogs was higher than in dogs without skin problems...|$|R

40|$|Dermatotraction was {{evaluated}} {{as an alternative}} technique for the closure of dermatofasciotomy wounds, with a review of literature and of our clinical experience. The dermatotraction technique provides closure of fasciotomy wounds and avoids the use of skin grafting. Patients treated with dermatofasciotomy for an acute compartment syndrome of the limbs, without obvious tissue necrosis and without shock or urgent life saving surgery, had their fasciotomy wound closed with dermatotraction with vessel loops, the skin approximation system, or the prepositioned intracutaneous suture. In our experience, the mean time to wound closure was nine days. Dermatotraction techniques that cause local skin compression should be avoided because skin necrosis might occur (skin approximation system). Dermatotraction with vessel loops or the prepositioned intracutaneous suture provides <b>good</b> <b>skin</b> apposition without the necessity for skin grafting. status: publishe...|$|R
