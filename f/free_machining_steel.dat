50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> is steel {{that forms}} small chips when machined. This {{increases}} the machinability {{of the material}} by breaking the chips into small pieces, thus avoiding entanglement in the machinery. This enables automatic equipment to run without human interaction. <b>Free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> with lead also allow for higher machining rates. <b>Free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> costs 15 to 20% more than a standard steel, but this is made up by increased machining speeds, larger cuts, and longer tool life.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> are: ductility is decreased; impact resistance is reduced; copper-based brazed joints suffer from embrittlement with bismuth free machining grades; shrink fits {{are not as}} strong.|$|E
50|$|Free {{machining}} steels are {{carbon steels}} that have sulfur, lead, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, or phosphorus added. Sulfur forms the compound manganese sulfide, which {{is soft and}} acts as a chip-breaking discontinuity. It also acts as a dry lubricant to prevent a built up edge on the cutting tool. Lead works {{in a similar way}} to sulfur. Bismuth achieves a <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> by melting into a thin film of liquid for a fraction of a microsecond to lubricate the cut. Other advantages to bismuth include: more uniformly distributed because of its similar density to iron; more environmentally friendly, as compared to lead; still weldable.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface finish}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to measure}} the machinability of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built up edge. Stainless steel and other materials with a high strain hardening ability also want to form a built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked <b>steels,</b> and <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steels,</b> as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more machinable.|$|R
5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild <b>steels</b> and <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steels.</b> When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|R
50|$|Exors of James Mills were {{manufacturers}} of steel products for over 100 years, the company growing {{from a small}} building employing two men to the large Bredbury Steelworks on Lower Bents Lane, which at its height employed over 2,000 people. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, the company began to roll steel and to produce bright steel, at one point becoming the largest producer of bright steel outside the United States. Other products were added from time to time, including cotters for locomotives and rolling stock, engineer's keys, taper pins, grooved fastenings for securing all kinds of assemblies, railway permanent way fastenings, rail lubricators and hot pressings of various types. In 1938 the company introduced lead-bearing steels to the United Kingdom, and in the 1960s developed <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steels</b> containing tellurium and an alloy replacement steel. The company was later acquired by GKN and closed down in 1985. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.|$|R
40|$|Various {{sizes of}} step drills were {{manufactured}} by a CNC grinder machine {{and used in}} the drilling process with different speeds and feed rates to produce single step holes in S 1214 <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steel.</b> The performance of step drills was {{compared with that of}} conventional twist drills in the drilling of the <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> for the same task. The influences of drill size, feed rate and cutting speed on the performance of step drills were studied. Experimental results show that for better cutting performance, the small diameter should not be less than 60 % of the large diameter. Also, most of the changes in the characteristics of the thrust force were influenced by the smaller drill of the step drill. On the other hand, the small diameter part of the step drill only contributed about 30 % of the torque. From the experimental results, empirical equations for drilling thrust force and torque have been established for step drills...|$|E
40|$|Usually we {{know that}} in the cutting {{operation}} the side rake of the tool is 	the important angle which controls the sharpness of the tool，and it influences 	the cutting force，the built up edge，the crater and the shapes of the chips. 	So the authors have researched the relationship between the side rake of 	the tool and the cutting force for the <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steel</b> and the carbon 	steel，and investigated the possibility that the machinability could be judged 	by cutting ratio besides above mentioned usual four heads...|$|E

Some results showing the influence of higher temperatures (up to 800 °C) on the flow stress are also {{obtained from}} the machining tests by considering the flow along the tool-chip interface. These results show a dynamic strain-ageing effect similar to that found in high-speed tension and compression tests on similar materials...|$|E
40|$|Layered {{manufacturing}} (LM) {{is gaining}} ground for manufacturing prototypes (RP), tools (RT) and functional end products (RM). Laser and powder bed based manufacturing (i. e. selective laser sintering/melting or its variants) holds {{a special place}} within the variety of LM processes: no other LM techniques allow processing polymers, metals, ceramics {{as well as many}} types of composites. To do so, however, quite some different powder consolidation mechanisms are invoked: solid state sintering, liquid phase sintering, partial melting, full melting, chemical binding, etc. The paper describes which type of laser-induced consolidation can be applied to what type of material. It tries to understand the underlying physical mechanisms and the interaction with the material properties. The paper demonstrates that, although SLS/SLM (Selective Laser Sintering or Melting) can process polymers, metals, ceramics and composites, quite some limitations and problems cause the palette of applicable materials still to be limited. There {{is still a long way}} to go in tuning the processes and materials in order to enlarge the applicability of LM. This is not surprising if one compares it to the decades of R&D work devoted to tuning processes and materials for hot or cold forming, metal cutting (e. g. development of <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> <b>steels),</b> casting and injection moulding (including powder injection moulding: MIM, CIM, etc.) Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
40|$|The all {{weld metal}} tensile {{properties}} from gas tungsten arc and electron beam welds in <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> austenitic stainless <b>steels</b> have been determined. Ten heats with sulfur contents from 0. 04 to 0. 4 wt. % {{and a wide}} range in Creq/Nieq ratios were studied. Tensile properties of welds with both processes were related to alloy composition and solidification microstructure. The yield and ultimate tensile strengths increased with increasing Creq/Nieq ratios and ferrite content, whereas the ductility measured by RA at fracture decreased with sulfur content. Nevertheless, a range in alloy compositions was identified that provided a good combination of both strength and ductility. The solidification cracking response for the same large range of compositions are discussed, and compositions identified that {{would be expected to}} provide good performance in welded applications...|$|R
40|$|The weld {{solidification}} {{and cracking}} behavior of sulfur bearing <b>free</b> <b>machining</b> austenitic stainless <b>steel</b> was investigated for both gas-tungsten arc (GTA) and pulsed laser beam weld processes. The GTA weld solidification {{was consistent with}} those predicted with existing solidification diagrams and the cracking response was controlled primarily by solidification mode. The solidification behavior of the pulsed laser welds was complex, and often contained regions of primary ferrite and primary austenite solidification, although in all cases the welds {{were found to be}} completely austenite at room temperature. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) pattern analysis indicated that the nature of the base metal at the time of solidification plays a primary role in initial solidification. The solid state transformation of austenite to ferrite at the fusion zone boundary, and ferrite to austenite on cooling may both be massive in nature. A range of alloy compositions that exhibited good resistance to solidification cracking and was compatible with both welding processes was identified. The compositional range is bounded by laser weldability at lower Cr{sub eq}/Ni{sub eq} ratios and by the GTA weldability at higher ratios. It was found with both processes that the limiting ratios were somewhat dependent upon sulfur content...|$|R
