5|$|Induction <b>generators,</b> {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine <b>generators</b> behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction <b>generators</b> cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous <b>generators.</b>|$|E

To the best of our knowledge, our prototype is the first succesfully implemented hand-written program <b>generator</b> <b>generator</b> for a statically typed language. ...|$|R
