50|$|The {{running gear}} {{and most other}} {{components}} stayed the same from the XM through to the XP. All of the utility, sedan delivery, and taxi/police kit vehicles had five-lug 13-inch wheels and larger 10-inch drum brakes, as had all previous commercial models. Commercials had always had lower-ratio differentials (4.00:1) and larger 6.70 x 13 tyres. The high-end Fairmonts came with 14-inch four-lug wheels to accommodate the standard disc brakes on this model, whereas other models had 13-inch wheels if disc brakes were not optioned. Fairmonts featured bucket seats, the 200 ci Super Pursuit engine initially in four-main bearing form and finally with the imported seven-main bearing unit, three-speed automatic transmission, and a padded dash along with carpets, perforated, colour-matched headlining, blower <b>heater,</b> <b>screen</b> washers, chrome-plated interior mirror, seven interior door-operated lights, and a handbrake on warning light flasher as standard. Vacuum-assisted disc brakes were standard in the Fairmont only and optional on other sedan and hardtop models.|$|E

50|$|Both {{standard}} and de-luxe versions were offered. The de-luxe package included a <b>heater,</b> manual <b>screen</b> washer, twin sun visors, twin horns, bumper over-riders, a clock and leather-covered seat. A two-tone paint scheme and a radio were available as options.|$|R
40|$|A <b>screen</b> <b>heater</b> with a gas sweep was {{developed}} and applied to study the pyrolysis kinetics of low density polyethene (LDPE) and polypropene (PP) at temperatures ranging from 450 to 530 °C. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the applicability of <b>screen</b> <b>heaters</b> to measure these kinetics. On-line measurement of the rate of volatiles formation using a hydrocarbon analyzer was applied to enable the determination of the conversion rate over the entire conversion range on the basis of a single experiment. Another important feature of the <b>screen</b> <b>heater</b> used in this study is the possibility to measure pyrolysis kinetics under nearly isothermal conditions. The influence of the mixing process in the gas phase on the measured hydrocarbon concentration versus time curve was assessed and it was demonstrated that the residence time distribution of the gas phase, which has to be accounted for to correctly interpret the experiments, becomes the limiting factor when measuring pyrolysis kinetics at high temperatures and not the heat transfer rate. With this type of apparatus, pyrolysis reactions with a first order rate constant lower than 2 s- 1 can be studied, which implies that the pyrolysis kinetics of the forementioned polymers could be determined at temperatures below 530 °C. The kinetic constants for LDPE and PP pyrolysis were determined, using a first order model to describe the conversion rate in the 70 - 90 % conversion range and the random chain dissociation model for the entire conversion range. Our experiments revealed that both LDPE and PP posses the same conversion rate, which is unexpected behavior since PP should be more sensitive to thermal degradation than LDPE. A comparison of the thermo gravimetric analyzer results with those obtained with the <b>screen</b> <b>heater</b> indicates an enhancement of the pyrolysis kinetics in the latter equipment. Several hypothesis were tested to explain this phenomenon and led to the suspicion that the discrepancy is possibly due to the effect of the electrical current passing through the screen on the pyrolysis reaction, although most of the evidence for this hypothesis is indirect. <b>Screen</b> <b>heaters</b> can therefore not be used in this configuration to measure the pyrolysis kinetics, if this hypothesis is correct. In addition to the experimental work two single particle models have been developed which both incorporate a mass and a (coupled) enthalpy balance, which were used to assess the influence of internal and external heat transfer processes on the pyrolysis process. The first model assumes a variable density and constant volume during the pyrolysis process, whereas the second model assumes a constant density and a variable volume. An important feature of these models is that they can accommodate kinetic models for which no analytical representation of the pyrolysis kinetics is available. Model calculations revealed that heat transfer limitations were not important during the pyrolysis experiments performed in the <b>screen</b> <b>heater</b> and could not explain the forementioned results...|$|R
40|$|NASA LeRC is {{developing}} a 30 cm diameter xenon ion thruster for auxiliary and primary propulsion applications. To maximize expectations for user-acceptance of ion propulsion technology, NASA LeRC, through their Electric Propulsion Outreach Program, is providing sectors of industry with portable power consoles for operation of 5 KW-class xenon ion thrusters. This power console provides all necessary functions to permit thruster operations over a 0. 5 - 5 KW envelope under both manual and automated control. These functions include the following: discharge, cathode heater, neutralizer keeper, and neutralizer <b>heater</b> currents, <b>screen</b> and accelerator voltages, and a gas feed system to regulate and control propellant flow to the thruster. An electronic circuit monitors screen and accelerator currents and controls arcing events. The power console was successfully integrated with the NASA 30 cm thruster...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results on}} the primary pyrolysis products of organosolv lignin at temperatures between 360 and 700 °C. To study the primary products, a vacuum <b>screen</b> <b>heater</b> (heating rate of 8000 °C/s, deep vacuum of 0. 7 mbar, and very fast cooling at the wall temperature of − 100 °C) was used. The effect of the temperature on the primary and secondary lignin products was studied with a fluidized-bed pyrolysis reactor (Treactor between 330 and 580 °C) with pine wood. The results obtained with the <b>screen</b> <b>heater</b> show that the primary products of lignin were oligomers. Between 450 and 700 °C, the yield of these oligomers was very high, between 80 and 90 %. After formation, the oligomers left the particle by evaporation or thermal ejection. Monophenols and other light compounds were formed by secondary reactions inside the particle or in the vapor phase. In the fluidized-bed reactor, significant quantities of lignin oligomers were formed along with monophenols, water, and other light compounds. The changes on the yield and composition of the lignin-derived oligomers {{as a function of}} the pyrolysis temperature are reported. The lignin oligomers were isolated by cold-water precipitation and analyzed with thermogravimetry (TG), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py–GC/MS), electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (ESI–MS), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR). The yield of lignin-derived oligomers reached a maximum between 450 and 580 °C. The differential thermogravimetry (DTG) results show the existence of three major peaks, which where maximal between 450 and 480 °C, indicating that not only the yield but also the structure of the lignin oligomers changed at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Py–GC/MS and 1 H NMR results indicated that, as the temperature increased, the content of methoxylated phenols decreased and the content of alkylated phenols increased. FTIR spectroscopy revealed an increase in carbonyl groups produced by carbonylation reactions, from the hydroxyl groups or the cleavage of ether bonds. Both ESI–MS and GPC results show a negligible effect of the pyrolysis temperature on the molar weight distribution. This result differs with the increase in the molecular weight observed for organosolv lignin pyrolyzed in the <b>screen</b> <b>heater</b> and highlights the importance of secondary reactions on the outcome of fast pyrolysis reactors...|$|R
5000|$|The Tasmin was {{the first}} {{production}} car {{in the world to}} have both a bonded windscreen and also to incorporate the aerial in the rear <b>screen</b> <b>heater</b> element. As with all TVRs, the running gear was located in a tubular spaceframe steel chassis which was powder coated for extra corrosion resistance. Much of the running gear was sourced from Fords of the period. The suspension and steering was sourced from the Ford Cortina, with TVR engineered rear wishbones. Gearboxes were from the Cortina, Granada, and Sierra. Brakes were discs all round, with the front units from the Granada. The differential (and rear brakes) was from the Jaguar XJ-S.|$|R
5000|$|The 1HD-FT is a 4.2 L (4164 cc) straight-6 24 valve SOHC {{turbocharged}} {{diesel engine}} of direct injection design. Bore is 94 mm and stroke is 100 mm, with a compression ratio of 18.6:1.

40|$|Buildup {{of scale}} in the kraft {{digester}} and black liquor evaporators is {{a major contributor to}} lost pulp mill productivity. Scale deposition occurs in areas such as the <b>heaters</b> and extraction <b>screens</b> of continuous digesters and the liquor side of heat-transfer surfaces in the evaporators. This reduces the efficiency and control of pulping and evaporation processes and eventually forces the costly cleaning of equipment. Since kraft pulping conditions require high temperatures and a high concentration of calcium and carbonate in alkaline liquors, the precipitation of CaCO 3 is inevitable. 1 raditionally, scaling tendencies have been managed using process control methods to reduce deposition rates. This paper examines the thermodynamic principles behind such process modifications while introducing the kinetic steps of the overall deposition pathway. Chemical additives that interfere with and retard the individual steps of the overall scaling mechanism can help to further reduce deposition rates...|$|R
40|$|Rockwell Collins has {{developed}} a robust, repeatable, low cost lamination process that utilizes a dry bond technology (using PSA) to directly couple substrates to display technology such as liquid crystal displays (LCD’s) and {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLED’s). These substrates can serve as protective covers, reflection mitigation, <b>heaters,</b> filters, touch <b>screens,</b> environmental barriers, etc. This resultant assembly is very rugged; shock, impact, and vibration resistant, while maximizing optical performance. The optical requirements for these applications can be quite demanding, especially for cockpit applications. This paper will discuss the optical requirements used to qualify an adhesive for use in display applications. The optical requirements will include total specular reflectance for a full display stack, spectral specular reflectance by layer, diffuse reflectance, birefringence, and internal transmission. In addition, key environmental tests required for avionics display applications will be defined. This section will include thermal and humidity profiles, altitude, solar exposure, and boot-kick requirements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a project where selected energy conservation measures in two Habitat for Humanity houses in Houston, Texas were measured using side-by- side measurements of identical houses and calibrated simulation. The measures include shell tightening, improved A/C efficiency, {{modifications to the}} DHW <b>heater,</b> and solar <b>screens.</b> To perform the analysis both houses were instrumented with hourly data loggers {{for more than one}} year to record energy use and environmental conditions and the data analyzed using several methods including an inverse fourier series method and calibrated DOE- 2 simulations. The results indicate that several of the energy conservation measures performed as estimated when all confounding factors were removed using simulation. The confounding factors that needed to be normalized with the simulation included: the weather conditions, Merences in the life styles of the two houses, and omissions {{in the construction of the}} houses (Bou-Saada, et al. 1998). This paper discusses the instrumentation installed in the houses and the efforts that were undertaken to calibrate the DOE- 2 simulation to the energy efficient house. The paper by Haberl et al.

40|$|The {{combustion}} kinetics of rapidly pyrolyzed wood {{have been investigated}} within the temperature range of 573 - 773 K and the oxygen concentration range of 2. 25 - 36 vol %. These kinetics are, for instance, required {{for the design of}} a char combustion section in an integrated flash pyrolysis pilot plant. Two different experimental techniques were used: a standard thermogravimetrical technique (TGA) and flue gas analysis after combustion in a diluted packed bed. The pyrolysis char was prepared in a small <b>screen</b> <b>heater</b> reactor, enabling heating rates of over 300 K/s. The results of the TGA and the packed-bed measurements are in good agreement for temperatures above 648 K. Below that temperature, the reaction rate observed in the TGA appears to be (up to 1. 5 times) lower than that in the packed-bed reactor. The {{combustion kinetics}} can be described by the following simple rate equation which has an average deviation of 20 %: r = 5. 3 × 10 5 e - 125 × 10 3 /RTP O 2 0. 53 (1 - X) 0. 49. Several pore models reported in the literature were tested against the experimental data, but they could not improve the accuracy of the fit. In comparison with available data, this specific type of char shows a notably higher rate of combustion...|$|R
