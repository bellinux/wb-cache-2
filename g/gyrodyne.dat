5|$|By {{the time}} of the Korean War, {{helicopters}} had replaced floatplanes and the Sikorsky HO3S-1 helicopter was employed. New Jersey made use of the <b>Gyrodyne</b> QH-50 DASH drone for her Vietnam war deployment in 1968–1969.|$|E
25|$|The Marine Corps {{eventually}} {{concluded that}} both the RON, and the competing Hiller ROE were too heavy and too difficult to fly and abandoned the project. The United States Navy, however, had noticed the compact size and high load-carrying capacity of the RON, and in 1960 awarded a contract to <b>Gyrodyne</b> to produce a radio-controlled drone version of the Rotorcycle, {{to be used as}} an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) platform. Using the dynamic components of the RON, this was eventually developed as the <b>Gyrodyne</b> QH-50.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} British VTOL {{project was}} the <b>gyrodyne,</b> where a rotor is powered during take-off and landing but which then freewheels during flight, with separate propulsion engines providing forward thrust. Starting with the Fairey <b>Gyrodyne,</b> {{this type of}} aircraft later evolved into the much larger twin-engined Fairey Rotodyne, that used tipjets to power the rotor on take-off and landing but which then used two Napier Eland turboprops driving conventional propellers mounted on substantial wings to provide propulsion, the wings serving to unload the rotor during horizontal flight. The Rotodyne was developed to combine the efficiency of a fixed-wing aircraft at cruise with the VTOL capability of a helicopter to provide short haul airliner service from city centres to airports.|$|E

25|$|Gyrodynes {{are also}} known as {{compound}} helicopters or compound gyroplanes. A <b>gyrodyne</b> has the powered rotor of a helicopter with a separate forward thrust system of an autogyro. Apart from take-off and landing the rotor may be unpowered and autorotate. Designs may also include stub wings for added lift.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gyrodyne</b> {{purchased}} {{the assets of}} Bendix Helicopters in 1949, including the Model 2C coaxial helicopter which provided the technology for the XRON-I. In 1951 the Model 2C was demonstrated to the Navy with shortcomings noted in autorotation control. The XRON-I was demonstrated under a new Navy contract NOas 55-388-c for a lightweight single man helicopter.|$|E
25|$|The second prototype, {{registered}} G-APTX flew on 5 September 1959 {{and flight}} testing continued, but the British helicopter industry {{was in a}} state of flux; the entire industry was being consolidated under Westland with the company's purchase of the helicopter divisions of Saunders-Roe, Bristol and Fairey. In the process, Westland acquired two potential rivals to the Westminster: the projected Bristol 194 and the Fairey Rotodyne (a <b>gyrodyne</b> design). Rationalisation was necessary and since the Rotodyne was already flying and government funded, work on the Westminster ceased in September 1960.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gyrodyne's</b> {{headquarters}} {{are located}} in Saint James, New York in Eastern Long Island. It was founded in 1946, initially as a helicopter design and manufacturing company.|$|R
50|$|Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a {{spinning}} rotor with aerofoil section blades (a rotary wing) to provide lift. Types include helicopters, autogyros, and various hybrids such as <b>gyrodynes</b> and compound rotorcraft.|$|R
50|$|On 8 July 1992, at 12:38 UTC Kaleri {{started his}} first career spacewalk. During the spacewalk, he and {{cosmonaut}} Aleksandr Viktorenko inspected some of Mir's <b>gyrodynes.</b> The spacewalk lasted 2 hours and 3 minutes.|$|R
25|$|There {{was also}} an {{interest}} in producing rotorcraft that made use of tip-driven rotors, which {{had the advantage of}} avoiding the torque that would be produced by rotors driven by a conventional transmission as well as the consequential requirement to incorporate a complicated and vulnerable torque-compensating tail rotor. Some contemporary designs, such as the Sud-Ouest Djinn, bled high pressure air from the engine directly to the tips; Fairey had been conducting work into a drive where this air was mixed with fuel at the tips and burned. Such methods had already been flight tested on the Fairey Jet <b>Gyrodyne,</b> and Fairey decided that the technique would be suitable for a compact rotorcraft.|$|E
25|$|So-called tipjets, {{actually}} {{hydrogen peroxide}} rockets, are {{placed at the}} tips of the rotor. The rockets are used only during takeoff and emergency landing, so they do not consume much propellant. The hydrogen peroxide rockets are light-weight, inexpensive, reliable, noisy, and transform the autogyro into an aircraft that has almost all the advantages of a helicopter (specifically vertical takeoffs and landings) {{at a fraction of the}} helicopter cost. Furthermore, the engine weight and engine power may be reduced by half because a smaller engine is needed for takeoff. The Fairey Jet <b>Gyrodyne</b> and Fairey Rotodyne had true tipjets instead of the rockets. They were technically successful but were not mass-produced due to concerns about tipjet noise.|$|E
500|$|It was {{originally}} planned that the ports would connect to [...] modules {{derived from the}} Soyuz spacecraft. These modules would have used a Soyuz propulsion module, as in Soyuz and Progress, and the descent and orbital modules would have been replaced with a long laboratory module. Following a February 1979 governmental resolution, the programme was consolidated with Vladimir Chelomei's manned Almaz military space station programme. The docking ports were reinforced to accommodate [...] space station modules based on the TKS spacecraft. NPO Energia {{was responsible for the}} overall space station, with work subcontracted to KB Salyut, due to ongoing work on the Energia rocket and Salyut 7, Soyuz-T, and Progress spacecraft. KB Salyut began work in 1979, and drawings were released in 1982 and 1983. New systems incorporated into the station included the Salyut 5B digital flight control computer and <b>gyrodyne</b> flywheels (taken from Almaz), Kurs automatic rendezvous system, Luch satellite communications system, Elektron oxygen generators, and Vozdukh carbon dioxide scrubbers.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, the gyrostat {{concept is}} used in the design of {{attitude}} control systems for orbiting spacecraft and satellites. For instance, the Mir space station had three pairs of internally mounted flywheels known as <b>gyrodynes</b> or control moment gyros.|$|R
50|$|Displayed in {{the museum}} are single and multi-rotor helicopters, gyrocopters, <b>gyrodynes</b> as well as {{numerous}} helicopter models, historical photos, working models of rotors, technical demonstration and teaching material, parts, tools or equipment for helicopters. A helicopter simulator is available for museum visitors.|$|R
50|$|Kvant-2 was {{the first}} Mir module based on the TKS spacecraft. Kvant-2 was divided into three {{compartment}}s. They were the EVA airlock, the instrument/cargo compartment, and the instrument/experiment compartment. The instrument/cargo compartment could be sealed off and act as an extension or a back-up to the airlock. Before Kvant-2 docked to the station, EVAs had to be carried by depressurizing the docking node on the Core Module. Kvant-2 also carried the Soviet version of the Manned Maneuvering Unit for the Orlan space suit. It delivered the Salyut 5B computer which was an improvement over the Argon 16B computer already on the station. Kvant-2 had a system for regenerating water from urine and a shower for personal hygiene. It carried six <b>gyrodynes</b> to augment those already located in Kvant-1. Unlike Kvant-1, Kvant-2's <b>gyrodynes</b> were only accessible from the exterior {{which turned out to}} make replacement of failed ones more difficult.|$|R
2500|$|The Research and Development Park {{is located}} on Stony Brook Road, {{a mile from the}} center of campus. On November 3, 2005, the University {{announced}} that it had formally acquired [...] of the adjacent Flowerfield property, originally owned by the St. James <b>Gyrodyne</b> Company of America, through eminent domain, three years after the University had expressed its desire to acquire the property.|$|E
2500|$|The XRON-I uses a {{manually}} started 40hp two-cycle engine with a {{gross weight}} capability of 500lb. The fuselage {{is a simple}} box-beam construction. The rotor uses co-axial blades which alleviate {{the need for an}} anti-torque tail rotor. Yaw control is provided by rotor tip mounted [...] "tip brakes" [...] providing differential torque between the rotors. <b>Gyrodyne</b> patented the control on 24 October 1954 Patent No. 2,835,331. There is a small inverted V-tail for control at forward speeds. The rotors are laminated wood construction. The mast is pressure lubricated and becomes a cooling surface for oil inflight. The landing gear consists of three small wheels.|$|E
2500|$|CMGs {{were used}} for {{attitude}} control on the Salyut and Mir space stations, where they were called gyrodynes (from the Russian гиродин girodin; this word is also sometimes used [...] especially by Russian crew [...] for the CMGs on the ISS). They were first tested on Salyut 3 in 1974, and introduced as standard components from Salyut 6 onwards. The completed Mir station had twelve gyrodynes altogether, starting with six in the pressurised interior of the Kvant-1 module. These were later supplemented by another six on the unpressurised outside of Kvant-2. According to NPO Energia, putting them outside {{turned out to be}} a mistake, as it made <b>gyrodyne</b> replacement much more difficult.|$|E
50|$|The prototype's {{engine was}} {{normally}} aspirated, and hence limited to just 320 hp (240 kW) and the aircraft went about 173 mph (270 km/h); {{which is still}} ~40% faster than a conventional autogyro but slower than <b>gyrodynes</b> of the 1950s. A custom gyroplane can go 168.29 km/h (104.6 mph), and Carter says the Carter Personal Air Vehicle goes 200 mph.|$|R
50|$|Flowerfield is the {{location}} of <b>Gyrodyne's</b> headquarters and is the former site of the helicopter manufacturing facility. It is located in Saint James, New York, 50 miles east of New York City. Flowerfield is a 68-acre property with 127,062 square feet of rentable space zoned primarily for light industry. Initially more than 300 acres, most of the Flowerfield property was taken by SUNY Stony Brook under eminent domain in 2005.|$|R
500|$|The {{attitude}} (orientation) of {{the station}} was independently determined {{by a set of}} externally mounted sun, star and horizon sensors. [...] Attitude information was conveyed between updates by rate sensors. Attitude control was maintained by a combination of two mechanisms; in order to hold a set attitude, a system of twelve control moment gyroscopes (CMGs, or [...] "gyrodynes") rotating at 10,000rpm kept the station oriented, six CMGs being located in each of the Kvant-1 and Kvant-2 modules. When the attitude {{of the station}} needed to be changed, the <b>gyrodynes</b> were disengaged, thrusters (including those mounted directly to the modules, and the VDU thruster used for roll control mounted to the Sofora girder) were used to attain the new attitude and the CMGs were reengaged. This was done fairly regularly depending on experimental needs; for instance, Earth or astronomical observations required that the instrument recording images be continuously aimed at the target, and so the station was oriented to make this possible. Conversely, materials processing experiments required the minimisation of movement on board the station, and so Mir would be oriented in a gravity gradient attitude for stability. Prior to the arrival of the modules containing these <b>gyrodynes,</b> the station's attitude was controlled using thrusters located on the core module alone, and, in an emergency, the thrusters on docked Soyuz spacecraft could be used to maintain the station's orientation.|$|R
2500|$|Frost {{was persuaded}} {{to move to}} Canada in 1947, shortly after the {{completion}} of the design of the Swallow, where he joined A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada). To him, this was an ideal opportunity – there was a promising project to work on and a chance {{to get away from the}} depressing conditions of postwar Britain. At the time, his wife, Joan, was living in the north of England while Frost worked at Hatfield, near London. Accommodations for many young couples were similarly strained. During his tenure at de Havilland, Frost began to put forward a number of unique ideas for a tip jet-driven rotor helicopter – a concept also known as a <b>gyrodyne.</b> He continued his research privately and with a group of friends, including fellow engineer, T. Desmond Earl, built a scale model to test his theories. Shortly after his departure to Canada, Earl joined Frost in his new venture, and remained his [...] "right-hand man" [...] for the rest of the Canadian period.|$|E

50|$|The Jet <b>Gyrodyne</b> was a {{modification}} of the second prototype FB-1 <b>Gyrodyne</b> aircraft registered G-AJJP. The Jet <b>Gyrodyne</b> was built specifically to develop the pressure-jet rotor drive system and operational procedures used on the later Rotodyne.|$|E
5000|$|A {{rotorcraft}} or {{rotary-wing aircraft}} is a heavier-than-air flying machine that uses lift generated by wings, called rotary wings or rotor blades, that revolve around a mast. Several rotor blades {{mounted on a}} single mast {{are referred to as}} a rotor. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines a rotorcraft as [...] "supported in flight by the reactions of the air on one or more rotors". Rotorcraft generally include those aircraft where one or more rotors are required to provide lift throughout the entire flight, such as helicopters, cyclocopters, autogyros, and <b>gyrodynes.</b> Compound rotorcraft may also include additional thrust engines or propellers and static lifting surfaces.|$|R
500|$|In November 2000, Rosaviakosmos {{decided to}} deorbit Mir, {{and the next}} month Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov signed an order to do so. By this stage Mir was well past {{the end of its}} design life, and Rosaviakosmos General Director Yuri Koptev {{believed}} that [...] "any of its systems could well fail at any time". Therefore, it was decided to deorbit it whilst it was still functioning, rather than risk it falling back to Earth out of control, like Skylab in 1979 and Salyut 7 in 1991, potentially dropping debris over a populated area. At the time, Mir was the largest spacecraft ever to reenter the Earth's atmosphere, and there were concerns that sizeable pieces of debris, particularly from the docking assemblies, <b>gyrodynes</b> and external structure, could survive reentry.|$|R
5|$|Salyut 6, {{launched}} on a Proton 8K82K rocket on 29 September 1977, marked {{the switch from}} engineering development stations to routine operations, and united the most effective elements {{from each of the}} previous stations. Its navigation system, made up of the Delta semi-automatic computer to depict the station's orbit and the Kaskad system to control its orientation, was based on that used on Salyut 4, as was its power system, which consisted of a trio of steerable solar panels together producing a peak of 4kilowatts of power over 51m². The station's thermal regulation systems, which made use of a sophisticated arrangement of insulation and radiators, was also derived from that used on Salyut 4. In addition, Salyut 6 made use of environmental systems first used on Salyut 3, and controlled its orientation using <b>gyrodynes</b> first tested on that station.|$|R
50|$|The Fairey Jet <b>Gyrodyne</b> was a British {{experimental}} compound autogyro {{built by}} the Fairey Aviation Company that incorporated helicopter, <b>gyrodyne</b> and autogyro characteristics. The Jet <b>Gyrodyne</b> {{was the subject of}} a Ministry of Supply (MoS) research contract to gather data for the follow-up design, the Rotodyne.|$|E
50|$|The Cierva Autogiro Company, Ltd's, C.41 <b>gyrodyne</b> pre-WW2 {{design study}} was updated and built by Fairey Aviation as the FB-1 <b>Gyrodyne</b> commencing in 1945. Fairey's {{development}} efforts were initially led by Bennett, followed by his successor Dr. George S. Hislop. George B.L. Ellis and Frederick L. Hodgess, engineers from the pre-WW2 Cierva Autogiro Company, Ltd., joined Bennett at Fairey Aviation. The first Fairey <b>Gyrodyne</b> prototype crashed during a test flight, killing the crew. The second <b>Gyrodyne</b> prototype was rebuilt as the Jet <b>Gyrodyne</b> {{and used to}} develop a pressure-jet rotor drive system later for the Rotodyne transport compound gyroplane. At the tip of each stub wing were rearward-facing propellers which provided both yaw control and propulsion in forward flight. The Jet <b>Gyrodyne</b> flew in 1954, and made a true transition from vertical to horizontal flight in March 1955.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, <b>Gyrodyne</b> {{became a}} {{publicly}} traded Real Estate Investment Trust. Around this time, <b>Gyrodyne</b> began focusing on purchasing medical properties. Since then, the company has bought three such facilities: two in New York, and one in Northern Virginia.|$|E
50|$|At the time, Mir was {{the largest}} {{spacecraft}} ever to reenter the Earth's atmosphere, and there were concerns that sizeable pieces of debris, particularly from the docking assemblies, <b>gyrodynes</b> and external structure, could survive reentry. Amid debris fall, New Zealand issued international warnings to ships and aircraft traveling in the South Pacific area. Deputy director of New Zealand's Maritime Safety Authority, Tony Martin, said that the chances of debris hitting ships would be very small. A similar situation occurred in Japan, whose residents were warned to stay indoors during the forty-minute period when debris was most likely to fall. The local officials admitted that the chances of an accident were very unlikely. The location of Mir announced after re-entry was 160°W 40°S with a debris spread of ±1,500 kilometres along track and ±100 kilometres laterally, reduced from the earlier estimate due to the steeper re-entry angle.|$|R
