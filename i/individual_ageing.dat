40|$|Because {{they are}} non-linear, {{biological}} systems are often characterized by emergent properties, multiple steady states, and thresholds. These are now well understood and appreciated in ecology; {{they are also}} important components for understanding life span, at both {{the level of the}} population and the level of the individual, and allow novel insights into the biology of ageing and longevity. The deceleration of mortality rate at later ages can be understood as an emergent property, {{in the sense of a}} macroscopic phenomenon (population mortality rate) arising (in this case, without interaction) from different microscopic ones (individual mortality). Models of <b>individual</b> <b>ageing</b> based on the autocatalysis and inhibition of replicating units lead to multiple stable steady states separated by thresholds. These systems respond to environmental challenges and this response leads to individual ontogeny of ageing; the environment thus sets a stochastic clock.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{presents}} a theoretical analysis {{and discussion of}} the theory of gerotranscendence, formulated by Lars Tornstam (University of Uppsala, Sweden). The theory is presented as a meta-theory of ageing, as a theory of universal and general ageing processes. Ageing is seen as an urge (a drive) towards a less engaged posititon in the wordly life, moving towards a higher degree of transcendence, with a more cosmic outlook and another definition of reality. In this article the theory is discussed from another theoretical position; Ageing seen in a cultural gerontological perspective, as a varied culturally and historically situated phenomenon – differing in different times and different cultures. The theoretical perspective underlines that ageing is complex dialectical processes, an intertwined interplay between individual development and cultural change. The varied <b>individual</b> <b>ageing</b> processes are not seen as the result of «drives». In Western post-modern cultures the ageing processes are becoming manifold, often contradictory. Elderly present versions of the selves that are becoming complex, multiplied (multiple selves), acting at different scenes, stamped by varied cultural values, presenting mixed versions of activity and passivity, engagement and retractment, wordliness and transcendence.

40|$|Abstract Background We present concept, study {{protocol}} and selected baseline {{data of the}} Longitudinal Urban Cohort Ageing Study (LUCAS) in Germany. LUCAS is a long-running cohort study of community-dwelling seniors complemented by specific studies of geriatric patients or diseases. Aims were to (1) Describe <b>individual</b> <b>ageing</b> trajectories in a metropolitan setting, documenting changes in functional status, the onset of frailty, disability and need of care; (2) Find determinants of healthy ageing; (3) Assess long-term effects of specific health promotion interventions; (4) Produce results for health care planning for fit, pre-frail, frail and disabled elderly persons; (5) Set up a framework for embedded studies to investigate various hypotheses in specific subgroups of elderly. Methods/Design In 2000, twenty-one general practitioners (GPs) were recruited in the Hamburg metropolitan area; they generated lists of all their patients 60 [*]years and older. Persons not terminally ill, without daily need of assistance or professional care were eligible. Of these, n[*]=[*] 3, 326 (48 [*]%) agreed to participate and completed a small (baseline) and an extensive health questionnaire (wave 1). In 2007 / 2008, a re-recruitment took place including 2, 012 participants: 743 men, 1, 269 women (647 deaths, 197 losses, 470 declined further participation). In 2009 / 2010 n[*]=[*] 1, 627 returned the questionnaire (90 deaths, 47 losses, 248 declined further participation) resulting in a good participation rate over ten years with limited and quantified dropouts. Presently, follow-up data from 2007 / 2008 (wave 2) and 2009 / 2010 (wave 3) are available. Data wave 4 is due in 2011 / 2012, and the project will be continued until 2013. Information on survival and need of nursing care was collected continuously and cross-checked against official records. We used Fisher’s exact test and t-tests. The study served repeatedly to evaluate health promotion interventions and concepts. Discussion LUCAS shows that a cohort study of older persons is feasible and can maintain a good participation rate over ten years, even when extensive self-reported health data are collected repeatedly through self-filled questionnaires. Evidently individual health developments of elderly persons can be tracked quantifying simultaneously behaviour, co-morbidity, functional competence and their changes. In future, we expect to generate results of significance about the five study aims listed above. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the youth are overall apathetic towards political activities {{and that such}} apathy is evidenced in low voter turnout during elections. Such conventional wisdom seems to be based mainly on findings in Western democracies and generates concern as to the future nature and resilience of democracy. When a significantly {{large proportion of the}} voting population shows apathetic attitudes towards the processes that enable participation of the public in democracy, it questions {{the extent to which a}} democracy can be consolidated. In the past the South African youth played an important role in the process of transformation to democracy and thereby possibly left a legacy of youth involvement. However, in the developing world, which includes South Africa, the youth seems to show the same sort of abstaining behaviour as their Western counterparts towards elections. This is problematic as the South African youth comprises a significantly large proportion of the voting population. This dissertation focuses on South African university youth and their political and voting behaviour. They have been chosen for the focus of this study as they are widely considered to be the future elite and leadership of South Africa. The aim of this study is to determine the extent to which Western scholarly explanations of youth voting behaviour can be applied to South African university youth. Western literature on voting behaviour identifies various models of voting behaviour (which comprise the Sociological Model, Michigan Model, Party Identification Model, Media/Dominant Ideology Model and Rational Choice Model) and age effects on voting behaviour (Cohort Effect, <b>Individual</b> <b>Ageing</b> Effect and Life Cycle Effect). Each of these seeks to explain voting behaviour and in order to determine how applicable they are to South African university youth, an analytical framework was developed in order to analyse and interpret the data gathered by means of questionnaires and focus group discussions. Ultimately it was found that most Western models and age effects are to some extent applicable in explaining the voting behaviour of South African university youth (albeit to a greater or lesser extent).

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The project collected three main types of data: (1) A {{second wave of}} a 2002 household surveys in Brazil and South Africa, which sampled just over 1000 households each in the Western and Eastern Cape region of South Africa, and Rio and Ilheus in Brazil, was collected in 2008. The sample frame in both countries was provided by census areas, the sample was proportionate to size, and stratified by {{urban and rural areas}} in Brazil and South Africa, and additionally by race in South Africa. The survey instruments included (i) a household questionnaire with a section collecting information on all household members; and (ii) and a supplement collected on all household members aged 60 and over, with questions on their entitlements, relations to other household members, health status, goals, social networks and community participation, and income decisions. The instruments were similar in all respects across the two countries. In South Africa, the questionnaires were translated into Xhosa and Afrikaans. (2) Semi-structured interviews with older respondents, stratified by age, race, and location in South Africa, and by age and location in Brazil. 30 in each country. The qualitative component complemented the information on households, especially as regards major events and household arrangements and circumstances in period intervening between the two survey points. (3) A mapping of institutions, policies, and programmes supporting older people and their households in the two countries. Project description: This study examines the impacts of <b>individual</b> <b>ageing</b> on the well-being of older people and their households in Brazil and South Africa, with a view to informing appropriate policies to address the challenges of accelerated population ageing in developing countries. The main hypothesis organizing the research is that the contribution of older people to social and economic development is a primary factor determining the dynamics of their, and their households', well-being. A core feature of the research will be to undertake a longitudinal comparative study of well-being among older persons and their households in South Africa and Brazil, by re-visiting a sample of households with older people from these two countries which participated in a 2002 household survey. The longitudinal dataset combined with in depth interviews will enable the analysis of the dynamics of household income and livelihoods in the two countries, including inter-generational relations and care. Comparison of South Africa and Brazil, two countries with rich social policy environments and recent innovations, will help identify the impact of old age support and existing anti-poverty programmes on the well-being of older people and their households...|$|E
40|$|At {{the moment}} birth rates in Europe {{are not just}} low, they are very low and at levels that were unthinkable a few decades ago. All of the 42 {{countries}} of Europe have fertility rates below the so-called replacement level of 2. 1 children per woman. And a majority of 24 countries even has fertility levels of 1. 5 or below. In these countries, one generation will only be replaced by two-thirds as many people or less. Together with increases in life expectancy, these low fertility rates cause a significant ageing of the population age structure. This ageing process is already under way but will gain momentum and speed over the coming years. In exact numbers, {{the population of the}} European Union ages by 2. 5 months every year or by two years per decade - and this trend is likely to continue well into the next century. The proportion of the population below age 20 is likely to decline further from more than 23 percent to 19 percent, while the proportion above age 60 will increase from 21 percent to 34 percent. Simultaneously, {{the mean age of the}} European population, presently at around 39 years, is likely to reach 45 years by the year 2030. Why does the mean age of the population increase less rapidly than the individual age of each one of us, which of course increases by one year per year? The difference between <b>individual</b> <b>ageing</b> and population ageing is that in a population, new members are being added every year at the very youngest age. This is why we speak of population renewal or reproduction; demographers measure reproduction rates as a key to understanding future population dynamics. At the individual level, there is no reproduction; even our own children cannot perpetuate our individual life. On the societal level, it is evident that children guarantee the survival and further evolution of the population. Moreover, in a population closed to migration, the laws of population dynamics clearly indicate a long-term scenario such as this: If reproduction remains below the so-called replacement level (and life expectancy has an upper limit), that population is going to be heading for significant population ageing followed by population decline and ultimately by extinction. The lower the level of reproduction as measured by fertility rates, the faster this process will come about. However, with possible extinction still centuries away and even significant population declines not yet foreseen for the next half century, the main cause for concern for Europeans over the next few centuries will be population ageing. This article will address three questions in this context: First, we will study what we can assume today about the future path of population ageing in the European Union. Next, we will focus more specifically on the possible future course of the birth rate, which is the main determinant of population ageing. Finally, we will address the question of whether public policies can possibly influence the course of the birth rate in the future...|$|E

Methods: We developed a state transition model to simulate the life experience of a cohort of individuals without polyps or cancer through {{to the development of}} adenomatous polyps and malignant carcinoma and subsequent death in the general population of England. The costs, effects and resource impact of five screening options were evaluated: (a) FOBT for <b>individuals</b> <b>aged</b> 50 – 69 (biennial screening); (b) FOBT for <b>individuals</b> <b>aged</b> 60 – 69 (biennial screening); (c) once-only FSIG for <b>individuals</b> <b>aged</b> 55; (d) once-only FSIG for <b>individuals</b> <b>aged</b> 60; and (e) once-only FSIG for <b>individuals</b> <b>aged</b> 60, followed by FOBT for <b>individuals</b> <b>aged</b> 61 – 70 (biennial screening). Results: The model suggests that screening using FSIG with or without FOBT may be cost-saving and may produce additional benefits compared with a policy of no screening. The marginal cost-effectiveness of FOBT options compared to a policy of no screening is estimated to be below £ 3000 per quality adjusted life year gained. Conclusions: Screening using FOBT and/or FSIG is potentially a cost-effective strategy for the early detection of colorectal cancer. However, the practical feasibility of alternative screening programmes is inevitably limited by current pressures on endoscopy services.
