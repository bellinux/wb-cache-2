Workflows can use both out-of-box <b>activities</b> and <b>custom</b> <b>activities.</b> Out-of-box activities include flow control activities such as DoWhile, Flowchart-related activities such as FlowDecision, WCF Messaging activities such as Send, and primitive activities that perform simple tasks like Assign and WriteLine. <b>Custom</b> <b>activities</b> are user-created CLR objects that derive from the class System.ActivitiesActivity, and provide declarative functionality by allowing the developer to define the execution behavior of the <b>activity</b> in code. <b>Custom</b> <b>activities</b> can benefit from having a <b>custom</b> <b>activity</b> designer associated with them to enhance the visual authoring experience in the Visual Studio IDE.|$|R

The data were collected by using descriptive qualitative method to analyze the domestication and foreignization found in the novel.

Hence, it indicates that foreignization ideology is mostly employed in this research. The result shows that the ideology of translation found in the novel The Rainbow Troops named after the original novel Laskar Pelangi by Andrea Hirata is foreignization.
