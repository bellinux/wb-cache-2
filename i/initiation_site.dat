The program requires that information be extracted from the nucleotide sequence data surrounding the translation <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> according to {{the framework of the}} Hid-den Markov Model. Since the translation <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> of 72 highly abundant proteins have already been assigned on the genome of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 by amino-terminal analysis, we extracted necessary information for GeneHackerTL from the nucleotide sequence data. The prediction rate of the GeneHackerTL for these proteins was estimated to be 86. 1 %. We then used GeneHackerTL for prediction of the translation <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> of 24 other proteins, of which the <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> were not assigned exper-imentally, {{because of the lack of}} a potential initiation codon at the amino-terminal position. For 20 out of the 24 proteins, the <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> were predicted in the upstream of their amino-terminal positions. According to this assignment, the processed regions represent a typical feature of signal peptides. We could also predict multiple translation <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> for a particular gene for which at least two <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> were experimentally detected.

The nucleotide locations of 33 <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> were identified by mapping G*pppN-RNA-DNA chains and identifying their 5 '-terminal ribonucleotide.

Pol alpha 2 had the greatest effect on RNA primer size, typically synthesizing primers 1 - 5 nucleotides long, while pol alpha-primase synthesized primers 6 - 8 nucleotides long.

Treatment of HeLa cells with trichostatin A (TSA) reversibly increased the acetylation level of histone H 4 globally and at these <b>initiation</b> <b>sites.</b> At all three origins, TSA treatment transiently promoted a more dispersive pattern of initiations, decreasing the abundance of nascent DNA at previously preferred <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> while increasing the nascent strand abundance at lower frequency genomic <b>initiation</b> <b>sites.</b> When cells arrested in late G 1 were released into TSA, they completed S phase more rapidly than untreated cells, possibly due to the earlier initiation from late-firing origins, as exemplified by the β-globin origin.

40|$|Abstract Background Utilization of {{alternative}} <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> for protein translation directed by non-AUG codons in mammalian mRNAs is observed with increasing frequency. Alternative <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> are utilized for {{the synthesis of}} important regulatory proteins that control distinct biological functions. It is, therefore, of high significance to define the parameters that allow accurate bioinformatic prediction {{of alternative}} translation <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> (aTIS). This study has investigated 5 '-UTR regions of mRNAs to define consensus sequence properties and structural features that allow identification of alternative <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> for protein translation. Results Bioinformatic evaluation of 5 '-UTR sequences of mammalian mRNAs was conducted for classification and identification of alternative translation <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> {{for a group of}} mRNA sequences that have been experimentally demonstrated to utilize alternative non-AUG <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> for protein translation. These are represented by the codons CUG, GUG, UUG, AUA, and ACG for aTIS. The first phase of this bioinformatic analysis implements a classification tree that evaluated 5 '-UTRs for unique consensus sequence features near the initiation codon, characteristics of 5 '-UTR nucleotide sequences, and secondary structural features in a decision tree that categorizes mRNAs into those with potential aTIS, and those without. The second phase addresses identification of the aTIS codon and its location. Critical parameters of 5 '-UTRs were assessed by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for identification of the aTIS codon and its location. ANNs have previously been used for the purpose of AUG start site prediction and are applicable in complex. ANN analyses demonstrated that multiple properties were required for predicting aTIS codons; these properties included unique consensus nucleotide sequences at positions - 7 and - 6 combined with positions - 3 and + 4, 5 '-UTR length, ORF length, predicted secondary structures, free energy features, upstream AUGs, and G/C ratio. Importantly, combined results of the classification tree and the ANN analyses provided highly accurate bioinformatic predictions of alternative translation <b>initiation</b> <b>sites.</b> Conclusion This study has defined the unique properties of 5 '-UTR sequences of mRNAs for successful bioinformatic prediction of alternative <b>initiation</b> <b>sites</b> utilized in protein translation. The ability to define aTIS through the described bioinformatic analyses can be of high importance for genomic analyses to provide full predictions of translated mammalian and human gene products required for cellular functions in health and disease. </p...|$|R
