60|$|When {{we examine}} common words, we find that, broadly speaking, proper names stand <b>for</b> <b>particulars,</b> while other substantives, adjectives, prepositions, and verbs stand for universals. Pronouns stand <b>for</b> <b>particulars,</b> but are ambiguous: {{it is only}} by the context or the {{circumstances}} that we know what <b>particulars</b> they stand <b>for.</b> The word 'now' stands <b>for</b> a <b>particular,</b> namely the present moment; but like pronouns, it stands <b>for</b> an ambiguous <b>particular,</b> because the present is always changing.|$|R

5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> letters.|$|E
5|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{there is no}} {{requirement}} <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> formalities in trust instruments, they can be oral or written. The only requirement is that they show an intention to create a trust. The exceptions are where it is a transfer of land, the transfer of existing equitable interests, or where the trust is made in a will.|$|E
5|$|Both a {{small and}} large coat of arms existed from 1949 until 1957 based on {{representations}} of them prior to 1936. In 1957 both the large and small city coat of arms were newly arranged by the designer Eduard Ege. At the same time, the city council set the resolution on the December 17, 1957 that the large one was no longer for official use but only <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> representative purposes.|$|E

The player may change {{the level of difficulty}} at any time, thereby weakening opponents and increasing the chance of success <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> actions. The screen constantly presents a heads-up display, which provides information about the character's health, magicka, and fatigue, all of which can be increased by leveling up.|$|E

The following are the main published editions since 1904. Years of publication often postdate the first performances from these editions.|$|E

5|$|All females {{recorded}} in the French Herd Book are controlled under this system, which focuses mainly on maternal qualities derived from measurements of calving ease, and growth and structure of calves. Females that achieve the best indexes <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> traits are then examined in detail by HBL technicians who assign grades based on morphology. The best females receive the qualification Reproductive Recognised (in French Reproductrice Reconnue, abbreviated to RR), which is awarded to the top 10%, or Reproductive Recommended (in French Reproductrice Recommand√©e, abbreviated to RRE) awarded to the top 1%. The qualifications aid the identification of superior animals.|$|E
5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was singled out <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had {{ruled that the}} Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{underneath}} the State Apartments is {{a suite of}} slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. Some of the rooms are named and decorated <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> visitors, such as the 1844 Room, decorated in that year for the State visit of Tsar NicholasI of Russia, and, {{on the other side}} of the Bow Room, the 1855 Room, in honour of the visit of Emperor NapoleonIII of France. At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's Garden Parties in the Gardens. The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} passage of the Statute of Westminster, Canada and other Dominions became fully {{sovereign}} from the United Kingdom. This had the effect of elevating the Canadian coat of arms, which had been granted as deputed arms <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> uses in a colony, to the status of the royal arms of the King in right of the country, for general purposes throughout the country. They thus replaced the British coat of arms, which had previously been arms of general purpose throughout the British Empire, in court rooms and on government buildings to represent the ruling monarch. This change can be seen in the Great Seal of Canada of George VI, where the royal arms of Canada replaced the British arms, and is even more evident in the Great Seal of Canada for Elizabeth II, where the title has been redefined as Queen of Canada. These are the coat of arms of the Queen of Canada.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the sport}} was pushed forward by American {{mathematician}} John Gill, who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics, a sport which had an established scale of difficulty <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds. Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 problems were {{as difficult as}} the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out <b>for</b> <b>particular</b> praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
