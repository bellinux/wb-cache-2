5|$|<b>Hydrocephalus</b> is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. <b>Hydrocephalus</b> can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. <b>Hydrocephalus</b> without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, <b>hydrocephalus</b> can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. <b>Hydrocephalus</b> is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult <b>hydrocephalus.</b> Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had <b>hydrocephalus,</b> {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrocephalus</b> (obstruction of {{the flow}} of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid) may complicate SAH in both the short and long term. It is detected on CT scanning, on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles), or occasionally a permanent shunt. Relief of <b>hydrocephalus</b> can lead to an enormous improvement in a person's condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{can also}} be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of <b>hydrocephalus.</b> However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal brain herniation.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{cerebrospinal}} fluid varies by size and species. In humans and other mammals, cerebrospinal fluid, produced, circulating, and reabsorbed {{in a similar}} manner to humans, and with a similar function, turns over at a rate of 3–5 times a day. Problems with CSF circulation leading to <b>hydrocephalus</b> occur in other animals.|$|E
5|$|At age seven de Candolle {{contracted}} of {{a severe}} case of <b>hydrocephalus,</b> which significantly affected his childhood. Nevertheless, {{he is said}} to have had great aptitude for learning, distinguishing himself in school with his rapid acquisition of knowledge in classical and general literature and his ability to write fine poetry. In 1794, he began his scientific studies at the Collège Calvin, where he studied under Jean Pierre Étienne Vaucher, who later inspired de Candolle to make botanical science the chief pursuit of his life.|$|E
5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, <b>hydrocephalus,</b> and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull {{issues such as}} an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A {{complication}} from that condition is <b>hydrocephalus,</b> also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where {{two or more of}} the dog's toes are fused together, may seem to be a health issue but this breed trait is not a cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{veins of}} the brain, both the {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to the jugular vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the veins {{of the brain and}} the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to <b>hydrocephalus,</b> however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Testing often {{including}} {{observing the}} colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying {{white and red}} blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels. A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection, or PCR {{may be used to}} identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure <b>hydrocephalus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, <b>hydrocephalus,</b> and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E
25|$|Chihuahuas, {{and other}} toy breeds, can be {{affected}} by <b>hydrocephalus.</b> Chihuahua puppies with <b>hydrocephalus</b> have an abnormally large head, are lethargic and do not grow at the same pace as their siblings. A true case of <b>hydrocephalus</b> can be diagnosed by a veterinarian, though the prognosis is grim.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} subcommissural organ is not highly {{permeable}} {{and does not}} possess fenestrated capillaries like other subventricular organs, it {{has emerged as a}} major site of congenital <b>hydrocephalus.</b> It is suggested that this is related to immunological blockage of SCO secretions and Sylvian's aqueduct malformation and obliteration or turbulent cerebrospinal fluid flow due to the absence of Reissner's fibers. There is evidence that in transgenic mice the overexpression of Sox3 in the dorsal midline of the diencephalon in a dose-dependent manner and that the conditional inactivation of presenilin-1 or the lack of huntingtin in wnt cell lineages leads to congenital <b>hydrocephalus,</b> which highlights the role of these proteins mediating the relation between the SCO and the condition. A more recent study using HTx rats reinforced the idea that the abnormal and dysfunction of the SCO precedes the development of the <b>hydrocephalus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Molera (hole in skull), {{better known}} as an open fontanelle, {{may be a sign}} of <b>hydrocephalus,</b> but is also a normal finding in toy breeds such as Chihuahua.|$|E
25|$|Occasional problems: ptosis of the eyelid, microophthalmia, {{cleft lip}} {{with or without}} a cleft palate, webbed neck, short neck, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, spina bifida, and <b>hydrocephalus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, meningomyelocele, encephalocele and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies {{of the nervous}} system include the Arnold-Chiari malformation, the Dandy-Walker malformation, <b>hydrocephalus,</b> microencephaly, megalencephaly, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.|$|E
25|$|Rebleeding, <b>hydrocephalus</b> (the {{excessive}} {{accumulation of}} cerebrospinal fluid), vasospasm (spasm, or narrowing, {{of the blood}} vessels), or multiple aneurysms may also occur. The risk of rupture from a cerebral aneurysm varies according {{to the size of}} an aneurysm, with the risk rising as the aneurysm size increases.|$|E
25|$|The {{foramina}} {{were named}} after the Scottish physician and University of Edinburgh graduate Alexander Monro, who first described an enlarged foramen {{in the context of}} <b>hydrocephalus</b> in a presentation to the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh in 1764, and subsequently in his 1783 publication, Observations on the Structure and Functions of the Nervous System.|$|E
25|$|His {{method of}} {{surgical}} removal of lungs {{became a major}} medical weapon {{in the treatment of}} tuberculosis and lung cancer, thus saving many patients. His name was also immortalised in Medicine in two other instances: the Macewen's operation for inguinal hernia and the Macewen's sign for <b>hydrocephalus</b> and brain abscess.|$|E
25|$|A pineal tumour can {{compress}} {{the superior}} colliculi and pretectal {{area of the}} dorsal midbrain, producing Parinaud's syndrome. Pineal tumours also can cause compression of the cerebral aqueduct, resulting in a noncommunicating <b>hydrocephalus.</b> Other manifestations are the consequence of their pressure effects and consist of visual disturbances, headache, mental deterioration, and sometimes dementia-like behaviour.|$|E
25|$|The tumor {{may take}} {{on a variety of}} appearances, {{depending}} on the amount of hemorrhage, necrosis, or its age. A CT scan will usually show an inhomogeneous mass with a hypodense center and a variable ring of enhancement surrounded by edema. Mass effect from the tumor and edema may compress the ventricles and cause <b>hydrocephalus.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{suspected}} causes of tonsillar herniation including: decreased or malformed posterior fossa (the lower, back {{part of the}} skull) not providing enough room for the cerebellum; <b>hydrocephalus</b> or abnormal CSF volume pushing the tonsils out; or dural tension pulling the brain caudally. Connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, can be associated.|$|E
25|$|Honduras: In 2013, the CURE Internacional Hospital de Ortopedia Pediátrica, {{located in}} San Pedro Sula, closed due to {{increasing}} insecurity in the country, {{and a lack}} of funding from the government. During its four years of operation, approximately 20,000 children were treated with orthopedic corrections. CURE continues to work in the country through its specialty clubfoot and <b>hydrocephalus</b> programs.|$|E
25|$|Uganda: Specializing in {{treating}} neurosurgical needs, the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda opened in 2000 {{and has been}} recognized as a global leader in treatment of <b>hydrocephalus.</b> The hospital, located in Mbale, also treats children with neural tube defects, spina bifida, epilepsy, and brain tumors. The training program brings in surgeons from many countries, including Bangladesh, the U.S., and Ghana.|$|E
25|$|Risks {{for late}} PTS include <b>hydrocephalus,</b> reduced {{blood flow to}} the {{temporal}} lobes of the brain, brain contusions, subdural hematomas, a torn dura mater, and focal neurological deficits. PTA that lasts for longer than 24hours after the injury is a risk factor for both early and late PTS. Up to 86% of people who have one late post-traumatic seizure have another within two years.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Dr. Clarren {{described}} a second infant whose {{mother was a}} binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe <b>hydrocephalus,</b> abnormal neuronal migration, and a small corpus callosum (which connects the two brain hemispheres) and cerebellum. FAS has also been linked to brainstem and cerebellar changes, agenesis of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, neuronal migration errors, absent olfactory bulbs, meningomyelocele, and porencephaly.|$|E
25|$|Delta is the {{frequency}} range up to 4nbsp&Hz. It {{tends to be}} the highest in amplitude and the slowest waves. It is seen normally in adults in slow-wave sleep. It is also seen normally in babies. It may occur focally with subcortical lesions and in general distribution with diffuse lesions, metabolic encephalopathy <b>hydrocephalus</b> or deep midline lesions. It is usually most prominent frontally in adults (e.g. FIRDA – frontal intermittent rhythmic delta) and posteriorly in children (e.g. OIRDA – occipital intermittent rhythmic delta).|$|E
25|$|Subependymal nodules are {{composed}} of abnormal, swollen glial cells and bizarre multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial or neuronal origin. Interposed neural tissue is not present. These nodules {{have a tendency to}} calcify as the patient ages. A nodule that markedly enhances and enlarges over time should be considered suspicious for transformation into a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, which typically develops in the region of the foramen of Monro, in which case it is at risk of developing an obstructive <b>hydrocephalus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} spina bifida can be {{prevented}} if the mother gets enough folate before and during pregnancy. Adding folic acid to flour {{has been found to}} be effective for most women. Open spina bifida can be surgically closed before or after birth. A shunt may be needed in those with <b>hydrocephalus,</b> and a tethered spinal cord may be surgically repaired. Devices to help with movement such as crutches or wheelchairs may be useful. Urinary catheterization may also be needed.|$|E
25|$|Achondroplasia can be {{detected}} before birth {{by the use of}} prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect homozygosity, wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-facial hypoplasia. Complications like dental malocclusion, <b>hydrocephalus</b> and repeated otitis media can be observed. The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya first {{reported}} the Ommaya reservoir in 1963. The reservoir is subcutaneous implant for repeated intrathecal injections, to treat <b>hydrocephalus</b> and malignant tumors. The reservoir {{was the first}} medical port to use silicone which is biologically inert and self-sealing. The Ommaya reservoir allows delivery of intermittent bolus injections for chemotherapy to the tumor bed. Agents are injected percutaneously into the reservoir and delivered to the tumor by compression of the reservoir. The Ommaya reservoir provided a great improvement for treatment which {{reduces the risk of}} infection.|$|E
25|$|Brain imaging has {{documented}} cerebral atrophy, {{which is a}} loss of neurons {{in the brain and}} the connections between them. Also documented were problems with the ventricular system in the brain, such as ventricular asymmetry and ventricular enlargement. <b>Hydrocephalus</b> has also been noted in children with 1p36 deletion syndrome. This is basically too much fluid within the brain. Hyperreflexia, which is defined as overactive or overresponsive reflexes in the body, was also found to be common. Many children also have epilepsy which is a disorder of the brain that results in recurrent, unprovoked seizures.|$|E
25|$|Theta is the {{frequency}} range from 4nbsp&Hz to 7nbsp&Hz. Theta is seen normally in young children. It {{may be seen}} in drowsiness or arousal in older children and adults; it can also be seen in meditation. Excess theta for age represents abnormal activity. It {{can be seen as a}} focal disturbance in focal subcortical lesions; it can be seen in generalized distribution in diffuse disorder or metabolic encephalopathy or deep midline disorders or some instances of <b>hydrocephalus.</b> On the contrary this range has been associated with reports of relaxed, meditative, and creative states.|$|E
25|$|MPS IV, Morquio syndrome, is {{estimated}} to occur in 1 in 700,000 births. Its two subtypes result from the missing or deficient enzymes N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) (Type A) or beta-galactosidase (Type B) needed {{to break down the}} keratan sulfate sugar chain. Clinical features are similar in both types but appear milder in Morquio Type B. Onset is between ages 1 and 3. Neurological complications include spinal nerve and nerve root compression resulting from extreme, progressive skeletal changes, particularly in the ribs and chest; conductive and/or neurosensitive loss of hearing and clouded corneas. Intelligence is normal unless <b>hydrocephalus</b> develops and is not treated.|$|E
25|$|Ommaya {{also did}} early {{work with the}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) scanner. His work with Sir Godfrey Hounsfield to determine the spatial resolution of the CT scanner {{opened the door for}} its use in stereotactic surgery. Spinal angiography was also pioneered by Ommaya, Di Chiro, and Doppman. This work allowed for the visualization of arteries and veins and allowed for understanding of spinal cord arteriography. The same team reported the treatment of spinal cord AVMs by percutaneous embolization of an intercostal artery using stainless steel pellets. This {{was one of the first}} reports of interventional neuroradiology. Ommaya made several significant contributions to many areas that concern neurological surgeons, treatment of cancer, <b>hydrocephalus,</b> traumatic brain injury, and arterio-venous malformations.|$|E
25|$|Just as in adults, most {{headaches}} are benign, {{but when}} head pain is accompanied with other {{symptoms such as}} speech problems, muscle weakness, and loss of vision, a more serious underlying cause may exist: <b>hydrocephalus,</b> meningitis, encephalitis, abscess, hemorrhage, tumor, blood clots, or head trauma. In these cases, the headache evaluation may include CT scan or MRI in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system. If {{a child with a}} recurrent headache has a normal physical exam, neuroimaging is not recommended. Guidelines state children with abnormal neurologic exams, confusion, seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life, change in headache type or anything suggesting neurologic problems should receive neuroimaging.|$|E
