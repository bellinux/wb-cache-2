40|$|We have {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} a new laryngeal mask prototype, the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA), as a ventilatory device and blind intubation guide. The ILMA consists of an anatomically curved, short, wide bore, stainless steel tube sheathed in silicone which is bonded to a laryngeal mask and a guiding handle. It has a single moveable aperture bar, a <b>guiding</b> <b>ramp</b> and can accommodate an 8 mm tracheal tube (TT). After induction of anaesthesia with propofol 2. 5 mg kg and fentanyl 2. 5 μg kg, the device was inserted successfully at the first attempt in all 150 (100...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare action tremor (AT) during manual {{tracking}} in normal subjects and patients with multiple sclerosis with tremor (MS-tremor group) and without tremor (MS-no tremor group), and to differentiate tremor occurring predominantly around the distal joint from that involving the proximal joints of the arm. METHODS: Subjects performed both a visually <b>guided</b> <b>ramp</b> tracking task using wrist flexion/extension {{and a whole}} arm circle tracking task using shoulder movement. Action tremor at the wrist or shoulder was computed as the SD of the tracking velocity. The ratio of wrist:arm tremor was then calculated to differentiate distal from proximal tremor in the tested arm. Frequency spectra of the records were also examined. RESULTS: During wrist tracking, AT in patients with multiple sclerosis contained a major frequency component at 4 - 5 Hz; the frequency was slightly lower during whole arm tracking. The ratio of wrist:arm tremor was significantly higher in the MS-tremor group. Of 12 tested arms, eight had tremor significantly weighted towards the distal joint, only one towards the proximal joint, and three had a ratio inside the control range. CONCLUSIONS: AT {{in the arms of}} patients with multiple sclerosis can be effectively differentiated into proximal or distal using these two different tracking tasks. Despite the variability of the effects of multiple sclerosis, most of the AT was distal rather than proximal in this group of patients. Possibly conduction block along the corticocerebellocortical pathways caused this distal tremor...|$|R
40|$|Segmental {{resection}} of the mandible generally {{results in}} deviation of the mandible to the defective side. This loss of {{continuity of the}} mandible destroys {{the balance of the}} lower face and leads to decreased mandibular function by deviation of the residual segment toward the surgical site. Prosthetic methods advocated to reduce or eliminate mandibular deviation include intermaxillary fixation, removable mandibular <b>guide</b> flange, palatal <b>ramp,</b> implant-supported prosthesis and palatal guidance restorations which may be useful in reducing mandibular deviation and improving masticatory performance and efficiency. These methods and restorations would be combined with a well organized mandibular exercise regimen. This clinical report describes the rehabilitation following segmental mandibulectomy using palatal ramp prosthesis...|$|R
5000|$|The K 3's gun {{design was}} nothing innovative, {{but the same}} cannot {{be said for the}} carriage. Rheinmetall placed a lot of {{emphasis}} on ease of assembly. It did not require a crane because it used electric winches, mounted on the carriage, to pull various parts through a system of inclined <b>ramps,</b> <b>guide</b> rails and runways. It also used the Rheinmetall's dual-recoil system, first seen on the 21 cm Mörser 18. The barrel recoiled normally in its cradle, but, in addition, the whole top carriage, which carried the barrel and its cradle, recoiled across {{the main part of the}} carriage. This system damped out the recoil forces and made for a very steady firing platform.|$|R
40|$|An ion {{mobility}} cell {{of a novel}} type was {{coupled to}} an orthogonal injection time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. The mobility cell operates at low-pressure and contains a segmented RF ion guide providing an axial electric field that drives the ions towards the exit. A flow of gas is arranged inside the ion guide {{in such a way}} that the gas drag counteracts the force exerted by the axial field. Ions with different mobility coefficients can be scanned out of the ion <b>guide</b> by <b>ramping</b> the axial field strength. The ions can be analyzed intact or fragmented in a collision cell before introduction into an orthogonal TOF mass spectrometer. An ion source with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) was attached to the instrument. The setup was evaluated for the analysis of peptide and protein mixture, with sequential fragmentation of multiple precursor ions from a protein digest and with mobility separation of fragment ions formed by in-source fragmentation of pure peptides. The mobility resolution for peptides was observed to be three times higher than the theoretical resolution predicted for a classical mobility setup with similar operating conditions (pressure, field strength, and length) ...|$|R
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is <b>guided</b> by feed <b>ramps</b> into the chamber. As the bolt's locking lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between ‘common practice’ as defined by a simple reading of PMBOK Chapter 11 and ‘best practice’ as approached (but not quite achieved) by two alternative <b>guides</b> (PRAM and <b>RAMP)</b> in terms of key points of contention in framing assumptions which everyone interested in project management as a whole ought to understand. An immediate purpose is helping readers to avoid some of the current confusion {{about the difference between}} ‘common practice’ and ‘best practice’. A longer term goal is influencing the shape of future project risk management guides, to enhance them individually, and to make them easier to use collectively. ‘Best practice’ definition is itself contentious. Other authors are encouraged to debate the definition of ‘best practice’ and explore the position of other guides. The framing assumptions are considered in terms of basic concepts: ‘probability’, ‘uncertainty’, ‘risk’, ‘optimisation’ and ‘opportunity’. A practical example of the implications is provided via analysis of the use of probability–impact (PI) matrices and associated PI indices (risk indices or scores). The use of PI indices is ‘common practice’, but it is a clear indication that ‘best practice’ is not being followed, for reasons clarified in this paper. A follow-on companion paper considers related generic process definition issues...|$|R

In fact, this representation neglects what makes up the samba essence {{in the first place}} [...] - [...] the swing! Understanding the Samba Groove by Pedro Batista [...] The metronome has no real musical value. I repeat, the metronome has no value whatsoever as an aid to any action or performance that is musical in intention. ...refer by analogy to the sister art of drawing. Graphic artists understand well enough the essential and generic difference that exists between mechanically-aided drawing {{on the one hand and}} freehand on the other. Similarly, musicians ought to distinguish between (1) the sort of timing that results from dull, slavish obedience to the ticking of a soulless machine, and (2) that noble swing and perfect control of pulsation which comes into our playing after years of practice in treating and training the sense of time as a free, creative human faculty. The Amateur String Quartet by James Brown III ... using the metronome as a constant <b>guide</b> to <b>ramp</b> up the speed or to keep the rhythm. This is one of the worst abuses of the metronome. ...If over used, it can lead to loss of your internal rhythm, loss of musicality, and bio-physical difficulties from over-exposure to rigid repetition Fundamentals of Piano Practice by Chuan C. Chang [...] A good performance is so full of these minute retardations and accelerations that hardly two measures will occupy exactly the same time. It is notorious that to play with the metronome is to play mechanically - the reason being, of course, that we are then playing by the measure, or rather by the beat, instead of by the phrase. A keen musical instinct revolts at playing even a single measure with the metronome: mathematical exactitude gives us a dead body in place of the living musical organism with its ebb and flow of rhythmical energy. It may therefore be suggested, in conclusion, that the use of the metronome, even to determine the average rate of speed, is dangerous. Daniel Gregory Mason [...] What is musical rhythm? Perhaps it is the difference between a performance that is stiff and metronomic in its strict adherence to the beat, and a performance that flows with elasticity and flexibility that emanates from the music itself. A rhythmically musical performance seems to take its cues from stylistic considerations, tempo, phrasing, and harmonic structure, as well as form. Sometimes we may not be exactly sure what makes a piece sound rhythmically musical, but we know it when we hear it.It should not surprise us that some children do not know instinctively how to play musically. Many youngsters are surrounded by popular music that is rigid and inflexible in its rhythm, characterized by a relentless beat that is often synthesized or computerized. Even some CDs and MIDI disks especially designed for use with piano teaching materials can encourage students to be overly metronomic in their playing. In general, our students may not be familiar with the idea of subtle nuances of tempo, and may need help understanding this. Jennifer Merry ...|$|R
