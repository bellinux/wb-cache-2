40|$|Social {{networks}} have begun supporting external content integration with platforms like OpenSocial and the Facebook API. These platforms let users install thirdparty applications {{and are a}} popular example of a mashup. Content integration is often accomplished by proxying the third-party content or importing third-party scripts. However, these methods introduce serious risks of user impersonation and data exposure. Modern browsers provide no mechanism to differentiate between trusted and untrusted <b>embedded</b> <b>content.</b> As a result, content providers are forced to trust third-party scripts or ensure user safety by means of server-side code sanitization. We demonstrate the difficulties of server-side code filtering – and the ramifications of its failure – with an example from the Facebook Platform. We then propose browser modifications that would distinguish between trusted and untrusted content and enforce their separation...|$|E

We {{will be able to}} browse digital contents on ubiquitous networks anywhere and at anytime. In our research, we have proposed several content-processing mechanisms for use in environment-enabled collaborative acquisition of embedded digital content in the real world situations. We have developed a network management device that makes it possible to acquire <b>embedded</b> <b>content</b> using coordinated ubiquitous devices. We have also developed two prototype systems using these devices.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{where the}} Years 4 - 10 Queensland French Syllabus is {{receiving}} support, by investigating groups of teachers with shared characteristics. In doing so, {{it aims to}} {{shed some light on}} why teachers have not embraced this new syllabus. Specific issues pertaining to the syllabus are investigated, {{such as the use of}} task-based instruction as the chosen methodology and of <b>embedded</b> <b>content,</b> as well as contextual issues, such as employment sector and levels taught. Teachers' reactions to change have also been investigated in relation to the introduction of this syllabus. In addition to this, the process involved in acceptance of an innovation has been explored which led to an examination of teacher understanding of the current syllabus. This study is divided into five chapters. Chapter one outlines the syllabus and context, as well as hypotheses for this study and rationale. Chapter two is a literature review which brings together previous research and links it to the current study. The chosen methodology is covered by chapter three, with chapter four being a detailed explanation of results received from the data collection. The final chapter, chapter five, discusses these results and the implications of these findings...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{work with}} {{autonomous}} modal parameter estimation has shown great promise {{in the quality}} of the modal parameter estimation results when compared to results from traditional methods by experienced users. While autonomous modal parameter estimation means slightly different things to different researchers and practitioners, {{for the purpose of this}} discussion, autonomous will require an automated procedure which sorts and processes a large number of possible modal parameter solutions to yield one consistent estimate with no user interaction after initial thresholds are chosen. In the work discussed, this final, consistent set of modal parameters is identifiable due to the combination of temporal and spatial information in a z domain state vector of relatively high order (5 – 10). Since this z domain state vector has both complex modal frequency and modal vector information as <b>embedded</b> <b>content,</b> sorting consistent estimates from the multitude of possible solutions is relatively trivial. Because this z domain state vector can be developed from the results of any modal parameter estimation method, possible solutions from different traditional methods can be utilized in the autonomous procedure to yield one consistent set of modal parameters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—After 2001 the {{upgraded}} ep collider HERA {{will provide}} an about five times higher luminosity for the two experiments H 1 and ZEUS. In order {{to cope with the}} expected higher event rates the H 1 collaboration is building a track based trigger system, the Fast Track Trigger (FTT). It will be integrated in the first three levels (L 1 –L 3) of the H 1 trigger scheme to provide higher selectivity for events with charged particles. The FTT will allow to reconstruct 3 -dimensional tracks in the central drift chamber down to 100 MeV/c within the L 2 latency of ∼ 23 µs. To reach the necessary momentum resolution of ∼ 5 % (at 1 GeV/c) sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have to be implemented using high density Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and their <b>embedded</b> <b>Content</b> Addressable Memories (CAM). The final track parameter optimization will be done using non-iterative fits implemented in DSPs. While at the first trigger level rough track information will be provided, at L 2 tracks with high resolution are available to form trigger decisions on topological and other track based criteria like multiplicities and momenta. At the third trigger level a farm of commercial processor boards will be used to compute physics quantities such as invariant masses...|$|E

40|$|AbstractE-portfolio {{assessment}} {{is getting more}} important as online teaching and learning activities are disseminating into instructional processes. Preservice teachers, as the current students and prospective teachers, must possess enough level of skills, abilities, and knowledge on e-portfolio development stages including their preparation, development and evaluation. Therefore, this study aims to gather the ideas of preservice teachers (n= 42) from Computer Education and Instructional Technology department who are quite familiar with different technologies. Before and after they actually develop their own e-portfolios, preservice teachers asked several open-ended questions about e-portfolios. Pre and post assessment were analyzed with qualitative data analysis. Results showed that preservice teachers perceive e-portfolios as a context for publishing their work (assignments, projects, and etc…) especially yielded from project based courses. Preservice teachers are divided into three groups {{with respect to the}} focus of eportfolio assessment; only product oriented, only process oriented and both process and product oriented decision making. In subsequent to their e-portfolio development, the process of creating e-portfolios has been reshaped in students’ minds from content-to-context to context-to-content. Preservice teachers noted that evaluation of an e-portfolio should mostly concentrate on its visual design, its <b>embedded</b> <b>content</b> and its usability. Although students reported that their skills and abilities extended with eportfolio development, preparation of e-portfolio websites was defined as the challenge...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effective {{tutorial}} {{systems can}} help promote products by reducing barriers of learning new applications. With dynamic web applications becoming {{as complex as}} desktop programs, {{there is a growing}} need for online tutorial/help systems. For visually impaired users the key limitations of traditional help systems are 1) poor access to help content with assistive technology, and 2) frequent reliance on videos/images to identify parts of web applications and demonstrate functionality. In this paper, we present a new interaction model, targeted towards screen-reader users, that describes how to embed an interactive tutorial within a web application. The interaction model is demonstrated within a system called DTorial, a fully functional dynamic audiobased tutorial with <b>embedded</b> <b>content.</b> While remaining within the web application, users can rapidly access any tutorial content, injected inline near relevant application controls, allowing them to quickly apply what they just heard to the application itself, without ever losing their position or having to shift windows. The model and implementation are grounded in sighted user help-systems literature and an analysis of screen-reader and Web-Application interactions. Lessons learned from the incremental design and evaluations indicate that providing visually impaired users with dynamic, embedded, interactive audio-based tutorial systems can reduce the barriers to new Web-Applications...|$|E
