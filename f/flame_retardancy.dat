50|$|Modacrylics {{are used}} {{primarily}} in applications where environmental resistance or <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> is necessary or required. Modacrylics {{have the ability}} to combine <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> with a relatively low density, meaning protective gear is not uncomfortably heavy (i.e. shirts and trousers worn by electrical linemen). The combination of <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> and low density is also useful in furnishings, draperies, and outdoor fabrics.|$|E

50|$|In 1990, Lewin {{founded the}} first Conference on Recent Advances in <b>Flame</b> <b>Retardancy</b> of Polymeric Materials held in Stamford, Connecticut. Since then, 20 annual {{meetings}} were {{held on the}} same topic in which Lewin served as chairman. These conferences, which include forty invited lectures each by expert scientists from over 20 countries, institutionalized <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> of polymers {{as one of the}} most important fields in polymer science.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{mechanisms}} of <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> {{vary depending on}} the specific flame retardant and the substrate. Additive and reactive flame-retardant chemicals can both function in the vapor (gaseous) or condensed (solid) phase.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> {{does not}} have the same meaning as flameproofing. Fabric that {{contains}} a flame-retardant coating can withstand even a very hot point source. However, it can still burn if a large ignition source is present.|$|E
50|$|Bromine studies {{performed}} by Lewin were directed towards the discovery {{and development of}} new uses for bromine which is found in large quantities at the Dead Sea. The studies included, {{in addition to the}} basic chemistry of the various compounds of bromine, new industrial uses which enabled the expansion of production and marketing of bromine, and thus contributed to the country's economy. In these studies, a new technology of bleaching fabrics was developed for the textile industry, and a method of bleaching pulp for the production of paper and cardboard was devised. Another major technology was the use of bromine and its components in <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> of polymeric materials. Lewin {{was among the first to}} develop this technology, and his invention to increase the <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> of wood products by injecting bromine into wood was acclaimed. The use of bromine and its components in the <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> of polymers has been developed over the years, and bromine products for this purpose have reached an annual export from Israel of hundreds of millions of dollars. Other uses of bromine researched by Lewin and his group were in the fields of medicine and biotechnology.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a fabric}} is {{designated}} as inherently fire-retardant, permanently fire-retardant, or durably fire-retardant, the <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> {{will last for}} the life of the fabric as it has been woven into the fabric fiber itself. The drapery can be laundered or dry-cleaned as recommended by the drapery manufacturer. In the case of fabrics that are designated as fire-retardant, that have been topically treated with chemicals, the <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> of the fabric will dissipate over time, particularly with repeated cleaning. As these chemicals are soluble in liquids-either water or dry cleaning fluid, these fabrics must be dry-cleaned with a non-liquid cleaning agent. The flame retardants work by coating the flammable fabrics with a mineral based barrier, preventing fire from reaching the fibres.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the studies}} {{carried out by}} Lewin and his team, the {{research}} on bromine markedly stands out. It dealt with problems of chemical structure and morphology of cellulose, polyester, polyamide, polyolefins, the changing crystalline structure of polymers, oxidation, bleaching and degradation of polymers, studies on <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> of polymers, and more.|$|E

50|$|Typically, the <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> of topically treated {{fabric is}} {{certified}} for one year, though the actual {{length of time}} in which the treatment remains effective will vary {{based on the number}} of times the drapery is dry-cleaned and the environmental conditions in the location in which the drapery is used.

For instance, Xyron is a halogen-free <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy.</b> It has low mold shrinkage, paired with dimensional accuracy and stability. Xyron resists acid and alkalis and is created for electrical property. Not only does it have processability and workability, but contributes a low-water absorption, hot-water resistance, and hydrolytic stability.

50|$|A unique {{class of}} {{partially}} crystalline aromatic polyesters based on p-hydroxybenzoic acid and related monomers, liquid-crystal polymers {{are capable of}} forming regions of highly ordered structure while in the liquid phase. However, the degree of order is somewhat {{less than that of}} a regular solid crystal. Typically, LCPs have a high mechanical strength at high temperatures, extreme chemical resistance, inherent <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy,</b> and good weatherability. Liquid-crystal polymers {{come in a variety of}} forms from sinterable high temperature to injection moldable compounds. LCPs can be welded, though the lines created by welding are a weak point in the resulting product. LCPs have a high Z-axis coefficient of thermal expansion.|$|E
50|$|The EUâ€™s RoHS {{directive}} forced E&E {{manufacturers to}} switch to lead-free solder systems running at about 30 Â°C higher temperatures than traditional systems. In particular, in the so-called surface mount technology (SMT) used to connect semiconductor components mechanically and electrically to circuit boards, the resins have to withstand peak temperatures of 260 Â°C and more during the soldering process. This triggered {{the rapid growth of}} polymer resins based on polyamides with melting points above 300 Â°C, in particular PPAs and Nylon 46. The application requires the resin to pass GWIT and UL94 ratings mentioned above. Aluminium diethylphosphinate confers this <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> on polyamides whilst meeting the other requirements such as CTI.|$|E
50|$|Nonwoven fabrics are {{engineered}} fabrics {{that may}} have a limited life, single-use fabric or a very durable fabric. Nonwoven fabrics provide specific functions such as absorbency, liquid repellence, resilience, stretch, softness, strength, <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy,</b> washability, cushioning, thermal insulation, acoustic insulation, filtration, use as a bacterial barrier and sterility. These properties are often combined to create fabrics suited for specific jobs, while achieving a good balance between product use-life and cost. They can mimic the appearance, texture and strength of a woven fabric and can be as bulky as the thickest paddings. In combination with other materials they provide a spectrum of products with diverse properties, and are used alone or as components of apparel, home furnishings, health care, engineering, industrial and consumer goods.|$|E

Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide has been used as a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardantsâ€”in the form of, for example, organophosphatesâ€”now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E

30|$|LOI is {{the minimum}} oxygen {{concentration}} (vol%) which {{would support the}} combustion of a certain material, so the higher LOI value represents the better <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy.</b> In Fig.Â  2, {{the results showed that}} the LOI values increased with increasing lignosulfonate addition, indicating the enhancing effect on <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> by lignosulfonate. Lignosulfonate is a natural macromolecule with substantial aromatic structures, and the LOI value increased with increasing lignosulfonate contents, indicating that lignosulfonate has a certain degree of <b>flame</b> <b>retardancy</b> due to lignosulfonate aromatic structure and its native carbonâ€“carbon bonds helping to promote char formation.
