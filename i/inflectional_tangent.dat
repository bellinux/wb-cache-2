As an application, we give first examples of Zariski pairs of cubic-line arrangements that do not involve <b>inflectional</b> <b>tangent</b> lines.

30|$|The {{addition}} of nanoparticles influenced also the heat capacity in {{solid and liquid}} phases. The specific heats were calculated as average of single values recorded in the temperature range 155 °C to 220 °C (where 220 °C is about the onset temperature) in solid phase and in the range 250 °C to 300 °C (where 250 °C is about the endset temperature) in liquid phase (the endset temperature is the intersection point of the baseline after transition and the <b>inflectional</b> <b>tangent).</b>|$|E
30|$|According to the {{regulations}} of the International Conference on Thermal Analysis, the onset temperature is the intersection {{point of the}} baseline before the phase change process occurs and the <b>inflectional</b> <b>tangent.</b> The onset temperature is generally considered the melting point. However, {{from the point of}} view of application, the thermal storage material is not completely transformed into the liquid phase at the onset temperature. The temperature of a complete phase transformation is a certain temperature between the peak temperature and endset temperature. For this reason, the endset temperature is employed as the temperature of a complete phase transformation. The three characteristic temperatures are all useful in describing the melting behavior of thermal storage materials.|$|E
40|$|A $k$-Artal {{arrangement}} is a reducible algebraic curve {{composed of a}} smooth cubic and $k$ <b>inflectional</b> <b>tangents.</b> By studying the topological properties of their subarrangements, we prove that for $k= 3, 4, 5, 6 $, there exist Zariski pairs of $k$-Artal arrangements. These Zariki pairs can be distinguished in a geometric way {{by the number of}} collinear triples in the set of singular points contained in the cubic. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{splitting}} {{number of}} a plane irreducible curve for a Galois cover is effective to distinguish the embedded topologies of plane curves. In this paper, we define a connected number of any plane curve for a Galois cover whose branch divisor has no common components with the plane curve, {{which is similar to}} the splitting number. We classify the embedded topology of Artal arrangements of degree b≥ 4 by the connected number, where an Artal arrangement of degree b is a plane curve consisting of one smooth curve of dgree b and three total <b>inflectional</b> <b>tangents.</b> Comment: 12 page...|$|R
40|$|A {{congruence}} is {{a surface}} in the Grassmannian Gr(1,P^ 3) of lines in projective 3 -space. To a space curve C, we associate the Chow hypersurface in Gr(1,P^ 3) consisting of all lines which intersect C. We compute the singular locus of this hypersurface, which contains the congruence of all secants to C. A surface S in P^ 3 defines the Hurwitz hypersurface in Gr(1,P^ 3) of all lines which are tangent to S. We show that its singular locus has two components for general enough S: the congruence of bitangents and the congruence of <b>inflectional</b> <b>tangents.</b> We give new proofs for the bidegrees of the secant, bitangent and inflectional congruences, using geometric techniques such as duality, polar loci and projections. We also study the singularities of these congruences. Comment: 26 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Congruences {{of lines}} in P 3, i. e. {{two-dimensional}} families of lines, and their focal surfaces, {{have been a}} popular object of study in classical algebraic geometry. They have been considered recently by several authors as Arrondo, Goldstein, Sols, Verra. Aim of the paper under review is to study from the modern point of view the notions appearing in this context, so to prove in a rigorous way some classical results. More precisely, a congruence is a surface X G(1, 3), its focal locus F, in general a surface, is the branch locus of the natural projection qX from the incidence correspondence IX to P 3. It results that a general line of X contains two foci counted with multiplicity, a line L whose points are all foci is called a focal line. In the paper under review the authors compute several invariants of the focal surface of a smooth congruence, e. g. its degree, class and sectional genus, {{and the degree of}} its nodal and cuspidal curves (assuming that these are the only 1 -dimensional components of its singular locus). Then they study in detail some important examples of congruences, i. e. the bisecant lines of a smooth curve C in P 3, the bitangents and the <b>inflectional</b> <b>tangents</b> of a smooth surface. In the first case they find that in general the focal surface F is all formed by focal lines, which are the stationary bisecants. In the other examples they find, among other results, that is a component of the focal surface with high multiplicity, and that at least one component of F is formed by focal lines. Motivated by the examples they state a series of conjectures about congruences whose focal surface is not irreducible or not reduced, and about singularities of congruences of bitangents or inflectionary tangents to not necessarily smooth surfaces of P 3...|$|R
