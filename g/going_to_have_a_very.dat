500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E

We are, by the standard of bearing and clothing I remark about us, unattractive in dress and deportment. We have nothing to produce to explain our presence here, no bit of a flying machine or a space travelling sphere or any of the apparatus customary on these occasions. We have no means beyond a dwindling amount of small change out of a gold coin, upon which I suppose in ethics and the law some native Utopian had a better claim. We may already have got ourselves into trouble with the authorities with that confounded number of yours!" ...|$|E

"I think," [...] he {{said when}} the meal was over and the waiter had placed the dessert and wine {{on the table and}} had retired, [...] "that we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{pleasant}} cruise. I am afraid we sha'n't have much chance of distinguishing ourselves in the fighting way, though we may pick up some of those rascally little craft that prey on the native commerce and capture a small European merchantman occasionally. With our small crew we certainly cannot regard ourselves as a match for any of the regular pirates, who would carry vastly heavier metal, and crews of at least four times our strength. The admiral expressly warned me that it was not intended that the Arrow should undertake that sort of business. Our mission is rather to gain news of what passes in the interior, pick up fugitives who may be hiding in the woods, and act in fact as a sort of floating observatory. Any fighting, therefore, that we may get will be if we are attacked. In that case, of course, we shall do our best. I am sure we shall be a pleasant party on board. Of course in a small craft like this we shall mess together. It is necessary, for the sake of discipline, that when we are on deck we should follow the usual observances, but when we are below together we shall be three mess-mates without any formality or nonsense." ...|$|E

I just feel tired of everything sensible and I'm going to let my imagination run riot for the summer. Oh, you needn't be alarmed, Marilla. I'll only let it run riot within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly time this summer, for maybe it's the last summer I'll be a little girl. Mrs. Lynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I've done this I'll have to put on longer skirts. She says I'm all running to legs and eyes. And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them and be very dignified. It won't even do to believe in fairies then, I'm afraid; so I'm going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer.

5000|$|At the {{previous}} race in Canada, Hamilton had crashed into Räikkönen {{in the pit}} lane, when Raikkönën braked to {{stop in front of}} the red {{light at the end of}} the pit lane. Williams driver Nico Rosberg then collided into the back of Hamilton. Hamilton later said that he saw the light too late and could not avoid hitting the Ferrari. Hamilton and Rosberg were both given ten place grid penalties for the French Grand Prix, meaning that whatever their qualifying position, they could start no better than 11th. After the penalty was given, McLaren's CEO, Martin Whitmarsh, said that he thought the penalty was [...] "severe", citing a similar incident at Monaco where Raikkönën had crashed into the back of Force India's Adrian Sutil. There, no penalty had been given. However, Rosberg said that the penalties from Canada were [...] "deserved". When Hamilton was asked whether the penalty would force him to change his approach, Hamilton said that [...] "it doesn't really. It's a race, I'm here to win and so I approach it the same." [...] "It's going to be harder," [...] he added, [...] "coming from the back, but I don't have any doubts or any worries, I think we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong package this weekend, and I think the car will be as good if not better than it was in the last race.

5000|$|The {{album was}} first {{announced}} in late August 2010, following Queensrÿche's signing with the Loud & Proud label of Roadrunner Records. Drummer Scott Rockenfield {{commented on the}} album, saying [...] "It's huge rock but with a great dance vibe to it, real modern dance. It’s kind of like Rage through a time tunnel, bringing it into the now. There {{are a lot of}} electronic elements to it. It’s a big rock thing that {{is going to have a}} lot of color to it — it’s good and really intense”. In an October 2010 interview with Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles, vocalist Geoff Tate revealed some information about the upcoming album: We are planning on a spring release. It will be a very strong collection of songs. The topic of the album is all over the place. There's a lot of different subjects we tackle. The sound and the writing direction is probably more focused on rhythm than any of our records have been. Scott and Eddie are contributing a lot to the composition of this record, so there's a lot of focus on rhythm structure and keeping things very rhythmatic and moving. It's got a lot of very intricate bass/drum work on it that perhaps hasn't been featured on earlier albums. Therefore it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> modern sound to it. Music these days, outside of hard rock and metal, is really rhythm-oriented. There's a lot of movement to it. So we're kind of going with that as a feature on this record. Still, there's a lot of interesting guitar work as we try to push the guitar into different areas as well, while trying to stay away from the bone-head stuff like the chunk-chunk-chunk kind of thing. We're using the guitars in a more melodic sense. The band is producing it with Kelly Gray, our longtime friend and engineer. We've got about three-quarters written and recorded. The album title was revealed as Dedicated to Chaos on March 29, 2011, with Tate calling the album [...] "a clash and slash of musical experimentation anchored by the pulse of digital code”. A summer tour in support of the album was also announced. The album art was unveiled on April 13. The album's track listing was released on May 5.|$|E

5000|$|At a Catholic orphanage {{located in}} Chicago, Hank Kipple is {{currently}} being disciplined for bad behavior (namely rigging {{the lights in the}} dorm rooms to not only use the Clapper, but also only to respond to his claps) and saying [...] "God can shove it." [...] Later on,there is a scene of Hank in his dorm room with several other children who live at the orphanage. It appears that his brash, rude manner even extends to his peers, and not just his authority figures. He also comments on the persistent danger of crime that is associated with living in an orphanage in downtown Chicago. Sure enough, as the children go to sleep, two burglars seek refuge in the dorm room of St. Frederick's. Hank starts smart-mouthing to the burglars, putting the other children of the orphanage in danger as the burglars decide to make them hostages. Just as one of the burglars begin threatening the children, a voice comes from the rafters of the old orphanage. It's Hawk-Owl, the Midnight Avenger. While the children don't recognize him (and some of the younger kids mistake him for Spider-Man), both of the thugs recognize him almost immediately. With Hank's help, the Hawk-Owl makes short work of the burglars with an assortment of crime-fighting tools. In the morning, while the children are still abuzz about the excitement the night before, Father Joe announces that the Orphanage is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> special guest. This turns out to be Jack Danner, a successful albeit unkempt businessman, accompanied by his butler Daniel Toliver (whom he calls James in this issue,) his Aunt Ruth, and seemingly mute chauffeur Lee. Danner, interested in adopting one of the children from the orphanage, first has a question and answer session with them. Most of the children ask him about his house, especially if he has toys waiting for them. Hank, on the other hand, gives him quite a hard time on everything from his demeanor to his politics. Eventually Hank is told to leave, which he seems to appreciate. Toliver notes that Danner has already picked [...] "the surly kid". As Danner is set to adopt one of the children, a child named John asks him if Danner will go take him [...] "make poop," [...] which startles Danner quite a bit, especially the prospect of having to watch him. Afterwards, Father Joe comes up to the dorm room where Hank has run off too, telling him to pack his bags. First thinking he's being kicked out, Hank grows very apologetic for the first time, until Father Joe explains himself: Danner has indeed chosen to adopt Hank. Hank expresses his confusion, given how rude he had been to Danner, but Father Joe proposed that perhaps Danner simply saw beyond the [...] "bravado". Father Joe also reminds him to pack quickly, seeing how he doesn't usually recommend long goodbyes. By the time the conversation is over, Hank is back to his brash self, smart-mouthing to God one more time as he exits, in the shadow of Hawk-Owl.|$|E
