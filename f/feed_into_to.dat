50|$|The Bayport Container Terminal, {{or simply}} the Bayport Terminal, {{is a major}} deep water port in the Greater Houston area in Texas (United States). This {{relatively}} new terminal, part of the Port of Houston, is designed to handle standardized cargo containers and offload the nearby Barbours Cut Terminal, which has no further room for expansion. The Bayport Terminal is situated along the Bayport Ship Channel off Galveston Bay, between La Porte, Texas and Seabrook, Texas (adjacent to Shoreacres and El Jardin).

30|$|To {{generate}} these fake queries, TMN transforms {{titles of}} articles listed in RSS <b>feeds</b> <b>into</b> queries. <b>To</b> do so, it randomly extracts keywords from a title and aggregate {{them into a}} fake query. The number of keywords is randomly chosen between 1 and 6. As a direct consequence, for a given title, this algorithm is able to create multiple fake queries and thus, two TMN users using the same RSS feeds do not systematically create the same fake queries.|$|R

50|$|With {{drainage}} and rainfall-related {{flood protection}} a huge concern, man-made canals were {{constructed by the}} mid-19th century. Drainage machines and pumps were built to lift the drained water over the high ridges and into the outfall canals. By 1878, there were approximately 36 mi of drainage canals <b>feeding</b> <b>into</b> Lake Pontchartrain <b>to</b> remove rainwater from populated areas. Today there are 90 mi of covered drainage canals, 82 mi of open channel canals and several thousand miles of storm sewer lines that <b>feed</b> <b>into</b> the system.|$|R

40|$|Four {{relatively}} distinct {{traditions in}} {{work with people}} with intellectual disability are identified: ordinary living/normalisation, functional, behavioural, and developmental. These approaches are analysed as paradigms which could be incompatible or compatible. The paradigms are explored {{in relation to a}} profoundly disabled man, whose case illustrates the complementarity of these approaches. It is suggested that the ordinary living paradigm is best seen as a basic guide to direction with the other paradigms <b>feeding</b> <b>into</b> it <b>to</b> help chiefly with implementation. However, the possibility is raised that rather than than the co-existence of different paradigms, what is really being sought here is a new and super-ordinate paradigm that still awaits its full development...|$|R
40|$|Access to {{training}} and the effective utilisation of skills in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) {{has long been an}} area of interest to public policy makers and economic development practitioners. SMEs often lack capabilities and infrastructure {{to make the most of}} their human capabilities – and as a consequence tend to have lower levels of training and skills development. It is against this back drop that the Department of Labour initiated this study with the OECD in conjunction with the Ministry of Economic Development, Tertiary Education Commission, Industry Training Federation and Business New Zealand.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to offer an {{interpretation}} of the images of Colombian English teachers constructed in official discourse, particularly (but not exclusively) in the document "Estándares básicos de competencias en lenguas extranjeras: inglés. Formar en lenguas extranjeras, el reto". This is part of a larger critical discourse analysis research study whose main data source is the aforementioned document. The analysis was conducted following a Hallidayan "clause as representation" approach combined with Fairclough's methodology for a critical discourse analysis. Three main images were found: teachers are invisible; teachers as clerks; and teachers as technicians/marketers. The conclusions show that official discourse plays into folk concepts of Colombian teachers and <b>feeds</b> <b>into</b> them <b>to</b> validate official unilateral decisions...|$|R
50|$|The low brought {{heavy rains}} {{to the state}} of Queensland, with many centers {{reporting}} 24-hour totals over 150 mm. This rainfall activity was enhanced by an upper-level trough which brought showers as far south as Sydney on 1 January. Widespread flooding caused some of river systems which <b>feed</b> <b>into</b> Lake Eyre <b>to</b> reach flood stage. At least one death was indirectly attributed to the storm, when heavy rain and fog caused a car to drive off a road north of Brisbane.|$|R

This paper presents the design and evaluation of a prototype mobile application for lifelong learning.

As a result of the evaluation, a revised set of design guidelines is produced that can potentially <b>feed</b> <b>into</b> other attempts <b>to</b> develop a framework for designing applications for mobile learners...|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{explore how}} nations without states, or “stateless nations” respond to {{new forms of}} {{religious}} diversity. Drawing on the cases of Quebec and Catalonia, I do so by tracing the historical emergence of the cultural narratives that are mobilized to support institutional responses to diversity {{and the way they}} bear on contemporary controversies. The article builds on recent research and theorizations of religious diversity and secularism, which it expands and specifies by spelling out how preexisting cultural anxieties stemming from fears over national survival are stored in collective memories and, if successfully mobilized, <b>feed</b> <b>into</b> responses <b>to</b> migrationdriven religious diversification. I show that while Quebec and Catalonia were in many ways similarly positioned before the onset of powerful modernization processes and the resurgence of nationalism from the 1960 s onwards, their responses to religious diversity differ dramatically...|$|R
40|$|A {{paper that}} explores {{the extent to}} which images remain {{resistant}} to their assimilation by the linguistic and technical systems that society has developed. It uses Damisch´s theory of /cloud/ to comment upon and refract Flusser´s notion of the technical image, proposing a productive incompleteness that the image continually <b>feeds</b> <b>into</b> our relationship <b>to</b> the world. With the image, laterality is as significant as linearity. Its form does not presuppose how it should be approached or understood; the provisionality heralded by /cloud/ and {{by the nature of the}} (technical) image can problematise, confound, or even offer an antidote to a systematising drive in the mediated world we inhabit...|$|R
