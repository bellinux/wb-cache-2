5|$|Construction {{on the bus}} tunnel {{project began}} with partial {{closures}} of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction</b> and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour. To prepare for extended periods of service disruption on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its electric trolleybus routes onto 1st Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction,</b> but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E

It was built as a two-lane bridge with shoulders; expansion since then has added a second lane <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction.</b> By the early 21st century it, like the Maroon Creek Bridge, was carrying more traffic than it had ever been expected to and was in poor structural condition.|$|E

5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction</b> and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction,</b> or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} boundary stabilization of 3 × 3 linear first-order hyperbolic systems with one positive and two negative transport speeds by using backstepping. The main result of the paper is to supplement the previous works on how to choose multi-boundary feedback inputs applied on the states corresponding to the negative velocities to obtain finite-time stabilization of the original system in the spatial L 2 sense. Our method is still valid for boundary stabilization of general n × n hyperbolic system with arbitrary numbers of states traveling <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} World War I, six guns in BSG mounts {{equipped}} Battery Friedrich August on {{the island}} of Wangerooge. Three of these were transferred to Helgoland after 1935 when Hitler renounced the Treaty of Versailles which had demilitarized the island. By 1938, they equipped Battery von Schröder and were manned by troops of the Second Naval Artillery Battalion (II. Marine-Artillerie-Abteilung), later 122nd Naval Artillery Battalion (122. Marine-Artillerie-Abteilung). After the French were defeated in 1940 all three guns were transferred to Le Trésorerie, near Boulogne-sur-Mer, France where they assumed their former name of Battery Friedrich August. These guns were initially in open barbettes with 360° traverse, but these were later rebuilt into concrete casemates with overhead cover. that could elevate to 50degrees and train 220degrees <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

Customer Information System screens by the entrance show arrival and departure information for all platforms, as do displays {{on each of the}} platforms. All platforms are signalled for trains <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction</b> and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use any part of the station. Platforms with odd numbers are at the east end, even numbers at the west end (geographically the south, due to the curvature of the platforms).|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Defender {{established}} scrolling in shoot 'em ups, offering horizontally extended levels. Unlike most later {{games in}} the genre, the player could move <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction.</b> The game's use of scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen, and though the game's minimap feature had been introduced before, Defender integrated it into the gameplay in a more essential manner. Konami's Scramble, released in 1981, is a side-scrolling shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels. Atari's Tempest, released in 1981, {{is one of the}} earliest tube shooters and an early attempt to incorporate a 3D perspective into shooter games. Tempest ultimately went on to influence major rail shooters.|$|E

Here it continues northwest to East–West Road and turns to run along the shores of Whitefish Bay and cross the Tahquamenon River near its mouth. Continuing along the bay as Whitefish Road, M-123 meets the community of Paradise, the northernmost point along the highway. It is here that M-123 intersects Whitefish Point Road, which continues north to Whitefish Point, home of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. <b>In</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction,</b> M-123 runs southbound from Paradise, changing direction.

5|$|The Mersea Week is {{a week-long}} August festival of boat racing {{organised}} by the West Mersea Yacht Club and Dabchicks Sailing Club, established in 1973. During the week, starting on Monday, there are races for many boat {{classes in the}} Blackwater Estuary, from Optimist dinghies to large yachts. The most celebrated event is the Round-the-Island race, where dinghies attempt to sail round the island <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction,</b> helped over the Strood by volunteers. On Saturday, there is a regatta at West Mersea, followed by a selection of water sports and a firework display at dusk. One of the popular events on Saturday is walking a greasy pole rigged {{over the side of}} the hosting Thames sailing barge.|$|E
5|$|The inner German border {{was never}} entirely sealed {{in the fashion}} of {{the border between the}} two Koreas and could be crossed <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>direction</b> {{throughout}} the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air– the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—DC motors find a {{wide range}} of use in various fields because of their small size and high energy output. Field failure of DC motor is very common phenomenon. This paper {{presents}} a low cost system for the protection of DC motor from field failure. The purpose of this field failure relay is to protect the motor from the damage of field failure and also provide a simple speed control technique. Operational amplifier and microcontroller together works as field failure relay. The class-E chopper is used to rotate the motor <b>in</b> <b>either</b> <b>directions</b> and for breaking. The pulse width modulation technique is used for smooth speed control. The concept of op-amp in field failure protection can be extended for application to different DC motor drives such as: series, separately excited and permanent magnet DC motor...|$|R
