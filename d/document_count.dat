50|$|The {{village of}} Eisenbach was founded long before its thus far {{earliest}} known documentary mention. It lay within the so-called Remigiusland, {{which had been}} given in the mid 12th century to the Counts of Veldenz as a Schutzvogtei (thus making the Counts “lords protector”). According to a 1200 <b>document,</b> <b>Count</b> Heinrich of Veldenz and Geroldseck declared {{that he was having}} seven solidi in Trier currency paid yearly to the Provost of the Remigiusberg, the actual holder of the Remigiusland, for the villages of Ysenbach and Leidenstal, which he had bought from a knight from the County of Zweibrücken. Leidenstal is a now vanished village that once lay within what are now Rehweiler’s limits, while Ysenbach is an old name for Niedereisenbach. Heinrich was a count of the younger line of the Counts of Veldenz, who also by marrying the orphaned Hereditary Countess Agnes of Veldenz took over the regiment. As described above, the Veldenz line died out for lack of a male heir in 1444, and the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken was founded.|$|E
50|$|In {{the village}} of Oberhausen (see Vanished villages below), people may once again have settled within what are now Oberstaufenbach’s limits {{as early as the}} 8th century. Sometime in the Early Middle Ages, a castle complex was built, in which the {{available}} Roman grave monuments would have been used. This castle was not used for very long, though, and any trace of it was ﬁnally destroyed by stone quarrying in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1393, Oberstaufenbach had its ﬁrst documentary mention in a document of bestowal from Count Friedrich of Veldenz. Professor Ernst Christmann, however, was of the opinion that there were already settlers in what is now Oberstaufenbach by 900, for Emperor Otto I in 945 granted a liegeman six Königshufen (an area of land) that lay between Bosenbach and Reichenbach, that is to say, within what are now Oberstaufenbach’s and Niederstaufenbach’s limits. Whatever the facts were, Oberstaufenbach was not mentioned by name in this <b>document.</b> <b>Count</b> Friedrich’s 1393 document, however, in which he granted his wife Margareta von Nassau villages belonging to the Ämter of Reichenbach and Theisbergstegen, lists Oberstaufenbach by name, along with all the other villages that he gave his wife. About the turn of the second millennium, the village belonged to the Imperial Domain (Reichsland) near Kaiserslautern. Back then, Oberstaufenbach was considered part of the Amt of Deinsberg (Theißberg) am Glan, where the parochial seat could also be found. This Amt ended up by pledge in the ownership of the Counts of Veldenz and passed in 1444 to the Counts Palatine (later Dukes) of Palatinate-Zweibrücken as rightful heirs to the County of Veldenz.|$|E
50|$|According {{to the old}} border {{descriptions}} of the Remigiusland, Neunkirchen am Potzberg lay outside this holding of the Bishopric of Reims in the Westrich, and thus in the Free Imperial Domain (Reichsland), which stretched out over a broad swath of land around Castle Lautern. Just when Neunkirchen arose as a village {{is very hard to}} determine, but it was likely founded only in the 10th century. Ernst Christmann was of the opinion that a church that Otto the Great gave the Worms Cathedral Foundation in 937 as a donation was none other than the church in Neunkirchen am Potzberg. This opinion, though, is contradicted by historians today. Researchers M. Dolch and A. Greule, for example, hold that the church in question was the one in a place called Neunkirchen southeast of Kübelberg, known as “Neuenkirchen” in contrast to “Altenkirchen” (neu and alt are German for “new” and “old” respectively). They base their thesis on the assertion that the said church appears several times in documents from the 10th century, and that its location was more thoroughly described, as in 956 when it was described as being in a forest near the Cheuilinbahc (a brook now called the Kohlbach, and also likely the old name for Kübelberg, but certainly not for Schwedelbach). Therefore, Neunkirchen am Potzberg cannot be the same place as the Neunkirchen in the 937 document as was claimed by so many historians in days gone by (Widder, Frey and Gümbel among others). As early as the 15th century, this village in what is now the southern Kusel district was given up. Furthermore, Neunkirchen am Potzberg must also be distinguished from Neunkirchen an der Nahe, which like Medard was held by the Bishops of Verdun. Any reference to this relationship that crops up in a document about “Neunkirchen” must always have to do with Neunkirchen an der Nahe. In view of all these revisions to the body of knowledge about “Neunkirchen”, Neunkirchen am Potzberg’s ﬁrst documentary mention must be considered to be a 1329 document kept at the Munich Main State Archive (Hauptstaatsarchiv München), which contains the wording “zu Nunkyrchen”. According to this <b>document,</b> <b>Count</b> Georg I of Veldenz delivered to Dietrich Schwinde von Rittersdorf 100 pounds in Heller to be paid out of a comital estate near Neunkirchen am Potzberg. About this estate, which was called Horreys gut, nothing further is known. The Count may have owned an estate in the still free Reichsland from which he drew income to pay his vassals. The free Reichsland was then, in the earlier half of the 14th century, pledged to various regional lords. Neunkirchen am Potzberg thus passed in 1345 along with all the villages in the Amt of Reichenbach as an Imperial pledge to the Counts of Veldenz. While it is still not quite certain as to whether the 1329 document indeed deals with Neunkirchen am Potzberg when it refers to Horreys gut, it can be so assumed with certainty by what appears in a further documentary mention. This deals with a 1393 letter granting a widow’s estate from Count Friedrich of Veldenz, which is reprinted in the Acta Academiae Theodoro-Palatinae. Yet another mention of Neunkirchen from late in Veldenz times {{is to be found in}} a 1430 document, according to which Siegfried Blick von Lichtenberg bequeathed to his wife Katharina money from, among other places, Neunkirchen in the amount of 2 pounds in Heller. It is clear that this means Neunkirchen am Potzberg from the addition of the phrase “in dem Konigrych” - “in the kingdom”. The Reichsland still existed, even if the king had pledged it. In 1444, the County of Veldenz met its end when Count Friedrich III of Veldenz died without a male heir. His daughter Anna wed King Ruprecht’s son Count Palatine Stephan. By uniting his own Palatine holdings with the now otherwise heirless County of Veldenz - his wife had inherited the county, but not her father’s title - and by redeeming the hitherto pledged County of Zweibrücken, Stephan founded a new County Palatine, as whose comital residence he chose the town of Zweibrücken: the County Palatine - later Duchy - of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. It is likely that throughout the Middle Ages, only a few houses stood around the church, only the rectory and the estate with various outbuildings. Likely more heavily settled was the now vanished village of Lanzweiler, lying somewhat lower down than Neunkirchen.|$|E

50|$|Konken {{is without}} a doubt {{one of the oldest}} places in the {{so-called}} Remigiusland. In the 9th-century holding and taxation register kept by the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims, the Polyptique, one can read:Census de Conchis. Uno anno XX solidos et VIIII denarios et obulum. In festo Sancti Martini iiii liberas et iii solidos; de sartis iii solidos. Medio martio v solidos de capitalicio. Ad natale Domini x solidos; de oblationibus pullos xxv; cum unoquoque x ova … de mappagiis xxv modios et dimidium de avena, de siligine xii modios et dimidium. While this in itself is a rather dull recitation of taxes levied on the village, it does offer a window on Konken’s early past. Translated from the Mediaeval Latin, it comes out as follows:Revenues from Konken: in one year 20 solidi and 8 denarii and a small donation. At Saint Martin’s festival 4 pounds and 3 solidi; from the workers 3 solidi, in mid-March 5 solidi in capital. On the Lord’s birthday 10 solidi; in chickens 25; at the same time also 10 eggs … furthermore 25 and a half bushels of oats, in legumes 12 and a half bushels. It is unclear, however, which standard of “bushel” was being used. Nevertheless, what is indeed clear is that when the ﬁgures given here for Konken are compared against those for the eighteen other Remigiusland places listed in this Polyptique, Konken comes out as one of the wealthiest places in the whole region. The name’s pre-Germanic origins might lead one to the assumption that there was continuous settlement in what is now Konken beginning in Gallo-Roman times. The name “Konken”, though, furnishes no such proof. Theoretically, it could be a settlement from Gallo-Roman times, but what is likelier is that it arose in Frankish times, and simply has a pre-Germanic name drawn from a name still borne at that time by a local waterway. According to this view, Konken would have arisen as a Germanic village in its seashell-shaped dale whose pre-Germanic name was still known. Be that as it may, the village is still surely one of the oldest places in the countryside around Kusel. The time when the village actually arose, however, cannot be ascertained through documents. It is believed that a village grew up bit by bit around a chapel. It was throughout the Middle Ages as seat of an Unteramt and as the hub of a parish always a place of greater importance than many. In 1112, Count Gerlach I, a scion of the Counts of the Nahegau, founded the new County of Veldenz and also exercised the Schutzvogtei (roughly “lord protectorship”) over the Remigiusland. In 1124, Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz conﬁrmed to Abbot Odo of the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims the Church of Kusel with its three afﬁliated churches in Konken, Altenglan and Pfeffelbach. In 1270, Heinrich von Geroldseck founded the Younger Line of Veldenz. In a 1326 <b>document,</b> <b>Count</b> Georg of Veldenz obliged the “Amt of Konken” to pay the knight Sir Harnisch of Bitsch a yearly amount of 100 Heller. That the Amt of Concken also had to pay the knight Sir Johann of Randeck, one of Count of Veldenz Heinrich II’s Burgmannen, 15 pounds in Heller is something that comes to light in a 1339 document. At that time, the count’s young wife, Agnes, was granted the Amt of Konken as a morning gift. All ﬁve Schultheißen (head ofﬁcials in the Unterämter) in the Remigiusland appear in a 1385 document from Counts Heinrich III and Friedrich II of Veldenz, among them one named as “Clays in Concken”. In 1444, the County of Veldenz met its end when Count Friedrich III of Veldenz died without a male heir. His daughter Anna wed King Ruprecht’s son Count Palatine Stephan. By uniting his own Palatine holdings with the now otherwise heirless County of Veldenz - his wife had inherited the county, but not her father’s title - and by redeeming the hitherto pledged County of Zweibrücken, Stephan founded a new County Palatine, as whose comital residence he chose the town of Zweibrücken: the County Palatine - later Duchy - of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Beginning in the Middle Ages, Konken was a market centre. From all over the region came the dealers and farmers to the Martinimarkt (“Saint Martin’s Day Market”). Later a Sommermarkt (“Summer Market”) was also held. By the mid 18th century, marketgoers could reach the market on one of the district’s few paved roads.|$|E
50|$|Because the Steinbach and the Henschbach {{formed the}} border between the Remigiusland and the Hornbach Monastery’s {{holdings}} in the Münchweiler valley, Steinbach’s and Frutzweiler’s paths through history were utterly unalike. From the Imperial Domain (Reichsland) around Castle Lautern, kings split certain parcels off to donate them to various ecclesiastical and secular lordships. Great parts passed into Salian hands. Count Werner I of this dynasty endowed the Hornbach Monastery in 737, whose ﬁrst abbot was Saint Pirmin. The Count bestowed a great many estates and landholds upon the monastery, including the Münchweiler valley, where Steinbach lay. As a ﬁef from the Hornbach Monastery with its centre at Glan-Münchweiler, all this area’s villages passed ﬁrst in 1323 to the Raugraves in the Nahegau, and thereafter, in 1344, to the Archbishop of Trier and the Breidenborns in 1388. In connection with the Münchweiler valley, the village of Steinbach and the now vanished village of Frensweiler were both mentioned repeatedly, although the latter was mentioned earlier. A man named Conradus de Vrodenswilre was mentioned as far back as 1313 in the family Mauchenheim’s cartulary, while a village named Frinßwiller was named in 1419 in the family Breidenborn’s cartulary. In the Weistum from 1456, a one Clais von Frynswillr crops up as a witness, and in a further 1461 Weistum from Glan-Münchweiler, someone who is likely the same man crops up again as Claz von Frinßwiller (a Weistum - cognate with English wisdom - was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times). The Lords of Frenzweiler may have been considered lower nobility in their own time. In 1355, Steinbach had its ﬁrst documentary mention in a border description of the Remigiusland; it was mentioned again in the 1419 document mentioned above, and then again in a 1541 Weistum (also a border description). The modern spelling was used, although much of the text used spellings that would now be considered archaic; the spelling used for Frensweiler, on the other hand, was Frntzweiler. Through Georg I von der Leyen’s marriage to Eva von Mauchenheim in 1456, the House of Leyen came into possession of the Bliesgau and also, by hereditary accession in 1486, of a share in the Blieskastel castle. At the same time, Abbot Ulrich of the Hornbach Monastery granted Jörge von der Leyen, a Burgmann of Castle Lautern, the Münchweiler valley. The Lords of Leyen had their roots in the lower Moselle area, and by the High Middle Ages, they already resided at their castle near Gondorf on the Moselle. They were mostly {{in the service of the}} Archbishop of Trier, and Johann von der Leyen-Safﬁg was even chosen to ﬁll that ofﬁce in 1556. Alongside the Leyens, their kin, the Mauchenheims took turns being enfeoffed with parts of the monastery’s holdings in the Münchweiler valley, but as of 1533, only the Barons - later Counts - of Leyen were ﬁefholders there. While Steinbach and Frensweiler eventually lay within the landholds granted the Leyens by the monastery, Frutzweiler lay in the Remigiusland, which was held by the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims, and which was also given in 1112 to the Counts of Veldenz as a Vogtei. This put the village in the County of Veldenz. Frutzweiler coincidentally had its ﬁrst documentary mention in the same 1355 border description as Steinbach (see above), and was mentioned again in a 1387 document from the Counts of Sponheim. A man named Baldewin von Frutzweiler stood in the late 15th century as the Burgmann at Lichtenberg Castle. According to a 1391 <b>document,</b> <b>Count</b> Friedrich III of Veldenz enfeoffed this Baldewin with a rental income of 8 pounds in Lichtenberg currency. In 1397, Baldewin still appeared among the Burgmannen at Lichtenberg Castle. In 1402, Count Friedrich conﬁrmed for him that this rental income could be bequeathed to his offspring. Baldewin had two sons, who were likewise mentioned in documents in the years still to come. One was named Tilman and the other Baldwin after his father. Tilman, too, was in the castle’s service as a Junker. In 1414, he conﬁrmed that he was entitled to the same rental income of eight Gulden as his now late father. The younger Baldwin, Tilman’s brother, now appeared in the record under the name Baldewin von Zweibrücken. He, too, lived as a Junker at Lichtenberg Castle, and according to a 1441 document, received a rental income of 8 pounds in Heller. This younger Baldewin was married to Jutta von Wadenau, whom he granted his Lichtenberg Castle ﬁef in 1441, a deed conﬁrmed by Count Friedrich III. In 1444, the County of Veldenz met its end when Count Friedrich III of Veldenz died without a male heir. His daughter Anna wed King Ruprecht’s son Count Palatine Stephan. By uniting his own Palatine holdings with the now otherwise heirless County of Veldenz - his wife had inherited the county, but not her father’s title - and by redeeming the hitherto pledged County of Zweibrücken, Stephan founded a new County Palatine, as whose comital residence he chose the town of Zweibrücken: the County Palatine - later Duchy - of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. From 1444 on, Frutzweiler thus lay in this state.|$|E

This is achieved by randomly selecting toponyms from the Ordnance Survey 50 K gazetteer to create search queries and thus gather <b>document</b> <b>counts</b> from various web sources for Great Britain. The same gazetteer is then used to geo-code the results and enable mapping. To validate our approach, and demonstrate the effects of geo/non-geo and geo/geo ambiguity, we mapped the selected toponyms to Geograph, a community project that contains user generated geo-tagged photographs of the UK. Although success varies with resolution, the proposed approach is likely sufficient to be reliably used by applications exploring the geographic coverage of the web for cases where references to settlements are likely to be common. In our case, we applied the method to produce maps of web coverage for a range of sources at a resolution of 30 km...|$|R
