In his Joventut editorials Caylà remained cautious and preferred not to <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> as to the new regime.

He called his fellow Carlists not to renounce their vision, suggesting to see whether the Republic would turn into an orderly state or whether the project would fail. In his trademark style he warned that extremism was the key enemy of the new regime.|$|E

According to Liston, Milo [...] "transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities".|$|E
500|$|Writing in London's Evening Standard on 5 January 2011, media {{commentator}} Roy Greenslade {{expressed concern}} {{over a number}} of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates' landlord, Jefferies, following his arrest, describing the coverage as [...] "character assassination on a large scale". He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published, including a headline in The Sun describing Jefferies– a former schoolmaster at Clifton College– as weird, posh, lewd and creepy; a story from the Daily Express quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as [...] "... a sort of Nutty Professor" [...] who made them feel [...] "creeped out" [...] by his [...] "strange" [...] behaviour; and an article from the Daily Telegraph, which reported Jefferies [...] "has been described by pupils at Clifton College ... as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films". Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April– The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Daily Star, the Daily Express, the Daily Mail and the Daily Record– seeking damages for libel. It was held that the media were quick to <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> regarding Jefferies' arrest.

40|$|An {{association}} of a 'jumping to conclusions' (JTC) reasoning style and delusions has been repeatedly found. The data-gathering bias {{has been particularly}} implicated {{with higher levels of}} delusional conviction in schizophrenia. For the first time the symptom, psychological and social correlates of <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> are examined in a large general population sample. This is based upon the recognition that delusional ideation in non-clinical populations is on a continuum of severity with delusions in psychosis. Two hundred individuals completed a probabilistic reasoning task and assessments of paranoid ideation, intellectual functioning, affective symptoms, anomalies of experience, cognitive flexibility, illicit drug use, social support, and trauma. The <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> reasoning bias was found in 20 % of the non-clinical sample. JTC was strongly associated with higher levels of conviction in paranoid thoughts and the occurrence of perceptual anomalies, but not with the presence of affective symptoms. The results indicate that <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> is a reasoning bias specifically associated with levels of delusional conviction, and is not a product of generally high levels of distress and affect. The {{association of}} <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> with the types of anomalies of experience seen in psychotic disorders is intriguing, and consistent with recent dopamine dysregulation theories and the importance of reasoning to perception. The study is a further illustration of the need to consider the dimensions of delusional experience separately...|$|R

2500|$|Polish Jews were a 'visible minority' {{by modern}} standards, {{distinguishable}} by language, behavior and appearance. Only 12 percent of Jews declared Polish as {{their first language}} in the national census of 1931, while 79 percent listed Yiddish and the remaining 9 percent Hebrew as their mother-tongue. For {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews the Polish language was barely familiar. By contrast, the overwhelming majority of German Jews of this period spoke German as their first language. In the labour market of many cities including Poland's provincial capitals, the presence of such large, mostly non acculturated minority, was a source of competitive tension. Here is where the temptation to <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> with regard to Polish-Jewish relations in wartime should be resisted, wrote Gunnar Paulsson: [...] "leaving aside acts of war and Nazi perfidy, a Jew's chances of survival in hiding were no worse in Warsaw, at any rate, than in the Netherlands" [...] once the Holocaust began.|$|E
2500|$|Orlando Brown portrayed Edward [...] "Eddie" [...] Thomas, Aged 14–17. He is Raven's male best friend. He is an {{aspiring}} rapper, {{and is a}} guard on the school basketball team.

[...] after he finishes talking to his friends or girls that he likes. His parents are divorced, which is mentioned several times throughout the series. It is also said that he has a little brother. In one episode, Eddie and Raven not only start to develop romantic feelings for each other but they also kiss on the lips at two separate times; however, {{by the end of the}} episode, they decide to remain friends (though its strongly implied they're still interested in one another).

2500|$|Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller) {{took over}} the {{previously}} unnamed coffee shop in Dog River after her aunt's death and renamed it The Ruby in her honour. Originally from Toronto, Ontario, she is perpetually trying to fit into small-town life, with mixed, often disastrous, results. She is a terrible liar, quick to <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions,</b> a poor winner, and thinks everybody has a crush on her, and frequently exhibits insecurity and regret about the path her life has taken. She has also expressed frustration at being unable to find [...] "a stable guy" [...] to date in Dog River. She considers herself a sweetheart and secretly believes that she alone of the town's women deserves the [...] "Woman of Distinction" [...] award (which she eventually wins).

It is implied that she and Brent Leroy have feelings for each other, although neither will admit or act upon them. In season five Karen describes Lacey as [...] "too upbeat, overly fastidious, a little needysame old Lacey!". Her fashion sense trends toward the revealing. This was mocked in the episode [...] "Doc Small", in which she welcomes to Dog River Dr. Chris Garner, a doctor from an even smaller town, and she's shocked by Lacey's [...] "slutty" [...] top, which is actually one of her more conservative tops. After the series' end she opened a second Ruby in Wullerton, but the local health inspectors quickly shut it down.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{elucidate}} the factors contributing to the severity and persistence of delusional conviction. One hundred participants with current delusions, recruited for a treatment trial of psychological therapy (PRP trial), were assessed at baseline on measures of reasoning, emotions, and dimensions of delusional experience. Reasoning biases (belief inflexibility, <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions,</b> and extreme responding) were found to be present in one half of the sample. The hypothesis was confirmed that reasoning biases would be related to delusional conviction. There was evidence that belief inflexibility mediated the relationship between <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> and delusional conviction. Emotional states were not associated with the reasoning processes investigated. Anxiety, but not depression, made an independent contribution to delusional conviction...|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{conducted}} with the probabilistic reasoning task has provided support for the claim that patients with de-lusional disorder and schizophrenia display a <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> bias (early decisions {{on the basis of}} little evi-dence). Various explanations for this response pattern have been proposed. The goal {{of the present study was}} to provide further insight into the underlying mechanism(s) of this reasoning bias using a novel task for which competing accounts of the <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> bias make opposing predictions. Twenty-nine schizophrenic patients and 28 healthy con-trols were administered pictures from the Thematic Apperception Task (TAT) and were asked to judge the plausibil-ity of various interpretations for each picture. The results demonstrated that patients gave relatively high plausibility ratings for those interpretations that were judged as poor or unlikely by controls, but did not display abnormality on interpretations judged as good or excellent by controls. Contrary <b>to</b> a strict <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> account, patients did not converge on one particular interpretation, but rather pursued multiple alternatives. Liberal acceptance is seen as a possible contributor to the emergence or maintenance of delusions: initial ambivalence may subsequently promote the ac-ceptance of fallible interpretations.

2500|$|George Lakoff {{explained}} the inaccuracy of metonymic models, through which people <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>conclusions</b> without sufficient elaboration, {{giving rise to}} prototype effects, in his book Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things. First of all, we commonly consider typical examples as the better examples of a category. For instance, {{in the category of}} fruits, apples and oranges are typical examples. It is common practice that we engage in reasoning by making inferences from typical to non-typical examples. As a matter of fact, an enormous amount of our knowledge about categories of things is organized in terms of typical cases. We constantly draw inferences on the basis of that kind of knowledge. Second, salient examples, which are familiar and memorable, are unconsciously used in our understanding of things. For instance, if one's best friend is a vegetarian and they don't know any others well, they will tend to generalize from their best friend to other vegetarians. This is what Tversky and Kahneman referred to as the [...] "Conjunction fallacy". To understand this notion via Probability theory, think of two mutually unrelated events. The theory assumes that the likelihood of the co-occurrence of the two events is lower than that of the occurrence of either, ignoring the fact that the two events are actually unrelated to one another. To understand this with regards to Lavender linguistics, just because two individuals are both self-identified bisexual males {{does not necessarily mean that}} they must engage in the same linguistic patterns and social styles. The failure to capture this asymmetry between prototypical and non-prototypical cases results in ineffective study of Lavender linguistics. Typical and salient examples are just two kinds of metonymic models. Others include social stereotypes, ideal cases, paragons, generators, and submodels.|$|E
