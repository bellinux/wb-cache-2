5|$|After a brief postwar increase, Troy's {{population}} began {{a continuing}} decline. The city began {{the first of}} several urban renewal plans shortly after adopting its 1962 master plan. Those plans called for the demolition of many buildings downtown, {{to be replaced by a}} new arterial road, large public housing projects and a shopping mall. After various delays, those projects were either scaled back or abandoned <b>entirely.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> interim many businesses either closed or moved out of downtown.|$|E
5|$|Blending {{science fiction}} with film noir conventions, Strange Days explores themes such as racism, abuse of power, rape, and voyeurism. Although {{the story was}} {{conceived}} by Cameron around 1986, Bigelow found inspiration after incidents such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. The film was shot <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greater Los Angeles Area {{over a period of}} 77 nights. The film's SQUID scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot (POV), required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation.|$|E

5|$|Cuarón {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} {{with his son}} Jonás and attempted to develop the film at Universal Pictures. Later, the distribution rights were acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures. David Heyman, who previously worked with Cuarón on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), produced the film with him. Gravity was produced <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, where British visual effects company Framestore spent {{more than three years}} creating most of the film's visual effects, which make up over 80 of its 91 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Generalizing this problem, one can ask {{how many}} lines {{can be drawn}} on a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, {{such as the one}} {{illustrated}} above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician Hermann Schubert, who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quintic is 609,250.|$|E

It remained this way for over 30 years before being decommissioned as a provincial highway <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mass downloading of highways in 1997.

5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is capped by hard lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.|$|E

5|$|Heyer's {{earliest}} {{works were}} romance novels, most set before 1800. In 1935, she released Regency Buck, {{her first novel}} set in the Regency period. This bestselling novel essentially established the genre of Regency romance. Unlike other romance novels of the period, Heyer's novels used the setting as a plot device. Many of her characters exhibited modern-day sensibilities; more conventional characters in the novels would point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. The books were set almost <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of the wealthy upper class and only occasionally mention poverty, religion, or politics.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route164 (NY164) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} located <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town of Patterson in northeastern Putnam County, New York, in the United States. It is a short, two-lane back road that does not pass through any major {{populated}} areas and serves primarily as a connector between NY311 and NY22. NY164 also allows for faster passage from Interstate84 (I-84) to the Putnam Lake area via NY311. The route was originally designated as NY312 during the 1930s and later became part of NY216. NY164 was established on January1, 1970, following the truncation of NY216 to its current eastern terminus.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route61 (NY61) is a {{state highway}} located almost <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Niagara Falls in Niagara County, New York, in the United States. The road runs across the city in a northwest–southeast direction, {{terminating}} at NY384 at its southern extent and NY104 at its northern tip. Conceptually, the road, known as Hyde Park Boulevard, forms the eastern border of downtown Niagara Falls. It is the second-shortest two-digit route in New York after NY71 in Columbia County. The NY61 designation was in 1958 after being approved by the Niagara Falls City Council.|$|E

The southern part of this glen has large areas of old-growth forest, chiefly hemlocks. Ricketts Glen is <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Catskill Formation and all of the falls on this section of Kitchen Creek have plunge pools.|$|E
5|$|The Volksdeutsche of the {{occupied}} territories were {{an important part of}} the economies of {{the occupied}} territories, and by 1941, they were <b>entirely</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thrall of the Nazi Party. Relations between the occupation authorities and the Volksdeutsche were strained by the killing of ethnic Germans during the invasion, to the extent that Adolf Hitler became aware of the issue. The Volksdeutsche were not active in the Hungarian military or civil administration, but were represented in the Hungarian Parliament, and from 1942 were permitted to conscript their members into the Wehrmacht. The official organisation of the Volksdeutsche in Hungary, the Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn (National League of Germans in Hungary), was essentially autonomous during the war, including within the occupied territories.|$|E
