5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the same {{philosophers}} also claimed that common-sense mental states {{simply do not}} exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and will ultimately be {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August 2011, CERA added Radio Network House to {{the list}} of {{buildings}} to be demolished. On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury newspaper The Press reported that implosion of Radio Network House had been approved by CERA. The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media. The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition, Inc., an American company based in Phoenix, Maryland, that has a track record of 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The implosion of Radio Network House was a test case, as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before, and there are still many more tall buildings to be demolished in Christchurch. The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with.|$|E

Minor minerals and mineral groups in peridotite include plagioclase, spinel (commonly the mineral chromite), garnet (especially the mineral pyrope), amphibole, and phlogopite. In peridotite, plagioclase is stable at relatively low pressures (crustal depths), aluminous spinel at higher pressures (to depths of 60km or so), and garnet at yet higher pressures.|$|E

25|$|According to Isaac Luria (1534–72) {{and other}} {{commentators}} on the Zohar, righteous Gentiles {{do not have}} this demonic aspect and are in many ways similar to Jewish souls. A number of prominent Kabbalists, e.g., Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu of Vilna, the author of Sefer ha-Brit, held that only some marginal elements in the humanity represent these demonic forces. On the other hand, the souls of Jewish heretics <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> satanic energy than the worst of idol worshippers; this view is popular in some Hasidic circles, especially Satmar Hasidim.|$|E

25|$|The {{southwest}} and west {{regions of the}} city on the plateau are marked by rolling plains and savannahs, with the undeveloped portion primarily being used for cattle grazing and ranching. South of this region sits the coastal plain, with sandy soil and pine forest. Parts of north Auburn <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> rugged topographies, with thick forests in high hills and deep hollows of the type common to parts of eastern Tennessee. The region surrounded by Chewacla Park in the south of the city contains sharp peaks and sudden drops of elevation as the 1.05 billion-year-old rock of the Appalachians meets the coastal plain.|$|E
25|$|Brittany {{lies within}} the north {{temperate}} zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate, similar to Cornwall. Rainfall occurs regularly but sunny, cloudless days are also common. In the summer months, {{temperatures in the}} region can reach , yet the climate remains comfortable, especially {{when compared to the}} French regions located south of the Loire. The temperature difference between summer and winter is about fifteen degrees, but it varies depending on the proximity of the sea. The weather is generally milder on the seacoast than inland but rainfall occurs with the same intensity on both. The Monts d'Arrée, despite their low elevation, <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> rainfall {{than the rest of the}} region. The south coast, between Lorient and Pornic, enjoys more than 2,000 hours of sunshine per year.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{families}} of graphs may, however, <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> restrictive bounds {{on the numbers}} of maximal independent sets or maximal cliques. If all n-vertex graphs {{in a family of}} graphs have O(n) edges, and if every subgraph of a graph in the family also belongs to the family, then each graph in the family can have at most O(n) maximal cliques, all of which have size O(1). For instance, these conditions are true for the planar graphs: every n-vertex planar graph has at most 3n6 edges, and a subgraph of a planar graph is always planar, from which it follows that each planar graph has O(n) maximal cliques (of size at most four). Interval graphs and chordal graphs also have at most n maximal cliques, even though they are not always sparse graphs.|$|E
