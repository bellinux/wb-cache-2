Hussey's innings fetched him the Man of the match award and helped the Chennai Super Kings to proceed to the knockout stage where they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the league altogether.|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose not," [...] he {{admitted}} reluctantly. [...] "But what other chance they've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> I don't see. Look at 'us. We'll be {{up against it}} next." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Roche had a {{tremendous}} season. In the spring, he won the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, taking a third victory in the Tour de Romandie and fourth place plus a stage win in Paris–Nice. He also finished second in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the closest he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> a professional 'Monument' Classic. He blamed it on tactical naiveté and [...] "riding like an amateur".|$|R
50|$|It was Thomas Muster's 4th {{title of}} the year, and 27th of his career. It was his 1st Masters {{title of the}} year and his 3rd overall. It was his second title at the event, also winning in 1992. It was also the closest Becker ever <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> a clay court tournament, as he missed a match point on his own serve with a double-fault in the fourth-set tiebreaker.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then I'll ask," [...] she cried. [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> {{out at this}} game, and the way is to know. Look at {{all these}} Portuguese. Where are all the Americans? They owned the land first, after the Mexicans. What made the Americans clear out? How do the Portuguese make it go? Don't you see? We've got to ask {{millions}} of questions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To accept," [...] she answered. [...] "They won't {{influence}} you--the terriers, as {{you call}} them. You are too strong. It is you who will sway them. It isn't {{as if you were}} a mere agitator. Take this opportunity of showing them that you can build, plan, organize; that you were meant to be a ruler. You can't succeed without them, as things are. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> them over. Prove to them that they can trust you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We haven't won yet," [...] he replied, and {{was quiet}} for a few moments. Then his look got very {{resolute}} and he went on: [...] "All the same, if the thing is anyhow possible, I'm going to win. You see, I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win!</b> When Cartwright engaged me I was engineer on board a cattle boat; a man of no importance, without friends or money, and with no particular chance of making good. Now I've got my chance. If we put across the job a big salvage company turned down, I'll make my mark. Somebody will give me a good post; I'll have got my foot on the ladder that leads to the top." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Pooh! pooh!" [...] the jarl {{said one}} day in answer to such an observation. [...] "Sweyn is but a lad yet. I {{know what you are}} driving at, and that Sweyn is smitten with the charms of my old companion's {{daughter}}, the pretty Freda; I noted it when we were in camp together; but it will be fully another ten years yet before Sweyn can think of marrying. He has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> for himself the name of a great warrior before a jarl's daughter of proper spirit would so much as think of him. When he has the spoils of France to lay at her feet it will be time enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't that shame you, sir?" [...] asked Mary Louise brightly, as {{she turned}} to Silas Herring. [...] "You're a {{business}} man, and they say--although I confess I doubt it--that you're a loyal American. You can convince me of the fact by purchasing a liberal share of bonds. Then I can forget your dreadful words. Then I can carry to everyone the news that you've made a splendid investment in Liberty Bonds. Even if you honestly think {{the administration has been}} at fault, it won't do any good to grumble. We are in this war, sir, and we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> it, that you and every other American may enjoy prosperity and freedom. How much shall I say that you have subscribed, Mr. Herring?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The men gave three {{cheers and}} then went off to their {{quarters}} at the guns. They were quiet and grave, and it was easy enough {{to see that they}} did not like the prospect. An Englishman always goes into action, as far as I have seen, with a light heart and a joke on his lips when he's fighting against Frenchmen or Spaniards or any other foe, but it's a different thing when it's a pirate he has to deal with. Every man knows then that it's a case of life or death, and that he's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> or die. The enemy made no secret of what they were, for when they got within a mile of us two black flags ran up to their mastheads.|$|E
50|$|In 2007 Miyamoto {{would begin}} teaming with Takashi Sasaki {{as the two}} would remain as a team, off and on, {{throughout}} the years to come, they even <b>got</b> close <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> the Dai Nihon Saikyo Tag League and becoming the new BJW Tag Team Champions.|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm {{just really}} proud of {{everybody}} on our...team for not giving up and doing {{all the things they}} had to do to get the car back on the track," [...] Harvick said after a disappointing 42nd-place finish.

25|$|Marcus Davis lost a very one sided {{unanimous}} {{decision to}} Mike Swick at UFC 85, ending his six fight undefeated streak in the octagon and eleven fight winning streak in MMA.

6000|$|... "Fellows, it's this way. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> today's game. It's {{the last}} of the season and means the pennant for Worcester. One more hard scrap and we're done! Of all the up-hill fights any bunch ever made to land the flag, our has been the best. You're the best team I ever managed, the gamest gang of ball players that ever stepped in spikes. We've played in the hardest kind of luck all season, except that short trip we called the Rube's Honeymoon. We got a bad start, and sore arms and busted fingers, all kinds of injuries, every {{accident}} calculated to hurt a team's chances, came our way. But in spite of it all we got the lead and we've held it, and today we're still a few points ahead of Buffalo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Parent, {{this is a}} {{swearing}} letter. I must let go to somebody. And somehow none of {{the other}} chaps are convenient. I don't know if I ought to be put against a wall and shot for it, but I hereby declare that all the officers of this battalion over and above the rank of captain are a constellation of incapables--and several of the captains are herewith included. Some of them are men of a pleasant disposition and carefully aborted mental powers, and some are men of an unpleasant disposition and no mental powers at all. And I believe--a little enlightened by your recent letter to The Times--that they are a fair sample of the entire 'army' class which has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> this war. Usually they are indolent, but when they are thoroughly roused they are fussy. The time they should spend in enlarging their minds and increasing their military efficiency they devote to keeping fit. They are, roughly speaking, fit--for nothing. They cannot move us thirty miles without getting half of us left about, without losing touch with food and shelter, and starving us for thirty-six hours or so in the process, and they cannot count beyond the fingers of one hand, not having learnt to use the nose for arithmetical operations.... I conclude this war {{is going to be a}} sort of Battle of Inkerman on a large scale. We chaps in the ranks will have to do the job. Leading is 'off.'...|$|E
50|$|Just so, said Bayinnaung, Comrades, we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> now.|$|E
50|$|In {{his first}} fight back {{following}} the back-to-back losses <b>to</b> Thompson, Price <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> ways with a first-round knockout victory over Istvan Ruzsinszky in Stuttgart, Germany on 25 January 2014. Price displayed his trademark power flooring Ruzsinszky, {{who was a}} late replacement for Konstantin Airich, with a big right hand.|$|R
50|$|United <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> {{ways with}} a {{comfortable}} 2-0 away win at West Ham. Wayne Rooney opened the scoring with a half-volley from {{just inside the}} West Ham half, reminiscent of David Beckham's goal against Wimbledon in 1996. The England striker then added his second after Mark Noble failed to clear Ashley Young's cross.|$|R
50|$|Watkins fought six general {{elections}} as a Liberal between 1959 and 1974. He contested Bridgwater in Somerset in 1959, 1964, and 1966. Then he switched {{his attention to}} North Dorset which had been Frank Byers’ old seat from 1945 - 1950. He kept the Liberals in second place on each occasion but never really <b>got</b> close <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> the seat.|$|R

50|$|In the 1992 AFL season, Stevens made four senior appearances. Sydney {{lost all}} four of those games {{as well as the}} only other game he played in 1993, meaning he never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{celebrate}} a <b>win</b> while with the Swans.|$|R
50|$|United {{played well}} to {{come away from}} the Emirates with a 0-0 draw, denying Arsenal {{for the second time}} this season. Van Persie had two great chances to score but was denied by Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczęsny. United <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> ways with a {{comfortable}} victory at Crystal Palace. Van Persie converted a penalty after Patrice Evra was fouled, before Wayne Rooney expertly volleyed in <b>to</b> seal the <b>win.</b>|$|R
