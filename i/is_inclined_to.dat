5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position <b>is</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but <b>is</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> it by an angle of about 23.4°, {{which is known}} as the obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north {{is known as the}} vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{the work}} was {{ascribed}} to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text. The historian Antonia Gransden <b>is</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> believe that the work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and prior of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194. Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist and a recent translator of the Liber, suggests {{that it may have}} been written by someone other than the traditional candidates. Whoever the author, the Liber specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.|$|E

25|$|The attempt {{has been}} made to explain the Biblical Nazarites as {{forerunners}} of monastic orders addicted to the practice of ascetic discipline. Pentateuchal legislation concerning them shows them to have been merely tolerated. Modern criticism explains their peculiarities as arising from motives other than those that determine the conduct of ascetics. The Biblical Nazirs, forerunners of the Nebi'im (Prophets), were Protestants against the adoption of the customs and the religious rites of the Canaanites. In their dress and mode of life they emphasized their loyalty to YHVH, enthroned on the desert mountain. Wine and the crown of hair were sacred to the gods of the land. Their very appearance emphasized their rejection of the new deities. And in later days the number of those that took the Nazarite vow was exceedingly small. One <b>is</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> the opinion that no case occurred in which the Pentateuchal provisions became effective.|$|E
25|$|Jason Grace: A demigod son of Jupiter. Jason suffers amnesia at the {{beginning}} of the book and <b>is</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> call the gods by their Roman names. He owns a coin that turns into a sword or a lance depending upon heads or tails, although it is destroyed during their quest. He is 15 years old and Thalia Grace's younger brother, although Thalia was born under the Greek aspect of Zeus while Jason was born under the Roman aspect, Jupiter. Jason was offered to Hera as a champion at the age of two, which later provoked Thalia to run away from home. Before the start of the book, he lived in Camp Jupiter, the Roman counterpart to Camp Half-Blood. He harbors feelings for Piper McLean, but at the end of the book it is hinted that he was romantically involved with a girl named Reyna before.|$|E

25|$|The mean {{inclination}} of {{the lunar}} orbit to the ecliptic plane is 5.145°. The rotational axis of the Moon is also not perpendicular to its orbital plane, so the lunar equator {{is not in the}} plane of its orbit, but <b>is</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> it by a constant value of 6.688° (this is the obliquity). This does not mean that, {{as a result of the}} precession of the Moon's orbital plane, the angle between the lunar equator and the ecliptic would vary between the sum (11.833°) and difference (1.543°) of these two angles, but, as was discovered by Jacques Cassini in 1722, the rotational axis of the Moon precesses with the same rate as its orbital plane, but is 180° out of phase (see Cassini's Laws). Therefore, the angle between the ecliptic and the lunar equator is always 1.543°, even though the rotational axis of the Moon is not fixed with respect to the stars.|$|E

Desdemona considers Pontians to be adulterated Greeks because Pontians inhabited Turkey, where some became Muslims and did not follow the Greek Orthodox religion.|$|E

500|$|Chronicle {{sources for}} the life of Æthelstan are limited, and the first biography, by Sarah Foot, was only {{published}} in 2011. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Æthelstan's reign is principally devoted to military events, and it is largely silent apart from recording his most important victories. An important source is the twelfth-century chronicle of William of Malmesbury, but historians are cautious about accepting his testimony, much of which cannot be verified from other sources. David Dumville {{goes so far as to}} dismiss William's account entirely, regarding him as a [...] "treacherous witness" [...] whose account is unfortunately influential. However, Sarah Foot <b>is</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> accept Michael Wood's argument that William's chronicle draws on a lost life of Æthelstan. She cautions, however, that we have no means of discovering how far William [...] "improved" [...] on the original.|$|E
500|$|The {{equipment}} of the Libyan line infantry {{has been}} much debated. Head has argued in favor of short stabbing spears. Polybius states that the Libyans fought with equipment taken from previously defeated Romans. It is unclear whether he meant only shields and armor or offensive weapons as well, though a general reading suggests he meant the whole panoply of arms and armor, and even tactical organization. Apart from {{his description of the}} battle itself, when later discussing the subject of the Roman legion versus the Greek phalanx, Polybius says that [...] " [...] [...] [...] against Hannibal, the defeats they suffered {{had nothing to do with}} weapons or formations" [...] because [...] "Hannibal himself [...] [...] [...] discarded the equipment with which he had started out [...] armed his troops with Roman weapons". Daly <b>is</b> <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> the view that Libyan infantry would have copied the Iberian use of the sword during their fighting there and so were armed similarly to the Romans.|$|E

[...] Morrell quotes various positions [...] during the voyage at southerly latitudes which later proved to be at least 100miles inside the then undiscovered Antarctic continental mainland. One possible explanation for this discrepancy, offered by the [...] writer W.J. Mills, is that since Morrell's account was written nine years after the voyage he may not have had access to the ship's log, and hence [...] "felt constrained to invent details that appeared plausible", in order to sustain his narrative.|$|E
