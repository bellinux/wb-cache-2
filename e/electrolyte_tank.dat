And the current load was applied by a DC electrical source which exports current constantly and can provide voltage up to 60 V. After that, the fabricated plate was ultrasonically cleaned and then immersed in 1.0 wt.% fluoroalkylsilane–ethanol solution for 2  h at room temperature (25  °C) to lower its surface energy.|$|E

Then, the samples were immersed in the electrolyte solution and connected to an open circuit, where Ta was the anode (connected to the positive pole), and to a platinum plate functioning as a cathode (connected to the negative pole). Samples were treated in a reactor, driven by an electric system consisting of the following components: AC power source with variable output voltage, a transformer, a rectifying circuit, a circuit breaker, an ammeter, and a voltmeter. An oscilloscope was used to verify the waveform after rectification [12]. The processing system is composed of the electrode support and the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>tank</b> [12]. During treatment, {{the temperature of the}} electrolytic solution was measured by a portable thermometer.|$|E
40|$|The {{vanadium}} {{redox flow}} battery, which was first suggested by Skyllas-Kazacos and co-workers in 1985, is an electrochemical storage system which allows energy {{to be stored}} in two solutions containing different redox couples. Unlike commercially available batteries, all vanadium redox flow batteries have unique configurations, determined {{by the size of}} the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>tanks.</b> This technology has been proven to be an economically attractive and low-maintenance solution, with significant benefits over the other types of batteries. Moreover, the soaring demand for large-scale energy storage has, in turn, increased demands for unlimited capacity, design flexibility, and good safety systems. This work reviews and discusses the progress on electrodes and their reaction mechanisms as key components of the vanadium redox flow battery over the past 30 years. In terms of future outlook, we also provide practical guidelines for the further development of self-sustaining electrodes for vanadium redox flow batteries as an attractive energy storage system...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{tightening}} environmental pressure {{together with}} the continued need for coatings able to meet challenging service environments have stimulated advances in coating technology. In the case of electrochemical techniques, the classical techniques of electrodeposition and anodising are being upgraded to meet the need for modern surface engineering coatings (including nanostructured films) on metals. A major challenge is to retain conventional processing, including aqueous solutions, simple power supplies and existing <b>electrolyte</b> <b>tanks</b> while using cost effective, ‘green’ electrolytes. One successful direction has been the emergence of electrolytes based on methanesulfonic acid, MSA which has good electrolytic conductivity and is capable of dissolving many metals as well as acting as a useful medium for dispersion of solids prior to electrophoretic coating. A range of application methods result, including electroplating, anodising and electrophoretic deposition from a stable, aqueous sol. A diverse range of coating materials is emerging, including metals, alloys, porous metal oxide films, conductive polymers and many composites. This review illustrates the usefulness and applications of MSA electrolytes using recent examples from the authors' laboratories and others. Developing coatings, including alternating multilayers of Sn and Cu, nanostructured metals, hierarchical pores, nanotubular metal oxides and graphene composites are briefly considered. This is a review with 94 references...|$|R
40|$|Results {{have shown}} that flow {{batteries}} may be a solution {{in the future as}} an effective and environmental friendly method to an energy storage system (ESS). The technology is reliable and has a high efficiency that comes with low energy losses and a long lifetime. The range of possible fields is suitable for cutting energy peaks in the power grid, by always have a ready and available energy storage that balances the production. By comparing the advantages of flow batteries with conventional batteries it is mainly the fact that they can conserve energy for a long time without being self-discharged thanks to that the storage capacity is in principle endless and limited {{by the size of the}} <b>electrolytes</b> <b>tanks</b> that makes them a great energy storage system. The batteries won’t take any damage or decrease in performance when charging or discharging it or if you exhausts it to 100 % and leave it discharged for a long time. The only disadvantages with flow batteries are that they are built upon an advanced design and are built of components made of expensive materials. The main objective of this thesis is to develop an experimental basis for assessing a small pilot module of a flow battery with respect to how different concentrations of salts, flow rates and different currents/voltages affect the performance of the battery. We start by performing the experiment with a polymeric ion exchange membrane and see what values and the advantages and disadvantages it entails...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{behavior}} of conjugated polymers as mechanical sensors is experimentally characterized and modeled. A trilayer conjugated polymer sensor is considered, where two polypyrrole (PPy) layers sandwich an amorphous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) layer, with the latter serving as an <b>electrolyte</b> <b>tank.</b> A theory for the sensing mechanism is proposed by postulating that, through its influence on the pore structure, mechanical deformation correlates directly to the concentration of ions at the PPy/PVDF interface. This provides a key boundary condition for the partial differential equation (PDE) governing the ion diffusion and migration dynamics. By ignoring the migration term in the PDE, an analytical model is obtained {{in the form of}} a transfer function that relates the open-circuit sensing voltage to the mechanical input. The model is validated in experiments using dynamic mechanical stimuli up to 50 Hz...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium (Al) -air cell holds a high {{volumetric}} capacity density of 8. 05 Ah cm- 3, {{benefit from the}} trivalence of Al ions. Additional benefits of Al-air cell are low price and environmental friendliness. Furthermore, the Al energy conversion process is characterized of 100 % recyclability in theory. Along with a large base of raw material reserve, Al attracts considerable attentions as a promising material to be integrated within the global energy system. However, despite the early successful applications in military services, several problems exist that prevent the Al-air cells from widely civilian use. The most serious issue is the parasitic corrosion of Al when contacts with electrolyte. To overcome this problem, super-pure Al alloyed with various traces of metal elements are used to increase the corrosion resistance. Nevertheless, high-purity Al alloys are costly and require high energy consumption during production process. An alternative approach is to add inexpensive inhibitors directly into the electrolyte. However, such additives would increase the internal ohmic resistance and hamper the cell performance. So far these methods have not provided satisfactory solutions for the problem within Al-air cells. For the operation of alkaline Al-air cell, there are still other minor problems. One {{of them is the}} formation of aluminium hydroxide in the electrolyte. This process decreases ionic conductivity of electrolyte. Another one is the carbonation process within the gas diffusion layer of cathode, blocking the porosity of gas diffusion. Both these would hinder the performance of cells. The present work optimizes the above problems by building an Al-air cell operation system, consisting of four components. A top <b>electrolyte</b> <b>tank</b> containing fresh electrolyte is located at a high level, so that it can drive the electrolyte flow by gravity force. A mechanical rechargeable Al-air cell is fabricated with low-cost materials including low grade Al, carbon paper, and PMMA plates. An electrolyte waste tank with elaborate channel is designed to separate the hydrogen generated from the corrosion, which would be collected by gas collection device. In the first section of the research work, we investigated the performance of the mechanical rechargeable Al-air cell with a constant flow rate of electrolyte, to ensure the repeatability experiments. Then the whole system was assembled together and the feasibility of operating was demonstrated. During experiment, pure hydrogen is collected by collection device, which holds potential for various applications. By collecting this by-product, high utilization efficiency of aluminum is achieved. Considering both electricity and hydrogen generated, an overall utilization efficiency of around 90 % or even higher under different working voltages are achieved. Fluidic electrolyte could remove aluminum hydroxide precipitate and solve the electrolyte deterioration problem. This operation system provides a low-cost strategy for harvesting energy from the abundant secondary Al. The system could also be applied into other metal-air cells and is suitable for emergency power supply, power plant and other applications. The low cost feature implies great potential for commercialization. Further optimization, such as scaling up and optimization of fabrication, will help to refine the technology into practical market offerings...|$|E

40|$|All {{vanadium}} {{redox flow}} battery (VRB) utilizes two separated <b>electrolyte</b> <b>tanks</b> containing V 2 +/V 3 + and V 4 +/V 5 + sulfuric acid solutions to store and release electricity (1, 2). The advantages of VRB systems include {{high energy efficiency}} (> 75 %), deep discharge ability, fast response, low self discharge, long life-time (> 10 yr), and most important, independent power and storage capacity. So far, several relatively large energy storage systems using VBR technology (up to 6 MWh) have been successfully demonstrated (3). One major disadvantage of VRB systems is the instability of the electrolyte solutions with relative high vanadium concentration (> 2 M) at low temperatures ( 40 oC for V 5 + solution). The stability of V 5 + solution at elevated temperatures was studied in this work, aiming at developing high concentration, stable V 5 + electrolytes for VFB systems with improved energy density. In the sulfuric acid solution, V 5 + exists {{in the form of}} VO 2 (H 2 O) 4 +. At elevated temperatures, VO 2 (H 2 O) 4 + cations lose H 2 O and H+, and forms V 2 O 5 -xH 2 O precipitation through inter-cations condensation (Reaction 1). This process was systematically studied using Quantum Chemistry calculations (Amsterdam Density Functional program) combined with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. A detailed reaction mechanism and the structure of two intermediate species were proposed. According to NMR study, once these intermediate species are formed at elevated temperatures, they can not change back to VO 2 (H 2 O) 4 + after the solution temperature is lowered, and precipitation of V 2 O 5 is inevitable. It is known that solubility of V 2 O 5 in sulfuric aid solution in low, indicating Reaction 1 in V 5 + electrolyte solution is almost in-reversible...|$|R

The polymer microactuators considered in this study, which were fabricated using a laser ablation technique, could operate both in aqueous and non-aqueous media.

The stiffness measurement method followed in this study is a static deflection measurement method, using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The stiffness constants of the microactuators while they were in passive (no electrochemical activation) and active (electrochemically activated) states were measured separately, and their statistical comparison was provided. The possible error sources for the stiffness measurement method are elaborated...|$|R
40|$|The {{leaching}} behaviour of nickel-copper matte in an acidic-copper sulphate solution during the repulping stage at Impala Platinum Refineries has been studied. The base metal recovery process {{consists of a}} matte repulping stage prior {{to a series of}} pressure leach stages. Therefore, the repulping stage is basically an atmospheric leach stage in which the matte containing mostly Ni and Cu is leached in copper-spent <b>electrolyte</b> from the <b>tank</b> house, resulting in dissolution of nickel and precipitation of almost all the copper.

Mathematical modeling is {{used to analyze the}} designs and predict the battery performance of the several designs being developed. A mathematical model for the flow-through porous electrode design of the flow cell was developed to analyze the flow cell design, identify design parameters and determine the interaction of the underlying physical phenomena. The flow cell model, based on material and charge balances, predicted the flow cell performance in terms of its energy efficiency, cell current and voltage. The model showed the concentration and potential distributions within the flow cell which were then used to identify the rate-limiting phenomena and evaluate the performance of individual components in the flow cell. ^ In flow cell model was extended to analyze the entire zinc bromine battery system by taking into account the flow cell, the <b>electrolyte</b> storage <b>tanks</b> and the polybromide 2 ̆ 2 red oil phase 2 ̆ 2.

40|$|International audienceZinc {{is used in}} the oil {{industry}} as a sacrificial anode for protecting steel storage tanks from corrosion. The behaviour of a sample of zinc from the Algerian metallurgy industry (zinc A) and a commercially available zinc (zinc B) was compared in an <b>electrolyte</b> from storage <b>tank</b> drainage water. The corrosion potential measurements for zinc A confirmed that this material {{could be used as a}} sacrificial anode. The polarization curves of the two materials (zinc A and zinc B) were different, zinc A being the least polarized. Thus, the same corrosion protection could be obtained with a lower surface ratio (S Zn / S Fe) for Zinc A. Cyclic voltammetry curves provided evidence of a surface layer formed by dissolution products. To provide protection over extended periods of time, the zinc anode must be oversized. The two types of zinc tested were comparable. The results of the impedance spectroscopy study confirmed the previous results. The corrosion layer formed on zinc A was not prejudicial to dissolution. Hence, the properties of this zinc were found to be satisfactory for its use as a sacrificial anode...|$|R

Gascoyne Highly-alkaline waste solutions have leaked from underground tanks at the US DOE Hanford Site, Washington, caus-ing mineral dissolution and re-precipitation upon {{contact with}} subsurface sediments. The main mineral precipitation and transformation pathways were studied in solutions mimicking tank leak {{conditions at the}} US DOE Hanford Site. In batch experiments, Si-rich solutions, representing dissolved silicate minerals, were mixed with caustic tank simulants. The tank wastes encompass a large range of chemical compositions. The effect of the following factors on mineral transformations were investigated: temperature (22, 50 and 80 !C), concentration of NaOH (from 0 to 16 M), 6 types of common inorganic anions in the tank supernatant, concentration of NaNO 3 (the most abundant <b>electrolyte</b> in the <b>tanks),</b> and the Si/Al ratio in the starting solutions.

40|$|The {{phenomena}} of vapor space corrosion and liquid/air interface corrosion of carbon steel in simulated liquid waste environments have been investigated. Initial experiments have explored {{the hypothesis that}} vapor space corrosion may be accelerated by {{the formation of a}} corrosive <b>electrolyte</b> on the <b>tank</b> wall by a process of evaporation of relatively warmer waste and condensation of the vapor on the relatively cooler tank wall. Results from initial testing do not support the hypothesis of electrolyte transport by evaporation and condensation. The analysis of the condensate collected by a steel specimen suspended over a 40 C simulated waste solution showed no measurable concentrations of the constituents of the simulated solution and a decrease in pH from 14 in the simulant to 5. 3 in the condensate. Liquid/air interface corrosion was studied as a galvanic corrosion system, where steel at the interface undergoes accelerated corrosion while steel in contact with bulk waste is protected. The zero-resistance-ammeter technique was used to measure the current flow between steel specimens immersed in solutions simulating (1) the high-pH bulk liquid waste and (2) the expected low-pH meniscus liquid at the liquid/air interface. Open-circuit potential measurements of the steel specimens were not significantly different in the two solutions, with the result that (1) no consistent galvanic current flow occurred and (2) both the meniscus specimen and bulk specimen were subject to pitting corrosion...|$|R
