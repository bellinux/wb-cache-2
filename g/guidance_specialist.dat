Some returned within weeks or months to their prior boarding schools or public schools, and some stayed for years. After 6 years of operation, with a 60% success rate, Intolubbe retired in 1968 when it was suggested that the Demonstration School be combined with the Boarding School.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{addition}} {{to the role of}} nanny is that of the maternity nanny or night nanny. In the US these specialty maternity nannies are also known as Newborn Care Specialists (NCS, disassociating this specialty for medically qualified nursing). The night nanny usually works with a family anywhere from one night to seven nights per week. A night nanny generally works with children from newborn to five years of age. A night nanny can provide a teaching role, helping parents to establish good sleeping patterns or trouble shooting the sleeping patterns of a child. Roles and qualifications vary between countries. The Night Nanny works together with the family's requirements and philosophies. Certified Newborn Care Specialists or maternity nannies are highly educated and referenced specialists who work with infants. Maternity nanny Sleep specialists or consultants typically work with older babies and children. They are highly experienced in all aspects of newborns not to include medical issues. They might work 24 hours a day, seven days per week, but most work 5 nights/days a week for {{the first three months of}} a newborn's life. The role can also consist of assisting parents with feeding guidance, nursery set up, premature infant, multiples, colic, reflux, and sleep guidance/training. The qualifications of a night nanny are usually in mothercraft nursing (see: Nursing in Australia), maternity nanny, sleep <b>guidance</b> <b>specialist,</b> or early childhood development. Pay rates vary from country to country but are usually well paid in comparison to the general nanny, as the night nanny or NCS is seen as a specialist or expert in their field. There are various non-accredited training organisations who make claim to provide legitimate certifications, however in an unregulated field parents should ensure that the qualifications of their maternity nanny are legitimate and accredited. The Newborn Care Specialist Association (NCSA) (http://www.ncsainfo.com) is one of many self-appointed certification entity's for Newborn Care Specialists in America.|$|E

So that you will understand the philosophy, principles and objectives upon which this role model is based, let me indicate them briefly to you: PRILOSOPMY OF EDUCATION: An updated philosophy views education as being more than just the traditional three "R's". Education is seen as including all of life's growth processes including the social and ',atonal aspects of an individual's development (Bruner, 1961; Gardner, 1962) : To assist in the growth processes of the individual, schools have seen the need to include pupil personnel services specialists, otherwise referred to as non instructional personnel (Dugald Arbuckle, 1967) to complement the efforts of teachers.

40|$|What are {{you going}} to do after {{graduation}} is a question that the writer has asked doctoral students working in counseling and guidance. A common answer voices the desire to do something in teacher training. It seemed obvious that many in the field of Counseling and Guidance felt that their basic orientation of working with people had significant worth for teachers working with children. With the training in Counseling and Guidance the writer had received while still a teacher, he decided that a project utilizing a guidance-centered orientation of working with children would be not only worthwhile to the children involved but would be valuable learning for the experimenter. It would give an avenue of experience and a fund of resources from which to draw in the future when working with teachers and children as a <b>Guidance</b> <b>Specialist.</b> It was the experimenter's goal to provide an environment where new attitudes, values, and feelings toward the self and others could be experienced. It was believed that new ways of perceiving and behaving could be learned as the result of developmental kinds of Interpersonal experiences. To give structure and method to such goals, the experimenter drew heavily upon sociometrics: sociograms, Ohio Social Acceptance Scale, Bogardus Social Distance Scale, inventories, check sheets, open-ended sentences, and autobiographies. These were sources of information that helped him see what was not obvious. Sociometric seating, meetings with groups and individuals in conference and counseling relationships were included. Classroom atmosphere, activities, and discussions were channeled to meet and deal with problems and needs as they were perceived. Helping children to like themselves and deal effectively with others is a goal too often set aside for spelling or "new" math. It was hoped that this project could help some toward achieving this goal. Two specific goals emerged as the experimenter formulated this project. These goals were: that the teacher's influence and classroom atmosphere would help the children to gain a better opinion of themselves [...] hence better feelings about the self or improved self-acceptance, and that the teacher's influence and classroom atmosphere would help the children to become more accepting of each other [...] hence better group-acceptance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to plan and {{implement}} a career guidance program far grade eight students, {{in conjunction with a}} District Vocational School Pilot Project. This project was undertaken in response to the recognized need for Junior High Schools feeding students to pre-vocational courses. [...] The Seal cove vocational School Pilot Project, of which this career guidance project was a part, was undertaken to provide a more diversified curriculum, hopefully reducing the dropout rate in the three involved school districts. It is planned that students doing vocational courses will spend part of their time in the vocational school during grades nine to eleven, while the remainder will be spent in their present schools. The need for educational and vocational guidance to help students coordinate their academic programs, then, was apparent, and led to the initiation of a career guidance program having the following goals: [...] 1. To design an overall guidance plan for use by all involved school districts and the Harbour Main Vocational School district in their implementation of the Seal Cove Vocational School Pilot Project. [...] 2. To plan and implement the vocational guidance program related to the Seal Cove Vocational School Pilot Project in the Conception Bay Center school district. Of the second, the major sub-goals to be achieved were: [...] A. The development of self-understanding by grade eight students, as relevant to the decision to be made concerning pre-vocational courses. [...] B. The provision of career and educational information, again relevant to decisions to be made concerning pre-vocational courses. [...] C. The fostering of decision-making skills by students, leading to decisions about grade nine courses. These decisions were to be made by the students no later than 15 April 1972. [...] There were no resources on hand {{at the beginning of the}} project which cost $ 1, 973. 00 to implement. $ 1, 383. 00 of this amount were non-recurring expenditures. One hundred and thirty-five students in five classrooms were served by a part-time <b>guidance</b> <b>specialist</b> and the district supervisor of guidance. [...] The program used orientation activities for students and teachers, some communication with parents, and a variety of guidance activities including large group guidance classes and small group discussions. One field trip was organized and a student project was based upon this. A resource center was set up to make occupational and educational information available to students. Finally, a fairly extensive program of testing with some interpretation activity was implemented. [...] Several problems became apparent as the project was implemented. The problems generally were organizational or administrative in nature. [...] Several problems became apparent as the project was implemented. The problems generally were organizational or administrative in nature. [...] The first project goal was achieved. The career guidance plan which was developed was adopted by the Vocational School planning committee and implemented in all the districts. [...] The second project goal was achieved only marginally, primarily because of the organizational and administrative problems which were encountered. It was found that students did learn a considerable amount abut their vocational and educational opportunities, but their achievement in self-understanding and in decision-making was not as much as was hoped for at the beginning of the project. [...] As a result of the experience of the project a number of recommendations were made for the improvement of career guidance programs when they are implemented in other areas. The major recommendations involved insuring understanding of the program goals at all levels of operation, the implementation of procedures for early recognition of students with special problems, and a thorough study of testing programs...|$|E

Assessing streams of patients and introducing a method of accelerated referral of patients back to the general practitioner (GP) under <b>specialist</b> <b>guidance</b> could help to alleviate these problems. METHODS: Seventeen GPs collaborated with rheumatologists during a 2 -year period in a 'joint consultation' model in which GPs and rheumatologists discussed patients together. All patient charts belonging to patients who had been referred to the outpatient clinic by these 17 GPs were identified. Rheumatologists assessed {{whether or not these}} patients could be referred back to the participating GPs under the <b>guidance</b> of the <b>specialist</b> in the joint consultation model. RESULTS: Of 276 eligible patients, 121 were discharged from the outpatient clinic.

As far as {{the origin of this}} term is concerned, it is told that earlier Merchants used to attend to extending of loans and arranging finance for trade but as the time passed the subject of banking assumed more importance and the Merchants switched over to banking activities,hence the term Merchant Banking. Rapid industrialization in India has led to the setting up of new industrial units and Expansion,Diversification, and Modernization of existing units.

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} {{available}} evidence on safety, competency and cost-effectiveness of nursing staff providing gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy services. METHODS: The literature was searched for publications reporting nurse endoscopy using several databases and specific search terms. Studies were screened against eligibility criteria and for relevance. Initial searches yielded 74 eligible and relevant articles; 26 of these studies were primary research articles using original datasets relating {{to the ability of}} non-physician endoscopists. These publications included a total of 28883 procedures performed by non-physician endoscopists. RESULTS: The number of publications in the field of non-specialist gastrointestinal endoscopy reached a peak between 1999 and 2001 and has decreased thereafter. 17 / 26 studies related to flexible sigmoidoscopies, 5 to upper GI endoscopy and 6 to colonoscopy. All studies were from metropolitan centres with nurses working under strict supervision and <b>guidance</b> by <b>specialist</b> gastroenterologists. Geographic distribution of publications showed the majority of research was conducted in the United States (43 %), the United Kingdom (39 %) and the Netherlands (7 %). Most studies conclude that after appropriate training nurse endoscopists safely perform procedures. However, in relation to endoscopic competency, safety or patient satisfaction, all studies had major methodological limitations. Patients were often not randomized (21 / 26 studies) and not appropriately controlled. In relation to cost-efficiency, nurse endoscopists were less cost-effective per procedure at year 1 when compared to services provided by physicians, due largely to the increased need for subsequent endoscopies, specialist follow-up and primary care consultations. CONCLUSION: Contrary to general beliefs, endoscopic services provided by nurse endoscopists are not more cost effective compared to standard service models and evidence suggests the opposite.

Dr. Marcia Chatelain, graduate from University of Missouri-Columbia and assistant professor of history at Georgetown University, created the hashtag #fergusonsyllabus so that educators could have a platform to discuss the national crisis in Ferguson, Missouri. http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/mc899/ Chatelain describes it as, “What emerged was a small call for community across the sometimes impersonal and expansive digital world.”http://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/teaching-ferguson-syllabus Chatelain contacted her colleagues in and across her discipline to use Twitter as a mechanism to recommend texts, collaborate on conversation starters, and inspire dialogue about some aspect of the Ferguson events.

To have someone to go to for advice and support is an important part of the guidance. While there is ambiguity about what the meaning of mentoring is believed to be and who it is for. Special educator's role as mentors in schools varies widely and there is no doubt that the special educator serves many functions and is there for those children who are in need of extra support.
