5|$|Working from Winthrop Jordan's Black on White (1968), Brodie {{also used}} Dumas Malone's {{documentation}} of Jefferson's activities to correlate his stays at Monticello with the conception period {{of each of}} Sally Hemings' children, whose births he recorded in the Farm Book. She discovered that Hemings never conceived when Jefferson was not at Monticello, during years when he was often away <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E
5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical icons of the Everglades, other ecosystems {{are just as}} vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. The Big Cypress Swamp {{is well known for}} its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E

25|$|Arapiles {{is still}} a popular {{climbing}} destination, with some visitors staying <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.

25|$|When Binoche's parents {{divorced}} in 1968, four-year-old Binoche {{and her sister}} Marion were sent to a provincial boarding school.

Binoche has stated that this perceived parental abandonment {{had a profound effect}} on her.|$|E
25|$|In January 1993 AvtoVaz was re-established as a joint-stock company under Russian law.

25|$|Norris has {{described}} his childhood as downbeat. He was nonathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre. His father, Ray, worked intermittently as an automobile mechanic, {{and went on}} alcohol drinking binges that lasted <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. Embarrassed by his father's behavior and the family's financial plight, Norris developed a debilitating introversion that lasted for his entire childhood.|$|E
25|$|Early {{management}} practices for paralyzed muscles {{emphasized the need}} to rest the affected muscles and suggested that the application of splints would prevent tightening of muscle, tendons, ligaments, or skin that would prevent normal movement. Many paralyzed polio patients lay in plaster body casts <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. This prolonged casting often resulted in atrophy of both affected and unaffected muscles.|$|E

In this way, despite his deafness, Brewster managed the business of arranging poses along with negotiating prices and artistic ideas with his sitters. As an itinerant portraitist working in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the United States, he would travel great distances, often staying in unfamiliar places <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{a barrier}} or other backup method is {{required}} on fertile days; otherwise the couple must abstain. To reduce pregnancy risk to below 1% per year, {{there are an}} average of 13 days where abstinence or backup must be used during each cycle. For women with very irregular cycles—such as those common during breastfeeding, perimenopause, or with hormonal diseases such as PCOS—abstinence {{or the use of}} barriers may be required <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E
25|$|A {{native of}} Fredericksburg, Virginia, Decker {{attended}} George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax after graduating high school.

The two married in 2009; their son was born six months later. Decker was often deployed to Afghanistan with his unit <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.

25|$|Red dwarfs are {{far more}} {{variable}} and violent than their more stable, larger cousins. Often they are covered in starspots that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, while at other times they emit gigantic flares that can double their brightness {{in a matter of}} minutes. Such variation would be very damaging for life, as it would not only destroy any complex organic molecules that could possibly form biological precursors, but also because it would blow off sizeable portions of the planet's atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|A {{collection}} of mature technologies called seasonal {{thermal energy storage}} (STES) is capable of storing heat <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time, so solar heat collected primarily in Summer {{can be used for}} all-year heating. Solar-supplied STES technology has been advanced primarily in Denmark, Germany, and Canada, and applications include individual buildings and district heating networks. Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta, Canada has a small district system and in 2012 achieved a world record of providing 97% of the community's all-year space heating needs from the sun. STES thermal storage mediums include deep aquifers; native rock surrounding clusters of small-diameter, heat exchanger equipped boreholes; large, shallow, lined pits that are filled with gravel and top-insulated; and large, insulated and buried surface water tanks.|$|E
25|$|Life for Carson as a {{mountain}} {{man was not}} easy. After collecting beavers from traps, he had to hold onto them <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time until the annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, held in remote areas of the West like {{the banks of the}} Green River in Wyoming. With the money received for the pelts, necessities of an independent life including fish hooks, flour and tobacco were procured. As there was little to no medical access in the varied regions he worked in, Carson had to dress his wounds and nurse himself. Conflict with particular Indians sometimes occurred. Carson's primary clothing at the time was in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time. This suit offered some protection against particular weapons employed by Indians.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Cost Plus World Market {{launched}} an online crowdsourcing-model marketplace called Craft by World Market.
