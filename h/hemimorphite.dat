2500|$|Paddys River Mine or Cowley copper mine {{is located}} 700m {{upstream}} on Paddys River. [...] The host rock is a skarn where Shannons Flat Adamellite baked limestone from the Paddy's River Volcanics. [...] The {{bulk of the}} mineral here is magnetite, but other sulfide and minerals of copper, lead zinc and silver attracted miners. [...] Thomas Coyle operated the mine in 1895, producing 2.6 tons of copper and 26.1kg of silver. In 1907 the Cowley Copper Syndicate Ltd started more work cutting two more adits and winzes. However it was abandoned by 1909 as the ore was too low grade. [...] More than a million tons of magnetite remain. [...] Many minerals such as aurichalcite, bronchanite, caledonite, cerussite, <b>hemimorphite,</b> hydrozincite, linarite, native silver, rozenite, and zincsilite have been found at the location.|$|E
