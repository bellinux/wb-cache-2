40|$|Tubular {{products}} have very important applications in various areas {{especially in the}} transportation industries. For instance, {{in the structure of}} cars there are various tubular products like roof headers, <b>engine</b> <b>cradles,</b> roof rails and frame rails with complex geometries which most of them need multiple steps like tube drawing, tube bending and hydroforming for their production. Based on the recent studies by this group, it was proven that in most of the structural tubular parts in the cars it was not necessary to have constant thickness along the axial direction of tube and it will be considered as overdesign and the overall weight of structures can be reduced considerably by using variable thickness tubes. In this paper, the variable thickness tube drawing and its applications in the tube bending and hydroforming applications were studied. The results showed that this process can have important role in reduction of defective parts in the production of complex tubes by the tube hydroforming method. However especial considerations should be taken into account in the design of thickness distribution along axial direction of these kinds of tubes to avoid problems in the drawing step and as well in the bending and hydroforming steps. 9 (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

In this work, as a comparative welding process, Laser Beam Welding (LBW) {{was used as an}} alternative to the traditional TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding. For the mechanical characterization of laser and TIG welds, tensile and hardness tests were performed. Microstructural characterization through optical microscopy was realized as well, in the fusion zone (FZ) and heat-affected zone (HAZ). Martensite was found in the fusion zone for both processes. However the average grain sizes were different due to different heating and cooling rates. In the present study, the weld was autogenous and a post weld heat treatment was conducted to evaluate its influence on mechanical properties. This treatment proved to improve the ductility of the steel and reducing the embrittlement in the welded region. It was observed that the thicknesses of the FZ and HAZ in the TIG welds were ten times larger than in the laser. The hardness values observed in FZ and HAZ were similar in both cases. Tensile strength after heat treatment remained at levels similar to the base material. After the heat treatment, there was a recover in the material ductility, particularly after the laser welding, demonstrating the usefulness of the process...|$|R
40|$|The tube {{hydroforming}} {{process is}} a relatively complex manufacturing process; the performance of this process depends on various factors and requires proper combination of part design, material selection and boundary conditions, In manufacturing of automotive parts, such as <b>engine</b> <b>cradles,</b> frames rails, sub-frames, cross members, and other parts from circular tubes, pre-bending and per-forming operations are often required prior to the subsequent tubular hydroforming process to fit the tubular blank in the complex die shape. Due to these pre-hydroforming operations, some of the strains are already developed {{before going to the}} actual hydroforming process. Such developed strains before hydroforming process in the part is called as prestrain. In this paper the study of effect of prestrain on formability and forming limit strains during tube hydroforming is done by simulation by taking the material prestrain value. The forming limit strains of pre-strained tube during hydroforming are predicted. A series of tube bulge tests for tube hydroforming are simulated by a commercial finite element solver to predict the limit strains. Numerical simulation of forming limit strains in tube hydroforming with different internal pressure and different simulation set up with or without axial feeding are considered to develop wide range of strain paths in the present work. The effects of process conditions on the forming limit strains are detailed. In this paper the forming limit strains during tube hydroforming are simulated for pre-strain and compared with zero prestrain.

His first job was as an {{engineering}} apprentice with the Austin Motor Company at their factory in at Longbridge, near Birmingham before setting up his own garage business in London. It was there that he built his first powered wheelchair for his disabled cousin Derry Preston-Cobb, using an engine from a lawnmower. He developed it into a commercially viable vehicle and founded the Invacar Ltd in 1946 and won a major contract with the Ministry of Pensions for national supply of transport for the physically disabled throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Encouraged by this success, Greeves decided to diversify into motorcycle manufacture and set up Greeves motor cycles in 1953. A keen trials rider in his spare time, he had started collecting veteran and vintage motorcycles, including a 1912 Triumph with the registration 'OLD 1'. Preston-Cobb also encouraged him to start the motorcycle business. Working together they developed a prototype using a 2-stroke 197cc single-cylinder engine sourced from Villiers Engineering - and a Greeves badge on the fuel tank. The motorcycles were really a sideline for the main business of producing the three-wheeled invalid cars, so development of the prototypes had to be fitted in when the production schedule allowed.

Bert had been an enthusiastic motorcyclist in his youth and always had an ambition to become a motorcycle manufacturer. The first Greeves motorcycle was developed in mid-1951, using rubber-in-torsion springing at both front and rear. This unconventional rubber springing came straight from the patented system used for the invalid car. Rear wheel suspension was by a pivoted fork with rods connecting to torsion rubber mounted units just below the seat. Friction dampers were also fitted which could be manually adjusted. [...] The front forks were also unusual, with short leading links to carry the wheel, pivoting on rubber-in-torsion spring units (later known as the 'Banana Leading Link' front fork.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the past}} decade, {{hydroformed}} structural components {{have been widely}} used in industrial areas in North American and Europe and there is a large potential market in Asia with the development of automotive industry. An extraordinary feature of tube hydroforming is that a hollow component with a three dimension axis and variable closed-sections can be integrally formed, so that the number of component parts is minimized, weight is reduced and stiffness of the part is increased. The section shapes in many automotive hollow components are complex and it is usually difficult or impossible to hydroform these typical sections directly from circular section tube, so that satisfactory preforms are necessary. In this paper, a method to reduce the friction and calibration pressure through a petal-like cross-section shape preform is presented and its mechanism is analyzed. Preforms for rectangular, trapezoidal and polygonal sections used in hollow components are investigated and satisfactory preforms are obtained. Taking an <b>engine</b> <b>cradle</b> as example, satisfactory preform section shapes have been designed, by which the thickness distribution was controlled and the flash generated from the die-parting surface in the final forming was avoided. So a carefully selected preform process can contribute significantly to the reduction of friction and calibration pressure and it is a dominant factor for successful hydroforming...|$|E
40|$|Reliability-based design {{optimization}} is an optimization technique {{based on the}} stochastic approach. Many studies using this approach assume the uncertainty in the design variable to be constant. However, when the uncertainty depends on {{the values of the}} design variable, this assumption results in the wrong conclusions. Therefore, the uncertainty should be considered as a variable in reliability-based {{design optimization}}. The uncertainty in the thickness during optimization, such as the tolerance, had been assumed to be a constant in automotive structures. However, in practice, the tolerance of the thickness depends on the nominal thickness. Hence, in this paper, reliability-based design optimization of an automotive structure such as an <b>engine</b> <b>cradle</b> and a body-in-white with a variable uncertainty is carried out. General Motors Korea provides the tolerance guide which defines the dependence between the nominal thickness and the tolerance. The information is adopted to define the variable uncertainty. Thus, the variable uncertainty can modify the uncertainty with respect to the design point, resulting in an accurate reliability estimation. Finally, reliability-based design optimization with a variable uncertainty is performed using the Akaike information criterion method which determines the fittest distribution of the performance based on the maximum likelihood estimation of the candidate distributions. Consequently, the automotive structures are optimized to reduce the mass while still satisfying the target reliabilities of the performances when considering a variable uncertainty.
