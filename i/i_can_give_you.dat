In the finals, Kentucky faced three-time defending tournament champion Alabama, which was without forward Andre Perry, who suffered a broken foot in the semifinals against Arkansas. Star sophomore Jamal Mashburn led all scorers with 28 points on 12-of-14 shooting, en route to an 8054 victory and tournament Most Valuable Player honors.

In response, Duterte threatened to leave the UN and form a separate organization with China and African nations. He announced in a news conference on August 19: [...] "You now, United Nations, if you can say one bad thing about me, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> 10 [...] I tell you, you are an inutil ("useless" [...] in Filipino street language.).

2500|$|Rihanna, {{with whom}} Eminem {{previously}} collaborated on [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] from Eminem's previous studio effort, Recovery (2010), was {{featured on the}} song [...] "The Monster". On September 11, 2013, she hinted at the collaboration on Twitter: [...] "Just left the studio... Recorded a #monster hook for {{one of my favorite}} artists! And that's all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>you...</b> #NavyShit". Upon the track list announcement, Staten Island singer Bebe Rexha revealed on Twitter that she had co-written the Rihanna collaboration featured on the album. Rexha recorded [...] "The Monster" [...] in November 2012 in Harlem's Stadium Red studio while working on her debut album.

Eminem added his own verses and tweaked the instrumental, while keeping Rexha's backing vocals. The song was revealed {{to be a part of}} the album with the reveal of the track listing. In an October 2013 interview, Rexha claimed that she said [...] "This is an Eminem record, y'all" [...] while standing in the booth after she recorded the chorus, and that she [...] "know when [...] heard it, it spoke to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Washington's estate, Mount Vernon, {{lay on the}} way [...] from Scotchtown to Philadelphia, {{he invited}} Henry to stop there and to ride to Philadelphia with him, and Henry did, also {{accompanied}} by Edmund Pendleton, another Virginia delegate to the Congress and something of a political rival of Henry's. Delegates and prominent Philadelphians took an intense interest in the Virginians, who had {{taken the lead in}} resistance to Britain, but whom few in the other colonies had met. This was Henry's first stay in the North, excepting a brief business trip to New York in 1770 but he found that his actions were well known. The sessions began on September 5, 1774, at Carpenter's Hall. Silas Deane of Connecticut described Henry as [...] "the compleatest speaker I ever heard... but in a Letter <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>You</b> no Idea of the Music of his Voice, or the highwrought, yet Natural elegance of his Stile, or Manner". The secretary of the Congress, Charles Thomson, wrote that when Henry rose, he had expected little from a man dressed as plainly as a rural minister. [...] "But as he proceeded, [...] evinced such [...] unusual force of argument, and such novel and impassioned eloquence as soon electrified the whole house. Then the excited inquiry passed from man to man... 'Who is it? Who is it?' The answer from the few who knew him was, it is Patrick Henry." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{features}} no printed lyrics, but {{it seems}} likely to connect with Isis's past legacy of concept albums, wherein some of the lyrics (such as [...] "She was his queen" [...] from [...] "Dulcinea") relate to past themes. Turner has confirmed {{the presence of a}} concept: [...] "I won't say what the concept is, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> some clues about what inspired it: Hassan-i-Sabbah, the Islamic mystic cult leader, [...] Don Quixote, [...] House of Leaves, and [...] Labyrinths." [...] However; from repeated explanation of what inspired Oceanic and Panopticon, his stance changed. [...] "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like I was losing my connection to the music and the lyrics simply from having repeated it so many times. And for me, personally, it's really important to maintain that connection as much as possible. I feel there's a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves. It's all spelled out. So it's interesting to leave some of that stuff open-ended so they have do to a little bit of legwork themselves." [...] Drummer Aaron Harris explains this further, saying that the album is based “on personal perception of anything [...] and what's true and what's not true.” ...|$|E
