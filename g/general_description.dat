5|$|In 1846, Palmer {{returned}} to his family in Indiana and in 1847 he published his diary as Palmer's Journal of Travels Over the Rocky Mountains, 1845–1846. This book provided equipment guidance and comprehensive route information for those crossing the Oregon Trail. The publication also had a <b>general</b> <b>description</b> of the Oregon Country, {{a detailed description of}} the Willamette Valley, and included a copy of the Organic Laws of Oregon adopted by settlers at the Champoeg Meetings.

40|$|AbstractThe central {{problem of}} the current {{collaborative}} research {{is the lack of}} <b>general</b> <b>descriptions</b> for collaborative enterprise networks (CEN). Due to the absence of these <b>general</b> <b>descriptions,</b> a consistent characterization or distinction of various forms of CEN has become difficult. Even the development of a unified theory is impossible. The goal of this paper is a definition-based description of a CEN model {{and the development of a}} morphology that allows a characterization of CEN...|$|R
5|$|Fluid models {{describe}} plasmas {{in terms}} of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters). One simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the plasma as a single fluid governed {{by a combination of}} Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. A more <b>general</b> <b>description</b> is the two-fluid plasma picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma {{in terms of}} a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects.|$|E
5|$|The Celtic Church is a {{term that}} has been used by {{scholars}} to describe a specific form of Christianity with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick. This form of Christianity later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a <b>general</b> <b>description</b> for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions and ideologies of primarily French origin began to take root in Scotland. The Celtic form of Christianity has been contrasted with that derived from missions from Rome, which reached southern England in 587 under the leadership of St. Augustine of Canterbury. Subsequent missions from Canterbury then helped convert the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, reaching Northumbria in the early eighth century, where Iona had already begun to have a presence. As a result, Christianity in Northumbria became a mix of Celtic and Roman influences.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} {{different}} missions {{and forms of}} conversion {{was a series of}} overlapping and informally organised churches.
