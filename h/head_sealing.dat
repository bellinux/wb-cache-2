50|$|In {{case the}} {{retracted}} {{length of the}} cylinder is too long for the cylinder {{to be built in}} the structure, Telescopic cylinder can be used. One has to realize that for simple pushing applications telescopic cylinders might be easily available; for higher forces and/or double acting cylinders, they must be designed especially and are very expensive. If hydraulic cylinders are only used for pushing and the piston rod is brought in again by other means, one can also use Plunger cylinders. Plunger cylinders have no sealing over the piston, if the piston even exists. This means that only one oil connection is necessary. In general the diameter of the plunger is rather large compared with a normal piston cylinder, whereas a hydraulic motor will always leak oil. A hydraulic cylinder does not have a leakage over the piston nor over the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>sealing</b> so that {{there is no need for}} a mechanical brake.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, the {{popularity}} of the stickers led to trouble for the series. The zeal for trying to obtain <b>Head</b> <b>Seals</b> would lead children to buy Bikkuriman in mass quantities, retrieve the stickers inside, and simply throw away the snack. This, along with the fact that children and collectors were willing to pay high amounts of money for the rarer cards, led to parent groups expressing concern of possible gambling undertones to the stickers. This led to action by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, and the number of <b>Head</b> <b>Seals</b> per pack was increased from the average 4 to 24 individual Seals.|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} failure {{mechanism}} of pneumatic cylinders {{is related to}} wear of <b>head</b> <b>seals.</b> It usually occurs due to excessive radial loads or vibrations (dynamic run-out) or as consequence of an incorrect mounting (rod to bore misalignment). Sealing behaviour has been the object of several analytical and numerical studies orientated to reproduce actual working conditions but perfect rod alignment has been often considered. A tri-dimensional quasi-static numerical model of rod radial misalignment {{and its effect on}} facing seal behaviour is herein presented as a first step of a study concerning mounting effects on <b>head</b> <b>seal</b> performances. In the specific, a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) rod lip seal has been considered. An analytical model was also developed considering the characteristics of the rubber-like material and stiffness variation of the lip seal versus deformation. A non-linear dependence of stiffness on deformation of rubber-like material was found. A cross validation between analytical and numerical models is provided...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assure the {{continued}} development of geothermal resources, many advances in materials technology are required so that high costs resulting from the severe environments encountered during drilling, well completion and energy extraction can be reduced.

High priority needs are for lost circulation control and lightweight well completion materials, and tools such as drill pipe protectors, rotating <b>head</b> <b>seals,</b> blow-out preventers, and downhole drill motors. The lack of suitable hydrolytically stable chemical systems that can bond previously developed elastomers to metal reinforcement is a critical but as yet unaddressed impediment {{to the development of}} these tools.
