40|$|A {{defining}} {{feature of}} the modern era of computer technologies has been a massive reliance upon the mass consumption of personal operating system software. Currently three products dominate how the world experiences computer operating system – Microsoft‘s Windows, Apple‘s Mac, and Linux. The near monopoly held by Windows has been a crucial enabler of the ICT revolution, while the small but significant markets held by Mac and Linux provide alternatives to Windows monoculture. Aside from their technical differences each offers distinct examples of modern-day branding, with individuals forming communities in which members signify their allegiance with these products. This thesis presents these individuals as User-Fans – those who develop an affinity with the mundane products of modern culture. Adapted from the fan models forwarded by Thorne and Bruner (2006), and Hunt, Bristol and Bashaw (1999), it is proposed that User-Fans are an acknowledgement of the extremes of devotion displayed by modern consumerism while also conveying an acceptance that consumerism {{is a form of}} discourse where strong allegiances can exist. Central to this thesis is the idea that brand communities exist as a consumer response to the emerging influence of the consumer society. Muñiz and O‘Guinn‘s (2001) brand community theory provides an apt description of the behaviour and bonds exhibited by the consumers central to this study. In outlining the convergence of individual and communal worship‘ of brands the brand community concept is adopted as both a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> <b>interaction</b> and the outcome of consumer devotion. The emergence of brand communities and User-Fandom reflects wider shifts in a society enveloped within the rhetoric of consumerism and the influence of the consumer society. Central to this is {{the manner in which the}} relationship between producers and consumers has evolved. In noting this relationship it becomes important to determine whether individuals are active agents within this system or if they are passive to the hegemonic forces that surround them. For the purpose of this research the consumer perspective was focused upon. It is the description of these converging forces that stands as the major theoretical contribution of this study. In performing netnographic research on the postings of operating systems users on online forums, the research identifies distinct forms of social interaction and consumer-product relationships. The broad concepts of community, identity, the consumer society and resistance have been brought together to establish a framework in an attempt to explain the socielity within this context. The analysis of the forums through the theoretical grounding allow for the concepts of brand communities, User-Fandom and resistance through consumerism to be explored...|$|E

50|$|Sociopolitical {{organization}} {{is complicated by}} the presence <b>of</b> sometimes conflicting <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> land tenure and systems introduced at different times by the Spaniards and Mexicans that crosscut traditional organization. There are two <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> land tenure present in the region. The comunidad is an older, indigenous form, in which land is held patrilineally and inherited by sons or widows. The ejido is a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> land-tenure system provided for in the constitution of 1917, following the Mexican Revolution. It allocated communal lands to applicants—whether Indian, mestizo, or together—to be held as long as the land is used economically. Under the ejidal system, land is not officially or legally inheritable, but actual practice often violates this proviso. An elected body of officials governs the ejido and its economic business. Residential units found within ejidos and comunidades include towns and rancherías.|$|R

40|$|Some theoreticians {{argue that}} the {{stability}} of liberalism is {{to a large extent}} an outcome of a continued existence of traditional and other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> life in communities, which are able to slow down or hinder the immoderate expansion of individualism, but that liberal societies are liable to destroy that foundation of their stability. However, liberal society cannot allow the destruction <b>of</b> the existing <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> and communitarian life, because it would mean its destabilization. On the contrary, where traditional communities do not play their stabilising role, liberal societies must change their social and cultural policy in order to generate some new <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> communitarian and <b>communal</b> life. The article deals with some constructive and destructive influences of liberalism on the communities constituted around separate concepts of the good.
