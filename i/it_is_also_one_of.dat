5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E

Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.|$|E
