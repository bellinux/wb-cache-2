5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of <b>galactomannan</b> subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates make {{up about}} 50% of the dry weight of green coffee beans. The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan, <b>galactomannan,</b> and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains, with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and galactose (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica green coffee bean, a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans, the content of free glucose was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free galactose 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes.|$|E

Analysis of the molecular weight distribution of the two neutral populations showed that they differ in their molecular weight. Further characterization of these neutral populations by NMR and by MALDI-TOF MS after enzymatic degradation with an endo-mannanase, showed the presence of acetyl groups linked to the <b>galactomannans,</b> a feature not previously described for this type of polysaccharides from coffee beans. It was found that the high molecular weight (ca. 2000 kDa) neutral fraction was highly substituted both with galactose residues and acetyl groups, while the low molecular weight (ca. 20 kDa) population was much less substituted.
