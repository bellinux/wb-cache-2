50|$|During the 1957-59 period, {{known as}} the pre-stabilization years, <b>economic</b> <b>planners</b> {{contented}} themselves with piecemeal measures such as moderate anti-inflationary stopgaps and increases in Spain's links with the world economy.

50|$|The Great Leap Forward in China in 1958 corresponded {{closely with}} the myth of superabundance; <b>economic</b> <b>planners</b> reduced the acreage space for {{planting}} wheat and grains, trying to force farmers and agricultural labourers into accepting new forms of industry. As a result, production of wheat and grain was slowed dangerously, and floods in the South and droughts in the North struck in 1959, leading China into the record-breaking Great Chinese Famine.|$|R

When he fell ill with a suspected cancer, he was removed to a hospital and encouraged to make further confessions in return for favourable treatment, but declined the offer. He was released on a commuted sentence in 1934 and allowed to work in Aktyubinsk, Kazakhstan, as an <b>economic</b> <b>planner.</b> Rubin was arrested once more during the Great Purge in 1937. After this arrest he was never seen alive again.|$|E
50|$|China has {{a budget}} deficit of around 1.5% of GDP. China {{projected}} a budget deficit of 295 billion yuan in 2006, down 1.7% from 2005. The {{overall budget deficit}} in 2004 was approximately US$26 billion, an amount equivalent to about 1.5% of GDP. In 2007, <b>economic</b> <b>planners</b> expect China's already small budget deficit to shrink again. According to economists, this has afforded China to spend more on public services such as education and healthcare.|$|R
50|$|China's <b>economic</b> <b>planners</b> gave {{priority}} in technology imports to electronics, telecommunications, electric-power generation and transmission, transportation equipment, and energy-saving devices. The degree of central control over technology imports fluctuated in the 1980s, reflecting changing foreign trade policies and foreign exchange balances, {{but the overall}} trend was toward devolution of decision making to those who used the technology or equipment. Bank loans and other means were made available to encourage end users to select appropriate technology.|$|R

50|$|The {{month of}} September in 2007 {{was just one}} of another moment in which the {{administration}} of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo compromised the welfare of the country.The NBN-ZTE deal was a ridiculous anomaly that designed the stashing of Billions of money from the coffers of government. Romulo Neri, the chief <b>economic</b> <b>planner</b> of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo unwittingly leaked the information that he was offered a P200 Million bribe by COMELEC Chairman Benjamin Abalos. On October 19, Glorietta was bombed leaving 11 persons dead. The analysis of Magdalo group then was that the bombing was made to deflect the attention of the public from the senate investigation done at that time.|$|E

50|$|In 1966, the Soviet economists {{suggested}} {{creating a}} unified series of mutually compatible computers. Due {{to the success}} of the IBM System/360 in the USA, the <b>economic</b> <b>planners</b> decided to use the IBM design, although some prominent Soviet computer scientists had criticized the idea and suggested instead choosing one of the Soviet indigenous designs, such as БЭСМ or Minsk. The first works on the cloning began in 1968; production started in 1972. In addition, after 1968, other Comecon countries joined the project.|$|R

The updated version of Socrates supports incubators by enabling users with technology-based facts about the marketplace, competitor maneuvers, potential partners, and technology paths to achieve competitive advantage. Michael Sekora, the original creator and director of Socrates says that a key purpose of Socrates is to assist government <b>economic</b> <b>planners</b> in addressing the economic and socioeconomic issues (see above) with unprecedented speed, efficiency and agility.|$|R
50|$|Turnpike theory {{refers to}} a set of {{economic}} theories about the optimal path of accumulation (often capital accumulation) in a system, depending on the initial and final levels. In the context of a macroeconomic exogenous growth model, for example, it says that if an infinite optimal path is calculated, and an <b>economic</b> <b>planner</b> wishes to move an economy from one level of capital to another, as long as the planner has sufficient time, the most efficient path is to quickly move the level of capital stock to a level close to the infinite optimal path, and to allow capital to develop along that path until it is nearly the end of the desired term and the planner must move the capital stock to the desired final level. The name of the theory refers to the idea that a turnpike is the fastest route between two points which are far apart, even if it is not the most direct route.|$|E
50|$|In 1944, Wilson {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Navy where he {{attended}} officer candidate school. After World War II, he attended Baylor University followed by Texas A&M University, where he received a degree in mathematics in 1949. He next attended the University of Texas and received a master's degree in anthropology. He then attended the University of Michigan {{as a graduate student}} and later received a Ph.D. from University of California, Los Angeles in 1961. After World War II, the GI Bill and his work for the Texas Highway Department, as an <b>economic</b> <b>planner</b> for the Jicarilla Apache Tribe in New Mexico, and as an attendant in a psychiatric hospital, helped to support his education. He was also involved {{in the early stages of}} testing of the Salk polio vaccine. In 1961, he joined the department of anthropology at the University of Missouri. He was a fellow of the American Anthropological Association and Sigma Xi. He was the first researcher to point out methodological flaws in studies reporting menstrual synchrony among women.|$|E
50|$|Leaving the OIS, Kalecki went to París, {{where he}} stayed not long, {{then moved to}} Montreal, where he stayed for fifteen months, working at the International Labour Office. In July 1946 he {{accepted}} the Polish government's invitation to head the Central Planning Office of the Ministry of Economics, but he left some months later. At the end of 1946, he {{decided to move to}} New York. He liked the position offered him in the Economic Department of the United Nations Secretariat. He remained there until 1954, mainly preparing the World Economic Reports. As in 1945, Kalecki resigned the position in protest. It was argued instead that he was punished on political grounds (a non-merited <b>economic</b> <b>planner</b> stance was attributed to him). He became depressed by Senator Joseph McCarthy's witch-hunt, as many of his close friends were directly affected. Denounced in the US Senate as a supporter of communism, Kalecki was unsuccessful in the US (although he influenced the future Post-Keynesians there), unlike in England, where he had a large following and was supported especially by his friend Joan Robinson.|$|E

50|$|Basra {{is a city}} of {{more than}} one million people, located in Southern Iraq. To {{military}} and <b>economic</b> <b>planners,</b> it represents a strategic objective because it sits near a port that provides access from inland Iraq to the Persian Gulf. The area around Basra itself produces much of Iraq's oil, which is processed at a local refinery. To the south-east is Rumaila oil field, which by itself contains billions of barrels worth of crude oil—14% of the world supply. To the north-east is the West Qurna Field, the second-largest oil field in the world.|$|R

50|$|Tarasov was a descendent of a {{well-known}} family of Armenian traders. Oil industrialist and dandy Nikolai Tarasov (1882-1910), co-founder of Moscow Bat theatre, and Henri Troyat (Lev Tarasov) are among his paternal relatives. Born to a photographer father and academic mother, Tarasov received several degrees as an engineer, a computer scientist, and an <b>economic</b> <b>planner.</b> He {{had a successful}} career as a scientific manager. His company, Progress, was the tenth co-operative officially registered in the Moscow, but it was shut down by the Moscow authorities as “amoral, dangerous to society and contrary to socialist principles”. Then he founded his next successful co-operative, Technika. Tarasov is the co-founder of Kommersant daily newspaper, the first independent airline, Transaero, and {{was elected to the}} Russian parliament. After a conflict with Soviet officials in 1990, he left the USSR and settled in London. In 1993, he returned to Russia and was once again elected to the Russian Duma. In 1996, he decided to run for President as an independent pro-business candidate, but his application was rejected by the electoral commission.|$|E
50|$|The Merton Rule {{is named}} after the council in the United Kingdom that in 2003 adopted the first {{prescriptive}} planning policy that required new commercial buildings over 1,000 square meters to generate at least 10% of their energy needs using on site renewable energy equipment. The policy was developed and implemented by policy officers at Merton Council (initially by Nick Smart, the Council's <b>economic</b> <b>planner),</b> who received corporate and political support. Its impact was such that the Mayor of London and many other councils also implemented it; and it become part of national planning guidance.Over the following few years, Merton worked closely with other authorities, professions and industry to embed the Rule into the UK mainstream. This work not only led to significant CO2 reductions in new buildings where previously {{there would have been}} none, but it also helped to support an emerging industry. In 2006 Merton won the Royal Town Planning Institute's Silver Jubilee cup for the policy, and in 2008 Adrian Hewitt (the Merton Council officer responsible for implementing and driving the policy) won the UK Heating & Ventilation Contractors gold award.|$|E
5000|$|The {{disaster}} of the Great Leap Forward decreased Mao's stature as national leader {{and even more}} so as an <b>economic</b> <b>planner.</b> Mao was subject to criticism within the Central Committee. Few were as vocal as Peng Dehuai had been, but the general consensus was that the chairman's grand experiment had failed completely. In the early 1960s, President Liu Shaoqi, Party General Secretary Deng Xiaoping, and Premier Zhou Enlai took over direction of the party and adopted pragmatic economic policies at odds with Mao's communitarian vision, and disbanded communes, attempting to rework the system to pre-Leap standards. Private handicrafts and street vendors were permitted, and peasants could sell surplus crops for profit after meeting their state production quotas. Living in semi-retirement, Mao continued to make occasional public appearances and voice his opinion on various issues, but played little active part in the daily management of the country from 1961-1964. Newspapers printed sarcastic comments about the chairman and frequently used his name in the past tense. Deng, Zhou, and Liu all seem to have concluded that Mao's policies were irrational and so they would run things while using him as an empty symbol for the people to rally around. Dissatisfied with China's new direction and his own reduced authority, Mao became increasingly annoyed. He complained that [...] "They're invoking my name like a dead ancestor." [...] and that landlords and capitalists were regaining power. The fall of Khrushchev in the Soviet Union also left Mao concerned that that might eventually be his fate.|$|E
5000|$|A 2004 econometric {{study by}} Harold L. Cole and Lee E.

[...] They believe that the [...] "abandonment of these policies coincided with the strong economic recovery of the 1940s." [...] They do not credit FDR for the remarkable prosperity of the 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{observers}} {{agree that}} South Korea's spectacular progress in modernization {{and economic growth}} since the Korean War is largely attributable to the willingness of individuals to invest {{a large amount of}} resources in education: the improvement of [...] "human capital." [...] The traditional esteem for the educated man, now extend to scientists, technicians, and others working with specialized knowledge. Highly educated technocrats and <b>economic</b> <b>planners</b> could claim much of the credit for their country's economic successes since the 1960s. Scientific professions were generally regarded as the most prestigious by South Koreans in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Following on the {{economic}} success of the South Manchurian Railway Company, and its various subsidiaries, such as the Showa Steel Works, ideological and <b>economic</b> <b>planners</b> from the Kwantung Army developed a comprehensive {{plan for the future}} economic and industrial development of Manchukuo per a state socialist model with a command economy. Prominent Japanese entrepreneur and technocrat, Yoshisuke Aikawa, the founder of the Nissan zaibatsu was invited to Manchukuo and asked to establish the Manchukuo Industrial Development Company, a joint venture owned 50% by Nissan and 50% by the Manchukuo government, which would oversee the central plan.|$|R
