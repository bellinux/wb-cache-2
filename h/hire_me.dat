500|$|His {{first big}} break, however, came {{with his second}} Broadway part in The Royal Hunt of the Sun, a play by Peter Shaffer about the {{destruction}} of the Inca empire by conquistador Francisco Pizarro. He said of this performance, [...] "Many of the important roles that I got later on were because the guy who was going to <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> was in that audience and had his mind blown." [...] For that part, Carradine won a Theatre World Award for Best Debut Performance in 1965.|$|E
500|$|Gravel {{took the}} 1980 defeat hard, recalling years later: [...] "I had lost my career. I lost my marriage. I {{was in the}} {{doldrums}} for ten years after my defeat," [...] and [...] "Nobody wanted to <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> for anything important. I felt like I was worthless. I didn't know what I could do." [...] By his own later description, Gravel had been a womanizer while in the Senate, and in December 1980 {{he and his wife}} Rita separated. They filed for divorce in September 1981; she would later get all of his Senate pension income.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} her success with Election, Witherspoon noted in an {{interview}} that she struggled to find work after completing the film, due to typecasting. [...] Analyzing the reasons behind her difficulty to find work, Witherspoon commented, [...] "I think because the character I played was so extreme and sort of shrewish—people thought that was who I was, rather than me going in and creating a part. I would audition for things and I'd always be the second choice—studios never wanted to <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> and I wasn't losing the parts to big box office actresses but to ones who I guess people felt differently about." [...] In 2000, Witherspoon played a supporting role in American Psycho and made a cameo appearance in Little Nicky. She also guest starred in season six of Friends as Rachel Green's sister Jill.|$|E
5000|$|Years later {{during an}} interview, he {{described}} an {{early part of}} the discussion he had with Goldsholl (1911-1995): [...] "Morton Goldsholl told me, unlike the other people, that he wanted a designer. And he said that he wasn't <b>hiring</b> <b>me</b> because I was black and he felt sorry for me. He said he was <b>hiring</b> <b>me</b> because he needed a designer. That turned a corner for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Segretti later {{testified before}} a Watergate grand jury about the activities, {{including}} Chapin's supervisory role. Chapin denied any detailed knowledge of Segretti or {{the activities that}} Segretti undertook during grand jury testimony. Segretti testified, [...] "When Dwight <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> {{he made it clear}} he was <b>hiring</b> <b>me</b> because I was a lawyer and would know what was legal and what was not." [...] Chapin was never indicted for any of Segretti's activities. Chapin resigned to work as an executive for United Airlines, but was drawn back into the swirl of Watergate legal proceedings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Left {{the boat}} at Snog's Point, and <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> {{to bring her}} back. I don't know much about motor-boats, so I'm running kind o' slow," [...] {{explained}} the man.|$|R
500|$|Julia Louis-Dreyfus {{expressed}} interest in the role, but ABC executives felt she was not right for the part. Actors originally considered for the role include Courteney Cox, Calista Flockhart, Heather Locklear, Mary-Louise Parker, and Sela Ward. Cherry wrote the part with Parker in mind, but she rejected the offer, later explaining [...] "it just didn’t feel like I was gonna [...] serve {{it as well as}} someone else might". Teri Hatcher auditioned for the role in January 2004 and impressed Cherry immediately. After a second audition, Hatcher read for the role in front of network executives. Cherry praised her performance, saying [...] "it was the best audition I've ever seen in network". Hatcher later commented, [...] "I don't think they were hot to <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> for Susan... I was maybe on a B-list, certainly not an A-list". Despite her reservations, Hatcher was the third reported cast member to have been cast in the series on February 18, 2004.|$|E
2500|$|... "Some {{people find}} their shtick," [...] Ledger {{reflected}} on the categorization of style. [...] "I never figured out who 'Heath Ledger' is on film: 'This is what you expect when you <b>hire</b> <b>me,</b> {{and it will be}} recognizable'... People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they have you and can describe you. That's fine. But there are so many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campbell, Evangelista and Turlington {{became known}} as The Trinity, a term first used by {{photographer}} Steven Meisel and noted by journalist Michael Gross. Evangelista {{was known as the}} [...] "Chameleon", for her ability to transform her look and reinvent herself. Turlington was known as the [...] "insurance model", saying [...] "clients know that if they <b>hire</b> <b>me,</b> nothing will go wrong". Campbell was the first black model to appear on the front cover of Time, French Vogue, British Vogue, and the September issue of American Vogue, traditionally the years biggest and most important issue.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't arrest me, boss. I wasn't in the game. The men <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> to take 'em out--that was all. They {{said the}} girl was light-headed and the place was a private asylum." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} do superlative work. So, I made a choice. I would either quit {{tattooing}} or {{try to get in}} with Cliff Raven at Sunset Strip Tattoo. Cliff <b>hired</b> <b>me.</b> That's the beginning of the story." ...|$|R
6000|$|So they parted, {{and when}} {{she arrived at the}} city she walked about the streets crying, 'Who will <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> for a servant? Who will <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> for a servant?' But, though many people liked her looks, for she was clean and neat, the maiden would listen to none, and still {{continued}} crying, 'Who will <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> for a servant? Who will <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> for a servant?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I did," [...] said Weston. [...] "You see, {{the case}} was rather different. You offered to <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> to do a thing I'm {{accustomed}} to. It's my occupation." ...|$|E
60|$|Up the Rue Vieille we {{proceeded}} with caution, for the hostelry of the Vigne d'Or, where Michelot had <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> a room, fortunately overlooking the street, fronted the Lys de France, where St. Auban {{and his men}} were housed.|$|R
2500|$|For {{the role}} of Lucifer, a studio {{representative}} asked June Foray if she could provide {{the voice of a}} cat. [...] "Well, I could do anything," [...] recalled Foray, [...] "So he <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> as Lucifer the cat in Cinderella".|$|R
2500|$|At {{the death}} of show and {{character}} creator Agnes Nixon in 2016, Slezak eulogized that, [...] "When she <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> to play Viki on One Life To Live, she changed my life and my career and I will forever be grateful to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{have missed}} it for a million dollars!" [...] cried the Major; but he added: [...] "and you couldn't <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> to go again for two million!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] {{said the}} Gentleman, gravely. [...] "If the people wish {{me to work}} for them, they must <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> without solicitation. I am very {{comfortable}} without office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Instigated my partner's murder, {{and twice}} {{attempted}} my own life," [...] Dane answered in breathless haste. [...] "But I'm {{in no mood}} to waste time. Will you <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> that surf-boat?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, Texas A&M {{athletic}} director Dr. Len Nardone said, [...] "A wonderful {{group of people}} there. The AD who <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> at the time (John Carpenter) gave me a terrific foundation experience in collegiate sports that I have always appreciated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] and Damer {{glanced at}} Horton. [...] "You have got that down? At first he only <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> {{to go up}} to Somasco and watch you while I worked for you. You're a tolerably smart man, Harry Alton, but it's kind of curious you didn't know me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was not I," [...] cried Malbihn. [...] "It was an Englishman who <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> {{to steal}} her. He wished {{to take her}} to London with him. She was willing to go. His name is Baynes. Go to him, {{if you want to know}} where the girl is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then, Monsieur Marius," [...] said he, [...] "since {{that is so}} and you are skilled--as skilled as am I, or more--and he has a fever, {{where is}} the need to <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> to the task?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about mining, but I'm pretty strong," [...] Drummond answered, giving Scott a deerskin bag. [...] "Anyhow, Mr. Thirlwell had better read his letter before you <b>hire</b> <b>me.</b> Antoine, the patron, brought up your mail." ...|$|E
6000|$|If only Miss Salome Whitney will <b>hire</b> <b>me!</b> thought Chester wistfully, as he {{crept up}} the slope. I'm afraid she'll say I'm too small. Wisht I could stretch three inches all at once. Wisht I wasn't so dizzy. Wisht-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "I'd {{help you to}} catch Harmon if I could, but I can prove he <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> to drive him over to Kemp's in the wagon, and you'd find it {{difficult}} to show I knew what there was in the packages he took along." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Faith, I {{am glad to}} {{deal with}} so {{sensible}} a man! Ye take it in the proper spirit. Ye see that what I ha' done I ha' but done {{in the way of}} my calling, that I am but a tool, and that what blame there be belongs to them which <b>hired</b> <b>me</b> to this deed." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'One man to want such {{a monstrous}} house as that! Well, 'tis a fine place. See, there's the carpenters' shops, the timber-yard, and everything, {{as if it}} were a little town. Perhaps Berta may <b>hire</b> <b>me</b> for a job now and then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The very thing," [...] Mr. Asmunsen replied. [...] "Only a {{short time}} ago I had my books gone through for the past ten years.

6000|$|... "I'll tell father {{you folks}} {{want to stay}} all night, and that's as much as I need say. If you count on {{explaining}} why you have come, it's none of my business.
