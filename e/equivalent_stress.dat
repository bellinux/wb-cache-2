However, by means of the von Mises yield criterion, which depends solely on the value of the scalar von Mises stress, i.e., one degree of freedom, this comparison is straightforward: A larger von Mises value implies that the material is closer to the yield point.|$|E

40|$|The article {{objective}} is to justify {{the rationale for selecting}} the multilayer finite element model parameters of the bearing structure of a general-purpose launch complex unit. A typical design element of the launch complex unit, i. e. a mount of the hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder, block, etc. is under consideration. The mount represents a set of the cantilevered axis and external structural cage. The most loaded element of the cage is disk to which a moment is transferred from the cantilevered axis due to actuator effort acting on it. To calculate the stress-strain state of disk was used a finite element method. Five models of disk mount were created. The only difference in models was the number of layers of the finite elements through the thickness of disk. There were models, which had one, three, five, eight, and fourteen layers of finite elements through the thickness of disk. For each model, we calculated the <b>equivalent</b> <b>stresses</b> arising from the action of the test load. Disk models were formed and calculated using the MSC Nastran complex software. The article presents results in the table to show data of <b>equivalent</b> <b>stresses</b> in each of the multi-layered models and graphically to illustrate the changing <b>equivalent</b> <b>stresses</b> through the thickness of disk. Based on these results we have given advice on selecting the proper number of layers in the model allowing a desirable accuracy of results with the lowest run time. In addition, it is concluded {{that there is a need}} to use the multi-layer models in assessing the performance of structural elements in case the stress exceeds the allowable one in their surface layers. </p...|$|R

To alleviate {{the problems of}} casing collapse induced by the coupling effect of rock salt creep and casing wear, the effects of salt creep, attrition rate and casing abrasive position on the <b>equivalent</b> <b>stress</b> on casings in non-uniform in-situ stress field is analyzed by finite-difference model with worn casing, cement and salt formation. It indicates that, creep reduces the yield strength of worn casing to a certain extent; <b>Equivalent</b> <b>stress</b> on casings is bigger and more non-uniform when the abrasion is more serious; Wear position obviously changes the distribution of <b>equivalent</b> <b>stress</b> on casing, and when the wear located along {{the direction of the}} minimum in-situ stress, <b>equivalent</b> <b>stress</b> on casing could be the largest that leads to the casing being failed more easily. <b>Equivalent</b> <b>stress</b> on casings increases gradually with creep time increasing and will get to balance in one year or so; In addition, new conclusions are obtained which are different from before: the maximum <b>equivalent</b> <b>stress</b> on casings is {{in the direction of the}} minimum horizontal stress, only when the attrition rate of the casing is little; otherwise, it is not.
