To the south of the courtyard is the Gatehouse, built originally by Hugh de Puiset in the 12th century and re-developed in the sixteenth and <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> Around this are the college's more modern offices.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Egyptian pagan {{culture was}} in decline after {{the rise of}} Christianity and later Islam, but {{interest}} in Egyptian antiquity continued {{in the writings of}} medieval scholars such as Dhul-Nun al-Misri and al-Maqrizi. In the seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.|$|E
5|$|When {{the medieval}} churches of Kiev were rebuilt {{in the late}} seventeenth and early <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> in the Ukrainian Baroque style, the cathedral was {{enlarged}} and renovated dramatically. By 1746, it had acquired a new baroque exterior, while maintaining its original Byzantine interior. Six domes {{were added to the}} original single dome, but the added pressure on the walls was counteracted by the construction of buttresses. The remaining medieval walls, characterised by alternative layers of limestone and flat brick, were covered with stucco. Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi was responsible for window surrounds and stucco ornamentation.|$|E

40|$|The <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{was crucial}} for the {{development}} of Arabic literature. While some genres were more prone to change, the maqāma remained a conservative and elitist genre. Yet it did enjoy a kind of renaissance in the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century.</b> The maqāmas of the <b>eighteenth</b> <b>century</b> were a varied lot, both qualitatively and content wise. Al-Harīrī remained the favourite model for eighteenth-century authors. Also other great authors of the past, such as Az-Zamahšarī and As-Suyūtī, were often imitated.

5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among members of the aristocracy by the early eighteenth century a girl's education was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 percent from the late seventeenth to the early <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> and perhaps 85 percent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men. Overall literacy rates were slightly higher than in England as a whole, but female rates were much lower than for their English counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, {{and it would not}} be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance left {{a legacy}} across {{intellectual}} fields including poetry, historical writing and architecture, which {{continued into the}} seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> A growing number of Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing confidence in their own literature. Part of the explanation for the sudden flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment, is that the country already {{had a history of}} achievements in philosophy, poetry, music, mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe. From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine, law, philosophy, geology and history. Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Scottish kinship in {{this period}} was agnatic, with descent judged through a common ancestor, helping to create the surname system in the Borders and the clans in the Highlands, with these systems {{beginning}} to break down in the seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> respectively. There was considerable concern over the safety of children. The abolition of godparents in the Reformation meant that baptism became a mechanism for emphasising the role and responsibilities of fathers. Wet-nurses were used for young children, but in most families mothers took the primary role in bringing up children, while the Kirk emphasised {{the role of the}} father for older children. After the Reformation there was an increasing emphasis on education, resulting in the growth of a parish school system, but its effects were limited for the children of the poor and for girls. Most children left home for a period of life-cycle service, as domestic or agricultural servants or as apprentices before marriage.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} Armenian to visit North America was Martin the Armenian from Iran. He was an Iranian Armenian tobacco grower who settled in Jamestown, Virginia in 1618. In 1653–54, two Armenians from Constantinople {{were invited to}} Virginia to raise silk worms. A few other Armenians are recorded as having come to the US in the seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> but most moved as individuals and did not establish communities. By the 1770s over 70 Armenians had settled in the colonies. The persecution of Christian minorities under the Ottoman Empire and American missionary activities resulted in a small wave of Armenian migration to the US in the 1830s from Cilicia and Western Armenia. Hatchik (Christopher) Oscanyan, a Constantinople American missionary school student, arrived in America in 1835 to pursue higher education. He later worked for the New York Herald Tribune and became the New York Press Club president. Many Armenians followed him {{and went to the}} US for education.|$|E
5|$|This {{section is}} crossed by King Street, which follows {{the course of}} a Roman road. Where it crosses the Maxey Cut, to the south of the {{original}} channels, there are a series of 14 arches which comprise Lolham Bridges. They are grouped into five structures to cross the channels in the area, and were funded by the County of Northamptonshire in the seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> The longest span is , and the cutwaters carry inscribed stones recording the County's involvement. To the north, an early nineteenth century stone rubble arched bridge carries the road over a drainage ditch near Lolham Mill, while an eighteenth-century bridge, probably rebuilt in the following century, crosses the mill stream. Another pair of early nineteenth-century bridges, built of coursed limestone with ashlar dressings, carry the road over the northernmost channel.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the late}} Medieval castles built in the borders were {{in the form of}} tower houses, smaller pele towers or simpler bastle houses. From the fifteenth century there was a phase of Renaissance palace building, which {{restructured}} them as castle-type palaces, beginning at Linlithgow. Elements of Medieval castles, royal palaces and tower houses were used in the construction of Scots baronial estate houses, which were built largely for comfort, but with a castle-like appearance. In the seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> the military significance of castles declined, but they increasingly became tourist attractions. Elements of the Scots Baronial style would be revived from the late eighteenth century and the trend would be confirmed in popularity by the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle in the nineteenth century and its adoption as a retreat by Queen Victoria. In the twentieth century there were only isolated examples of new castle-influenced houses. Many tower houses were renovated, and many castles were taken over by the National Trust for Scotland or Historic Scotland and are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief in}} the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women, vied with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers. In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the catechism and even {{to be able to}} independently read the Bible, but most commentators, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. In the lower ranks of society, they benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys, often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. They were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Female illiteracy rates based on signatures among female servants were around 90 per cent, from the late seventeenth to the early <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> and perhaps 85 per cent for women of all ranks by 1750, compared with 35 per cent for men.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation {{has been seen}} as creating the Highland clan system, evident in records from the thirteenth century. Surnames were rare in the Highlands until the seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> In the Middle Ages all members of a clan did not share a name and most ordinary members were usually not related to its head. At the beginning of the era, the head of a clan was often the strongest male in the main sept or branch of the clan, but later, as primogeniture began to dominate, it was usually the eldest son of the last chief. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent in status to Lowland gentlemen, providing council to the chief in peace and leadership in war. Below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. In the Isles and along the adjacent western seaboard, there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids and taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes act as soldiers. In the early modern era they would take the clan name as their surname, turning the clan into a massive, if often fictive, kin group.|$|E
