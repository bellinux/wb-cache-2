The construction of the Patuca II hydroelectric plant in the Patuca river highlights the elements of the debate. A hydroelectric plant <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> affect the waterway where it is built. It also requires infrastructure that disturbs the environment around it. A lot of the reserve does not have developed roadways or power. A hydroelectric facility would require development throughout the reserve.|$|E

She is reluctant to activate the pendant and it eventually becomes clear that David {{is in love with}} her. David takes her to meet his parents, Maddy and Az, who are the original runaways from the city. They explain how the operation <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> “cosmetic nipping and tucking.” It also causes lesions in the brain to make the people placid, or “pretty-minded.” Horrified, Tally decides to keep the Smoke secret and throws the locket into a fire. However, the flames' heat causes the tracker to activate, giving away the Smoke’s location.|$|E

Port activities generate $9.7 billion in gross domestic product and $20.3 billion in economic output. Vancouver is also the headquarters of forest product and mining companies. In recent years, Vancouver has become a centre for software development, biotechnology, aerospace, video game development, animation studios and television production and film industry. The city's strong focus on lifestyle and health culture also makes it a hub for many lifestyle-brands with Lululemon, Arc'teryx, Kit and Ace, Mountain Equipment Co-op, Herschel Supply Co., Aritzia, Reigning Champ, and Nature's Path Foods all founded and headquartered in Vancouver.|$|E

[...] He also found it awkward that the Hogwarts Express reverses into Platform [...] at King's Cross—although in Hogsmeade the train arrives facing forwards. Overall Levine said that the attraction <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just making it a ride, [...] "By making it an integral and compelling part of The Wizarding World, most guests would want to ride it to get the complete Potter experience. By making it an inter-park ride and requiring a two-park ticket to board it, Universal will surely help up-sell a lot more more customers to higher-priced passes, encourage multi-day visits, increase demand for its on-property hotels, and drive business at its CityWalk dining/shopping/entertainment district".|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the certification courses {{of all four}} instructors, the player is informed that an agent has infiltrated an enemy base ("EVIL Syndicate") on the fictional Izanu Island and has freed the player's kidnapped instructors, who are waiting to be rescued. The player's mission is to fly an attack helicopter from an offshore aircraft carrier and retrieve the captives by landing on a helipad on the island. This rescue mission stands out from the normal courses in that the player <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> maneuver a craft. As the player flies over the island, they must successfully dodge anti-aircraft fire from ground-based turrets, and, although the helicopter is able to fire missiles to destroy the artillery, a single hit to the craft causes the game to end. The helicopter has forward, backward, left, and right pitch controls, rotor throttle controls for altitude, and left and right missile firing controls. Completing the mission earns the player the [...] "Pilot's Wings" [...] certificate and opens harder training areas (consisting of several weather conditions and higher score requirements) and another helicopter mission. Clearing the second helicopter mission awards the player with the golden [...] "Pilot's Wings," [...] and the credits roll.|$|E

500|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} both praise and criticism for its multiple-genre format. It was reviewed by {{four people in}} a 1989 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly shortly {{after the release of}} the game in 1989. Steve Harris said that the game <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> most shoot 'em ups and that it's a [...] "good follow-up for Zanac fans". He added that the multiple-genre format [...] "helps elevate the whole title to a much higher level". Ed Semrad called the game a Blaster Master clone and [...] "only average at best", and he echoed Harris' opinion that those who enjoyed Zanac would enjoy The Guardian Legend. Donn Nauert said that the game is repetitive and offers little challenge and {{that it would have been}} better as a pure shoot 'em up; he pointed to a special password ("TGL") in which players can enter to bypass all of the Labyrinth portions. Jim Allee also compared the game to Zanac and repeated what Nauert said about the lack of difficulty except in the boss battles; he overall praised the game for successfully bringing together two distinct themes.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{production}} designer was Scott Chambliss, {{a longtime}} collaborator with Abrams. Chambliss {{worked with a}} large group of concept illustrators, including James Clyne, Ryan Church, creature designer Neville Page, and Star Trek veteran John Eaves. Abrams stated the difficulty of depicting the future was that much of modern technology was inspired by the original show, and made it seem outdated. Thus the production design had to be consistent with the television series but also feel more advanced than the real world technology developed after it. [...] "We all have the iPhone that <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the communicator," [...] said Abrams. [...] "I feel like there's a certain thing that you can't really hold onto, which is kind of the kitschy quality. That must go if it's going to be something that you believe is real." [...] Prop master Russell Bobbitt collaborated with Nokia on recreating the original communicator, creating a $50,000 prototype. Another prop recreated for the film was the tricorder. Bobbitt brought the original prop to the set, but the actors found it too large to carry when filming action scenes, so technical advisor Doug Brody redesigned it to be smaller. The phaser props were designed as spring-triggered barrels that revolve and glow as the setting switches from [...] "stun" [...] to [...] "kill". An Aptera Typ-1 prototype car was used on location.|$|E

2500|$|... "When a poem rhymes," [...] Heaney wrote, [...] "when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes {{consciousness}} {{into new}} postures, {{it is already}} {{on the side of}} life.

When language <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit."He continues: [...] "The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place". Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz.|$|E

2500|$|Norwood is a lyric contralto, {{with a range}} {{spanning}} three octaves {{and five}} semitones. Her voice has often been described as soft, raspy, and husky by music critics and Norwood herself. Music critic and Slant Magazine writer Andrew Chan describes Norwood's vocal tone as having [...] "an unusual mix of warmth and cold, hard edges". He further describes her vocal quality, saying, [...] "Like little else in pop-music singing, Brandy's subtle manipulation of timbre and texture rewards close listening. [...] Her main claim of technical virtuosity has always been her long, cascading riffs, a skill many R die-hards revere her for." [...] Norwood is also noted for her use of multitrack recording to create intricate vocal arrangements and layering. Terry Sawyer of PopMatters writes on this skill, remarking, [...] "While it's been said that Brandy's voice isn't exactly a barn burner, it's not mentioned enough that she <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough with what she's got. She never leaves her voice hanging in spotlit scarcity, folding its variegated terracing, whispering out the lead track, shouting in the back-up, and piling each song with enough interlocking sounds to create the tightly packed illusion of vocal massiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|The script of {{the play}} [...] "remains 85% Shakespeare" [...] and mostly follows the plot of Macbeth, {{although}} lines from other Shakespeare plays are included. MacHomer features, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, [...] "clever rearrangements of lines, crosscuttings between scenes, sometimes topical interpolations and assignment of roles to cartoon entities [...]" [...] During the MacBeth portion, Miller performs the various roles using voices from The Simpsons characters. He <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 voices. For example, Homer Simpson is Macbeth, Marge Simpson is Lady Macbeth, Mr. Burns is King Duncan, Ned Flanders is Banquo and Barney Gumble is Macduff. Miller also includes some non-Simpsons characters, such as Kermit the Frog. Sound and video effects are incorporated into the performance as well. According to critic Nelson Pressley of the Washington Post, [...] "you have to give MacHomer awfully high marks for technical difficulty." [...] At {{the back of the}} stage, there is a monitor which shows various images, including 200 drawings made by Miller. There is also a video camera hidden in a cauldron, so that when Miller looks into it, his face can be seen on the screen. Halfway through the play, he puts on a puppet show, which recaps the play to that point.|$|E

McInerney (a friend of Ellis) noted the novel's comparative darkness {{to his own}} Model Behaviour (also about 90s nightlife and [...] supermodels), published the same year, saying [...] "I deliberately wrote a comic novel because you don't go chasing butterflies with sledgehammers". (Regarding McInerney's novel, Stein had felt that the novelist's attempt at a zeitgeist novel was one [...] "looking at the '90s through an '80s lens".) Harvard Crimson noted, similar to McInerney, that [...] "Celebrity by itself teeters so often into self-parody that it seems too easy to bash it" [...] but remarks that [...] "Fortunately, Ellis <b>does</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> that injecting Glamorama with a sharper plot than those of earlier novels, a plot which kicks in {{about a quarter of}} the way into the novel." [...] The New York Times question the choice of subject matter as well: [...] "Ellis's satirical message is, essentially, a one-liner, and hardly an original one at that – celebrity culture is vapid, yes, and?" [...] The reviewer furthermore suggested [...] "Glamorama is itself just another artifact of the culture it pretends to criticize." ...|$|E
