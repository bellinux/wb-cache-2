40|$|To {{examine the}} {{distribution}} of low molecular weight silicones in body organs, separate groups of female CD- 1 mice were injected with either breast implant distillate composed primarily of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane,</b> and tetradecamethylcycloheptasiloxane or a polydimethylsiloxane oil containing low molecular weight linear siloxanes. Mice were injected subcutaneously in the suprascapular area and killed at different times. Levels of individual low molecular weight silicones were measured in 10 different organs (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, mesenteric lymph nodes, ovaries, spleen, skeletal muscle, and uterus). In mice treated with the cyclosiloxane mixture and killed at 3, 6, or 9 weeks, highest levels of cyclosiloxanes {{were found in the}} mesenteric lymph nodes, ovaries, and uterus, but all organs examined contained cyclosiloxanes. In a cohort killed at 1 year, most organs contained measurable cyclosiloxanes with highest levels in mesenteric lymph nodes, abdominal fat, and ovaries. Of the individual cyclosiloxanes measured, selective retention of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane and <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane</b> relative to octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane was seen in all organs at all time points studied. Organs from animals receiving the linear siloxane mixture were harvested at 9, 12, and 15 weeks. We found maximum levels in the brain, lungs, and mesenteric lymph nodes, but all other organs contained measurable levels.

Flow simulations were performed to evaluate the potential of using this experimental arrangement to investigate the formation and propagation of nonclassical waves. Results of D 6 (<b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane)</b> flow field computations generated by point explosions are hereby presented and show that the spreading of the nonclassical compression can be hardly detected by means of optical measurements.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Direct human {{emissions}} {{are known to}} contribute volatile organic com-pounds (VOCs) to indoor air via various mechanisms. However, few measurements that determine the emissions of a full suite of occupant-associated VOCs are available. We measured occupant-related VOC emissions from engineering students in a classroom using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS). The dominant compound emitted was a cyclic volatile methylsiloxane (cVMS), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5), which is a major inactive ingredient in some personal care products such as antiperspirants. D 5 was found to contribute ∼ 30 % of the total indoor VOC mass concentration {{as measured by the}} PTR-TOF-MS. Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4) and <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane</b> (D 6) were detected at abundances that were 1 − 2 orders of magnitude lower.

Concentrations of cVMS in biota were {{within the range}} reported for other studies of cVMS in aquatic biota. Trophic magnification factors (TMF) were assessed in various food web configurations to investigate the effects of food web structure.

Here, we analyze two previously-published datasets of concentrations of cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes (cVMS) in air and find Junge relationships in both. The first dataset is a time series of concentrations of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) measured between January and June, 2009 at a rural site in southern Sweden that shows a Junge relationship in the temporal variability of the measurements. The second dataset consists of measurements of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D 3), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4) and D 5 made simultaneously at 12 sites in the Global Atmospheric Passive Sampling (GAPS) network that shows a Junge relationship in the spatial variability of the three cVMS congeners. We use the Junge relationship for the GAPS dataset to estimate atmospheric lifetimes of <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane</b> (D 6), 8 : 2 –fluorotelomer alcohol and trichlorinated biphenyls that are within a factor of 3 of estimates based on degradation rate constants for reaction with hydroxyl radical determined in laboratory studies...|$|E

Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5), <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane</b> (D 6), and their gas-phase oxidation products have been incorporated into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Gas-phase oxidation products, as the precursor to secondary organic aerosol from this compound class, were included to quantify the maximum potential for aerosol formation from gas-phase reactions with OH. Four 1 -month periods were modeled to quantify typical concentrations, seasonal variability, spatial patterns, and vertical profiles. Typical model concentrations showed parent compounds were highly dependent on population density as cities had monthly averaged peak D 5 concentrations up to 432  ng m − 3. Peak oxidized D 5 concentrations were significantly less, up to 9  ng m − 3, and were located downwind of major urban areas. Model results were compared to available measurements and previous simulation results. Seasonal variation was analyzed and differences in seasonal influences were observed between urban and rural locations.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{thermodynamic}} optimization of Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs), coupled with absorption or adsorption cooling units, for combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) generation from biomass combustion. Results were obtained by modelling with the main aim of providing optimization guidelines for the operating conditions of these types of systems, specifically the subcritical or transcritical ORC, when integrated in a CCHP system to supply typical heating and cooling demands in the tertiary sector. The thermodynamic approach was complemented, to avoid its possible limitations, by the technological constraints of the expander, the heat exchangers and the pump of the ORC. The working fluids considered are: n-pentane, n-heptane, octamethyltrisiloxane, toluene and <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane.</b> In addition, the energy and environmental performance of the different optimal CCHP plants was investigated. The optimal plant from the energy and environmental point of view is the one integrated by a toluene recuperative ORC, although it is limited to a development with a turbine type expander.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary {{design of a}} Ludwieg tube for the experimental verification {{of the existence of}} nonclassical rarefaction shock waves in dense vapors. Nonclassical phenomena can manifest in flows of vapors of complex molecules, such as siloxanes or perfluorocarbons, near the liquid-vapor saturation curve and close to the liquid-vapor critical point. The Flexible Asymmetric Shock Tube (FAST) setup is composed of a charge tube that can be maintained at high temperature and pressure in accurately controlled conditions. The charge tube is separated from the discharge vessel by a special fast opening valve. A nozzle is interposed between the valve and the charge tube to prevent disturbances from the discharge vessel to propagate into the tube. If the rarefaction wave that is generated by opening the valve is a nonclassical rarefaction shock, then it moves with supersonic speed. The supersonic character of the rarefaction wave is to be demonstrated by computing the wave speed from dynamic pressure measurements at two different locations, to be compared to the local sound speed, which can be measured in the same device. An estimate of the valve opening time is computed and it is found to be within technological limits.

40|$|Cyclic {{volatile}} methylsiloxanes (cVMS) {{are used}} in personal care products and emitted to aquatic environments through wastewater effluents, and their bioaccumulation potential is debated. Here, a new bentho-pelagic version of the ACC-HUMAN model was evaluated for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and applied to cVMS in combination with measurements to explore their bioaccumulation behavior in a subarctic lake. Predictions agreed better with measured PCB concentrations in Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) when the benthic link was included than in the pelagic-only model. Measured concentrations of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) were 60 ± 1. 2 (Chironomidae larvae), 107 ± 4. 5 (pea clams Pisidium sp.), 131 ± 105 (three-spined sticklebacks: Gasterosteus aculeatus), 41 ± 38 (char), and 9. 9 ± 5. 9 (trout) ng g- 1 wet weight. Concentrations were lower for octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4) and <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane</b> (D 6), {{and none of the}} cVMS displayed trophic magnification. Predicted cVMS concentrations were lower than measured in benthos, but agreed well with measurements in fish. cVMS removal through ventilation was an important predicted loss mechanism for the benthic-feeding fish.

Due to their prevalence and chemical characteristics, cyclic siloxanes are being assessed as possible persistent organic pollutants. D 4, D 5, and D 6 were measured in indoor and outdoor air to quantify and compare siloxane concentrations and compound ratios depending on location type. Indoor air samples had a median concentration of 2200 ng m- 3 for the sum of D 4, D 5, and D 6. Outdoor sampling locations were over Lake Michigan near Chicago, downtown Chicago, Cedar Rapids, IA, and West Branch, IA, and had median sum siloxane levels of 300, 280, 73, and 29 ng m- 3 respectively. A diurnal trend is apparent in the samples taken in downtown Chicago. Nighttime samples had a median 2. 7 times higher on average than daytime samples, which is due, in part, to the fluctuations in {{the height of the}} planetary boundary layer.

They are predicted to undergo long-range atmospheric transport, but measurements of cVMS in remote areas remain scarce. An active air sampling method for decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) was further evaluated to include hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D 3), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4), and <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane</b> (D 6). Air samples were collected at the Zeppelin observatory in the remote Arctic (79 ° N, 12 ° E) with an average sampling time of 81 ± 23 h in late summer (August−October) and 25 ± 10 h in early winter (November−December) 2011. The average concentrations of D 5 and D 6 in late summer were 0. 73 ± 0. 31 and 0. 23 ± 0. 17 ng/m 3, respectively, and 2. 94 ± 0. 46 and 0. 45 ± 0. 18 ng/m 3 in early winter, respectively. Detection of D 5 and D 6 in the Arctic atmosphere confirms their long-range atmospheric transport. The D 5 measurements agreed well with predictions from a Eulerian atmospheric chemistry−transport model, and seasonal variability was explained by the seasonality in the OH radical concentrations.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} and fate of four cyclic and two linear volatile siloxanes {{were studied}} in a municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), Beijing City, China. Aqueous and sludge samples {{were analyzed by}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS). In the studied WWTP, four cyclic analogs (D 3 -D 6) had significantly higher concentrations and frequencies than the two linear analogs [Octamethyltrisiloxane (L 3) and Decamethyltetrasiloxane (L 4) ], with inputs into the WWTP ranging from 78. 2 to 387. 7 kg/year. Removal efficiencies of volatile cyclic siloxanes in two parallel secondary treatment processes ranged from 59. 3 to 92. 7 %. For volatile cyclic siloxanes, relative fractions of mass loss by adsorption to sludge ranged from 8. 3 to 53. 0 %, and their adsorption capacities were significantly affected by the dissolved organic matter. Besides adsorption, they were eliminated mainly in anaerobic units (44. 4 - 84. 3 %). Through in vitro biodegradation experiments, we concluded that in the anaerobic compartments, Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D 3) and <b>Dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane</b> (D 6) were eliminated mostly by volatilization, while Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4) and Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) may be eliminated by both volatilization and degradation.

Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners that are “legacy” chemicals known to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and biomagnify across aquatic food webs {{were used as}} a benchmark chemical (CB- 180) to calibrate the sampled food web and as a reference chemical (CB- 153) to validate the results.

Various regression models were developed that incorporated benchmarking to control bias associated with experimental design, food web dynamics, and trophic level structure. There was no evidence {{from any of the}} regression models to suggest biomagnification of cVMS in Tokyo Bay. Rather, the regression models indicated that trophic dilution of cVMS, not trophic magnification, occurred across the sampled food web. Comparison of results for Tokyo Bay to results from other studies indicated that bioaccumulation of cVMS was not related to type of food web (pelagic vs demersal), environment (marine vs freshwater), species composition, or location. Rather, results suggested that differences between study areas was likely related to food web dynamics and variable conditions of exposure resulting from non-uniform patterns of organism movement across spatial concentration gradients...|$|E

Here, we {{evaluate the}} environmental behavior of three cVMS compounds (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) and <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane</b> (D 6)) {{in a high}} latitude lake (Storvannet, 70 °N 23 °E), experiencing intermittent wastewater emissions and high latitude environmental conditions (low temperatures and seasonal ice cover). Measured cVMS concentrations in lake water were below detection limits in both March and June 2014. However, mean concentrations in sediments were 207 ± 30, 3775 ± 973 and 848 ± 211 ng g− 1 organic carbon for D 4, D 5 and D 6, respectively. To rationalize measurements, a fugacity-based model for lakes (QWASI) was parametrized for Storvannet. The key removal process for cVMS from the lake was predicted to be advection due to the low hydraulic retention time of the lake, followed by volatilization. Predicted cVMS behavior was highly sensitive to the partition coefficient between organic carbon and water (KOC) and its temperature dependence. Predictions indicated lower overall persistence with decreasing temperature due to enhanced partitioning from sediments to water. Inverse modeling to predict steady-state emissions from cVMS concentrations in sediment provided unrealistically high emissions, when evaluated against measured concentrations in sewage. However, high concentrations of cVMS in sediment and low concentrations in water could be explained via a hypothetical dynamic emission scenario consistent with combined sewer overflows.

The FAST is conceived to measure the velocity of waves propagating in dense vapours of organic fluids, in the so-called non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics (NICFD) regime, and can operate at pressures and temperatures as high as 21 bar and 400 ?C, respectively. The set-up is equipped with a special fast-opening valve, separating the high-pressure charge tube from the low-pressure plenum. When the valve is opened, a wave propagates into the charge tube. The wave speed is measured using a time-of-flight technique employing four pressure transducers placed at known distances from each other. The first tests led to the following results: (1) the leakage rate of 5 × 10 ? 4 mbarl s? 1 for subatmospheric and 5 × 10 ? 2 mbarl s? 1 for a superatmospheric pressure is compatible with the purpose of the conceived experiments, (2) the process start-up time of the valve {{has been found to be}} between 2. 1 and 9. 0 ms, (3) preliminary rarefaction wave experiments in the dense vapour of siloxane D 6 (<b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane,</b> an organic fluid) were successfully accomplished up to temperatures of 300 ?C, and (4) a method for the estimation of the speed of sound from wave propagation experiments is proposed.

40|$|Modern {{thermodynamic}} models {{indicate that}} fluids consisting of complex molecules may display non-classical gasdynamic phenomena such as rarefaction shock waves (RSWs) in the vapour phase. Since the thermodynamic region in which non-classical phenomena are physically admissible is finite {{in terms of}} pressure, density and temperature intervals, the intensity of RSWs is expected to exhibit a maximum for any given fluid. The identification of the operating conditions leading to the RSW with maximum intensity {{is of paramount importance}} for the experimental verification of the existence of non-classical phenomena in the vapour phase and for technical applications taking advantage of the peculiarities of the non-classical regime. This study investigates the conditions resulting in an RSW with maximum intensity in terms of pressure jump, wave Mach number and shock strength. The upstream state of the RSW with maximum pressure drop is found to be located along the double-sonic locus formed by the thermodynamic states associated with an RSW having both pre- and post-shock sonic conditions. Correspondingly, the maximum-Mach thermodynamic and maximum-strength loci locate the pre-shock states from which the RSW with the maximum wave Mach number and shock strength can originate. The qualitative results obtained with the simple van der Waals model are confirmed with the more complex Stryjek–Vera–Peng–Robinson, Martin–Hou and Span–Wagner equations of state for selected siloxane and perfluorocarbon fluids. Among siloxanes, which are arguably the best fluids for experiments aimed at the generation and measurement of an RSW, the state-of-the-art Span–Wagner multi-parameter equation of state predicts a maximum wave Mach number close to 1. 026 for D 6 (<b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane,</b> [O-Si-(CH 3) 2] 6).

The fluids considered herewith are octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM, C 8 H 24 Si 3 O 2), decamethyltetrasiloxane (MD 2 M, C 10 H 30 Si 4 O 3), dodecamethylpentasiloxane (MD 3 M, C 12 H 36 Si 5 O 4), <b>dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane</b> (D 6, C 12 H 36 Si 6 O 6). The 12 -parameter functional form proposed by Span and Wagner has been selected because of its positive characteristics. Siloxanes are produced in bulk quantities and are mostly utilized in the cosmetics industry and, mixed, as high-temperature heat transfer fluids. Furthermore, they are used as working fluids in high-temperature organic Rankine cycle power plants. The available property measurements are carefully evaluated and selected for the optimization of equation of state parameters. For some of the fluids, experimental values are scarce, therefore ad hoc estimation methods have been used to supply more information to the procedure for the optimization of the parameters of the equation of state. In addition, saturated liquid density and vapor pressure measurements are correlated with the equations proposed by Daubert andWagner–Ambrose, respectively, to provide short, simple, and accurate equations for the computation of these properties. The recently developed isobaric ideal-gas heat capacity correlation for the selected siloxanes is included in the thermodynamic models. The performance of the newly developed equations of state is tested by comparison with experimental data and also with predictions calculated with the Peng–Robinson–Stryjek–Vera cubic EoS, as this model was adopted in previous technical studies. The new thermodynamic models perform significantly better than cubic equations of state. T–s and P– v diagrams for all the substances are also reported...|$|E
