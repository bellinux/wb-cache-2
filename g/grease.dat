5|$|Homer and Bart {{begin their}} <b>grease</b> {{business}} and make sixty-three cents worth of <b>grease</b> from twenty-seven dollars' worth of bacon, much to Homer's glee and Bart's disappointment. After Bart {{points out that}} they need larger amounts of <b>grease,</b> the pair drive to Krusty Burger, where they attempt steal <b>grease</b> from the fryers. After loading it into Marge's car, two employees of The Acne <b>Grease</b> and Shovel Company steal it, claiming they control the <b>grease</b> and shoveling business in the city.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{arrive at}} the school during the school-dance to steal the <b>grease</b> in the school's kitchen which Bart told him about. They sneak {{into the kitchen and}} plants a hose in the fryer to suck it into the car, but Willie spots them and {{attempts}} to stop them, claiming the <b>grease</b> to be his retirement plan. Homer tries to escape, but Willie grabs his legs and strangles him with the hose sucking the <b>grease,</b> which explodes due to the increased pressure, causing the <b>grease</b> to flood into the dance hall. A <b>grease</b> fight begins among the students, where Alex eventually joins in after being told by Lisa to act her own age.|$|E
5|$|Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle, {{the manager}} of station WYZT and a racist and sizeist. Velma is {{interested}} in keeping her daughter Amber in the spotlight and The Corny Collins Show segregated. Hairspray was the first film featuring Pfeiffer {{to be released in}} five years. Stardust, also featuring Pfeiffer, was shot before Hairspray, but released three weeks afterwards. The peculiarity of Pfeiffer and Travolta appearing onscreen together (Travolta starred in <b>Grease,</b> Pfeiffer in <b>Grease</b> 2) was not lost on the production staff; Travolta requested that Pfeiffer play the part of the villainess.|$|E

50|$|Dropping {{point is}} used in {{combination}} with other testable properties to determine the suitability of <b>greases</b> for specific applications. It is applicable only to <b>greases</b> that contain soap thickeners. <b>Greases</b> with other thickeners, such as many synthetic <b>greases,</b> do not change state. Instead, they separate oil, and the dropping point as a phase transition does not apply.|$|R
40|$|A Spiral Orbit Tribometer was {{employed}} to evaluate the tribological behavior and relative lifetimes of several commercially available <b>greases</b> under ultrahigh vacuum. These <b>greases</b> are either based on a multiply alkylated cyclopentane oil, or a perfluoropolyalkylether oil, and a thickener made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) telomer.

5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{fraction}} of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of X-ray fluorescence, after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of X-rays became commonplace, the separation was done with <b>grease</b> belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to <b>grease</b> than the other minerals in the ore.|$|E

25|$|Polishing {{operations}} for {{items such as}} chisels, hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, etc., are given a fine finish but not plated. In order to achieve this finish four operations are required: roughing, dry fining, <b>greasing,</b> and coloring. Note that roughing is usually done on a solid grinding wheel and for an extra fine polish the <b>greasing</b> operation may be broken up into two operations: rough <b>greasing</b> and fine <b>greasing.</b> However, for inexpensive items money is saved by only performing the first two operations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Eight {{titanium}} complex <b>greases</b> (i. e., benzoic acid/stearic {{acid and}} sebacic acid/stearic acid titanium complex <b>greases,</b> and <b>greases</b> containing PTFE, or nanotitanium dioxide, or nano-silicon dioxide) were synthesized using 3 -L reaction vessel. Their physical characteristics were characterized and their tribological properties {{were evaluated by}} using a four-ball tester. Chemical compositions of the boundary films generated on worn surfaces were analyzed {{with the use of}} scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Results show titanium complex <b>greases</b> containing PTFE, or nano-titanium dioxide, or nano-silicon dioxide exhibited excellent tribological performance. The mechanism for the frictionreduction and antiwear effect of all titanium complex <b>greases</b> was also proposed and discussed from a tribochemistry point of view...|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{synthesized}} {{two types}} of calcium sulfonate complex <b>greases</b> (barium soap and calcium soap) and investigated their physical, rheological, and tribological properties in detail. The test {{results showed that the}} evolution of their linear viscoelasticity functions with frequency were quite similar to those of traditional lubricating <b>greases.</b> Moreover, these two calcium sulfonate complex <b>greases</b> had good friction-reducing and antiwear properties at room temperature and at 150 °C. In addition, by adding an organic molybdenum compound (MoDTC) to the base <b>greases,</b> we obtained a very low friction coefficient (0.065) for one of the <b>greases</b> (calcium soap) at 400 N and 500 N (maximum Hertzian pressures of 3.47 GPa and 3.74 GPa, respectively) at 150 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the tribofilm was composed of some complex oxide species and CaCO 3 that had formed on the worn surface.|$|R

40|$|Most {{currently}} used <b>greases</b> for space applications {{are based on}} perfluoropolyalkylethers (PFPE) and multiply alkylated cyclopentane (MAC) oils. Evaluation of the <b>greases</b> includes outgassing properties, rheological behavior, and particularly {{the ability to create}} EHL films under conditions {{as close as possible to}} an actual application. A spiral orbit tribometer (SOT) has been developed to conduct accelerated tests under realistic conditions. The SOT was employed to evaluate two <b>greases</b> used in space mechanisms: a PFPE oil with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thickener, and a multiply alkylated cyclopentane oil with n-octadecylterephthalamate soap. The results from the <b>greases</b> are in agreement with results previously obtained with the base oils...|$|R

5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing <b>grease</b> and the <b>grease</b> business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E

40|$|Non-additized {{batches of}} {{lubricating}} <b>greases</b> {{were subjected to}} an artiﬁcial thermal aging procedure. The fresh and aged samples were then tribologically characterized through ﬁlm thickness measurements and Stribeck curves, over a large range of entrainment speeds on a ball-on-disc test rig at different operating temperatures, ensuring fully ﬂooded conditions. The results were analysed at {{the light of the}} physical and chemical changes regarding the fresh <b>greases.</b> The ﬁlm thickness increased for all <b>greases</b> after the thermal aging. The ﬁlm thickness plateau at low speeds also changed and for certain <b>greases</b> it disappeared under the same range of entrainment speeds. The friction behaviour also changed considerably given the changes to the lubrication regimes for the same speeds. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5|$|Molybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS2) {{is used as}} a {{solid lubricant}} and a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) antiwear agent. It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — {{in the event of a}} catastrophic <b>grease</b> failure, a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts. It also has semiconducting properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.|$|E
