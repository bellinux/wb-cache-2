40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} equivalence between two identified zebrafish motoneurons is broken by interactions with identified muscle fibers {{that act as}} an <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> for the axons of these motoneurons. Here we investigate the molecular basis of the signaling interaction between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> and the motoneurons. We provide evidence that Netrin 1 a is an intermediate target-derived signal that causes two equivalent motoneurons to adopt distinct fates. We show that although these two motoneurons express the same Netrin receptors, their axons respond differently to Netrin 1 a encountered at the <b>intermediate</b> <b>target.</b> Furthermore, we demonstrate that when Netrin 1 a is knocked down, more distal <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets</b> that express other Netrins can also function to break equivalence between these motoneurons. Our results suggest a new role for <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets</b> in breaking neuronal equivalence. The data we present reveal that signals encountered during axon pathfinding can cause equivalent neurons to adopt distinct fates. Such signals may be key in diversifying a neuronal population and leading to correct circuit formation...|$|R
40|$|Inflation {{targeting}} {{is shown}} to imply inflation forecast targeting: the central bank's inflation forecast becomes an <b>intermediate</b> <b>target.</b> Inflation forecast targeting simplifies both implementing and monitoring of monetary policy. The inflation forecast is actually an ideal intermediate target: it is most correlated with the goal, easier to control than the goal, more observable than the goal, and very transparent. Money growth targeting generally leads to higher inflation variability than inflation targeting. In the rare special cases when either money growth or the exchange rate is the best <b>intermediate</b> <b>target,</b> inflation forecast targeting automatically implies the relevant <b>intermediate</b> <b>target...</b>|$|R

40|$|During development, motor axons {{navigate}} {{from the}} spinal cord to their muscle targets in the periphery using stereotyped pathways. These pathways are broken down into shorter segments by <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets</b> where axon growth cones are believed to coordinate guidance cues. In zebrafish stumpy mutants, embryonic development proceeds normally; however, as trunk motor axons stall at their <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets,</b> suggesting that Stumpy is needed specifically for motor axon growth cones to proceed past <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets.</b> Fine mapping and positional cloning revealed that stumpy was the zebrafish homolog of the atypical FACIT collagen collagenXIXa 1 (colXIX). colXIX expression was observed in a temporal and spatial pattern, consistent with a role in motor axon guidance at <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets.</b> Knocking down zebrafish ColXIX phenocopied the stumpy phenotype and this morpholino phenotype could be rescued by adding back either mouse or zebrafish colXIX RNA. The stumpy phenotype was also partially rescued in mutants by first knocking down zebrafish ColXIX and adding back colXIX RNA, suggesting that the mutation is acting as a dominant negative. Together, these results demonstrate a novel function for a FACIT collagen in guiding vertebrate motor axons through <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets...</b>|$|R

A theoretical choice of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> of the monetary policy strategy refers to inflation targeting, exchange rate targeting and monetary targeting, with the latter not being a practical choice in these countries. This research tends to find out whether this choice means different economic characteristics considering macroeconomic and financial variables, and whether the choice of an individual <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> implies better overall economic performance. Eleven characteristics are classified for 14 chosen CEE countries, using the multivariate and multicriteria approaches. The research was conducted in four years (2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011) in order to see whether performance and ranking of countries change when taking into account the financial crisis. The results show that, when considering all 11 indicators, countries cannot be classified into two equal clusters considering the choice of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>target.</b> However, when clustering is done using foreign currency denominated loans and three forms of central bank independence, results show that countries are clustered according to our expectations, i. e., foreign currency denominated loans and two forms of central bank independence contribute to a difference between countries. Furthermore, countries were ranked considering overall economic performance, but no significant difference considering the choice of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> was found...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAlternative {{splicing}} {{provides a}} means to increase the complexity of gene function in numerous biological processes, including nervous system wiring. Navigating axons switch responses from attraction to repulsion at <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets,</b> allowing them to grow to each <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> and then to move on. The mechanisms underlying this switch remain poorly characterized. We previously showed that the Slit receptor Robo 3 is required for spinal commissural axons to enter and cross the midline <b>intermediate</b> <b>target.</b> We report here the existence of two functionally antagonistic isoforms of Robo 3 with distinct carboxy termini arising from alternative splicing. Robo 3. 1 is deployed on the precrossing and crossing portions of commissural axons and allows midline crossing by silencing Slit repulsion. Robo 3. 2 becomes expressed on the postcrossing portion and blocks midline recrossing, favoring Slit repulsion. The tight spatial regulation of opponent splice variants helps ensure high-fidelity transition of axonal responses from attraction to repulsion at the midline...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{criteria for}} the selection of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> for monetary policy are (1) that the target be {{closely related to the}} nonfinancial objectives of monetary policy, (2) that it contain information about the future movements of those relevant aspects of the nonfinancial economy, (3) that it be closely connected to the instruments over which the central bank can exert direct control, and (4) that data on it be readily available on a timely basis. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that, on each of the four criteria considered, total net credit is just as suitable as any of the monetary aggregates to serve as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> for monetary policy in the United States. As long as the Federal Reserve Sys tem continues to use an <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> procedure, this evidence is consistent with adopting a two-target framework based on both money and credit, thereby drawing on information {{from both sides of the}} public's balance sheet for the set of signals that govern the systematic response of monetary policy to economic events. ...|$|R

40|$|Recently the {{question}} of whether a monetary aggregate, and in particular M 2, is a useful <b>intermediate</b> <b>target</b> for monetary policy {{has been the subject of}} intense debate. The most striking feature of this debate, which has been largely empirical, is that the central issues that are relevant for analyzing M 2 ’s usefulness in the conduct of monetary policy have been neglected. Issues involving the controllability of M 2 and the structural relationship between M 2 and economic activity have not been adequately addressed. Rather, much of the debate has focused on the notion of predictive content. The argument expressed in much of the literature is that if money lacks predictive content, then it has no useful role as either an information variable, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>target,</b> or, when possible, an instrument of monetary policy. 1 This argument basically misses the point. In this article we argue that Grangercausality tests generally are not a proper test of the usefulness of money as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>target.</b> We also argue that evaluating the usefulness of any monetary aggregate in the conduct of monetary policy requires a structura...|$|R

40|$|Any {{attempt to}} model {{monetary}} policy in China {{has to take}} into account two ‘specifics’ of the Chinese monetary policy: the reliance on several operational instruments, both quantitative (open market operations, discount rate, reserve requirement) and qualitative (selective credit allowances, window guidance etc.), as well as the combined strategy pursued by the People’s Bank of China, i. e. the two <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets</b> - the exchange rate and the money growth. In this paper we analyze monetary policy in China using a small, three-equation New Keynesian model, considering these issues as follows: first, the qualitative instruments are estimated by using the Kalman filter, as no data on them exist. Then, a monetary-policy index is created as a weighted average of the quantitative and the qualitative instruments, which is in turn included in the model instead of the interest rate. Finally, the two <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets</b> (monetary growth and exchange rate) are included in the monetary-policy rule. Our results suggest that monetary authorities in China consider stabilizing inflation and output gap when making their decisions. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>targets,</b> in particular the growth of the monetary aggregates, appear to be important determinants of the monetary-policy behaviour, implying that their omission might be a serious drawback of any analysis. We also find that omitting the qualitative instruments can lead to wrong conclusions about monetary-policy conduct. ...|$|R
40|$|Growing axons {{are often}} guided to their final {{destination}} by <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets.</b> In the developing spinal cord and optic nerve, specialized cells at the embryonic midline act as <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets</b> for guiding commissural axons. Here we investigate whether similar <b>intermediate</b> <b>targets</b> {{may play a}} role in guiding cortical axons in the developing brain. During the development of the corpus callosum, cortical axons from one cerebral hemisphere cross the midline to reach their targets in the opposite cortical hemisphere. We have identified two early differentiating populations of midline glial cells that may act as intermediate guideposts for callosal axons. The first differentiates directly below the corpus callosum forming a wedge shaped structure (the glial wedge) and the second differentiates directly above the corpus callosum within the indusium griseum. Axons of the corpus callosum avoid both of these populations in vivo. This finding is recapitulated in vitro in three-dimensional collagen gels. In addition, experimental manipulations in organotypic slices show that callosal axons require the presence and correct orientation of these populations to turn toward the midline. We have also identified one possible candidate for this activity because both glial populations express the chemorepellent molecule slit- 2, and cortical axons express the slit- 2 receptors robo- 1 and robo- 2. Furthermore, slit- 2 repels-suppresses cortical axon growth in three-dimensional collagen gel cocultures...|$|R
