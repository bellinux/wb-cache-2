50|$|Assume for {{a contradiction}} {{that there is}} no {{interval}} J ∈ EFT(I) satisfying h(J) = J. By definition of h, this means that no interval in EFT(I) <b>intersects</b> <b>with</b> J. However, this would also mean that J is compatible with every interval in EFT(I), and so the earliest finishing time algorithm would have added J into EFT(I), and so J ∈ EFT(I). A contradiction arises, since J was assumed to not <b>intersect</b> <b>with</b> any interval in EFT(I), yet J is in EFT(I), and J <b>intersects</b> <b>with</b> itself. Thus by contradiction, h must <b>intersect</b> <b>with</b> at least one interval in EFT(I).|$|R
