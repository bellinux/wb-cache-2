5000|$|Load {{density is}} the {{percentage}} of the space in the cartridge case that is filled with powder. In <b>general,</b> <b>loads</b> close to 100% density (or even loads where seating the bullet in the case, compresses the powder) ignite and burn more consistently than lower-density loads. In cartridges surviving from the black-powder era (examples being [...]45 Colt, [...]45-70 Government), the case is much larger than is needed to hold the maximum charge of high-density smokeless powder. This extra room allows the powder to shift in the case, piling up near the front or back of the case and potentially causing significant variations in burning rate, as powder near the rear of the case will ignite rapidly but powder near the front of the case will ignite later. This change has less impact with fast powders. Such high-capacity, low-density cartridges generally deliver best accuracy with the fastest appropriate powder, although this keeps the total energy low due to the sharp high-pressure peak.|$|E

40|$|Composite {{laminates}} {{have been}} increasingly used in advanced structural applications, {{due to their}} excellent strength-to-weight properties and considerable flexibility on designing {{with respect to the}} laminate layup. However, the heterogeneity and anisotropy of composite laminates have brought many challenges for analysis and numerous researches have been devoted in this field. A well known problem which has been studied intensively is the so-called free-edge problem. It states that due to the mismatch in elastic properties of adjacent layers, full-scale three-dimensional (3 D) and highly concentrated stress fields will occur {{in the vicinity of the}} free edges. The interlaminar stresses grow very rapidly at the layer interface over a small boundary region and decay quickly toward the inner laminate region at the free edges. As the transverse normal and shear strength of interfaces are usually very low, these interlaminar stresses may cause initiation of delamination. Therefore, it is important to obtain the accurate 3 D stress field of the free-edge problem. ^ In the present study, free-edge stress analysis of composite laminated structures with arbitrary cross sections is dealt with mechanics of structure genome (MSG). MSG is a unified theory that links the original heterogeneous structures with microscopic details and the hypothetical homogeneous continuum used in the macroscopic structural analysis. A cross-sectional analysis specialized from MSG is formulated to solve the free-edge problem of composite laminates with arbitrary cross sections. In contrast to the existing methods, MSG cross-sectional analysis is applicable to laminates of general layups under <b>general</b> <b>loads.</b> In this thesis, MSG based free-edge stress analysis has been further explored to analyze composite laminated structures with arbitrary cross sections and arbitrary layup under <b>general</b> <b>loads.</b> ^ An I-beam laminate and a curved beam laminate subjected to extension, bending and twisting are analyzed separately by MSG to study the distributions of interlaminar stresses. The results successfully capture the stress singularity at the free edge and are in excellent agreement with 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) results. Moreover, MSG shows significant advantages in efficiency while accuracy is maintained by comparing to 3 D FEA results. ...|$|E

For the first ten years, the emphasis of the research was on metal aircraft structures in both the General Aviation Crash Dynamics Program and the Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) Program, a transport aircraft program culminating in the controlled crash test of a Boeing 720 aircraft in 1984. Subsequent to the transport work, the emphasis has been on composite structures with efforts directed at understanding the behavior, responses, failure mechanisms, and <b>general</b> <b>loads</b> associated with the composite material systems under crash type loadings.

To do that direct time integration methods are used to solve the dynamic equilibrium equations. It has been tried to perform general methods to apply in most structures. In this thesis structures are made of cables and bars but the solution methods which is presented can be applied for any structure, and to utilize those implicit and explicit methods for all structures it is needed to know the tangent stiffness matrix and mass matrix for the structure. Then, {{it would be possible to}} analyze the dynamic response of structures under <b>general</b> <b>loads</b> and by general it can be understood that by application of arbitrary forces on different nodes of structure, the method generates result based on applied forces.
