2500|$|The two {{different}} wings {{known to have}} been fitted to the Parasol both had constant chord and very square tips. [...] They were of fabric covered wood construction. [...] The quite slender fuselage was a mixture of steel tubes and spruce, square sided aft of the cockpits and rounded forwards. [...] The supercharged 226hp (167kW) Armstrong Siddeley Lynx radial engine was smoothly cowled but with its cylinder heads exposed. [...] The observer sat in the front cockpit, allowing him direct access to the dynamometer. [...] This had a control wheel and dial for the force readings, plus a lever with which he could free, read or lock the instrument. [...] The pilot's cockpit, behind and with a view unobstructed by the wing had two unusual controls associated with the measurements. [...] He could engage a pair of dynamometer cams which limited its movement and that of the wings to the 6mm necessary for a <b>force</b> <b>measurement</b> in case of a dynamometer failure. [...] He also controlled an hydraulic brake which was used to stop the engine during measurements and avoid prop wash interference. [...] After a period of gliding flight, the engine could be restarted with a gas starter.|$|E
2500|$|This single <b>force</b> <b>measurement</b> {{could not}} resolve the drag and lift components. [...] This {{was done by}} making two force {{measurements}} on different flights and with slightly different support structure geometries, one with the parallel V-struts leaning a little forwards, a second with them leaning back; {{a knowledge of the}} two net forces and of the precise geometry allowed the desired resolution. [...] Rather than fix the rectangular frame directly to the lower longerons and provide alternative locations to change the geometry, Parnall made its readjustment simple by hanging the frame on hinged, near vertical struts from the upper longerons and fixing it in place with four further locating struts from frame to lower longerons. [...] The angle could then be changed by using locating struts of different lengths. [...] Though two angles were sufficient to get the lift and drag, a third measurement at another angle was often made as a cross check. [...] The locating struts lengths were designed so that the wing stayed in the same place and at the same angle of incidence throughout. [...] However, other choices of location strut lengths allowed the wing to be flown at different angles of incidence, for example the high angle experienced by slotted wings. The lift struts entered the fuselage via short horizontal slots to allow from the geometry changes.|$|E

This has led to spectacular results, including direct observation of the atomic structure of complex molecules and quantification of chemical and frictional forces at the atomic scale. We address here a critical question: Is recovery of force from the measured frequency shift experienced by the AFM cantilever ill-posed - that is, unreliable {{in the presence of}} (unavoidable) measurement uncertainty? Resolution of this issue underlies all <b>force</b> <b>measurements</b> using FM-AFM, but remains outstanding. It is shown that concavity of the force law's distance dependence controls ill-posed behavior, with a rapid concavity change corrupting <b>force</b> <b>measurements</b> by inducing spurious and unphysical effects - such rapid change is not uncommon. Practical conditions to eliminate ill-posed behavior are formulated which are verified experimentally.

With high resolution <b>force</b> <b>measurement</b> system makes the measurement of even lower conductivity possible.Up to date has the <b>force</b> <b>measurement</b> system continually being developed. At first the pendulum-like setups was used (Figure 5). One of the experimental facilities consists of two high power (410 mT) magnets made of NdFeB suspended by thin wires on both side of channel thereby creating magnetic field perpendicular to the fluid flow, here deflection is measured by interferometer system,. The second setup consists of state-of-art weighting balance system (Figure 6) from which is being hanged optimized magnets on the base of Halbach array system. While the total mass of both magnet systems are equal (1 kg), this system induces 3 times higher system response due to arrangement of individual elements in the array and it's interaction with predefined fluid profile. Here use of very sensitive force measuring devices is desirable, since flow velocity is being converted from the very tiny detected Lorentz Force. This force in combination with unavoidable dead weight [...] of the magnet (...) is around [...] After that, the method of differential <b>force</b> <b>measurement</b> was developed. With this method two balance were used, one with magnet and the other is with same-weight-dummy. In this way the influence of environment would be reduced.

50|$|Chemical force {{microscopy}} (CFM) is {{a variation}} of atomic force microscopy (AFM) {{which has become a}} versatile tool for characterization of materials surfaces. With AFM, structural morphology is probed using simple tapping or contact modes that utilize van der Waals interactions between tip and sample to maintain a constant probe deflection amplitude (constant force mode) or maintain height while measuring tip deflection (constant height mode). CFM, on the other hand, uses chemical interactions between functionalized probe tip and sample. Choice chemistry is typically gold-coated tip and surface with R-SH thiols attached, R being the functional groups of interest. CFM enables the ability to determine the chemical nature of surfaces, irrespective of their specific morphology, and facilitates studies of basic chemical bonding enthalpy and surface energy. Typically, CFM is limited by thermal vibrations within the cantilever holding the probe. This limits <b>force</b> <b>measurement</b> resolution to ~1 pN which is still very suitable considering weak COOH/CH3 interactions are ~20 pN per pair. Hydrophobicity is used as the primary example throughout this consideration of CFM, but certainly any type of bonding can be probed with this method.|$|E
