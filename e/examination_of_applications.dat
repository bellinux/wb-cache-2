40|$|The Mean Ceramic Dating (MCD) {{formula is}} a widely {{accepted}} method for dating historic archaeological ceramic assemblages. This mathematical assessment uses historically known ceramic manufacture ranges to determine a date assumed to correspond with a site's occupation; however, formula applications on nineteenth century sites have been inconsistent in establishing acceptable absolute dates. An <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> of the formula on nineteenth century ceramics reveals that it's strength is not {{in its ability to}} establish absolute dates for a site, but rather to create relative intrasite chronologies. This study uses ceramic assemblages excavated from several of the feature and outbuilding remnants at the Lanier site (12 Je 490) to assess and evaluate the MCD formula. Historical documentation allows hypothetical chronologies to be established for the site. The MCD formula is applied to several Lanier site contexts in order to demonstrate the formula's ability to establish relative intrasite chronologies for a nineteenth century site.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the suitability of pulse frequency modulation (PFM) as a standard form of signal for representing quantities in process control. The encoding and decoding of PFM signals into both analogue and digital forms is examined in some detail. PFM is shown to be well suited for high accuracy telemetry at moderate cost, provided ample channel band-width is available. The processing of the information in PFM signals by means of binary logic devices is treated systematically. Functional building blocks are identified, and shown to be capable of performing all the basic algebraic and differential operations needed for control. The thesis concludes with an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> and a discussion of PFM transducers, actuators and hierarchical control schemes. The performance constraints of two different process controllers are identified. Both controllers show ‘P+I’ action; one works continuously, the other has a cyclic action; both employ PFM techniques. They are shown to offer dynamic responses similar to those of conventional analogue controllers, in conjunction with high accuracy (e. g. errors less than ½...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Efficient {{storage in}} spatial {{processors}} is increasingly important as such devices get larger and support more concurrent operations. Unlike sequential processors that {{rely heavily on}} centralized storage, e. g. register files and embedded memories, spatial processors require many small storage structures to efficiently manage values that are distributed throughout the processor’s fabric. The goal of this work {{is to determine the}} advantages and disadvantages of different architectural structures for storing values on-chip when optimizing for energy efficiency as well as area. <b>Examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> for coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) shows that most values are short-lived; they are produced and consumed quickly, but the distribution of value lifetimes has a reasonably long tail. We take advantage of this distribution to optimize register storage structures for managing short-, medium-, and long-lived values. We show that using a combination of register storage structures, each tailored for values with different lifetimes, provides a reduction in overall area-energy product to 0. 69 × the area-energy of the baseline architecture, without loss of performance. Finally we provide energy profiles, characteristics, and comparisons of each register structure to enable architects to guide future design choices.

40|$|It is {{seen that}} usage of social media {{in order to}} {{communicate}} with consumers to have relation and to create awareness of brand has increased dramatically in tourism sector {{as well as in}} other sectors. There are some risks during buying process for travellers due to difficulty in deciding before consumption since tourism product depends on experience and abstract structure of service provided. Therefore, social media tools which provides high quality visualizations that supports communication efforts of hotel managements with consumers and making the service concrete become important. Depending on that, the main aim of this study <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> of hotel managements on Instagram as a photo based social media tool and analyzing whether {{there is a difference between}} their photo preferences depending on their type or not.

40|$|Usually patent data {{does not}} contain any unique {{identifiers}} for the patenting assignees or the inventors, as the main tasks of patent authorities is the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> and {{the administration of the}} patent documents as public contracts and not the support of the empirical analysis of their data. An inventor in a patent document is identified by his or her name. Depending on the patent authority the full address or parts of it may be included to further identify this inventor. The goal is to define an inventor mobility index that traces the career of an inventor as an individual with all the job switches and relocations approximated by the patents as potential milestones. The inventor name is the main criteria for this identifier. The inventor address information on the other hand is only of limited use for the definition of a mobility index. The name alone can work for exotic name variants, but for more common names the problem of namesakes {{gets in the way of}} identifying individuals. The solution discussed here consists in the construction of a relationship network between inventors with the same name. This network will be created by using all the other information available in the patent data. These could be simple connections like the same applicant or just the same home address, up to more complex connections that are created by the overlapping of colleagues and co-inventors, similar technology fields or shared citations. Traversal of these heuristically weighted networks by using methods of the graph theory leads to clusters representing a person. The applied methodology will give uncommon names a higher degree of freedom regarding the heuristic limitations than the more common names will get...|$|E

40|$|Scholars have spilled much ink {{questioning}} patent quality. Complaints encompass {{concern about}} incoming applications, examination by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), and the USPTO’s ultimate output. The literature and some empirical data also suggest, however, that applications, examination, and output may differ considerably based on technology. Most notably, although definitions of patent quality are contested, {{quality in the}} biopharmaceutical industry is often considered substantially higher than that in information and communications technology (ICT) industries. This Article presents the first empirical examination {{of what happens when}} the two fields are combined. Specifically, it analyzes the creation and early history of a USPTO examination art unit (AU 1631) that reviews interdisciplinary inventions at the intersection of the biological and information sciences. We explore private value and quality metrics in an early cohort of incoming applications assigned to AU 1631, comparing the applications’ performance on these metrics to a group of applications assigned to a related art unit for more traditional software. We then explore the marginal value of the examination process by comparing examination in AU 1631 with that of a matched set of applications assigned to the traditional software art unit. Our results show that, on almost all conventional measures of patent value and quality, incoming bioinformatics applications were substantially different from, and “better” than, traditional software applications. Moreover, when we compared <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> in the two art units that had been matched on these dimensions of private value and quality, applications in AU 1631 experienced significantly more rejections, particularly notice-related rejections, than the conventional software applications. The notable exception was in the area of nonobviousness, where the prevailing law at the time made interdisciplinary, or “recombinant,” inventions presumptively nonobvious. Potential causal explanations for the higher rejection rates in areas other than nonobviousness include “biotechnology-specific” guidelines then in place at the USPTO as well as the higher educational attainment of examiners in AU 1631. Our results contribute to the empirical literature on factors that affect patent examination quality, particularly with respect to notice. They suggest that technology-specific examination guidelines and educational level not only have an impact, but that this impact can “spill over” into other technologies. The results also demonstrate, {{at the level of the}} art unit (an important but relatively understudied unit of analysis), the empirical theme of substantial variation in what the USPTO receives and how it processes what it receives. We conclude by discussing potential policy implications, including a link to the literature on how examination should be conducted when (as is increasingly the case) the art in question is an interdisciplinary, team-based field...|$|E
