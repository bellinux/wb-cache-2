25|$|Heinz Hopf, who {{had been}} in Berlin before his {{appointment}} to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held - as is clear from oral statements and also from letters - Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E

Some district officials had reportedly spoken to him about his writings, and others had threatened him with a libel action. As {{a result of this}} perceived harassment, Udin had filed multiple complaints with the Legal Aid Institute (...) in Yogyakarta. Udin had also been offered bribes to cease his reporting and received threats of violence. When his wife asked him about the threats, he responded, [...] "What I write is the facts. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> die, I will accept it."

500|$|Bach set {{the text}} in a complex {{structure}} uniting two singers, a solo oboe and a solo cello.

[...] the other. The cello provides an intricate counterpoint throughout, which Albert Schweitzer describes as [...] "a motif of purified happiness". The voices and the cello form a trio, another symbol of the Trinity. The musicologist Anne Leahy of the Dublin Institute of Technology notes that Bach had possibly stanza 3 in mind, which speaks of love, and used the instrument which is named after love.|$|E

During the riots, a caller to Beehive Radio claimed incorrectly that Cambodian embassy officials were killed in Bangkok.

There she meets Glynis Holloway (Hannah Gordon), whose husband has also recently died. The two become good friends.

[...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it.

500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect it too much. I couldn't do it to you. I couldn't do it to the memory of my father, and I couldn't do it to myself. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go into bankruptcy, something I'd hate to do, I'd do it," [...] according to in a 1992 New York Times interview with Susan Rudolph. [...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000. [...] While he refused to seek professional help, Rudolph cut back on his gambling habit later in his life.|$|E
500|$|Still, in the World Series against Colorado, he did {{not start}} the team's away games. Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120-RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117-RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it [...] "the most {{difficult}} decision any American League manager has had {{to make in the}} 34-year history of the DH". Youkilis said, [...] "It doesn't bother me. I want to play, but I totally understand the situation. Look, I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do. I'm playing in a World Series. I'm playing every day. I'm happy. I just want to win.... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take a seat, that's just the way it has to be." [...] Youkilis hit two doubles (both in Game 1) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4-game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, [...] "Move on and go to another team if you’re worried about your playing time, and think you deserve to play over somebody else." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, I know this is it and I'll go to battle <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to,</b> against anyone who doesn't believe in it.

500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to,</b> but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E
500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioned}} on Midweek Politics {{about whether}} reporting on celebrities' sexual orientation incites homophobia {{by making it}} news, Hilton indicated {{that he did not}} believe so.

2500|$|The show usually {{concluded}} with Red giving {{a message to}} his wife, Bernice (usually a double entendre), and delivering his signature piece of life advice {{in the form of}} a hockey metaphor: [...] "Keep your stick on the ice." [...] This was followed by a general meeting of the Possum Lodge membership while the credits rolled, which began with the ritual stating of the Lodge motto: [...] "Quando omni flunkus moritati" [...] (Pseudo-Latin for [...] "When all else fails, play dead"). From season six onward, this was often followed by the Man's Prayer: [...] "I'm a man, but I can change, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to,</b> I guess." [...] In the final episode of the series, a revised version of the prayer was said: [...] "I'm a man, but I changed, because I had to. Oh well." [...] Steve Smith later identified that this was a tribute to his wife Morag, who had simply commented, [...] "Oh well," [...] upon viewing the first episode back in 1991. In one episode, women take over Possum Lodge and change the prayer to [...] "I am woman, hear me roar. I'm in charge, get over it." ...|$|E

In an interview with MTV UK writer Han O'Connor he explained his decision to use Kickstarter, stating [...] "we started trying different angles at solving old problems. Kickstarter was the natural evolution of trying creative new business models.
