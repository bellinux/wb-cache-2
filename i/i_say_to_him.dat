Jordan biographer David Halberstam said that Jordan and Pippen [...] "seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta", and that [...] "in the end, {{it was as if they}} had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause."

His claim to fame is that he drafted Earl Monroe for the Bullets. And <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> 'What pick was that?' He says, 'Two.' And I say, 'Hell! Earl Monroe was a real secret, huh? A real secret? If you hadn't taken him, he'd have gone third!'" ...|$|E
