60|$|Upon this, we {{went back}} to the hill, and fell to work with that. We found the earth loose, and of a {{yellowish}} loamy colour, and in some places a white hard kind of stone, which, in describing since to some of our artists, they tell me was the spar which is found by ore, and surrounds it in the mine. However, if it had been all gold, we had no instrument to force it out; so we passed that. But scratching into the loose earth with our fingers, we came to a surprising place, where the earth, for the quantity of two bushels, I believe, or thereabouts, crumbled down with little more than touching it, and apparently showed us that there was a great deal of gold in it. We took it all carefully up, and washing it in the water, the loamy earth washed away, and left the gold <b>dust</b> <b>free</b> in our hands; and that which was more remarkable was, that, when this loose earth was all taken away, and we came to the rock or hard stone, there was not one grain of gold more to be found.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Silica is an {{inorganic}} material {{that found in}} the nature in various forms. The hazards of crystal of silica or α-quartz (free silica) is greater than other forms. Exposure to <b>dust</b> that contains <b>free</b> silica result to pulmonary injury and result to silicosis and death finally. The present research was conducted in order to evaluate the level of workers exposure to free silica in air of Khaf Iron stone quarries. "nMaterials and methods: The exposure level to total and respiratory dust measured based on personal and environmental sampling methods and concentration of dust determined based on gravimetric method. For determination of amounts of <b>free</b> silica, <b>dust</b> samples analyses based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, and results compared with standard levels. "nResults: The maximum amount of total <b>dust</b> and <b>free</b> silica measured in stone breaking station (800 ± 155 mg/m 3 and 26. 11 ± 6. 7 mg/m 3) and minimum of them measured in official and safeguarding station (8. 28 ± 2. 2 mg/m 3 and 0. 012 ± 0. 0019 mg/m 3). The maximum amount of respiratory <b>dust</b> and <b>free</b> silica measured in red mound digging number 1 (66. 14 ± 13. 45 mg/m 3 and 1. 48 ± 0. 39 mg/m 3) and minimum of them measured in air hammer machine station (5. 26 ± 2. 62 mg/m 3 and 0. 01 ± 0. 005 mg/m 3).

40|$|Background: The paper {{presents}} {{the incidence of}} occupational diseases in Poland (2013). Material and Methods: Occupational disease reporting forms, supplied to the Central Register of Occupational Diseases, were used as the study material. The incidence was specified in terms of rates per 100 000 employed people. Results: The number of new cases was 2214 with the incidence rate of 15. 6. The downward trend recorded over several years continues; compared to 2012, {{the number of new}} cases decreased by 7. 8 %. Exposure to dusts (35 % cases), mostly inorganic (carbon, asbestos, and industrial <b>dusts</b> containing <b>free</b> crystalline silica) was {{the most common cause of}} occupational diseases. Among the organic dusts allergenic effects of flour and vegetable dusts predominated. Every 3 rd case of occupational disease was attributable to physical agents, mainly the way the work is done, excessive vocal effort and noise. The sections of national economy with the highest incidence comprised mining and quarrying (271. 1), manufacturing (24. 3), education (22. 4), agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing (21. 0), human health and social assistance (20. 5). Conclusions: The decreased incidence of ‘traditional’ diseases observed over the recent 15 years and the analysis of the 2013 incidence indicate a need to revise the Polish list of occupational diseases by exposures found in the modern work environment. Particular attention should be paid to conditions prevailing in workplaces with high exposures to industrial <b>dusts</b> containing <b>free</b> crystalline silica. A considerable variation in the incidence of voice disorders in teachers between individual voivodeships (provinces) points to the need for harmonization of the standards of preventive, diagnostic and certification procedures.
