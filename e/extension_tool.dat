In order to contribute with the inclusion of this technology at the Ignacio Agramonte CCS, in El Carmen, municipality of Nuevitas, Camaguey, Agricultural <b>Extension</b> <b>tools</b> were used, like systemic diagnostic and participatory orientation. The SWOT matrix was created after three workshops, where agricultural conservation practices were identified for adoption, based on actual conditions at the CCS. As a result, five key problems were identified: lack of water for irrigation, saline waters, saline soils, use of inappropriate management technologies, deforestation and poor training in agriculture. The most critical impact found in the matrix was in Weaknesses - Threats (81. 3 %).

Typically, (large) supervised systems cannot be guaranteed to meet elaborated performance requirements, as ensuring them during the synthesis procedure is a costly undertaking. We propose a model-based systems engineering framework that enables supervisor synthesis of stochastic (nondeterministic) discrete-event systems, and post-synthesis validation of quantitative properties of the supervised system by imposing a cost model. To this end, we develop several <b>extension</b> <b>tools</b> that interface with the supervisory controller synthesis tool Supremica. To illustrate our approach, we remodel an industrial case study involving coordination of maintenance procedures of a printing process and demonstrate how to obtain performance measures using Markovian reward model checking...|$|R

Previous research quantifying the capability of turfgrass for this purpose was undertaken and communicated, but did not lead to a substantial increase in market share for erosion control by turfgrass in Australia. The Australian turfgrass production industry has therefore invested substantial resources into the design, construction and operation of a new national Erosion and Sediment Control Demonstration Facility at Cleveland, Queensland, as a technical <b>extension</b> <b>tool.</b> The facility has been designed to demonstrate turf as an erosion control and sediment capture measure compared to other products available on the market including silt fencing, silt socks, coir logs and hydro-seeding.

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades when Geographical Information System (GIS) {{technology}} was not fully developed in practical use, watershed delineation work used to be conducted manually by hydrologists based on topographic maps. The work was a tedious operation, since {{it had to be done}} repeatedly in similar manner for each basin or sub-basin of interest, and its process always left some unpredicted errors. Nowadays, GIS software is being upgraded regularly with powerful tools responding to the needs of users in different fields. In the present study, to find a simple hydrological solution for a basin (Tatara River basin), an <b>extension</b> <b>tool</b> (ArcHydro) of a well-known GIS software (ArcGIS) was essentially used for simulations of elevation, drainage line definition, watershed delineation, drainage feature characterization and geometric network generation. With sufficient resolution of DEM interpolated from point elevation data, all water bodies extracted from topographic maps in the basin were critically characterized [...] -the depth and water volume of lakes, ponds, and rivers were numerically computed. The final goal of this paper is to calculate surface runoff of the study basin based on a GIS-based watershed management approach. The work was also processed under another extension called the ArcCN-Runoff model, which ran on the background of ArcGIS software. This <b>extension</b> <b>tool</b> was built based on a very popular model for surface runoff estimation known as the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) model. A total discharge volume in the northern sub-watershed region of the basin was consequently computed on a monthly basis throughout one year. The computed discharges were totally consistent with those observed, and each of the discharges was also confirmed to be responsible for rainfall. These indicate that SCS-CN and ArcCN-Runoff models used in this paper are definitely valid and can be applied to other related projects of surface runoff calculation...|$|E
