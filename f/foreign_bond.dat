In Holland these grew out of merchant houses that shifted their capital first from financing their own trade and inventories to acceptance credit, and later branched out specifically into underwriting and public offerings of foreign government bonds (denominated in Dutch guilders) in the Dutch capital markets. In this respect the domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>bond</b> markets differed appreciably, as the Dutch government dealt directly with Dutch investors (as we have seen above).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{quantitative}} easing (QE) in a small open economy dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with international portfolio balancing. Portfolios are classified as imperfectly substitutable short-term and long-term subportfolios, each including domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>bonds.</b> Unlike in standard small open economy models, both domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>bonds</b> may be traded internationally. The model links the domestic term premium to the global term premium, and the implication of the model {{on the effectiveness of}} QE policies in reducing the domestic term premium depends crucially on the degree of substitutability between domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>bonds.</b> The estimated model implies that QE in small open economies is expected to be much less effective on long-term yields because of the high substitutability between home and foreign assets found in the data. In the model, this causes the effect on the exchange rate to be limited. The paper also shows that foreign investors' access to the domestic debt market is essential when evaluating the QE policy; ignoring foreign investors' access would mistakenly make the policy look more effective...|$|R

40|$|Finance theory {{suggests}} that markets where <b>foreign</b> <b>bond</b> portfolio investors overweight their portfolio relative to the prescribed theoretical benchmark should experience higher international risk sharing. Correspondingly, the cost of debt in such markets should be lower compared to markets facing a lower degree of international risk sharing. We empirically examine this prediction using a panel data set of sovereign bond yield spreads and a measure of suboptimal <b>foreign</b> <b>bond</b> portfolio allocations for 50 emerging and ten developed markets. Consistent with theory, our results show higher levels of <b>foreign</b> <b>bond</b> allocations – relative to the theoretical benchmark – are negatively related {{to the cost of}} debt.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies two newly emerging bond varieties - the <b>foreign</b> <b>bond</b> and the CAT bond. Concerning the <b>foreign</b> <b>bond,</b> {{we focus}} on its micro-level impact on the equity value of the issuing firm. We derive a theoretical model {{to explain why the}} issuance of foreign bonds impacts firm value through the channel of foreign exchange risk. Then, we empirically test the stock price reaction to the launch of two foreign bonds - dim sum bonds and Eurodollar bonds. We further show that the crosssectional differences among stock reactions result from foreign exchange volatility rather than from other bond characteristics. Concerning the CAT bond, {{we focus on}} its macro-level impacts on the economic development, risk financing and sovereign debt sustainability of least-developed countries. We examine the roles of the CAT bond as both an ex ante risk financing strategy and an ex post economic development tool. We discuss how the issuance of a government sponsored CAT bond improves the sovereign debt sustainability in an static social wealth maximization framework. In the end, we illustrate how to simulate the price of a drought linked CAT bond through the well-defined closed form solution and show that our simulation technique is adaptive and robust to different settings. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{domestic}} bond markets of the Asia and Pacific region have grown considerably since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, although they remain undeveloped {{relative to the}} region's weight in the world economy. This paper proposes {{that in order to}} encourage further development of these markets, regulators should make them more accessible to foreign borrowers. To that end we offer insights into the nature and mechanics of <b>foreign</b> <b>bond</b> issuance by investigating the key characteristics of 3, 132 foreign bonds issued in 14 countries (other than the United States) between July 1928 and June 2009. We found that the foreign borrowers that tap domestic markets are overwhelmingly of high credit quality and comprise sovereigns, supranationals, and major financial institutions. There is a preference for simple fixed-rate payment structures, which can then be swapped into the currency and coupon type of choice using currency and interest rate derivatives. On the whole, the long-term viability of <b>foreign</b> <b>bond</b> markets appears linked to the presence of highly liquid foreign exchange and derivatives markets that facilitate risk management and transformation, enabling regulation that facilitates cooperation with market participants, the presence of benchmark issues, and competitive pricing between alternate market segments. bond markets; financial market development; foreign bonds...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{a policy}} {{often used to}} defend a {{currency}} peg: raising short-term interest rates. The rationale for this policy is to stem demand for foreign reserves. Yet, this mechanism is absent from most monetary models. This paper develops a general equilibrium model with asset market frictions where this policy can be effective. The friction I emphasize {{is the same as}} in Lucas (1990) : money is required for asset transactions. When the government raises domestic interest rates, agents want to increase their holdings of domestic currency in order to acquire more domestic-currency-denominated assets. Thus, agents do not run on the reserves of the central bank, and the peg survives. A key implication of the model is that an interest rate defense can always be successful, but at great costs for domestic agents. Hence the reluctance of governments to sustain this policy for long periods of time.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{international}} spillover effects of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) using a two-country dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with nominal and real rigidities, and portfolio balance effects. Portfolio balance effects arise from imperfect substitution between short- and long-term bond portfolios in each country, {{as well as}} between domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>bonds</b> within these portfolios. We show that LSAPs lower both domestic and foreign long-term yields, and stimulate economic activity in both countries. International spillover effects become larger as the steady-state share of long-term U.

We also find that U. S. asset purchases that generate the same output effect as U. S. conventional monetary policy have larger international spillover effects.

We show that, as long as the agent is not constrained in her holdings of bonds, the demand for domestic money will not, in general, depend on expected inflation. The demand for money may however become a positive function of the inflation rate in case the agent is constrained in her holdings of <b>foreign</b> <b>bonds.</b> The only case in which the demand for domestic money may depend negatively on the inflation rate is when the agent faces a binding constraint in her holdings of domestic bonds.
