It has been previously reported that Bacillus megaterium QM B 1551 contains seven <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmids,</b> of sizes 5. 5, 8. 8, 20, 49, 71, 108, and 165 kb. The loss of the largest of these resident plasmids resulted in cells that produce endospores that were unable to germinate in response to single chemical triggers, although they were still able to germinate in response to rich media as are wild-type endospores. Several attempts to clone the plasmid-borne gene(s) responsible for this phenotype resulted in one clone that was able to increase the germination of a plasmidless strain (PV 361) in response to single chemical triggers, although this increase in germination was too small to allow the clone to be analyzed further. Also, a minimum of four (probably five) origins of replication from Bacillus megaterium QM B 1551 <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmids</b> have been cloned. One of the origins was shown by Southern hybridization to be cloned from the 5. 5 kb plasmid of QM B 1551, and another hybridizes with several of the large plasmids of QM B 1551. One of the origins (a 2. 3 kb HindIII fragment designated clone I) blocks sporulation when cloned into the moderate copy number vector pHT 315, yielding pDS 100. When clone I is subcloned into a vector with no additional Bacillus origin of replication (pBEST 501) sporulation is not as severely inhibited, although plasmid replication is unstable. Another probable origin of replication (clone II) was found by colony hybridization that is 88 % identical with clone I.

The R. eutropha strain contained chromosomal genes necessary for mineralization of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), while the E. coli strain did not. The soil system was contaminated with 2, 4 -D alone or was cocontaminated with 2, 4 -D and Cd. <b>Plasmid</b> transfer to <b>indigenous</b> populations, <b>plasmid</b> persistence in soil, and degradation of 2, 4 -D were monitored over a 63 -day period in the bioreactors. To assess the impact of contaminant reexposure, aliquots of bioreactor soil were reamended with additional 2, 4 -D. Both introduced donors remained culturable and transferred plasmid pJP 4 to indigenous recipients, although to different extents. Isolated transconjugants were members of the Burkholderia and Ralstonia genera, suggesting multiple, if not successive, plasmid transfers. Upon a second exposure to 2, 4 -D, enhanced degradation was observed for all treatments, suggesting microbial adaptation to 2, 4 -D. Upon reexposure, degradation was most rapid for the E. coli D 11 -inoculated treatments. Cd did not significantly impact 2, 4 -D degradation or transconjugant formation.

The Java 9 strain of Y. pestis is a biovar Orientalis isolate obtained from a rat in Indonesia. Although it lacks the Y. pestis-specific plasmid pMT, which encodes the F 1 capsule, it retains virulence in mouse and non-human primate animal models. While comparing diverse Y. pestis strains using subtractive hybridization, we identified sequences in Java 9 that were homologous to a Y. enterocolitica strain carrying the transposon Tn 2502, which is known to encode arsenic resistance. Here we demonstrate that Java 9 exhibits high levels of arsenic and arsenite resistance mediated by a novel promiscuous class II transposon, named Tn 2503. Arsenic resistance was self-transmissible from Java 9 to other Y. pestis strains via conjugation. Genomic analysis of the atypical plasmid inventory of Java 9 identified pCD and pPCP plasmids of atypical size and two previously uncharacterized cryptic plasmids. Unlike the Tn 2502 -mediated arsenic resistance encoded on the Y. enterocolitica virulence plasmid; the resistance loci in Java 9 are found on all four <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmids,</b> including the two novel cryptic plasmids.

Replication loci of several Streptomyces theta-type plasmids have been reported, {{but are not}} characterized in details. Conjugation loci of some Streptomyces rolling-circle-type plasmids are identified and mechanism of conjugal transferring are described. Results We report the detection of a widely distributed Streptomyces strain Y 27 and its <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmid</b> pWTY 27 from fourteen plants and four soil samples cross China by both culturing and nonculturing methods. The complete nucleotide sequence of pWTY 27 consisted of 14, 288 bp. A basic locus for plasmid replication comprised repAB genes and an adjacent iteron sequence, to a long inverted-repeat (ca. 105 bp) of which the RepA protein bound specifically in vitro, suggesting that RepA may recognize a second structure (e. g. a long stem-loop) of the iteron DNA. A plasmid containing the locus propagated in linear mode when the telomeres of a linear plasmid were attached, indicating a bi-directional replication mode for pWTY 27. As for rolling-circle plasmids, a single traA gene and a clt sequence (covering 16 bp within traA and its adjacent 159 bp) on pWTY 27 were required for plasmid transfer. TraA recognized and bound specifically to the two regions of the clt sequence, one containing all the four DC 1 of 7 bp (TGACACC) and one DC 2 (CCCGCCC) and most of IC 1, and another covering two DC 2 and part of IC 1, suggesting formation of a high-ordered DNA-protein complex.

Chromosomal locations of mutations in 1 Nod- and 11 Fix- derivatives were ascertained by transferring the chromosome (mobilized by plasmid R 68. 45), in eight fragments, into symbiotically effective recipients and testing the recombinants for symbiotic phenotype. Alternatively, the kanamycin resistance marker of Tn 5 was mapped. In five mutants the fix alleles were localized on different chromosomal regions, but six other fix mutations and one nod mutation tested did not map onto the chromosome. It was {{shown that the}} chromosome-mobilizing ability (Cma+) of R 68. 45 {{was not involved in}} the mobilization of genes located extrachromosomally. Moreover, Cma- derivatives of R 68. 45 could mobilize regions of the <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmid</b> pRme 41 b but not chromosomal genes. Thus, mobilization of a marker by Cma- R 68. 45 indicates its extrachromosomal location. With a 32 P-labeled DNA fragment carrying Tn 5 as a hybridization probe, it was shown that in five extrachromosomally located Tn 5 -induced fix mutants and one nod mutant Tn 5 was localized on plasmid pRme 41 b. This is in agreement with the genetic mapping data...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSalmonella enterica {{serotype}} Dublin harbors an approximately 80 -kb virulence plasmid (pSDV), which mediates {{systemic infection}} in cattle. There {{are two types}} of pSDV: one is pSDVu (pOU 1113) in strain OU 7025 and the other pSDVr (pOU 1115) in OU 7409 (SD Lane) and many clinical isolates. Sequence analysis showed that pSDVr was a recombinant plasmid (co-integrate) of pSDVu and a plasmid similar to a 35 -kb <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmid</b> (pOU 1114) of S. Dublin. Most of the F-transfer region in pSDVu was replaced by a DNA segment from the pOU 1114 -like plasmid containing an extra replicon and a pilX operon encoding for a type IV secretion system to form pSDVr. We reconstructed the particular evolutionary history of the seven virulence plasmids of Salmonella by comparative sequence analysis. The whole evolutionary process might begin with two different F-like plasmids (IncFI and IncFII), which then incorporated the spv operon and fimbriae operon from the chromosome to form the primitive virulence plasmids. Subsequently, these plasmids descended by deletion from a relatively large plasmid to smaller ones, with some recombination events occurring over time. Our results suggest that the phylogeny of virulence plasmids as a result of frequent recombination provides the opportunity for rapid evolution of Salmonella in response to the environmental cues...|$|R
40|$|In Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato PT 23. 2, plasmid pPT 23 A (101 kb) is {{involved}} in synthesis of the phytotoxin coronatine (C. L. Bender, D. K. Malvick, and R. E. Mitchell, J. Bacteriol. 171 : 807 - 812, 1989). The physical characterization of mutations that abolished coronatine production indicated that at least 30 kb of pPT 23 A DNA are required for toxin synthesis. In the present study, 32 P-labeled DNA fragments from the 30 -kb region of pPT 23 A hybridized to plasmid DNAs from several coronatine-producing pathovars of P. syringae under conditions of high stringency. These experiments indicated that this region of pPT 23 A was strongly conserved in large plasmids (90 to 105 kb) that reside in P. syringae pv. atropurpurea, glycinea, and morsprunorum. The functional significance of the observed homology was demonstrated in marker-exchange experiments in which Tn 5 -inactivated sequences from the 30 -kb region of pPT 23 A were used to mutate coronatine synthesis genes in the three heterologous pathovars. Physical characterization of the Tn 5 insertions generated by marker exchange indicated that genes controlling coronatine synthesis in P. syringae pv. atropurpurea 1304, glycinea 4180, and morsprunorum 567 and 3714 were located on the large <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmids</b> where homology was originally detected. Therefore, coronatine biosynthesis genes are strongly conserved in the plasmid DNAs of four producing pathovars, despite their disparate origins (California, Japan, New Zealand, Great Britain, and Italy) ...|$|E
40|$|S u m m a r y Xanthomonas {{bacterium}} exhibited post-exponential programmed {{cell death}} (PCD) under certain nutritional conditions especially in a protein rich medium. PCD was not displayed by Xanthomonas cells while growing in minimal medium like starch minimal medium or M 9 medium. While undergoing PCD, the organism was found to transform to spherical membranous apoptotic body like structures. The transformation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The membranous bodies were found to contain DNA, which was devoid of the <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmids</b> of the organism. These bodies were also found to bind annexin V indicative of the externalization of membrane phosphatidyl serine. Nicking of DNA was also detected using a Tunnel assay in Xanthomonas campestris pv. glycines (Xcg) cultures undergoing PCD in LB medium. The PCD in Xanthomonas {{was found to be}} associated with the synthesis of an endogenous enzyme similar to human caspase- 3, a known marker of apoptosis in eukaryotes. Caspase- 3 like protein was detected only in the cells growing in proteinous medium and not in those growing in minimal medium. It was found that starch or its hydrolytic product acted as the repressor of biosynthesis for the Xanthomonas caspase, thereby, preventing the organism from undergoing PCD, upon its addition. Caspase negative mutants of Xcg strain AM 2 did not display PCD. The importance of PCD in Xanthomonas life-cycle needs to be elucidated as the system appears to have significant similarities with the eukaryotic apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} field study on plasmid {{mobilization}} in an agricultural soil. The influence of pig manure on {{the mobilization of}} the IncQ plasmid pIE 723 by <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmids</b> or by the IncP(alpha) plasmid pGP 527 into the recipient Pseudomonas putida UWC 1 (Rif(supr) Nal(supr)) was studied in field soil. Six plots were prepared in duplicate, three of which were treated with manure prior to inoculation of the donor and recipient strains. As a donor strain, either Escherichia coli J 53 (pIE 723) or E. coli 600 (pIE 723, pGP 527) was used. Putative transconjugants obtained on a selective medium were confirmed by DNA hybridization and PCR. Plasmid mobilization by indigenous mobilizing plasmids was observed on two occasions in manured soil. Manuring of soil significantly enhanced the frequency of pIE 723 mobilization by pGP 527, since mobilization frequencies into P. putida UWC 1 were at least 10 -fold higher in manured soil than in nonmanured soil. Enhanced numbers of P. putida UWC 1 transconjugant and recipient colonies could be observed in manured soil throughout the 79 -day field test. Transfer of pIE 723 or pG 527 into indigenous soil or rhizosphere bacteria could not be detected when indigenous bacteria isolated by selective cultivation were screened {{for the presence of}} these plasmids by DNA hybridization. Furthermore, the presence of IncN-, IncP-, or IncQ-specific sequences was confirmed in total community DNA extracted directly from the manured or nonmanured soil by PCR. IncW plasmids were detectable only in manured soil, indicating entry of these plasmids into soil via manure...|$|E
40|$|The {{site for}} {{integration}} of pMC 7105 into the chromosome of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola has been mapped to a 2. 6 -kilobase-pair (kb) Bg/II-EcoRI fragment on this 150 -kb <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmid.</b> Selected excision plasmids resulting from imprecise excision of pMC 7105 {{were used to}} identify one of the plasmid-chromosome juncture fragments and to characterize the mechanism of recombination from the chromosome. A 14. 2 -kb BamHI plasmid-chromosome juncture fragment has been identified in pEX 8060 (234 kb), an excision plasmid which carries approximately 90 kb of chromosomal sequences {{to the left of}} the site of integration. This fragment contains a portion of the 2. 6 -kb Bg/II-EcoRI fragment as well as chromosomal sequences. Blot hybridization with a probe made from selected fragments of pMC 7105 revealed three distinct repetitive sequences, RS-I, RS-II, and RS-III, on this plasmid. The 2. 6 -kb fragment, to which the site of integration maps, also contains RS-II. Five copies of RS-II are present in pMC 7105, and more than 20 copies are present in the chromosome. Eight small excision plasmids were shown to result from recombination among fragments of pMC 7105 that contain common repetitive sequences. The results indicate that integration and excision of pMC 7105 occur through general recombination at homologous repetitive sequences...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato PT 23. 2 {{produces}} the chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin coronatine. Thirty-eight chlorosis-defective mutants of PT 23. 2 were previously generated {{by using the}} transposon Tn 5. Five mutants contained Tn 5 insertions in the <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmid</b> pPT 23 A; the remaining 33 mutants either were missing pPT 23 A (29 mutants) or contained deletions in this plasmid (4 mutants). These results suggested that pPT 23 A was involved in coronatine production in strain PT 23. 2. This plasmid was introduced into P. syringae pv. syringae PS 61, which does not produce coronatine. A bioassay for coronatine suggested that PS 61 (pPT 23 A) transconjugants {{were able to make}} this phytotoxin. In a chemical analysis, organic acids were isolated from PT 23. 2, PS 61, and the transconjugant PS 61 (pPT 23 A); these were derivatized to their methyl esters and analyzed by gas chromatography. The derivatized organic acids extracted from PT 23. 2 and PS 61 (pPT 23 A) contained peaks that corresponded to coronafacic acid, coronafacoylvaline, and coronatine, but these were absent in the extracts from the wild-type strain PS 61. The identification of these components was confirmed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry. Therefore, the acquisition of pPT 23 A by PS 61 resulted in biosynthesis of coronafacic acid, coronafacoylvaline, and coronatine, clearly demonstrating the involvement of pPT 23 A in coronatine production in P. syringae pv. tomato...|$|R
40|$|Dysgalacticin {{is a novel}} {{bacteriocin}} {{produced by}} Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain W 2580 that has a narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity directed primarily against the principal human streptococcal pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Unlike many previously described bacteriocins of Gram-positive bacteria, dysgalacticin is a heat-labile 21 ? 5 kDa anionic protein that kills its target without inducing lysis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of dysgalacticin [Asn-Glu-Thr-Asn-Asn-Phe-Ala-Glu-Thr-Gln-Lys-Glu-Ile-Thr-Thr-Asn-(Asn) -Glu-Ala] has no known homologue in publicly available sequence databases. The dysgalacticin structural gene, dysA, {{is located on the}} <b>indigenous</b> <b>plasmid</b> pW 2580 of strain W 2580 and encodes a 220 aa preprotein which is probably exported via a Sec-dependent transport system. Natural dysA variants containing conservative amino acid substitutions were also detected by sequence analyses of dysA elements from S. dysgalactiae strains displaying W 2580 -like inhibitory profiles. Production of recombinant dysgalacticin by Escherichia coli confirmed that this protein is solely responsible for the inhibitory activity exhibited by strain W 2580. A combination of in silico secondary structure prediction and reductive alkylation was employed to demonstrate that dysgalacticin has a novel structure containing a disulphide bond essential for its biological activity. Moreover, dysgalacticin displays similarity in predicted secondary structure (but not primary amino acid sequence or inhibitory spectrum) with another plasmid-encoded streptococcal bacteriocin, streptococcin A-M 57 from S. pyogenes, indicating that dysgalacticin represents a prototype of a new class of antimicrobial proteins...|$|R
