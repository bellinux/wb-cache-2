25|$|Gaur, {{also known}} as the <b>Indian</b> <b>bison,</b> is the {{heaviest}} and most powerful of all wild cattle native to South and Southeast Asia. It is indicated in field data that the population of mature animals is about 5,200–18,000. Male and female Gaur both have distinctive humps between the head and shoulders, a dorsal ridge, prominent horns, and a dewlap which extends to the front legs.The Gaur grows 60% faster than domestic cattle, meaning farmers meat can be harvested at a faster rate, making beef production two to three times more profitable. Gaur meat is preferred over other breeds' meat among local people. Another benefit of the bovine is that it has the ability to sweat and tolerates heat well.|$|E

Management tools used to enhance the habitat for wildlife include farming, grazing, prescribed burns, construction of ponds, and wetland draining and flooding.|$|R

2500|$|The park {{authorities}} plan {{to create}} a new Indian Gaur safari in 2011 in part of the current lion safari area. The lion safari has two geographical regions—hilly and plains. At present, the lions move around in the plains region (about [...] of the [...] total area) and are not allowed into the hilly region. The proposed gaur safari would be created on the [...] of the hilly terrain. In 2007, a night safari project in the park was promoted with two components, namely, an animal exhibit area and an entertainment area. The night safari was being established for providing opportunity to observe the natural wildlife behaviour and activities in the night hours. Initially, it was expected to be implemented during 2010–11 at a cost of [...] 40.2 million. With the initially allocated sum, the zoo authorities completed construction of enclosures for tiger, elephant, <b>Indian</b> <b>bison,</b> sloth bear, spotted deer and sambar and a large number of saplings was raised to be planted around the night safari area. Nearly [...] 78.7 million was spent on construction of the enclosures, surveying the lands, perimeter wall and laying circular roads for the night safari. With delay in getting funds from the Union Ministry, the project was put on hold and the zoo prepared another proposal for [...] 820 million for night safari in July 2011. However, this too was deferred by the state government.|$|E
