5|$|The Haunted Mask {{was written}} by R. L. Stine and {{originally}} illustrated by Tim Jacobus. The author says {{the idea for the}} book came from his son Matthew Stine, who was wearing a Halloween mask that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> getting off. Stine also says that he incorporated a duck costume his parents got him for trick-or-treating in the book. Tim Jacobus's niece was the model for the cover of the book.|$|E

5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the match}} results were {{encouraging}} {{for such a}} young and inexperienced team, Craig scored only 103runs at 14.71. Despite his contributions as a leader, this was not up to standard. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> with his defence, being bowled eight times in 17innings. In the 12 matches {{in the last three}} months of the tour, Craig passed fifty only once in 13 innings. However, the selectors did not have to reverse their youth policy: Craig contracted a bout of hepatitis before the start of the 1958–59 season. He returned to cricket at the beginning of the season, but was underprepared, scoring two ducks in his only two innings of the season, the second coming against the touring England team. Craig declared that he was not ready for a return to Test cricket and relinquished the captaincy, which the selectors handed to Benaud. Benaud went on to defeat England 4–0; as England were widely regarded as the best team at the time, this established him as captain of a resurgent Australia.|$|E

Grissom {{took a job at}} Carpenter Body Works, a local bus manufacturing business, and rented an apartment in Mitchell. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> earning a sufficient income and was determined to attend college. Using the G.I. Bill for partial payment of his school tuition, Grissom enrolled at Purdue University in September 1946. During his time in college, Betty returned to live with her parents and took a job at the Indiana Bell Telephone Company while he worked part-time as a cook at a local restaurant. Grissom took summer classes to finish early and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering in February 1950.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{established}} a new archaeological journal, Ancient India, planning {{for it to}} be published twice a year. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> securing printing paper and faced various delays; the first issue was released in January 1946, and he would release three further volumes during his stay. Wheeler married Kim Collingridge in Simla, before he and his wife took part in an Indian Cultural Mission to Iran. The Indian government had deemed Wheeler ideal to lead the group, which departed via train to Zahidan before visiting Persepolis, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Pasargadae, and Kashan. Wheeler enjoyed the trip, and was envious of Tehran's archaeological museum and library, which was far in advance of anything then found in India. Crossing into Iraq, in Baghdad the team caught a flight back to Delhi. In 1946, he was involved in a second cultural mission, this time to Afghanistan, where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient Bactria and visited the archaeology of Balkh.|$|E
