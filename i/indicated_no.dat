According to French law, subsequent references to the Priory bear no legal relation to that of 1956 and no one, other than the original signatories, is entitled to use its name in an official capacity.

5|$|In the 20th century {{existing}} Christian denominations {{were joined}} by other organisations, including the Brethren and Pentecostal churches. Although some denominations thrived, after World War II there was a steady overall decline in church attendance and resulting church closures for most denominations. In the 2011 census, 53.8% of the Scottish population identified as Christian (declining from 65.1% in 2001). The Church of Scotland is the largest religious grouping in Scotland, with 32.4% of the population. The Roman Catholic Church accounted for 15.9% {{of the population and}} is especially important in West Central Scotland and the Highlands. In recent years other religions have established a presence in Scotland, mainly through immigration and higher birth rates among ethnic minorities, with a small number of converts. Those with the most adherents in the 2011 census are Islam (1.4%, mainly among immigrants from South Asia), Hinduism (0.3%), Buddhism (0.2%) and Sikhism (0.2%). Other minority faiths include the Bahá'í Faith and small Neopagan groups. There are also various organisations which actively promote humanism and secularism, included within the 43.6% who either <b>indicated</b> <b>no</b> religion or did not state a religion in the 2011 census.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Diana {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that existed western Africa into the Atlantic on July 27. Conditions were unfavorable for development of a tropical cyclone, and the tropical wave remained disorganized until reaching the eastern Caribbean Sea. The system entered the Caribbean Sea through the southern Windward Islands, where falling barometric pressures were observed, decreasing by 3.5mbar (hPa; 0.1inHg) in 24 hours. Upper-level air data from the Lesser Antilles indicated that the tropical wave was associated with an upper-level anticyclone. With increasing convection, the first Air Force reconnaissance plane flight <b>indicated</b> <b>no</b> low-level circulation, but a relatively large amount of thunderstorm activity. The system continued to have {{a large amount of}} associated convection while passing over the Netherlands Antilles, as indicated by satellite images and surface observations. Cyclonic rotation was observed in the low-level convection by satellite images, and the fifth tropical depression of the season had developed at 0000 UTC on August 4, situated in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. However, this was based on surface observations, and it was not confirmed that tropical cyclone formation occurred until later that day.|$|E
25|$|Laws in Luxembourg {{specifically}} {{distinguish between}} coercion and {{force in the}} 1973 Act on Regulating the Use of Force. This Act regulates the use of police weapons and specific technical means of physical force used by police. However, this act does not cover other forms of physical coercion by police officers {{such as the use}} of handcuffs as these are seen as basic police measures that do not require specific legislation. The officer must be legitimately executing his duty and his actions and must be compatible under the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity, reasonability and measure in order to use force. To ensure the Grand Ducal Police do not engage in police brutality numerous safeguards and prevention methods are implemented. The police inspector (which is the term for an everyday officer) must undergo legal and tactical training lasting an intensive 26 months followed by further training at an allocated police station. By way of comparison, the Victoria Police Academy only provides 33 weeks of tactical and legal training. The 2015 Human Right Report on Government practices by the United States <b>indicated</b> <b>no</b> cases of police brutality in Luxembourg. This report suggests the Grand Ducal Police have effective mechanisms in place to investigate and punish potential abuse and corruption.|$|E

500|$|In late 1943 {{the actions}} of Soviet partisans, who had been ordered to destroy Home Army forces, even {{resulted}} in limited uneasy cooperation between some Home Army units and German forces. While the Home Army still treated the Germans as the enemy and conducted operations against them, when the Germans offered arms and supplies to the Home Army, to be used against the Soviet partisans, some Polish units in the Nowogródek and Wilno areas accepted them. However, such arrangements were purely tactical and <b>indicated</b> <b>no</b> ideological collaboration such as was shown by France's Vichy regime or Norway's Quisling regime. The Poles' main motive was to acquire intelligence on the Germans and to obtain much-needed equipment. There were no known joint Polish-German operations, and the Germans were unsuccessful in recruiting the Poles to fight exclusively against the Soviet partisans. Furthermore, most such cooperation by local Home Army commanders with the Germans was condemned by Home Army headquarters.

500|$|For {{the most}} part, the long passage across the Weddell Sea {{proceeded}} uneventfully. There was a growing level of unrest among the crew, perhaps provoked by disappointment with the apparent aimlessness of the voyage; Worsley {{in particular was}} critical of Wild's leadership. Wild, in his own account, dealt with this discontent {{by the threat of}} [...] "the most drastic treatment". On 12 March they reached 64°11'S, 46°4'W, which was the area where Ross had recorded an [...] "Appearance of Land" [...] in 1842, {{but there was no sign}} of it, and a depth sounding of over 2,300fathoms (13,800ft, 4,200m.) <b>indicated</b> <b>no</b> likelihood of land nearby. Between 15–21 March Quest was frozen into the ice, and the shortage of coal became a major concern. Wild hoped that the diminished fuel supply could be supplemented by blubber from the seals at Elephant Island. On 25 March the island was sighted. Wild wanted if possible to revisit Cape Wild, the site of the old Endurance expedition camp, but bad weather prevented this. They viewed the site through binoculars, picking out the old landmarks, before landing on the western coast to hunt for elephant seals. They were able to obtain sufficient blubber to mix with the coal so that, aided by a favourable wind, they reached South Georgia on 6 April.|$|E

Various data sources <b>indicated</b> <b>no</b> closed circulation by 21:00UTC {{and it was}} noted that advisories could be discontinued, at least temporarily. Early on August3, the disheveled storm moved through the Mona Passage and brushed the eastern coast of the Dominican Republic before emerging over the Atlantic Ocean. As the storm moved away from Hispaniola its movement became more northwesterly, following the edge of the subtropical ridge. Moving near the Turks and Caicos Islands, Bertha's circulation finally became better organized and banding features developing over its eastern periphery. At 14:00UTC, Bertha made landfall on Middle Caicos Island with winds of 45mph (75km/h). Subsequent strengthening of upper-level outflow, decreased shear, increased mid-level humidity, and high sea surface temperatures enabled rapid intensification. Deep convection wrapped cyclonically into the storm and winds reached 65mph (100km/h) by 03:00UTC on August4. During the early part of August4, structural organization began to degrade with convection becoming more limited in extent and banding features dissipating. The only factor aiding the storm was its well-defined outflow. However, despite the storm's ragged and weak appearance observations from hurricane hunters indicated that it had intensified into a hurricane by 12:00UTC. Bertha is estimated to have reached its peak intensity around this time with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg). Additionally, by this time its movement had shifted to due north and with increased forward momentum.|$|E
